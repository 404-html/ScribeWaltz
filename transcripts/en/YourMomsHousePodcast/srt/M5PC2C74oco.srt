1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,473
Wow.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,060
Well go to your mom's house,

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,393
Christina.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,410
And now time to get into this.
We have a fits dogs on the way and um,

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,250
you ready gene? Woo. Ready to have
some fun. Ready? Okay, here we go.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,520
Here we go. Pay Attention. I'm paying
attention to turn that ringer off.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,090
I can't because I'm waiting for a very
important phone call. Okay, here we go.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,870
All right, let's, she's been
carded. She's your daughter.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,650
She's retarded.
She's retarded.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,090
Told you tango started

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,260
bringing in one loving coded.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,780
Well,
I like

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,360
Christina pushes.
It's interesting.

14
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,063
Yeah.

15
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,543
Ooh,

16
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,720
she's retarded.

17
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,950
Is that how you feel when we're out in
public you and I'm embarrassing you and

18
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:56,360
you want to tell people that
this is a like a boards.

19
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,790
This is say a button on a bus.
Retarded.

20
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,600
I think it's the boyfriend of a lady
who's acting out and the bus driver asked

21
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:05,570
him to get off the bus and they refuse.
The cops are right there.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,470
She spits on one of them. Oh dear.
So then they kind of like, you know,

23
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,880
push her back onto the bus to arrest her.
And that's when the guy's like, don't,

24
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:16,410
she's retired. She doesn't know
what she's doing. And then somebody,

25
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,440
some PC or on the, on the bus
goes, it's mentally. Yeah,

26
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,380
I think it might even be one.

27
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,240
So here she is and they're
like, let's go. Go. Oh,

28
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,120
okay.
There you go.

29
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,640
There's Christina just
leaving during our show. Oh,

30
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,170
okay.
That's a fun new way to do this program.

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,430
Who cares about the cohost?
I'll just, and then I can,

32
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,450
I can hear her through there.
That's awesome. You good?

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,430
Oh Great. Great. If you want to join
the show, that was, that would help.

34
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,580
Well, you know what
column? I think for me,

35
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,100
I don't know what call you're
waiting for. Oh really? No.

36
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,710
I remember when I went to the appointment
I went to right before this. Yeah.

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,230
Oh yeah, but you didn't tell me that's
the call you're waiting for. Oh yeah,

38
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,160
that's a long way. Right? Okay. Yeah.
All right, here we go. So here's the

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,700
ladies round to

40
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,230
just spit towards the cop.
She said,

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
oh no, no, you're not.

42
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,080
I think he's retarded return.
That is a good way to get out of behavior.

43
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,080
That's not acceptable. You
know, like started. Yeah.
Yeah. He say, I am retarded.

44
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,050
That's another one. You should
try it. Well, that's about it.

45
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,860
If you ever do anything for
sure from now on in public,

46
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:49,640
that's not socially acceptable. I'm going
to go. She's retarded. She's retarded.

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,850
Yeah.
The PC here has to tango started.

48
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,650
Yeah.
Word is developmentally disabled.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,810
The PC police has to fucking all
the leases on the bus. Yeah. Okay.

50
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,920
I don't think they did that.

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,120
They rode the bus and the guy who's
saying she's retarded is her boyfriend,

52
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:27,990
caregiver, whoever. It was close to her.
Yeah. He's not troubled by the word.

53
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:32,050
She's certainly not disputing it.
She's like,

54
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,870
I'm not retarded.
I'm mentally disabled.

55
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,590
She sounds retarded.
Bula Schumer

56
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,950
mentally to say somebody's a really
gets upset about it. There is that.

57
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:02,370
The cop is that one of the other
cops, listen, he gets really upset.

58
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,580
Jeff through this develop.

59
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,530
Don't say the word retarded and then
he's like, no, no, she's retarded.

60
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,600
He's retarded. If you knew her, you know
how I'm with her all the time. She's 24,

61
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:17,434
seven retarded.

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,270
I told you you were going
to lay a, that made my day.

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,160
That really made my guys guys, guys,
I'm with her all the time. Trust me.

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,300
She's retarded.
Yes.

65
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,583
Yes

66
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,480
guys, it's table, um, cash.

67
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,740
Check it out but just did hot yoga number

68
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,230
12. It's been ruining our home
life. Too many messages. Too many.

69
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:57,231
You're gone for hours every day cause
we're doing 90 minute fucking classes.

70
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,470
Well I don't get it cause your,
let's say your class is like one,

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,590
everyone's sick of it by the way. I'm sure
it was Joe's idea. She was sick of it.

72
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,810
I'm so fucking sick of yoga.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,940
No one wants to do 15 classes in a month
about anything. It's a lot. No, no.

74
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,990
Have you achieved enlightenment of some
sort? I do feel like at the end of,

75
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,070
of all the classes you do have a
definite sense of clarity. It's a good,

76
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,000
it's a good place to go if you have
a decision weighing on your mind.

77
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,110
I think like whether or not to call
somebody retarded or developmentally

78
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,210
challenged, I don't know yet. And
then at the end of class I'd be like,

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,650
she's retarded.
So you really do.

80
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,310
What happens is hot yoga,
Bikram Yoga class. Um,

81
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,690
a good portion of it is
basically meditation. If
you're in a meditative state,

82
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,950
which I think Burt could really benefit
from. Oh, Berta specialty. Yeah.

83
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,150
Has he been able to sign everyone does
silenced his monkey mind? I don't know.

84
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:53,000
I think so. I think he
isn't in a different place.
It would be. We should do,

85
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,960
we should see him again soon. We should
bring him back and get an update.

86
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,040
Good enough. Did you leave for hot?
You're like, oh class is that one.

87
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,540
I'll be home at seven.
You're hilarious.

88
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,980
It's so funny how we
breakdown for this audience,

89
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,900
what it's like to be with you in this.

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,730
So classes are 90 minutes long.
90 okay.

91
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,620
It's hot yoga in on the class schedule.
If you'll go online,

92
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,550
it tells you to arrive.
Please arrive 15 minutes before class.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,060
So your 90 minutes is now 105 minutes.

94
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,830
Class doesn't start exactly on time.
Mostly the class would start, you know,

95
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,410
five to 10 minutes after
the scheduled time,

96
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,900
which means it ends five to 10
minutes after the scheduled time.

97
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,880
So if you're talking about driving to
this thing, arriving a little bit early,

98
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,500
doing the full class when you're done,
it's 104 degrees in the room.

99
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,700
It's like you jumped into a pool and
then you got to let all those parts out

100
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,730
that you've been holding the farts
out. You've got to take a shower. Um,

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,790
there's a single shower, wait
a minute, what you're like no,

102
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,910
cause you were like you came home in her
day and you're like, I'm like, cause I,

103
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,380
I showered there and I go, all of you
shower there. I mean what, what Yoga,

104
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,100
I've never heard of a yoga,
Yoga, yoga studio, honestly,

105
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,980
where you could shower after. I
have, I have never heard of it.

106
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:13,710
But you haven't been to a Bikram yoga
class. But that's what I'm in. So

107
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,920
understanding, but I'm saying
that you're like me and the guys,

108
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:23,921
we shower together after and I was
like a group shower and you're like,

109
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,280
yes, a group shower. And I thought that
was a little fishy. The ladies shower too.

110
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,920
So everybody showers. Showers. Yeah.

111
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,810
I think the only person that I've seen
not shower there as Bert because he just

112
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:39,320
gets in his car. Oh wait a minute. Soaking
wet, but it's not really a group shower.

113
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,810
She fits. This is weird. Yeah.

114
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,120
We just hit pause. We're back. Uh,

115
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,150
Fitz Simmons just came in fits dog the
Great Greg and we were talking off mic.

116
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,790
Uh,
he's actually a hot Yoga Bikram Yoga

117
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,960
practitioner as well. He loves it, right?
Isn't it pronounced beek rum? Yeah. Okay.

118
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,150
All right. Should I open your mic
or no? Yeah, that would be good. Oh,

119
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:05,440
there you are noticing.
I can,

120
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,250
I can't hear anything because you
didn't turn his headphones up,

121
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,230
which you return those

122
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,920
probably number two. There
we go. Yeah. That's good.

123
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,820
That's good. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't done
it a ton, but I used to do it every year.

124
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:21,300
I went to San Francisco because that's
where it kinda started, I think. Yeah.

125
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,290
And I would go up and I would do the
punch line and I would always go in on

126
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,240
Saturday. And do a hot yoga
class and uh, you know,

127
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,360
so it was once a year, but then I
started doing it with a buddy in Venice.

128
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,010
They got one in Venice.
That's really good. Yeah.

129
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,570
I mean, so I've gone to, I went
to my 12th one of the month today.

130
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,840

132
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,500
Thanks for adding that up.

133
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,501
I wasn't sure if team work
cause 13 concept and then
it goes 1415 that's if you

134
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:53,350
know like all, all right. And you
do that off the top of your head.

135
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,570
I can just throw another number at me.
I'll just say,

136
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,200

138
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,020
But Christine's favorite kids
joke of all time. That was why.

139
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,020
Why is five afraid of six to seven eight,
nine,

140
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,020
six three to seven because
seven ate nine is that it? Yeah.

141
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,380
He never red bubble gum wrappers? No. No.

142
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,400
And then you can see more of these if
you watch was new, special, inferior.

143
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:25,710
It's on Netflix right now.
Love dead.

144
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,680
Lot of dad jokes

145
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,280
to Mary for there to be a group shower
after she thinks it's crazy that I shower.

146
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,990
I'm like I'm a group shower

147
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,730
pool after this now that's what happens.
It's a matter of fact,

148
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:40,040
I'd never seen my friend Matt,
Matt Molloy.

149
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,900
I'd never seen him naked before and I was
okay with it because it wasn't like we

150
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,570
had just jumped into a cold
lake and then we're doing it.

151
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:50,600
This was like I had some nice hang.
Sure.

152
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,600
I had some Nice puffy flesh Gordon Brown

153
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,680
sweating for awhile in there. Yeah I
know it's weird cause like we have a,

154
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:02,270
it's a very small locker room and it's
a single shower so people have to wait

155
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,450
and like some of the guys walk into the
shower stall with their shorts on and

156
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,540
I'm a dick out guy. Like I, I take it off,

157
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,270
I sure I stand naked in the locker room.

158
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,610
It's kind of really a separation of like
who's have grown up in here, you know,

159
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,940
cause like I feel like the, no,
I'm serious. It an immigrant.

160
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,660
It's the real Russian
immigrant style. Yeah, yeah,

161
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,120
yeah. Give a shit. Well it's um,

162
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,900
I was a very skinny kid and I had,
I hit,

163
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,490
I hit puberty at like I was close
to 15, I think when I hit. Yeah.

164
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,060
So I remember freshman hockey,
I used to go,

165
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,210
I used to go to practice
not making this up.

166
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,030
I was so embarrassed to
even take my pants off.

167
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,960
Did I used to strap my shin
guards and put my pants,

168
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:53,140
my hip pants on over my jeans

169
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,790
and I would play hockey with my jeans
on underneath. That's crazy. Excellent.

170
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,370
Cause I was so embarrassed
by my twiggy little legs.

171
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,900
I hairless twiggy little lag.

172
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,100
Really. You thought you're going to be
mocked by others like the other kids?

173
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,830
I was horrified about my body.
And so,

174
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,670
and then I would hitch hike home because
the rank was like 20 minutes away and

175
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,260
it was,
this is New York in the wheelchair.

176
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,560
I would stand on the side of the
highway in January. Drenched wet. Yeah,

177
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,300
the we raised. Where
were your parents? Had?

178
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:27,190
One of my teachers picked me up on the
side of two 87 and they drove me home.

179
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:27,450
It was,

180
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,970
it was way out of her way to take me all
the way home and then they call my mom

181
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,260
the next day and they were like,

182
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,460
do you know that I picked your son up
hitchhiking last night at nine o'clock

183
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:40,150
until 87 and my mom went like, well, how
else was he going to get home? It's like,

184
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,360
oh. I picked him up and
driven up not only that,

185
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,280
never bought me any hockey equipment.

186
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,200
I used to bum like old skates off
friends and I remember going through the

187
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:54,610
garbage and the locker room and finding
broken shin pads and then taping them on

188
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,623
with tape.

189
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,500
I'd find tape rolls that were thrown
out that weren't completely gone and I

190
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:02,690
would use those because they never bought
me a piece of sporting equipment and

191
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:05,780
my life and I played sports.
How do they not buy you?

192
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,240
I meanwhile we had money.
That's even worse.

193
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,240
That's even worse because my mom grew up,

194
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,130
both my parents grew up in the Bronx and
they didn't have any money and my mom,

195
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:17,620
especially like my
grandparents were from Ireland,

196
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:21,880
they came over here like
literally off the boat, nothing.

197
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,740
And so my mom grew up with seven
brothers and sisters and just like penny

198
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:27,970
pinched and she couldn't,

199
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,850
even though my father was in
radio and he made good money,

200
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,130
she couldn't spend the money. I feel the
same way. I know how many, how many kids,

201
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,110
how many siblings did you have?
A brother and a sister?

202
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,810
They're brothers, sisters. Everybody had
this experience then that your siblings.

203
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,550
Yeah, that's, that's wild. Yeah.

204
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,670
Is this something you guys talk about a
lot or no to so many other things to get

205
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,720
to? You know, that doesn't, that's
at the bottom of the list now.

206
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:55,150
It wasn't that bad. It's
a matter of fact, my,

207
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,760
my sister has said to my wife,

208
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,930
she doesn't get what me and my brother
are complaining about so much because she

209
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,530
thinks that everything was good and
bad, but fine. But isn't that funny?

210
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,760
She's the baby.
That's why

211
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,450
blings though when you talk
about the shared experience,

212
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,830
I always find that like I have two
sisters and I've heard in different,

213
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,360
in different scenarios,
uh,

214
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,300
either one of us having the, you
know, the totally different version

215
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,680
for you, younger or older. I'm a middle,
I'm the middle of the year, the metal.

216
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,543
But like I,

217
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,120
I think I'm, I'm, I mean I'm the most
even tempered of the three to begin with.

218
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,360
And then like my version of something
we'll always be usually more like a

219
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:39,450
recollection will be like, that
was pretty normal. And there's,

220
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:40,770
we're always be like more heightened,

221
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,210
more emotional exaggeration of something
I'll be like, no, that wasn't it.

222
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,040
I think,
I think you guys know this as parents,

223
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,550
you guys have gone through some pretty
major life in the last couple of years

224
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,650
and uh, I think you deal with a different
set of parents at any given time.

225
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,210
And birth order they say has a huge
effect on how you're treated. You know,

226
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:05,540
the first one there, they're nervous,
they're scared. That kid can be neurotic.

227
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,020
They could end up being hyper achieving
because there's so much pressure on them

228
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,220
and in the middle kid can get lost a
little bit because then the younger one

229
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,730
gets the,
it's the baby we gotta you know,

230
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,140
and then the younger one
generally gets treated the best,

231
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:22,260
but they also feel the most pressure
to not cause any issues there.

232
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,060
They tend to be super likable,
not have needs.

233
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,690
Boy, I think that was me in our family,
the middle, cause they were like,

234
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,110
the older kid had more like,
you know, shit going on and,

235
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,630
and acting out and then the baby
was the baby and they're like,

236
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:41,480
is the good thing about you is that
you're, you're not demanding. Like to me,

237
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,343
you know,
they were like,

238
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,750
that's the great thing about
you is that you're a nice kid.

239
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,190
Easy to deal with you.
You're not causing us anyway.

240
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,360
Yeah. And I was like, look,
you right in the eye when they
say it. Yeah, you're nice.

241
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,580
Everybody likes you stay without causing
any problems, which keep grades. Okay.

242
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,080
You don't get drunk and you're
just taking it all in. Good.

243
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,420
Those are my marching
orders. Of course. Yes.

244
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,290
And I don't think they consciously realize
that they're telling you to do that.

245
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,740
You know,

246
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I think they think part of them thinks
like they're just like telling you how it

247
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,850
is that they're actually
telling you what to do.

248
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,370
Yeah. You know, I don't know if
they processed that at the time. Um,

249
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,510
I think subconsciously you tell your kids
a lot and I'm starting to become more

250
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,270
aware of that because my
kids are so different.

251
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,110
My son is like boom,
straight A's,

252
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,550
captain of the soccer team, captain
of the club, soccer team, girlfriend,

253
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,810
steady friends. I'm the
nicest, most even keeled.

254
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,470
Like I literally couldn't tell you
what I would change about this kid.

255
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,100
And then sometimes I wonder,
am I, is he being that way?

256
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:46,750
Because we're subtly demanding
that of him. Right. Oh, right.

257
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,550
Because he's almost too good, right? Yeah.
And you're not aware of it. Obviously.

258
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,001
You know,

259
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:55,210
you don't know until later when your
kids tell you that you were a bad parent.

260
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,470
God, there's no way you were bad.
You weren't bad. I go, I travel.

261
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,210
I feel like maybe that
has an effect on them.

262
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,540
You may have gone every other weekend,
but your wife is there. Right.

263
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,590
So somebody's got a full time mom for
17 years, so somebody is always there.

264
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,900
Same with Tom and I, we take
turns traveling, but one of
us is always there. Yeah,

265
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,660
I think that's the key,
right? No, we don't both.

266
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:21,040
And don't let your kids hitchhiked.
Don't you love how that, that's this,

267
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,710
that's that far gender people hitchhiked.

268
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,130
I grew up here in the San Fernando
Valley. I just saw some, uh,

269
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,150
like a grown man who's doing that?
Who's doing that? Fuck. Are you doing?

270
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,040
I hitchhiked.
I used to,

271
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,940
I used to work as a caddy at a golf
course that was like 15 minutes away.

272
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,950
And I used to get up at like six o'clock
in the morning and I would get on the

273
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:45,640
road and I would hitchhike to work.
And then I would caddy like two loops.

274
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:50,010
I was like 14 years old and I would
carry two loops. Two giant. I told you I

275
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,980
was skinny. I was, yeah. And
then I would, uh, hitchhike home.

276
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:56,100
Who would pick up cause you got,
you got a bunch of rides.

277
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,560
So sometimes it took a long time.
Yeah.

278
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,520
Was it, um, questionable people
picking you up usually or,

279
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,380
I never had a bad experience.
Not once. Nope. My friend Pete,

280
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:11,670
who is my best friend, we
hitchhiked together a lot.
Yeah. And uh, he had a guy,

281
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:15,900
he went, he went to school in the
Bronx and so he had a guy pick them up,

282
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,890
two different guys twice picked him
up that were jerking off. Wow. Yeah.

283
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,580
I could see that happening
a lot. But yeah. For guys,

284
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,660
here's the crazy thing
about this whole, um, uh,

285
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,870
what's his name? Harvey
Weinstein thing. Yeah.

286
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,230
Okay.

287
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,950
And not to, you know, and you had some
very interesting opinions on it when Ya,

288
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,530
thank Christina did my podcast the other
day and I thought you had some very

289
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:42,860
brave takes on it. Me
Meetings. She would blow up

290
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,300
hi. PHRYGIA and her husband
would encourage her. Yeah.

291
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,800
That's a story. Not even scarring. I mean,

292
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:54,300
if it's a big enough fell,
that's what I'm saying. Yeah.

293
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,820
Like a big Hollywood movie to show me the
deck film for some film. Kidding. Yeah.

294
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,160
Guy. If a guy your deal,
that's not a big one.

295
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:03,480
I needed a ride and he
gave you that ride still.

296
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,350
I wouldn't mind if that's what I'm
saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

297
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:11,080
And so I know a comedian who was kind
of mentored by another comedian. Huh.

298
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,770
And uh,

299
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,960
the older comedian brought him over his
apartment one night and he jr he just

300
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:18,800
started jerking off

301
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,180
the front of them and the guy just left
and he fucking still considers him like

302
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:28,110
a mentor still. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just like, all right, so the,

303
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,670
the Guy Jerks. It's, it's almost
like, you know, I believe me,

304
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,720
I'm not belittling the Harvey Weinstein
thing or anybody need to even say what

305
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,830
I'm in the middle of saying no.
But I think

306
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,430
is funny thing about guys is like guys
forgiving guys doing like guys can also

307
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,640
feel like somebody could act
violently, right? Yeah. Uh,
a man and a woman be like,

308
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm gonna stay away from that
guy for the rest of my life.

309
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,830
And a guy can act violently
and in front of another guy,

310
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,630
like a friend I was saying,
and he'll still like, he'll
get over, he'll be like, oh,

311
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:03,170
I have fist fights with like a,
you know,

312
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,790
you guys externalize
your anger. He, you know,

313
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,760
he punched a hole in that wall and
broke that guy's job. But like, yeah,

314
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,390
he's a good guy. No, we don't do,

315
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,220
I used to fist fights with my close
friends and we would get over it. I mean,

316
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,160
it would take a week. Yeah. And
then we'd be over it. Yeah. Yeah.

317
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,830
But I hear stories about guys jerking
off in front of each other too,

318
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:23,270
like sleepover parties. When you're
a, you've heard those stories, like,

319
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,380
I never heard those stories.
My guy friends were like, yeah,

320
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,100
we used to have sleeping bags and we'd
sleep on either side of the bed and we'd

321
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:34,060
watch some movie. And then
we both jerkbait that's me.
Sarah, you did that? Yeah.

322
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,630
No, I used to go over, across the street.

323
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,320
Uh, my friend's house, I won't say his
name but, but we would, uh, he would have,

324
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:42,471
you know,

325
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:45,140
everyone be sleeping bags and then
we would put it on the spice channel.

326
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,980
But spice didn't come in. You would,
it would snow. You're right. And

327
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,530
then you'd get like some,
some get a random,

328
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,670
I'll get a random shot and then everyone,
no one would be like, hey check me out.

329
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,600
But everyone will be like humping the
floor or like you could, you could feel,

330
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,870
you know, all the wrestling
and the sleeping bags and
then people would be like,

331
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,440
and then we're like 10, 11,
and then everyone pass out.

332
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,660
And that was like a
sleepover on like a Friday,

333
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:12,070
Saturday night for a year or two
that was happening all the time.

334
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,780
Never talked about when talked about it
was, yeah. It wasn't like people have,

335
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,690
cause it was at the age of like
starting to do that. In other words,

336
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,710
it's not like you're 15, 16, you've been
doing it for awhile. It was like 10,

337
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:27,910
11 years old. So it, you
wouldn't even know earlier
here hit puberty. Like I said,

338
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,420
I guess that was 21.
I was pouring Greg,

339
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,620
I mean 15 years old.

340
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,880
And that kicks in like did you have
some kind of pituitary thing or why?

341
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,180
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm just like, I'm not even,

342
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,070
I didn't have hair for a long time and
uh, you know, I've kind of a high voice.

343
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:49,510
I'm a, I'm a feminine man and what
I've always tried to overcompensate,

344
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,433
you're really not.

345
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,340
But I've always tried to overcompensate
by being tough and being aggressive,

346
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:57,190
like a little cocky, sharp tongue,
still sharp tongue. But you know,

347
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:01,840
that's all hiding. Uh, you
know, your early years of
having a shame with my body.

348
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,550
Um,
and our high school,

349
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,650
so I switched high schools and
when I arrive at high school,

350
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,410
I'm a freshman so I switched her my
freshman year and after the first football

351
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:16,460
practice, I'm a, I'm a freshman
but I'm playing with, you know,

352
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,610
I'm on the Varsity team cause we're,
we're doing a spring ball,

353
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,170
so I'm playing for the first time in
spring football on the varsity team.

354
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,030
So people are getting after practice,
taking their pads and their stuff off.

355
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,670
And I noticed all the guys going into
the shower with their boxers on and like,

356
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,890
it's so weird. So what happens is
nobody wanted to shower naked, but why?

357
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,330
Just they were just, it was, I dunno, but
here's the thing, like I'm a freshman,

358
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,411
so I came from,

359
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,160
I switched from a school where everybody
was showering naked because it's a

360
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,100
shower.
But since I,

361
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,970
I switched and there's upperclassmen
wearing boxers in the shower.

362
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,010
I just kept my boxers on too.

363
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:02,450
Because you didn't want to be the person
who's insisting on being naked. Yeah.

364
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,600
So people showered with their boxers on
and then took their boxers off once they

365
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:12,530
had a towel around them.
And this is, this is like,

366
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:17,590
I'm 14 and these are like
1718 year old guys shower,

367
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,770
showering in their boxers.
You think

368
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,230
actually the shower that the most integral
part of the shower is the asshole on

369
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:31,180
the ball said, right? Yeah. And
those boxes are so football boxers,

370
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:36,100
like you just ran around and just, you
know, it's just gnarly, man. Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,890
Wow.

372
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,920
Nobody except for like,
by the time I was a senior,

373
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:43,790
the one kid who we suspected was gay
and definitely turned out to be gay,

374
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,860
was walking around without that was it?

375
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,480
That was the only kid.
It's like you're black.

376
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,440
And he had a big fucking Dick on him
too, so he was like, Hey, what's up?

377
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,260
It's out here.

378
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,770
I've spent so little time around
naked guys at the Friar's club.

379
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:58,310
I used to belong to the
Friar's Club in New York. Yeah.

380
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,200
And they have the best
steam room in New York City.

381
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,120
It's like this old marble and a, this is
going to sound crazy, but I swear to God,

382
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:10,860
this is true. You go in and it's so old
school Jewish that when you walk in,

383
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,990
you put on a towel and you sit down and
then this, this Yugoslavian guy comes in,

384
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:20,100
this old Yugoslavian guy and he brings
you ice water and a towel that's been

385
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:21,690
dunked in ice.
And he hands it to you.

386
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,040
And so you sit there and it's
completely balls. Once you get in there,

387
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,340
it's balls out. Yeah. Yeah. And
so it's all these old dudes.

388
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:33,730
And their sacs are like hanging over the
bench and down towards the floor. Yeah.

389
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,170
There, you know, the PDC can't tell if
they have a big penis or it just melted.

390
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,670
His skin is flopping over Fishkin and
gravity and life has just written on these

391
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:46,040
bodies and these splotches of hairs,

392
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,160
sometimes you don't even have they shaved
or did the hair just fall out? Yeah.

393
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,303
And so,

394
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,310
and so you finished with the shower
and then you walk to the Shah,

395
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,370
you finished with the steam and you walk
to the shower and they have these giant

396
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,110
fucking marble sided showers with,
um,

397
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,810
with a man hole covers size,
shower head on it.

398
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,590
And it blasts like a thousand gallons
a second. You feel, it's like,

399
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,270
it's like being in a civil rights riot.

400
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,350
This German shepherds barking underneath
the seat and then you shout and then

401
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:18,270
you, uh, and then I would jerk off a lot,

402
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,840
not because I just saw this
Dick's just because I was I 22,

403
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,850
and I was just jerking off all the time.
Sure.

404
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,210
And so I would jerk off and then uh,

405
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:31,680
I would come out and the Yugoslavian guy
would wait for you and you have a dry

406
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:36,681
towel and he would put it around your
shoulders and then he would pat you dry

407
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,910
your neck and your arms and your back
then your butt and your legs and your

408
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,080
feet. He would pat. Is that, is that yes.

409
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,950
And your peer that yes, it is.
So in Hungary, that guy, oh,

410
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,940
a tip every day when you leave.
Yeah, it's normal. And Hungary,

411
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,170
there's the thermal baths.

412
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,940
It because the Turks were in Hungary
at some point and so they have a, the,

413
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,330
you know, famous Miguel air and hotel and
you, you get buck naked and, and yeah,

414
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:03,810
someone pats you down, they're very
hands on. They can be very hands on,

415
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:07,620
don't you dare get a massage at the
Gellert cause that's like, you know, your,

416
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,440
your buck naked.
And then like the Big Lady,

417
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:14,400
we'll open the curtain and like people
will be walking by and you're just

418
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:17,720
getting slapped and slathered
with that soap. It's, it's,

419
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,200
they're not as squeamish as Americans
are about the body. Definitely.

420
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,630
Yeah.
I think the Irish are very squeamish.

421
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:28,800
I think it's probably a Catholic thing.
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've always, yeah,

422
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,770
it took me a long time. I'm not, I'm
still not comfortable with my body,

423
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:35,520
but should we get naked? You want to look
good naked? I'll do hot yoga with you.

424
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,630
I'm at right now. That's what I'm
saying. Yeah. And then we'll do hot yoga

425
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,160
because it's going to get hot.
I'll tell you after having

426
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,860
a kid, I don't give a shit.
And I think it's because you,

427
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,750
when you give birth you're wide open.

428
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:52,680
And like I was pushing
Ellis out as I was pushing,

429
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,360
the nurses had a shift change,

430
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,230
so it was like five new people
got to see my coach. No, but yeah,

431
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,030
like I don't care. I'm done. My
body is a functional thing. Yeah.

432
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,920
Like I don't feel weird about it.

433
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,660
Yeah. I think I feel less weird than
I used to. You know, like I, uh,

434
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,830
I used to bench press a lot because
that was how I overcame being skinny.

435
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,430
He's like in college I actually got
kind of, not big, but you know bigger.

436
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,250
And the worst thing about that
is then you get older and you,

437
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,300
your tits ball might have yeah.
And, and the, and you know,

438
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,770
and it's just so fucking embarrassing to
the point where you get so embarrassed

439
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,860
that you stopped being embarrassed. Right?
Yeah. You just let go into it. Yeah,

440
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,280
that's right. Surrender. Surrender
to your ugly, Shitty Yadie

441
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,960
and that's what you end up. It's funny
cause you had your party admirers.

442
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,280
I do like the notably flawed
person who really doesn't care.

443
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,650
You know what I mean? And then
you're like, I want to be like that.

444
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,110
And then sometimes you become like that
and you're like, oh I'm back. You're like,

445
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:50,700
I just don't care anymore Bobby Lee.

446
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,150
Well and if you can notice if you,

447
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,680
if you go on vacation or to
any ocean or pool, most people

448
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,370
we'll have shitty bodies. That's
right. Yeah, that's right.

449
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:04,670
It's a small section that I'm good.
And when I do see them,

450
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:08,150
I think I'm glad I'm looking at
their body, but I think to myself,

451
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:13,390
how much time and work went into
their life this moment. Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,290
This, yeah. You know, how many moments
do people get to see their body?

453
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,650
Like when we saw a perfect
dad and that last vacation,

454
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,160
he's a perfect day saw perfect dad
fucking like Swedish Donnis for sculpted,

455
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,510
just everything. But the V
fucking the lower, you know,

456
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,950
the lower ab,
right.

457
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,820
Good feet holding one kid and
walk with the other world,

458
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,830
like beautiful motherfucker. Get the
time to do it, to work out with him.

459
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,150
And his wife was like, okay, it like
an okay shape, but this dude was just,

460
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,570
I mean he looked, I was like, I
bet this guy's an Olympian. Yeah.

461
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,700
That's the type of build he had.
Yeah.

462
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,180
But like he stood out amongst hundreds,

463
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,920
like everybody else was dog shit.

464
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,340
Yeah. Well, how do you feel with the body
change that you've just gone through?

465
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:55,581
I mean,

466
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:58,610
do you feel like you want to go out on
the beach and show people your body now?

467
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,230
No,

468
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,950
I think it's, you know, it's different.
I was actually telling someone about it.

469
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:05,770
It's like you change happens with,

470
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:09,600
with like with your weight
and everything slowly. Yeah.

471
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,960
And I think it just, you kind of
get, it reinforces to you like,

472
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,360
oh, like this still sucks pretty
badly. Like my body, I'll be like, oh,

473
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:22,600
like you're still,
you're still pretty fat and it's been,

474
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,370
a lot of weight is gone.

475
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,790
But then I always try to remind myself
of like how getting out of shape actually

476
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:33,700
took a long time because what happens
is like when you're, when you're in it,

477
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,180
when you really are like really
eating well and working out,

478
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,630
it can be frustrating when you just,
some random day you're like,

479
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,870
I eaten poorly in a month and I've
done nothing but work out. And um,

480
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,090
and you just see like you're fat shitty
flaws and you're like, that sucks.

481
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,730
But then you go like, yeah,
but to get out of shape,

482
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:54,610
it wasn't like I ate three bad meals,
you know what I mean?

483
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:59,611
It was neglect and sitting and
eating shitty food for years to,

484
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,770
to put on that weight.
So yeah,

485
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,830
a month or two months or six months
is not going to be like all that,

486
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,360
all that bad shit is gone. It takes a
long, long time. Yeah. Yeah. But I think,

487
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,350
I mean with me like I definitely
don't feel like, Oh wow, this is like,

488
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:18,760
I joke around, you know, like I
know t's Bert and uh, you know,

489
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,590
but like I know I feel like I'm in

490
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,130
terrible. You Look Great Tommy. I
compliment you. And every day you do,

491
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:29,040
you look great. Well thanks. So hands
on your face will be so different.

492
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,960
Your body looks fantastic, I think. I
mean, you look great heavy. Thankfully.

493
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:37,790
I like you both ways. I like skinny.
Yeah, you definitely tolerated that.

494
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,740
Tolerate it. Okay. How about
your body? You sucked off
the, the mom you weight fast.

495
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,450
Do you think? Yeah, you look good. I
dropped out. Yeah. I got real fat now.

496
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,560
You know, you just don't eat carbs or
sugar or have fun. No alcohol, suffering.

497
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:55,220
It's just you have to suffer. That's just
it. Yeah. There's no easy way. Right?

498
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,030
You just suffer. Well, I guess
it's a matter of like your palate.

499
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:04,031
I think for some people you get addicted
to carbs and so the withdraw from carbs

500
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,280
and sugars is very intense,
intense.

501
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,100
And I think for some people they
just were never that into carbs.

502
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,850
So it's not that big a deal. When
I think about, yeah, I've had,

503
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,170
I not even going to say out loud what
I want to say. Why? Well No, I should,

504
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:21,380
because I can tell you how horrifying it
was to be that skinny when I was little.

505
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,580
I literally eat anything that I want.

506
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,820
Yeah, no, I get it man up. But
everyone had like, I don't know man. I,

507
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,050
everyone has their own issue
with different things. Yeah.

508
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,360
So it's like I've never had the,

509
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:37,361
for me it's definitely food and
I definitely was eating a cray,

510
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,840
like I was thinking about once you make
a transition and for a while you're

511
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:46,790
conscious of your eating and you go,
how I used to eat was so insane. Yeah.

512
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,040
Well let me see his comedian.
Oh yeah.

513
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,470
And like what about like
eating with normal people and,

514
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,830
and like they would,
you know,

515
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:59,831
they would like a regular person would
see one of my meals as like an indoor,

516
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,780
like a vacation meal, I guess we'll
do this today. And I'd be like,

517
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,330
I do this every day.
Like I always do.

518
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,680
And like I would eat just like with,
I just no regard for her.

519
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,840
Give me like a regular
meal at a restaurant.

520
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:18,270
What you would order like an
appetizer and entree and a dessert.

521
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,650
Hundred percent. Yeah. And
like, and, and maybe like order,

522
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,910
another thing that like,
I just want to try that and,

523
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:30,870
and like another entree or aside maybe
both. No Shit. But I wouldn't even,

524
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:34,800
like I wouldn't fucking even process it.
And like I would have,

525
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,630
if I was on the road,
I would have breakfast,

526
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,700
I would have something like rich
and fatty, then I would be like,

527
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,280
I gotta have something sweet. So I
have like a waffle. And then like,

528
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,270
if they're like, have you seen this bakery
that has like, bib, amazing croissants,

529
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,420
I'd be like, let's go.
Let's go try it. Yeah.

530
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,220
I mean I think I'm going to throw ups
was wait like an hour and then when I'm

531
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:56,020
done, like once it digests, like I
just wouldn't, I wouldn't think that,

532
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,850
I wouldn't even think it was
that much of an indulgence.

533
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,560
I would think of normal Tommy.

534
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,900
We used to at our old house and a
bag in Redondo last time we saw you,

535
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,800
we used to make brownies. I would, I
would bake brownies like every night,

536
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,960
every night, and then we would eat
like half the tray nice and hot,

537
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:19,820
put some ice cream on that. And I'm
like, well no wonder, you know, we got,

538
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,840
and here's the other thing before I,
I always forget this,

539
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,680
before we invited the public
to shame us about being fat,

540
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:31,700
like Burt and I specifically, and we did
this weight loss challenge. Yeah, Dude.

541
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,280
When I would post things on social media,

542
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,930
maybe one out of 400 comments
would be about being fat.

543
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,500
Nobody would say anything to me. Nobody
was like, you're one person might,

544
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,930
you know, you're like,
oh, this guy's a dick.

545
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,690
Well because you're built to be fat
bill. I have a big fat. Yes, true.

546
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:52,940
What a great thing to say. You're
right. It's true. Are built to be. So

547
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,900
it would just be like, it's
fine. Yeah. Built to be fat.

548
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,900
That's a good name for a special
actually tee shirts shot.

549
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:03,610
I just shot it in this special
and I submitted the title,

550
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:06,340
but I think it might change.
It took the break

551
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:16,400
built to be fat. He's got the face
for it and you've got a big head.

552
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,490
Shoulders are broad. You had
a beard into that. Forget it.

553
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,680
You know what I might do?

554
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,330
Put on a hundred pounds and have another
special called built to be fun where

555
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:30,720
it's like I put it all back on,
right? Well, yeah. I mean, uh, um,

556
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,700
what's her name?
Got Pregnant again to do her next special

557
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,070
Allie. You know, people
are gonna say that too. Oh,

558
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,400
she did it again. Yeah,
but it's a ticking clock.

559
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:47,120
She's got to get the special
done, you know? I mean,

560
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:51,650
how old's the other baby
or babies like to, oh,

561
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:56,270
it's two already heard her
baby's going to be too, right,

562
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,680
right. Yeah. She's uh,
she's so fucking funny.

563
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,330
She's a great person. Good. Yeah,
she's really sweet. Um, so, okay,

564
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,150
so I have a gift for you
guys because you know, you,

565
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,430
um,
when you had the baby and uh,

566
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,840
Christina reminded me of this when I came
on, I got you guys a, uh, uh, a white, uh,

567
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:21,260
genie was a white or like a warm,

568
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:25,910
which by the way has become our
go to gift for. That's great.

569
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,740
When we think of it as like, oh, this
is what a comic should get. Yes. Yes.

570
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,800
And it's like,
you know,

571
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:34,580
when you think about a baby and you
think about how little control they have

572
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:38,080
about joy and all that stuff,
a hot on the asshole

573
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,090
is the best. It's just every single time
it would put the baby in a good mood.

574
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,390
Yeah. Yup. And by God, if you're about
to give me a notebook full of jokes,

575
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,900
I'm super appreciative because I have,
I need a new hour and I really,

576
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,620
well you remember that Greg, do you
remember that movie field of dreams?

577
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,100
If you build it they will come.
Yes. It's an empty notebook. Ah,

578
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,900
but here's what it is. Is this book
right here? Look in this. This is what I,

579
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,650
we kept since the start. Cause how
old is your kid now? Nine months.

580
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,540
No, he's almost two year olds to shut
the fuck up. Yeah, he's almost too

581
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,120
God

582
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,880
damn. All right. So I might be a
little late with this but not too late.

583
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,640
We started this,
somebody gave us this one when the,

584
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,810
when our first kid started talking
and it's, you write down every quote,

585
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:26,811
every cute thing that they
say are meaningful thing
and we've got it for years.

586
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,300
Oh and uh,
so I got you guys the same book.

587
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,590
Have you been keeping?
Yeah,

588
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,530
record of that.

589
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,110
I opened up an email account for Ellis
when he was born and we email him,

590
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,780
we sent him photos,
photos and stuff.

591
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,280
But this is direct quotes of
things. Then you know, we'll, we'll,

592
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,830
we'll say like today we did this. Yeah.
And like you said that. All right.

593
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,120
All right. This is fantastic. Thank you.

594
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,060
I brought mine so I could
read you a couple of good
ones that my kids, it's sad.

595
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,063
We'll start,

596
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,490
we've got to show that one. Yeah. Yeah.

597
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,700
This is special because it's handwritten
from Mommy and Daddy. That is very nice.

598
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,260
Very special.
You know how much like,

599
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,390
cause I was going to read this like
as we get and I'm 38 and like I have,

600
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,080
you know,

601
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,440
every year like your appreciation and
your relationship with your parents

602
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:21,170
changed. Yeah. Like if I was my eight,

603
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:25,490
like right now reading
this that my parents wrote,
yeah. I have such an impact.

604
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,350
Oh, already know this thing is
dogeared because my kids, uh, there,

605
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,100
there are 17 and 14, like to
sit around and read this. Oh,

606
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,100
there's nothing kids
when they're adolescents,

607
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:41,240
like more than to see pictures of
themselves and hear what they were like,

608
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,170
they love stories about themselves
because they don't know who they are yet.

609
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,750
Right, right, right. And they
think it's hysterical when,

610
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:51,500
when you show them that they
were cute. Um, all right.

611
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,670
Uh Oh. And what was
tired? And he said, um,

612
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,260
mommy more snores please. Do
you want to take a nap? Oh, I,

613
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:05,150
that's like so and uh, he said,
wait, let me find a good one.

614
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,750
Oh, this was the, the quote that
we still quote almost constantly.

615
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,220
We were in the airport and we're flying
from New York back to La and we had to

616
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:18,221
get up super early and Owen was three
ish and he was cranky and we've got some

617
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:23,330
breakfast, but we tried to give them
good food. So we tried to find oatmeal,

618
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,870
we couldn't find it. And so we ended
up having a buy him a chocolate muffin.

619
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,100
And so we give it to when he was
so excited, he was like shaking.

620
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,580
And then we said, but you can't eat the
whole thing. And I took the top off.

621
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:38,200
I said, you just eat the part that's
in the thing. And he goes, yeah,

622
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,670
you don't know all the rules about,

623
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,150
and to this day we constantly say,

624
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,650
you don't know all the rules about
whatever it is they were talking. Oh,

625
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,860
that's adorable. Tell me if this is too
corny. I just thought it would be, no,

626
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,110
we love it. I'm going to
do this for an email. Um,

627
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,560
because he just started talking.
He just started really

628
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,630
run your finger along the crack of your
ass. You don't need to figure your whole,

629
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,410
you don't want to come back
with shit on your finger.

630
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,180
And he was for, Jeez, this is Owen.

631
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,210
When he was, uh, six, uh,

632
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:18,390
I was carrying out a plate of fresh cut
pineapple and he said, come on Daddy,

633
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:22,680
let's go eat some heaven.
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Um,

634
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,090
I liked, I think my favorite thing
too is that he enjoys reading this,

635
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,970
but that's really good. Yeah. Um,

636
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,370
this is Jo Jo when she was about,
uh,

637
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,510
six violence. Mom, her
mom, her friend's black.

638
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,620
My father's mom has really
curly hair and wide fingernails,

639
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,050
but that's okay because she's
an extremely nice person.

640
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,213
Awesome.

641
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,673
Fantastic.

642
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,300
Am I qualifying it? You know, but
that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

643
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,190
he wasn't nothing. He not a race. She
was not a racist kid, but you know. Yeah.

644
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,590
Black and white is black
and white for sure.

645
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,800
And then this is another
black and white one. Um,

646
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,470
this is Owen before watching
a Michael Jackson video.

647
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:14,630
Is he going to be black or white in this
one? And then after watching the video,

648
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:18,290
he said I like his hair
better after the fire. Oh Man.

649
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,480
He was already slinging. Um, um, uh,

650
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,250
then this is Joe Joe, the first week
of school when she was in kindergarten.

651
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,580
Everyone at school is always
having fights to play with me.

652
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,880
I hate myself because it's
like I'm starting wars.

653
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,870
So when you want to hear these, you guys
would just run to the notebook. Oh yeah,

654
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,990
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We should keep it
in like the kitchen or something. Yeah.

655
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,970
And then, um, she had like,

656
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:49,130
all of her friends were black
for some reason growing up.

657
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,820
Maybe it's because we live in a really
poor neighborhood now. We live in Venice,

658
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:56,300
so there's a lot of like
diversity. But she says, Mommy,

659
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,640
why do I like all the dark ones the best?

660
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,200
Okay.

661
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,830
Oh Man, that is so fun. And
this was a, here's a little one.

662
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:18,450
Act play after Jay. My kids make
fun of me going bald constantly.

663
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:21,810
It's their Goto. Thanks
Dale. Now. Oh yeah. Yeah,

664
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,320
but this is when they were really little.
Yeah.

665
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,550
A judge who was making fun of my
hair falling out and then Owen said,

666
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,690
don't listen to Joe, Joe Teasing you.
And I said, thanks Owen. And he went,

667
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,130
you're welcome baldy.

668
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,600
Right. I'm not going to keep
reading because I have no
idea if this is annoying.

669
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,620
It's really, really horrible. Yeah, we're
going to do it. Thank you for that. Yeah.

670
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,120
I remember that. Wanting to learn
who I was and what I was like.

671
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,050
The thing is that you feel like it's true.
It's like it gives you,

672
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,690
it gives you a sense of identity to
know what you were like, you know?

673
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,310
Because our memories are so selective.
I mean,

674
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:03,311
I read this thing about interviewing I
witnesses for jury pools and not your

675
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,660
pulls for eye witnesses for,
for trials.

676
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,200
And our ability to truly remember
what happened is like 0.1%.

677
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,170
It's like,

678
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,920
you know when and when you're talking
about your childhood with all the emotions

679
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:22,850
that go around it and you hear other
people telling the story about you.

680
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,190
So it's really their
version of who you were.

681
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,670
And so to have the actual quote from them
shows them as close to you as you can

682
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,750
get to who they really are.

683
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,710
And especially when my
daughter's racist story is,

684
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,850
is um, is something positive,
like a positive quality.

685
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:45,270
I think where if you're in that age where
maybe you're, you know, I don't know,

686
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:45,530
you're,

687
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,850
maybe you're a young teen and you're
shy and you're not sure of yourself and

688
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:54,851
they tell and you hear a story about
you being a little kid doing something

689
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:59,750
where you were assertive. You know,
it's like, it gives you confidence. Yes.

690
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:03,660
You go like, oh, like who I really am
is the story you're telling. You know,

691
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:07,090
it changes. It changes the way
you feel about yourself. Precise.

692
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,620
My parents saw me a story when I was a
kid because I grew up with a lot of black

693
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,250
kids too,
and there was a kid with the blacks.

694
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,660
There was a kid who invited me to his
birthday party and then I found out that

695
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,740
he didn't invite our friends. His name
is Yemi, a wallaby. He was from Africa,

696
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,420
didn't invite Yummy and so I said to
the kid who was like my best friend,

697
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,250
but his mother didn't want Yemi there.

698
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,070
I said I wouldn't go to the
party and I was only like seven.

699
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:33,763
He's not going on.
I'm like,

700
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,040
cause I figured then the
musical sock and nobody can dam.

701
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,100
I went to high school with a kid named
[inaudible] obituary who, damn. Yeah,

702
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,930
he was at for,
it's funny,

703
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,970
I was asking my dad to reminisce
when I give birth to Alice.

704
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,600
I was like, Dad, look what was I like?
How much did I weigh when I was born?

705
00:43:56,601 --> 00:44:01,550
He goes, I don't know normal.
I'm his only child like you.

706
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:06,470
You do remember the one right?
Just normal car. Remember the time?

707
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,390
No, no, no, it was it where they did.

708
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:16,340
They have a lot of pictures of, you know,
Friday my mom put together an album.

709
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,580
Yeah, you must've been a cute little
kid. Was really attractive. Yeah.

710
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,100
God really? Qut. The pictures.

711
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,200
Oh I got real dark.

712
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:30,620
What was that like 1213 and the
darkness and the darkness came over.

713
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,300
Let me ask you this because
this is good to know.

714
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,620
My daughter now that she's 14 is going
into that place where she comes in the

715
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:41,520
front door and is in a room very quickly
and you don't see her except for dinner

716
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:45,900
and you know she's actually very sweet
but she can be pissy towards my wife.

717
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,660
When does that end and are you,

718
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,680
were you aware that you were doing that
and did you feel bad about it later? Oh,

719
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,800
I don't feel bad about it because
I was hiding from my family.

720
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:57,810
I didn't like being around them. Yeah. My,

721
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,650
my family is different than what you guys
had by far. Like what you have rather.

722
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,180
A lot of it is high school drama. Did
she just start high school? Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,960
So I think a lot of it is
like what happened at school
and she might be talking

724
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:13,620
to her girlfriends about it like, oh my
God, and then he did this or we did that.

725
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:16,410
Like you're analyzing a lot of what
happened to you if you're going to break

726
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,960
down the dad's. Cool. Yeah. So that
could be, I think that's really, it's,

727
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,220
it's like this girl world
that you inhabit at that age.

728
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,120
So it ends when you start to realize
you're not the center and like it doesn't

729
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,990
matter. Like by 16 I
think you're like, oh,

730
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,530
I'm not the only human around
and mom and dad are not that bad.

731
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,780
Quick to get out of it to page 17

732
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,700
my two sisters were really bad
my senior year. Really bad. Yeah.

733
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,960
I'm saying like with like kind of being
rude and Shitty to my parents and they

734
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:49,140
were over it before high school ended.
Yeah.

735
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,960
And they did feel bad and felt even worse
later once they had kids before even

736
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:57,680
having kids, like once you're
like in your 20s, they,

737
00:45:57,681 --> 00:46:02,170
they would feel like really guilty about
how shitty their attitudes were. Yeah.

738
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,240
Yeah. Like they feel really bad
because like, they were like, you know,

739
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,280
like super embarrassed of them and
like just like era and they were just

740
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,890
oh yeah.

741
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,930
Snapping all the time. Yeah.
You're like, what the fuck man?

742
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:18,220
Like she's in ninth grade.

743
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,080
She's in ninth grade. Yeah.
That's a hard year. Ninth Grade,

744
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,430
the first year of high school.

745
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:27,280
So it's like this huge leap into becoming
a teenager. Like a legit teenagers.

746
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,650
Yeah. Well this device the
way make you feel bad. Let you
show me this. Uh, this, uh,

747
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:33,980
we, we were sent this
video, this lady, um, she,

748
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,930
she and her boyfriend were asked
to leave a bus and then, um,

749
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,163
she didn't want to leave the

750
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,140
bus,
so the police are outside the class.

751
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,480
Then she spit towards the cop. She said,

752
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,520
no, no, you're not

753
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,300
her boyfriend.
Well,

754
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,590
her boyfriend is trying to get this is
the boyfriend is trying to get her off,

755
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,820
like trying to get the policemen to not
arrest her just by repeating that she's

756
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:13,170
retarded.
So she's not accountable but

757
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,850
oh I didn't hear that.

758
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,210
Oh
she's retarded.

759
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,360
I told you tango started just retarded.

760
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,700
And did you see the PC police
step in and go mentally disabled?

761
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,840
Don't even pop was saying that. No, it's
another bus rider is like for seniors,

762
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,770
the word is developmentally
disabled and uh,

763
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:45,710
he continues like route as
they bring her off the bus.

764
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,870
Oh No,

765
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,060
she,
she's not developmentally,

766
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,070
he's correcting the guy that's trying to
help her. That's clearly her guardian.

767
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,700
Right? Yeah. Right. Speaking of which,

768
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,270
um, oh, we're doing a benefit, Christina,
and I think you're out of town.

769
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:22,550
I remember eighth at the comedy store
for the best buddies. That's cool.

770
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,550

disabled people that thought the

771
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,250
developmentally disabled growing
this benefit for it. But it's cool,

772
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,480
but it's going to be Rogan.

773
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,590

Wow. Look at all star plus a
black act to be named later.

so we will catch you up on something
that's been rolling into this week.

780
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:03,050
A few weeks ago somebody sent us this guy
who walking down the street decided he

781
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:05,690
was going to write a
song into camera and it,

782
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,600
there wasn't a lot going on in the song.
[inaudible] he

783
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:15,440
sing my song trying to sue my
song. Okay, here we go. Here we go.

784
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,080
I have another beat down for you. I
tried to practice talk, just my own song.

785
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:24,140
Just my introduction to my
song coming at Ya. Here we go.

Yeah. It got a gun. Terminate
her gun. Yeah. Machines.

788
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,720
Then machines was thin. G 16. Geeze.

789
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,150
16 China wreck.
My Rep trying to make my RUC,

790
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,040

792
00:49:46,911 --> 00:49:51,510

Street. I don't care, but

793
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,200
a fireable haters

794
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:58,710
that you can't tell me you don't like,
you know,

795
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:04,010
a little bit of joy that I can tell. He's
like, if Dj Khaled was actually dumber,

796
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,730
so we knew it would
happen. We get, we get of

797
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:14,810
all the podcasts, the most amazing
song submission. So last week, oh,

798
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,670
that was made specifically for your show?
No, no, no, no. So, but we know that like,

799
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,220
whenever we play, like, you know, like
we play like she's retarded clip. Yeah.

800
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,870
Like someone will make a song out of
that and like some of them are legit song

801
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,070
production people,
you

802
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,903
know,
they'll just,

803
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,240
there we go.
Here we go.

804
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:40,450
She said sort of classic

805
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,050
terminator. Yeah. Got It. Yeah,

806
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:56,420
yeah, yeah, sure.

807
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,023
Yeah.

808
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,340
So that was got to Yaddo tuned them

809
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,173
16

810
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,620
those came in. I've been having machines
within, it's stuck in my head. Oh,

811
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:19,460
last with ready. Catchy though. Right?
That's just like a vibrator store. Yeah.

812
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,820
It, uh, it's incredible. And
more machines within came in.

813
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,110
Here's a gun. Yeah. Nadir Gun.
Let's see what this one is here.

814
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,440
Wow.
This is the Max.

815
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,580
Incredible.
That's amazing.

816
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,000
This is a, by the way, this is

817
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,110
sounds good.
Genes within metal by machine

818
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:03,670
genes
play made a real,

819
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,410
there was a bit like he
put a band together and

820
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,670
no. So what happens is like,
okay, so for like the first few,

821
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,910
what happened was people took the audio
that we played with this guy walking

822
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:17,760
down the street, just got machines
within and they created, uh,

823
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,540
a song out of that. In other words,
they, they looped in beats and then they,

824
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,240
and they made a song out of it.
This one right here,

825
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,520
I don't know if on that one right there,

826
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,210
they actually sang it themselves or
whether they distorted it or not.

827
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:32,270
I don't know. It's pretty. And,

828
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,570
but like this guy right here
just submitted this also.

829
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,900
So here's a little different
take on machines. I mean,

830
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,630
it's going to be the full corrosion
on it. A big fans. So you got,

831
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:48,720
so Tom and Cindy, um, and
it was an amazing time.

832
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:52,800
We kept seeing machines within all day.
So I just kind of like in my head.

833
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:53,634
So hope you enjoy it.

834
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:55,763
Yep.

835
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,240
Oh,
I was right.

836
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,940
Good.
Jesus.

837
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,300
That's amazing.

838
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:23,180
That's by Kyle. She's
by Kyle. So good haters.

839
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,590
Half all the haters and

840
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:35,610
wow. Impressive man. Those
guys inspiring people

841
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,680

That,

842
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:48,220
that's amazing. That's my pick. And
they both work. Yeah. That's the thing.

843
00:53:48,221 --> 00:53:51,760
These guys found a way to make the song
work. It's all about the producer man.

844
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,270
Gotta find your deep. Do you guys
put out an album once a year? No.

845
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,860
Let's do a Christmas

846
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,063
production.

847
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,340
The second guy stalling
before an oral exam.

848
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,180
This is a

849
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,450
what's jeans? What's fake?
Dj Meet farts. Unbelievable.

850
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,580
What talent he to meet parts
has a good little sound system.

851
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,330
Yeah.

852
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:55,120
That [inaudible] is the terminator.
Yeah, of course. He didn't know that.

853
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,760
Uh,
so somebody wrote in,

854
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:58,740
my husband's steward is an avid
listener of your mom's house.

855
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:00,360
He listens while working hate came home.

856
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:03,840
The day machines within episode was
played. It's always been singing.

857
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:05,850
The song is stuck in my head.
I haven't listened to it.

858
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,670
It's hard to get down
and dirty and disease.

859
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,040
Ms And ms teams within is
all I'm hearing beforehand.

860
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,000
As a previous writer submitted that
juggler has tapped into something and my

861
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:18,900
husband and now I'm afraid of my husband
is a kid gonna convert to juggle.

862
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:22,830
Oh awesome. You guys are an awful
influence to my 27 year old husband.

863
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:26,130
Much love Christy Christy.
It's infected all of us.

864
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,320
If I do kill multiple people,
that will be when I'm,

865
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,790
do you want to know something? That
guy posted another video of a new song

866
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:45,300
much. No. Hey, great.

867
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:46,860
For Halloween,

868
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:53,110
I am the mass murderer. I may him
mashed murder. My Song is called,

869
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,070
it's a mass murder of the grave.

870
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,320
Oh so far.
Mass

871
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,950
murderer of the grave.

872
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,340
The mass murderer of the grave of the
grave as can be mass murder of the gray

873
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:14,120
was can be mass murder and makes me

874
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,670
no, it's great. In joke writing,

875
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:19,700
you really got to make your premise
clear and that's what he does with songs.

876
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:24,160
He's like, Chris rock really sets
it up. Yup. Here's what the song's

877
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,100
about. For people that
aren't watching. He has,

878
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:28,900
he has blood on his face and his clothes.

879
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,630
I mean might have bury the lead on that.

880
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,890
I know we did leave that out
because we're like just got that.

881
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,890
A lot of blood on his face
because we're like,

882
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:42,724
this is

883
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,290
mass murderer on the map to the
grave from the grave to the grave.

884
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:54,100
Mass murder from the [inaudible],
from the gray mass murder from the grant.

885
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:57,390
Ra is going to be defending this guy soon.
Yasmar from the grave.

886
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,710
I'm chopping the burst

887
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,570
mass murderer makes me cool.
Mass murderer makes me cool.

888
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:08,350
Yeah. Mass murderer makes me
cool. Cooler can be Muslim.

889
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,620
No pain, no pain. It sounded like coolest.

890
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,460
Oh my God. How is it
possible? This guy is too.

891
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,900
Yeah.
Deep down.

892
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:24,730
Deep down in the grave
spiritually from the grieve.

893
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,780
I wouldn't agree. Spearfishing
from hell. Hell, hell is chaos.

894
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,440
Do you think you could do live?
Do you think you'd do a live show?

895
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,170
I think if you could book him as
your opener is what you're saying.

896
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,720
I mean like do you think it could
handle it? It's a good five minutes.

897
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:40,410
That's a solid five. Try to get
him to shut up. Once you're on

898
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,460
stage though.

899
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:44,923
Seven mass

900
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,570
rave as can already sent it in. It's a
merger of the great. How did they hear it?

901
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:54,100
Did you play this in a previous episode?

902
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:59,101
Somebody found this video makes
me and made the song murder,

903
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:00,883
but then next,

904
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:05,210
next episode people will have made
much more on rave mass murder.

905
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,620
Mass murder from the grave.
Here we go. Here we go.

906
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,350
Mass murder from the paper mache mermaids

907
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,630
me. Cool. Mass murder makes me cool. Yeah.

908
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:20,950
Mass murderer makes me
cool as can be Muslim.

909
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:24,370
No hate. Must love new. Hey mass murder.

910
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:27,100
That is a no chase with that song.
Thank you know chase.

911
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:29,920
Thanks everybody is sending in
your machines within remixes.

912
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,490
Those were really good. Looking forward
to, she's retarded songs next week.

913
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:39,580
They're really good. This guy does
have a gift for the idea though.

914
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,520
I'm saying this Juggalos.
Yeah,

915
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,450
he does have a gift of putting together
like silly things. Silly, catchy.

916
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,340
He could write jingles. Maybe you know he
could write for the insane clown posse.

917
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:55,750
Maybe that's quite a leap put on with
the, Jimmy wants his dick and that, oh,

918
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:59,180
Jimmy Ivy. No. Right.
Did you watch that? Um,

919
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:03,280
defiant ones on HBO about
Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre.

920
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:08,560
Like a four [inaudible] it's so good,
man.

921
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,260
Their story, Jimmy, I've been story
is just bananas. It's so, it's, it's,

922
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,580
it's insane what like how he got into
being a record producer, you know,

923
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:22,340
he was like cleaning up a studio
for a job, like after hours,

924
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,130
like just mopping. Right. And then they're
like, do you know how to run a board?

925
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,370
Yeah. And he was like, no. And then
a guy shows them how to run a board.

926
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,590
That's amazing.
And it's just like,

927
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:32,090
and athlete like one thing into the
next and then he's sitting there like

928
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:37,670
engineering a Springsteen album. Wow.
And then, uh, he tells a story about it.

929
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:41,930
That's right. Yes. He talks about it. This
book. It's wild. Yeah. And then how about,

930
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,380
uh, I think it was Ivan. He's Catholic
and it was like an Easter where there,

931
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,470
one of the guys was like, you need to
come that we need you to hear today.

932
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:52,400
He's like, it's Easter Sunday. And the
guy was like, fucking come to the studio.

933
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,690
And his family was like, come on, you're
not leaving on this. He's, he's young.

934
00:59:56,691 --> 01:00:00,400
He's like in his early 20. [inaudible]
and he goes in and it's for, uh,

935
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:06,200
it's a Lennon session. Wow.
Yeah. So he's sitting there like,

936
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,850
he's like, I just said Fuck
Easter. Yeah. And just, he was a,

937
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,240
Oh, that's amazing. He
didn't know. He just went in.

938
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,260
He was telling me to come in and do
one in. Yeah. Damn, that's the thing.

939
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:21,920
I always tell young people now that you
hit a certain age and you talked to a

940
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:26,560
lot of young people about, you know,
everybody wants advice. And we went and,

941
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,950
and it's, it's hard because if you catch
me on a bad day, and this has happened,

942
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,380
I've taught kids out of
going into show business,

943
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,870
my friend Tom asked me to
talk to his son, um, and, uh,

944
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:43,871
he wanted to go into comedy writing
and I read his scripts and it was okay.

945
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,260
It was okay. And in this business,
it's got to not just be good.

946
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:53,150
It's gotta be excellent. And it's gotta
be original. There has to be like,

947
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,400
you know, like somebody, a SPEC script,

948
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:59,750
it gets traction in this town is like
somebody will take a partridge family

949
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:04,190
episode from 1971 and
then they'll put in uh,

950
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:08,330
isis as like, you have to come
up with shit. That's crazy.

951
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,800
And then on top of it be so well written
and so, and I just said to him, I go,

952
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:17,720
look man, you got a college degree. Does
just, there's so many other things to do.

953
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:22,190
And his father who's black got really
upset with me. He's like, dude,

954
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:25,910
what did you fucking tell my son? And I
was like, I'm sorry man. It was a bad day.

955
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:26,810
It was a bad day for them.

956
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:30,480
I totally get that. I, you
know what I did once this is,

957
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,640
I mean like I don't think
I did the wrong thing.

958
01:01:33,641 --> 01:01:38,641
I picked the wrong time was I told a
comic who was booked by a club that was

959
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:43,170
emceeing to not do so much crowd work.
Oh that,

960
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:47,290
well I told him cause he was doing
it every show. Yeah. And, um,

961
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:52,240
it was like Saturday between the first
and late show where I go, look, man, I go,

962
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,760
someone's going to tell you, someone's
going to tell you this at some point.

963
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,980
And like, you should know that like when
you're on a headliner show like this,

964
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,540
like you really don't,

965
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:06,630
it shouldn't be up to you to just
decide to do 10 minutes of crying.

966
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,330
And he was like, what? And I
go, I'm telling you this to, uh,

967
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:16,300
to be rude, but like you're,
you're basically dictating that.

968
01:02:16,301 --> 01:02:19,170
Like that's the tone of what
they're about to see. You're not,

969
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,080
you're actually making it,
it's not even really fucking up my show,

970
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:26,010
but it's like the Middle Act, who on
this hierarchy is definitely above you,

971
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,920
is now like putting this thing where he's
like, has to adapt to your crowd. Right.

972
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,700
Exactly. Not only that, now
you meet you in the feature.

973
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:36,970
I'd have to watch him every shell to
see you so you don't talk to the same

974
01:02:36,971 --> 01:02:37,804
people he's talking.

975
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,580
It's, so I, I did it in
like a nice way. Yeah.

976
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:46,060
But man that he was shell shocked
and I couldn't tell right away.

977
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:51,460
He went up there and bombed. And
then afterwards, like, you know, I,

978
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,770
I didn't say much to him after his set,
but after the show he was like,

979
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:57,751
I go,
dude,

980
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:00,430
like somebody was going to tell you that
and they might not have even been as

981
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:02,440
nice about it as I was. I said, well,

982
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:07,450
you think you can just get on like
fucking bill birds show and just be like,

983
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,840
Ma, I'm just going to do
fucking Crowdwork. Yeah,
go, you can't do that shit.

984
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,450
And he was like, really? I go, it's not
like this was like a showcase thing.

985
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,040
Do what you want, you know, was
20 comics going up? Fine. They go,

986
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:22,130
but like this is not that show.
This is a weekend show. And um,

987
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,210
he was like, ah, I guess,
you know, I just, um,

988
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:30,450
I guess you telling me like two minutes
before I went up Kinda threw me off was

989
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:34,180
like, sorry, I felt bad.

990
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:36,710
I felt bad about the timing
of it. I was like, yeah,

991
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:41,340
it's powerful for a young comic
to hear from a, you know a legend.

992
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,430
Yeah. Yeah. Will you go, will you tell,
especially if you tell him like right,

993
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:47,580
if someone tells you something,
right. There was, I was,

994
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,563
well I,

995
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:52,590
I always do this thing when I'm on the
road and I don't know when I started

996
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:55,200
doing it,
but every time the MC and sometimes I,

997
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:59,010
I've met the emcee for two
enough to get my, my intro,

998
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,360
cause if it's the first night,

999
01:04:00,361 --> 01:04:04,320
I just haven't spent time with them
and I always will go. He'll go,

1000
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:06,810
Greg Fitzsimmons and I come up
and then when he shakes your hand,

1001
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:08,790
when he walks off, I
was go, thanks faggot.

1002
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:11,370
And then I do my set and
I never talk about it.

1003
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:13,710
And then the next time I go up I'll go,
thanks homo.

1004
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,990
And I just keep saying thanks cock sucker.

1005
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:19,020
And I do it each time and
they never bring it up.

1006
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,980
And then this one guy comes up to me
Saturday night between shows. He's like,

1007
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,210
he goes, did I do something?
Goes did I do, did I go long?

1008
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:30,270
I keep thinking that I did that bit.
That's similar to yours and his,

1009
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,860
did that make you mad? He,
he was going through and what
I would, it could be. I go,

1010
01:04:33,861 --> 01:04:36,420
no dude, I do that to everybody. I never,

1011
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,380
I never imagined anybody would
take it as anything, but it's,

1012
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,820
yeah, of course, of course. I can
imagine though, if you're that guy,

1013
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:47,650
the anxiety he probably had the
next day. He was probably like,

1014
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,640
I thought it was a good show,
but I can tell me me a faggot,

1015
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,090
it's done. He goes,
there's a, cause that guy,

1016
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,200
I was doing crowd work with that guy and
I kinda like backed down and I thought

1017
01:04:58,201 --> 01:05:01,080
that maybe that's why you kept calling
me that and it's like I didn't have the

1018
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:04,320
heart to tell him. I didn't
watch all of his sets, you know?

1019
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,440
Oh man, that's the other one is when they,
um, sometimes they are like Saturday,

1020
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:14,180
the be like, you see the set and I
go, no, not once. That's a whole week.

1021
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,010
You guys are terrible people.
And then I'm like, I just, I,

1022
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,900
I can't do it then.
I don't want to watch.

1023
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,440
It's hard because sometimes if I
watch the feature and he's got,

1024
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,740
he's got a bit that's
really close to mind.

1025
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,920
It depresses me because I realize this
kid is in Oklahoma and he's a feature and

1026
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:33,480
he and we're thinking the same joke.

1027
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,600
So I don't even care if we repeat a
similar joke like I used to watch so I

1028
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,470
didn't repeat a joke and now he just
figured it's more detrimental to even know

1029
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,670
through that comedy is this easy
and I think it's so hard. Right?

1030
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,220
And then you're like that
guy's name when that good.

1031
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,880
I know that too where you're
like that's one of my,

1032
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:55,350
that's a good as an original thought
or thought at the time. Like damn.

1033
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,120
And I found when lightning in a bottle,
it's depressing.

1034
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,820
I thought it went today actually when I
was on the toilet and I wrote it on my

1035
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:01,540
phone,

1036
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:06,450
which is Yelp is essentially
like you can tell a lot,

1037
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,160
cause I was yelping um,
hot water heaters.

1038
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:13,690
We need a new hot water heater and you
just see the range of opinions that

1039
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:17,920
people can have about a piece
of hardware and that you know,

1040
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:22,210
you know any given case a factory worker
didn't put a nut on or didn't it so it

1041
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,830
doesn't make the company evil,

1042
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,520
it just means that there's a variance in
quality of thanks but it becomes like a

1043
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:31,270
roar shack test for the person that's
doing the reviewing and it's always like

1044
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:36,330
this hot water heater makes me feel
lonely and someone else is like this thing

1045
01:06:36,971 --> 01:06:39,160
gets me laid as true.

1046
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,170
So I want to put really innocuous things
on Yelp and just see how people like

1047
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,750
friendship see on people.
How do you yell at Friends House?

1048
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,170
That's true because it
is one big projection.

1049
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,040
Your experience of something and like
the particular form of rejection and you

1050
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:59,620
can always look for the
negative and something or you
can look for the positive.

1051
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,200
Yeah,

1052
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,070
we've been up by the way we've emailed,

1053
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,110
we put out there a bunch of
these questions originally
we put out I think like

1054
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,930
how to, what blind people
know when they're done wiping.

1055
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,670
And then blind people would write
in and tell us how to deaf people.

1056
01:07:13,671 --> 01:07:14,630
Wake up in the morning.

1057
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,900
And then last week we asked about
how to cop a lot of dumb questions.

1058
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:22,880
Just trying to see now how do
cops, um, handcuff a one arm guy?

1059
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,110
Like when they have a one arm guy,

1060
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,980
here's your answer. We
go, we got the answer.

1061
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,220
Hey Mommy's,
I'm a police officer on the east coast.

1062
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,480
I'm explaining to you how
to cuff on one arm. PERP.

1063
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:38,100
First option is to cut off one
hand and put the other cuff off,

1064
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,360
cuff off one hand,

1065
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,620
put the other cuff on a belt loop
on the opposite side of their genes.

1066
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,930
If they're foolishly not wearing
their jeans high and tight,

1067
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:49,980
then they just get cuffed to a
stationary, immovable object. Thanks.

1068
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,720
And the Canadian answer and I didn't
know we had a different answer there.

1069
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,113
Their hand,

1070
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,150
uh, the police. Okay.
On your recent Potty,

1071
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,030
I heard you ask police how to handcuff
someone with one. On one hand,

1072
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:07,630
I'm a police officer in Canada and
recently helped arrest a one handed man.

1073
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:10,420
No Way. The short answer to
the question is we can't.

1074
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:15,560
One would assume that you can just
cut his one hand directly to ankle.

1075
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,130
So apartment Paulison specifically
prohibits this because it is considered a

1076
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:27,131
hard time and can cause fat people with
respiratory problems and stop breathing.

1077
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,400
We are issued nylon Rhett leg restraints,

1078
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,220
however they are useless
if the rest of the person,

1079
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,300
if the arrested person is also is not
handcuff because they can just bend over

1080
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:39,134
and take them.

1081
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,130
The only restraints that we
consider acceptable or the
metal shackles that would

1082
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:47,990
cut his cough is hand to the front and
have as a long chain reaching around down

1083
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:51,740
to the ankles. They're
loosely cuff together. Patrol
cops don't carry shackles,

1084
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,570
so we just shoved him
into the back of the van.

1085
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,320
I hope this helps and thanks
for the great podcast, Justin.

1086
01:08:57,321 --> 01:09:01,280
Well thank you both Brim Lau and
Justin for the snappy in one armed and

1087
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:05,510
overweight. Oh, like it couldn't
get worse. And committing crimes,

1088
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:09,020
you're just like being in your arrested
just like your life is just shit.

1089
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:13,230
You know, you're in jail, you're
fat and you got one arm. Yeah,

1090
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,430
I was watching Trudeau on the
Internet, you know, they're,

1091
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:20,990
you know that Canadian band,
the tragically hip. Yeah.
It's like Canon is pride.

1092
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,580
Right.
And the lead singer died.

1093
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,970
And here's like sweet ass Trudeau
crying about this lead singer.

1094
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,400
Did you see him buying Shannon
couldn't love them anymore. Yeah.

1095
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,610
He was like national treasure.
And I was like,

1096
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,350
imagine if Donald Trump like our stupid
president book bunch of faggots crying

1097
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:43,430
about some bad, get it together. Yeah.
Like, oh my God, what a difference.

1098
01:09:43,431 --> 01:09:47,540
And I know he's got an military guys
go down and he doesn't even take it

1099
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:48,374
seriously.

1100
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,860
I see that thing this,
this morning,

1101
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:56,030
how brutal where the widow of the of
the soldier that died was on like good

1102
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,560
morning America. And she
was like, yeah, that,

1103
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,900
that account that Frederica Wilson gave
of how the president spoke is spot on.

1104
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:07,690
That's where I'm like, God. And He,
and she was what made me really sad.

1105
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,410
It was that he,

1106
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:12,340
he couldn't remember my husband's
name and he immediately tweeted,

1107
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,340
I spoke to her and I'd
never hesitated about him,

1108
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:18,350
his name from the very beginning, like
he tweeted that immediately. Oh boy.

1109
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:23,070
I mean, the amazing thing is there was a
witness to the first call. So number one,

1110
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,590
what's the agenda of a fallen soldier?

1111
01:10:25,591 --> 01:10:29,630
His parents to lie about the
president of United States. Right.

1112
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,780
And then you've got corroboration
from a congress woman,

1113
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:37,980
not just Johnny, you know, she had had
in the back of the van, like, yeah,

1114
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:43,030
no, for this woman, she was on the
call. It was speakerphone, her aunt,

1115
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:47,720
her uncle, the congresswoman and the
driver. So five people. Yeah. And she's,

1116
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:52,640
and she's like, nope. And
he's like, that's not what
happened out of that. Yeah.

1117
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,190
It's crazy.
Wow.

1118
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:54,961
It's true.

1119
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:58,440
That's not even your priority to call
out the president at that moment when it

1120
01:10:58,441 --> 01:10:59,340
all started,

1121
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:03,510
because he was taking shots
at Obama saying that I,

1122
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:07,260
he didn't use to call me
while Obama called every one
of them followed up with a

1123
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:12,120
letter and usually called back
six months later. So why go after,

1124
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,370
first of all, it's like,
it's like a lawyer says,

1125
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,860
don't ask a question.
You don't know the answer to.

1126
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:21,080
Don't Attack Obama on something that
you don't know the answer to. Yeah.

1127
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:24,420
Especially when you're actually
guilty of it yourself. Yeah. Well,

1128
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:29,190
he's a sociopath. It's crazy. It's
banana. She just ban ban Trump.

1129
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:30,390

1131
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,793

1154
01:13:32,631 --> 01:13:37,520
M. Thank you quip. So Greg,
we're big dental fans here.

1155
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:41,480
We like knowing what's going on inside
people's mouths. I'd like to know,

1156
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,500
have you been to the dentist recently? Did
you brush and floss? Floss reason? Yeah.

1157
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,010
Say the wisdom tooth is not here. Yeah.
Got it out five days ago, five days ago.

1158
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:55,030
Why is the gallery then he
I think it was that day. No.

1159
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:58,270
Yeah. What? Yeah. What like it
didn't bother me. Didn't bother me.

1160
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,680
Before we get to the

1161
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:04,150
sale of this, how are you a regular like
are, are you good at oral care, do you

1162
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,870
I floss every day,

1163
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:10,900
thank God because I've got a couple
of niches in between my that just,

1164
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:17,230
they just fill up. I eat anything. I've
got something in those, in those spots.

1165
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:21,430
It drives me crazy and so I love
the little handheld flossing

1166
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,550
devices. Those, they don't
like that. I like them.

1167
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,030
I keep those in my bag and
then I floss every night.

1168
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:28,890
I brush at least three times a day.

1169
01:14:28,891 --> 01:14:32,850
I'm consumed with having bad breath
because when people have bad breath,

1170
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,860
I can't hang out with them anymore.
Dude,

1171
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:38,450
it's ruined a few like people
that I want to hang out with. Yes.

1172
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,620
It's all I think about your breath.
One of them,

1173
01:14:40,621 --> 01:14:44,010
like I like a friend and I'm
just like, I dunno. It's weird.

1174
01:14:44,011 --> 01:14:45,350
Like I can't write that off.

1175
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,960
We both wrote down three names
of comedians with bad breath.

1176
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,700
They would crossover. I bet. I
bet. At least let's do that. Okay.

1177
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,023
When we're off the air.

1178
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:56,640
Um, so, uh, anyway,

1179
01:14:56,641 --> 01:15:01,410
so I go in and I was feeling this pain
when I bite on the right side of my mouth.

1180
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,690
And so I went in and the, and, and I swear

1181
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:07,860
war. And how often do you go to the
dentist? Do you go regularly? Yeah,

1182
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:11,850
go once a year. Okay. Okay. And uh, oh,
I take my teeth very seriously. Yeah,

1183
01:15:11,851 --> 01:15:12,890
that's what I'm saying.
You know, it's very,

1184
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,710
you'd be surprised because I only
ask because of the range of like,

1185
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:20,390
some people come in here or they'll
email in and they'll be like,

1186
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:24,180
haven't been to the dentist in 10 years.
And then they go, because you guys talk.

1187
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:27,120
But all the time I just decided
to go and we get the full range.

1188
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:30,030
Some people were like, I had 26 cavities.
Right. And some people were like,

1189
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:33,360
you wouldn't believe what I haven't been
in 10 years. Nothing. Yeah, I'm fine.

1190
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,050
Right. Anyway, I have very hard teeth. I
didn't get a lot of cavities in my life.

1191
01:15:37,051 --> 01:15:40,320
My mom's got hard teeth. We don't get
cavities. Wow. They're very white.

1192
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:43,110
Is that a natural?
I don't know.

1193
01:15:43,111 --> 01:15:47,840
I used toothbrush with the white neuron
it and maybe like know smile. Oh Wow,

1194
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:52,800
this one's fake. This got knocked out.
Ooh. And Aah. And they've put it in.

1195
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:57,720
And that was when I was 15 and it's still
going strong ground on the last that

1196
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:01,920
long. Now what about veneer work?
Porcelain? No, nothing like that. No.

1197
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:05,920
Bondings of any kind of, wow. So you're,
you're feeling a pain though. So I'm

1198
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,340
feeling a pain when I bite and I'm
convinced it's my second molar top. Uh,

1199
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,980
uh, right. Yup. And so
I go in and the guy, uh,

1200
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,990
takes, takes a, like a cue tip and he
says, bite down and keep biting down.

1201
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,400
I'm not feeling the pain.
And it keeps going.

1202
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:24,310
And then he goes back to the
wisdom tooth and I bite on that.

1203
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:25,360
And there was the pain.

1204
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:28,420
And so it was like this phantom thing
where I thought it was this tooth,

1205
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:32,290
but it was the other one. So then he
goes, all right, well, you know, we can,

1206
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,010
we can, uh, he says, he, I
think it's cracked. He said,

1207
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:39,520
and so because I,
I do to have filling in that one.

1208
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:42,940
And so the wall of it was too
thin. So he goes, all right,

1209
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:44,320
we're going to pull it next week.

1210
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:49,321
And so I go home and then that week
I'm chewing and all sudden I chew on

1211
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,300
something hard.

1212
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,220
And it was the outside piece of the
wisdom tooth had fallen off and I crunched

1213
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:58,950
down. And here's the amazing
thing about the human tooth.

1214
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:03,820
A dental system,
you will be biting full speed.

1215
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,050
What does that 20 miles an hour each bite.
Sure.

1216
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,260
And then if something
is in there that's hard.

1217
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:13,410
Your teeth stop in a nano
millimeter for crushing down.

1218
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:17,270
Isn't that incredible?
And it just stops. Yeah.

1219
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:22,490
And even when you're
fat, it's about, and so,

1220
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:24,350
uh, so I went in and he, uh,

1221
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:27,200
he went in to pull it out and
he shot me with the Nova Cane.

1222
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,990
And all I'm asking is in advance.
I'm like,

1223
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:34,390
so can I get like a barbiturates or
whatever, can I, can I get some opioids?

1224
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,190
And he's like, I don't think you'll
really need it. And I'm going, you know,

1225
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:40,040
I'm pretty pain sensitive
and I'm really not, but, uh,

1226
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,430
I want to get them and give
them to my friends. And so, uh,

1227
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,080
and so he goes in and he's like,

1228
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:48,980
gives me the penicillin shot and that not
penicillin. The, uh, the numbing thing,

1229
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,850
the Novocaine, Novocaine, and
then, and then he's picking her,

1230
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:56,450
he's poking around and then all of
a sudden he holds it in front of me.

1231
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,250
It took like three minutes.

1232
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:02,600
He just popped it right
out and then, um, you know,

1233
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:07,010
gave me some gauze to chew on and
I did three shows at night. Oh,

1234
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:11,870
Mike with the gauze in my mouth.
Oh, here, here in la. And then I,

1235
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:16,160
and then I went out the next
day. Took the, you know,
said the gauze out overnight.

1236
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:19,100
The next day I was,
I was fine and I haven't had any pain.

1237
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:23,660
Some people get wisdom teeth out
and for whatever reason it's, oh,

1238
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:26,730
it's an leads.
It affected and they have pain from

1239
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:30,950
back then when I,
when I had mine taken out,

1240
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:34,850
they weaved in some cloth
that had a painkiller,

1241
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:39,970
but it had a clove clover,
clover

1242
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,200
and I,
I absolutely cannot stand it.

1243
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:50,220
So I would driving around like,
oh, and tasting the clothes,

1244
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:53,990
the clove tastes. Yeah. And I
had to, I called, I was like,

1245
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,020
you have to put something else in.
Like I'm going to, I'm going to be not,

1246
01:18:57,021 --> 01:19:00,470
I'm going to throw up. And so I had
to go in, they had to weave it back,

1247
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,710
put another one in. Wow. I never have,
I've never heard this story 12 years.

1248
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:09,240
And I never,
you know about your dental history time.

1249
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:14,250
I know you always get something exciting
and fun with a dental update or you do

1250
01:19:14,341 --> 01:19:18,320
a dental update on every episode that
every episode we've probably done,

1251
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,980
I don't know, 50 of, I mean we'd
like to, it's funny like we,

1252
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:27,040
we aligned with this company where we're
both there like trying to make oral

1253
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:31,790
care more a part of the conversation
and we naturally did this,

1254
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,230
been doing this for years. Like we just
bring it up because I think we're just,

1255
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:40,130
I know it started as a joke.
It was started as a joke.

1256
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:45,620
I had put the veneer stuff
or some dental work done. No,

1257
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:47,150
I had a crown replaced.

1258
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:50,450
My point is that we were so boring to
talk about on the podcast that we made it

1259
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:55,200
a segment on the point of
fascination. Yeah. In other words,

1260
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,630
and it really is interesting to
hear people's take on it. Like it's,

1261
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:03,590
it's so extreme, but there are people
who come sit here and are like,

1262
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:08,790
don't brush, don't do anything. And
you're, yeah. It's just, I don't know.

1263
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,910
It's like one of those things that you
take for granted that someone is probably

1264
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:12,840
going to take care of it.

1265
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,480
Oh well it is like old people.

1266
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:17,730
One of the first things they'll
tell you is take care of your teeth.

1267
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:21,300
Cause when you get old in,
that shit starts popping out or in pain.

1268
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:25,930
I've asked, I always ask whenever I go
to any type of medical professional,

1269
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:28,960
as soon as you get that rapport going
with like the nurse, I'm always like,

1270
01:20:28,961 --> 01:20:32,830
tell me some wild shit. Like what?
What? And they told me that like, I go,

1271
01:20:32,831 --> 01:20:35,380
what's the craziest thing you
see here in the dentist's office?

1272
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:39,370
And they're always like, oh, it's
old people who have neglected.

1273
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:42,960
Do you think it smells
bad when they said no?

1274
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:46,150
Some of them will tilt their head back
and there was just food packed. Yeah.

1275
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,490
Oh,

1276
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,570
goals and in between. And I'm
like, and the smell of be like,

1277
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:52,250
it's not describable smell.
It's a,

1278
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,770
it's the most nauseating
thing you've ever seen

1279
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:55,850
and you got to get it.

1280
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,880
And then the dentist assistant has to
get in there with the floss and floss,

1281
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:03,710
go out
being a dental hygienist.

1282
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:08,240
Could you even imagine the smells and
you're working for a suicidal boss,

1283
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:11,210
number one suicide rate.
Why do they want to kill themselves?

1284
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:15,800
But no one wants to be there as monotonous
and people are afraid when they up

1285
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:19,600
there. I mean, I catch myself in
the chair and I go, oh my God,

1286
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:24,110
every muscle in my body is
tense right now. Right. And
they pick up on that. Yeah.

1287
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:28,520
As opposed to being a comedian where what,
how fucking great is our job.

1288
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:32,830
People come in, they drink,
they relax, they, and,

1289
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:36,890
and it's also like, I was thinking about
this, like, we're not that good. Right.

1290
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:41,780
What we do is not that good because we
learn over time to be calm and act like

1291
01:21:41,781 --> 01:21:42,614
we know what we're doing.

1292
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:47,660
But the truth is those two or 300
people are sitting there with an agenda.

1293
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,730
Yeah. They are there to laugh.
It's like when you go to a, uh,

1294
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:56,960
a sad movie, you're there to cry. I don't
cry when I go to it's sad movie. I cry.

1295
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,680
Right. So when I go to a comedy show, it
doesn't matter how funny the person is,

1296
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:03,590
I paid, you know, whatever
they're paying to get in 20 bucks,

1297
01:22:03,591 --> 01:22:08,270
25 bucks and two drinks, they're
fucking laughing. Right, right. Maybe,

1298
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:12,710
but then again, there's the, the, I dare
you to make me laugh. People too. Yeah.

1299
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:16,160
But that's not, most of us are most,
they're watching your specials like oh,

1300
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:19,790
that's different. Some on TV
it's different. Yeah. Yeah.
And then it's a challenge.

1301
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,713
Yes.

1302
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,650
Yeah. The best was when you're getting
these notes, different dynamic.

1303
01:22:23,651 --> 01:22:26,860
The emails that I get, emails,
like I press play on your,

1304
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,530
on your special knowing that it would suck

1305
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:33,080
and you're, and you're like,
cool. And then they'll be like,

1306
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:37,610
I gotta admit I did laugh and I
was totally not expecting too.

1307
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:40,400
You're not, you're not as Shitty
as I thought you would be.

1308
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:43,130
Like that's a very nice email.
And you know,

1309
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:46,770
they think that they're being clever.
Yeah.

1310
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:48,530
But it really is so annoying.

1311
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,210
It's so those him emails or after shows
with some of the codes to go, hey,

1312
01:22:53,211 --> 01:22:57,180
you weren't that bad. It's like,
just walk. Just fucking walk away.

1313
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:01,110
Yeah. Yeah. I always, I'm the one
that I always tell is like the, uh,

1314
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,930
like they're like, you were pretty
funny and you're like, would you,

1315
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,550
would you honestly walk up to another
human being and qualify a compliment like

1316
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,940
that? Like, would you approach
a woman be like, yeah, you know,

1317
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,470
you're not bad looking. Yeah.
You know, it's like the, the,

1318
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:19,240
the way that you're saying that
is such a shitty tone to say like,

1319
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:19,631
well,

1320
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:23,710
it means that that guy probably sees
himself as the funniest guy in his office

1321
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:26,950
and he can't give up the Alpha status.
That's really interesting. Yeah. I never,

1322
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,160
I never thought of it that way.
There's a lot of alpha. Yeah. I mean,

1323
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:32,750
we're assuming alpha status and
the same for you. Yeah. You know,

1324
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,200
you're walking in and you're
saying that's why women do.

1325
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,080
And one of the many theories
why women are, you know,

1326
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:41,170
there's that thing of like women aren't
funny and it's all, it's like, well no,

1327
01:23:41,171 --> 01:23:43,690
it's that you won't give over
to the way I just described.

1328
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:46,060
People walking into club and
sitting down and giving over.

1329
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,990
I think there's a criteria for who
they will give it over to as well.

1330
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,080
And for men they don't sell. You don't
want to give up their alpha status. Yeah.

1331
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:56,650
It's a position of power to,
to hold a microphone and to be like,

1332
01:23:56,651 --> 01:23:59,380
you're listening to me for
the next hour of your life.

1333
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:04,210
And also a women aren't
allowed to be loud, vulgar,

1334
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:04,871
aggressive.

1335
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:09,450
It's societaly frowned upon for a woman
to a assert that kind of power. Yeah.

1336
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,950
So attractive. Sexually attractive. Yeah.

1337
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,250
How threatened men are.
Um,

1338
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:17,240
in all aspects of like on social media,

1339
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:22,550
I was thinking about like all the shit
talking like all the hate. It's all dudes.

1340
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:27,260
And I probably have a more,
obviously skew more male followers,

1341
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,880
but like all the fucking hate all the
shit talking. It's all guys. Yeah.

1342
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:36,380
It's all guys. It's like
unprompted. They're just
pushing their issues onto you.

1343
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,530
Yeah. You know, it's like whatever,
they're attacking you for it.

1344
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:41,720
Sometimes it's like, oh, you know,

1345
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:45,920
you have this a nice fucking
shirt asshole and you're like,

1346
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,060
what? Yeah. You know, or it's like,
yeah, you think you're so fucking funny.

1347
01:24:50,061 --> 01:24:51,880
What about some guy wrote me like I,

1348
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:56,881
I did some sarcastic post and he was like
easy to say when you have success and

1349
01:24:56,961 --> 01:25:00,990
your wife has makes money and blah
blah blah. I'm like, yeah, right.

1350
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:05,380
It's the grand post. Right.
I'm just joking. Although
when a woman criticizes me,

1351
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,420
she's almost always dead on.

1352
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:12,030
So it's like the thing you said it was
actually kind of racist we got, yeah.

1353
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,920
Like think about it. You're right.
Yeah, you're right. That's true.

1354
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,220
I know a lot of females criticizing
me now from the special,

1355
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,220
it's a lot of female on female
eight. Really? Oh yeah. Yeah.

1356
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:25,550
Maybe it's that the sexist feel
more comfortable criticizing.

1357
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:30,580
They're all 100% yeah. Yeah. Cause guide
the, the, what I get from guys is like,

1358
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:34,840
I usually hate a female comics, but
you're funny. Like a guy. He's funny.

1359
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:38,360
And then I'm like, thanks. I think,
thank you. I don't know, you know,

1360
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,490
like every other dumb broad out there.
Yeah. Good job. Wow. What a compliment.

1361
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:45,460
Yeah. By the way, did you pick up
on this, uh, the David Cross thing?

1362
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,950
Did you hear about this or read about it?
What happened?

1363
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,910
How he was accused of being racist,
but like in a tweet,

1364
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,960
oh, I saw that there was an Asian,
a comedic actress, Simon say,

1365
01:25:56,980 --> 01:26:00,320
and I don't want to give this person
any thunder. I mean, it's a known story.

1366
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:04,800
I think that, you know, David
Cross is whole sensibility

1367
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,240
is ironic. Every, I mean it's
like Sarah Silverman, it's a call.

1368
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:11,710
Anything she says is racist is like split.
You don't get what this person is.

1369
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:15,510
That's what I thought too, man. And the
other thing that I, I want to say like,

1370
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,920
yeah,
we have to give some sense.

1371
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,810
I mean, it's literally like
me calling that Guy Faggot
as being homophobic. Right?

1372
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,910
When I say to the MC,

1373
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:26,760
like that's literally how add a
context that would be David Cross.

1374
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:31,450
So the story of people know is that the,
the comedic actress was,

1375
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,460
I think, I think it was at a bar in,
on location before shooting a movie.

1376
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:37,510
This is how I understand it.

1377
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:42,780
And like people are getting together at
the bar and that he approached and she

1378
01:26:43,601 --> 01:26:45,220
said that he was like,
um,

1379
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:48,090
he said something to her and she
was like stunned by what she, yeah.

1380
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:50,650
He made fun of her pants or
something. Yeah. And then he was like,

1381
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:51,880
you know how to speak English

1382
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:58,420
and then challenged her to a karate
fight. And I was like, yeah, I, you know,

1383
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,480
I just thought like, but if
you're, cause you're a comp,

1384
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,850
if the person who was saying
it was, is a comedian, yeah.

1385
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:09,420
Don't you think that like if you know
David Cross that he is actually playing,

1386
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:15,370
like playing the part of
that stupid person, right.
In an improvisational moment.

1387
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,970
Right. Like that's how I was like,
wouldn't that be like automatic?

1388
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:22,390
It's a compliment that he would think
that you'd be okay with it. Right, right.

1389
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:26,500
Great. 100%. Yeah. Um, and I
just felt like, I don't know,

1390
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:31,501
I mean I'm not Asian so I don't have the
right to like say whether or not it's

1391
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:35,290
offensive, but I'm like, but I am a
comic. And I'm like, yeah. Like if,

1392
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:40,710
if he came up to me and started like
doing what David Cross does and like

1393
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:46,390
jumping into like a
character and insulting me.

1394
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,400
Like that's supposed to be the fun thing
that you're like, yeah, oh yeah man.

1395
01:27:51,401 --> 01:27:54,960
Like your yes and it, yeah, yeah,
yeah. You go along with it. Sure.

1396
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,240
And to recount it 10 years later and
be like, God, that was so painful.

1397
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,320
It just sounded like,
I was like,

1398
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,470
oh, you're so weak. It might.

1399
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:06,490
Well that's the problem now with the whole
me to pound sign me too Hashtag yeah.

1400
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:12,940
Is that it's so undefined and it's such
an excuse for anybody to just bitch

1401
01:28:13,851 --> 01:28:16,040
about feeling slighted at some point.

1402
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,230
Feeling slighted and being sexually
harassed are very different things. Yeah.

1403
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:26,270
Well racial, racially harassed. The
whole problem is the non specificity,

1404
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,270
specificity. Specificity. For instance,

1405
01:28:29,271 --> 01:28:32,390
if you're going to call someone a racist
and you're going to do it on Twitter

1406
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:37,391
and 150 characters or less like is that
really fair to put someone on blast in

1407
01:28:38,631 --> 01:28:42,860
two sentences? The answer is no racism.

1408
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:47,750
You know, like to tell that story
like we met at the bar before,

1409
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:52,751
like you know as a like as a cast and
then like to take all the nuance out of

1410
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:53,654
the conversation.

1411
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,620
Yes.
And then that was racist to me.

1412
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:59,620
Well it's also a misuse of the
word racist because racism is

1413
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:01,710
the, the, the,

1414
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,760
the person who has the power using that
power to objectify or oppress the person

1415
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:13,410
of another race. Geez. The lesser race,

1416
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:17,580
the superior race acting
superior basically is a crime.

1417
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:19,240
We earned it. Yeah. Look,

1418
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:23,190
we only fucked within our thin
gene pool for thousands of years,

1419
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,500
so we could be better.
But I mean,

1420
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:30,060
but I mean racism is the
acting out of a prejudice.

1421
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:33,720
Yeah. So just making it up. Not even say,

1422
01:29:33,721 --> 01:29:38,721
say David Cross was it for
the most liberal outspokenly,

1423
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:41,040
you know,
democratic guy.

1424
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:44,910
If he say this in one moment of
his life decided to be a racist,

1425
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:46,440
he didn't do anything about it.

1426
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,170
He didn't keep her from
getting an a movie or on stage.

1427
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:53,350
So there's no crime and I think
he is one of the most liberal, uh,

1428
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:57,870
he is like really? He and his
wife have followed them on
Instagram. Yeah. Ps sweet.

1429
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,620
I doubt that.

1430
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:01,620
And what the Hashtag me too think I'd
like to know what the stories are.

1431
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:06,080
I feel like if it, if it's not
specific, it's like what is,

1432
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:10,380
how is this helping people? Yeah.
There you go. Cause in sharing stories,

1433
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:13,950
that's how people help each other. Do
you know what an Asian woman by the way,

1434
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,500
making fun of another Asian.

1435
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,940
She was no, she, this woman
is actually talking about how,

1436
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,030
how she said that like uh,

1437
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:25,200
that she'll fight your ass even
though I'll let her say it so

1438
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:37,950
fucked up bitch, I'm still hurting
shit and we'll fuck your is stop. Okay.

1439
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:39,540
You want to fuck with my money?

1440
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:45,460
Oh, I fucking love that. So
Schatz a character, she's a,

1441
01:30:45,461 --> 01:30:49,330
she's a real hood ass chick, right? What
does she look like? She's, um, I guess,

1442
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:53,830
I think it was she Chinese,
Vietnamese, and um, but she like,

1443
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:58,450
uh, from New York and talks
like, like super ghetto.

1444
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,370
And then it goes, she was like, oh, I
might look like I'll change, I'll bow.

1445
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:06,410
Fuck your ass up. He want to fuck
with my mind. Who I fuck with me?

1446
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,810
Do you want to fuck with me man?

1447
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:16,660
Oh,
that's be as Vietnamese,

1448
01:31:16,661 --> 01:31:17,494
right?

1449
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:22,380
Yeah. May, may, may, may
is her name. I don't know.

1450
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:25,510
I'm on my mind.

1451
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,560
Yeah.
The Vietnamese gangs are bad ass.

1452
01:31:28,561 --> 01:31:31,680
They were no tourists when they started
coming over here and like the 90s,

1453
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:36,290
I forget why they was like an
influx of Vietnamese gangs and, uh,

1454
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,280
the cops would talk about how, you know,
it all started with like, you know,

1455
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:45,120
the Italian mobsters. Right. And
that mafia were really, they just,

1456
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:48,780
they killed other fat guys. There
wasn't, there wasn't too much.

1457
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,470
And then along came
like, um, you know, uh,

1458
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:57,150
inner city crips and bloods and
they were killing other bystanders.

1459
01:31:57,151 --> 01:32:01,210
Got killed a lot. But then these
Vietnamese gangs came along and they said,

1460
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:05,680
these motherfuckers were scary than any
of the other gangs because these guys

1461
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:10,380
would just black fucking open fire there
we do is all kinds of hits going on.

1462
01:32:10,381 --> 01:32:12,670
And, and they said they were,
they were really fucking tough.

1463
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:14,800
And then of course the Russians came.

1464
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:19,630
Oh savages that just like Trump
everyone. And then, you know,

1465
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:23,980
I remember when we were kids,
like the big thing when I was growing up,

1466
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:25,990
my mother's Peruvian is
we would always refer,

1467
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:29,110
everyone would referred to the
Colombians as like the most savage. Yeah,

1468
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:31,630
no cause it like the cartels and
they're like, they're so violent.

1469
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,820
And then they were definitely,

1470
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,850
I mean they look like
fucking kindergarteners
next to the Mexican cartels.

1471
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:44,580
So much way more savagery and the Mexican
cartels like fucking will kill a whole

1472
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:46,500
kid,

1473
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:51,190
like a school full of kids and all the
teachers and stab notes into them so that

1474
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:56,170
when the cops come, the notes are
stabbed into the kid's dead bodies.

1475
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,030
No Shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1476
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:01,520
Because like they were trying to
oppress the cartel in that area. Wow.

1477
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:05,020
Crazy shit like that. You
know, it's like in um, way,

1478
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:08,030
but I'm saying like leftover.
Yeah. You know what?

1479
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:08,391
Well,

1480
01:33:08,391 --> 01:33:12,820
it's like member apocalypse now and when
at the end he's talking about how the

1481
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:17,821
Americans would send a medical units in
to try to treat the Vietnamese who had,

1482
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:19,510
I forget what disease they have,

1483
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:23,560
but they gave him shots of penicillin
and then the warlords would come in and

1484
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:26,500
they would chop off the
children's arms that got the shot.

1485
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:31,510
And then that's when Marlon
Brando said the horror, AH,

1486
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,190
Jesus Christ

1487
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,380
gray matter.

1488
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,090
It's all made a song out of that.

1489
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,410
It is a good song.

1490
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,600
My mind.

1491
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,393
Ah,

1492
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:56,743
Tuesday

1493
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,073
I belie

1494
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,380
man my day because I make crazy as videos

1495
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:12,060
in my hair. Fucking Matt, come
on, look was talking to you too.

1496
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:19,470
Your Dick in a box to tick,
tick,

1497
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:24,420
tick, tick, tick,

1498
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,870
tick,
tick in the wrong.

1499
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:33,950
You remember a
great,

1500
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:38,510
yeah, it's really good. I can't stand when
somebody comment under one of my video.

1501
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:42,260
It's too high. No
waterfall. But I am blessed.

1502
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,940
Uh,
so this guy last week tried to tell us,

1503
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,640
tell the Internet that if
you want to feel Horny,

1504
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:52,160
you should take 10 to 12 Benadryl.

1505
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:55,070
You're going to answer
by when you see this one,

1506
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:58,110
he's a die.
If you take 12 where

1507
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:01,440
we thought crazy person. Yeah. He's like,

1508
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:04,580
you want to be a horny 10 to 12 Benadryl.

1509
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:10,090
Send me the hospital
before you have sex.

1510
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,250
Do you want to be horny for two or three
hours? Like you never been in your life?

1511
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:19,060
Any of access to marijuana too good.

1512
01:35:19,061 --> 01:35:23,950
We'd listen to me.
She came to me.

1513
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:27,670
True wheat alone can get your
really hornier than normal,

1514
01:35:27,671 --> 01:35:29,020
but it's been on general.

1515
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:33,370
Take about 10 12 billion girl before you
want to have your sexual fun with your

1516
01:35:33,371 --> 01:35:35,890
partner or whatever you do or masturbate.
All right,

1517
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,400
so this guy,
I'm thinking it's the ladder with him.

1518
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,950
This guy is often in the balloon.
Odd. He's, he's, he's real. He's the,

1519
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:48,880
they send them some more videos of him,
so he's gone for it.

1520
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:50,000
He's really going for it.

1521
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:54,890
But this person said that's one way
I heard the most recent podcasts.

1522
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:57,020
It needed to share. When I was
in high school, Somebody told me,

1523
01:35:57,021 --> 01:35:59,330
you took a bunch of Benadryl. It
would give you a pleasant, hi,

1524
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:04,070
I'm not sure what is wrong with that
women's wrestling guy because it was truly

1525
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:07,520
one of the worst, worst
experiences in my life. And movies.

1526
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:11,840
They often show acid and mushrooms is
terrifying, inducing terrifying visuals,

1527
01:36:11,841 --> 01:36:15,410
which they don't for most
people, unfortunately. This
is exactly what happened.

1528
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:19,190
Most of them, I felt like it was on
fire. I could not tell what was real,

1529
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:19,761
what wasn't.

1530
01:36:19,761 --> 01:36:22,920
I was talking to people I believed were
there and I would look back and they

1531
01:36:22,921 --> 01:36:25,550
were gone.
When I would walk into a different room,

1532
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:29,090
I would think I was somewhere else
on a different day. Towards the end,

1533
01:36:29,091 --> 01:36:29,821
I was chasing it.

1534
01:36:29,821 --> 01:36:32,820
Tarantula around the room and
trying to kill it with a broom says,

1535
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:37,580
considering this guy has done this a lot,
he must be a special kind of crazy.

1536
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:41,900
Keep your dosage is low when experimenting
with drugs or new masturbation

1537
01:36:41,901 --> 01:36:46,190
techniques. Dr Lee's, I bet he
didn't sneeze one style. Yeah.

1538
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:52,060
See upside on the bright
side. You this, uh,

1539
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:55,680
could you imagine this guy's fucked up?
Well,

1540
01:36:55,681 --> 01:36:59,530
can you imagine watching the
video and then going, I'll
try it. Yeah. Look at this.

1541
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:01,910
I mean there's,
you're talking about take the,

1542
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:05,450
this is the string from his shorts.

1543
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:12,640
Obviously it goes to my pants right now,
but

1544
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:17,350
cause hard as you can to rip this apart.
Close hers.

1545
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,680
You can you fill those magnets,

1546
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:24,990
a little atomic magnets that make
molecules and the molecules stick down our

1547
01:37:24,991 --> 01:37:27,240
molecules. No, no they don't.

1548
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:34,050
That's a magnet.
Lots of the little pity magnets ma'am.

1549
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:42,320
He also turns out he's really
pissed off at women in general.

1550
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,270
I know why.
I was going to say,

1551
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:48,620
I mean when I see a waste
of human existence like
that and you think about how

1552
01:37:48,621 --> 01:37:52,810
much work it took for his mommy to
make him and care and then you're like,

1553
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:56,040
no, this is what you're
fucking dealing with your

1554
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,100
life. You've suck. All right. Well

1555
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,750
all M and are the reason that I'm done.

1556
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,190
I take fucking 30
Benadryl at once at night.

1557
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:07,210
Third fucking want to get horny
and enjoy myself sexually without,

1558
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:11,110
and then there's the jealousy and rage
as you I have over. Even Lesbians,

1559
01:38:11,111 --> 01:38:15,070
I'm jealous of you even so.
See,

1560
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:18,990
but you get to be horny or in grow up
sexually and mature sexually because

1561
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:21,360
you've had real pussy in your face.
And I haven't.

1562
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:24,570
I got to get he watching the
fucking videos on youtube.

1563
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,780
I spent thousands of dollars in my life.

1564
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:31,620
I'm female wrestling and little
girls do that all the time, man.

1565
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:35,880
And Post it on Youtube and it's more fun
and it's free, but the fucking sucks.

1566
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:40,460
The quality and everything else.
There's little girls. God Damn

1567
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:43,940
No, I think he's saying he
watches female wrestling. Yeah.

1568
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:48,860
And that any chick woman can do this,
make that video her,

1569
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:53,630
grab her friend. We can get all the pussy
in the world. He's saying, but he can't.

1570
01:38:53,631 --> 01:38:57,380
So he's jealous. Yeah, no,
that's true. He hates his mommy.

1571
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:01,040
Nice. Your sexuality.
America fucking sucks.

1572
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:03,290
What these guys are
talking about in America.

1573
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:07,120
Have you ever left America and shot of
a woman there? A better place for you?

1574
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,410
Yeah.
In America.

1575
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:14,540
Yeah. It's America's fault. Yeah.
Yeah. He doesn't have a passport.

1576
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:18,550
Never left the town that he's from.
He also thinks it's really stupid.

1577
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:22,870
Like it's really lame to want
to have traditional sex. Oh Wow.

1578
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:23,930
What?

1579
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:28,120
I have never in my life wanting to stick
my dick inside of a woman and calm.

1580
01:39:28,121 --> 01:39:32,870
That is the stupidest, nasty as
dumb ass thing I've ever had. To me.

1581
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:35,900
It's no different almost.
And having sex with a gun in the ass hole,

1582
01:39:35,901 --> 01:39:37,730
which is disgusting as fuck,
too.

1583
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,810
Option three years.

1584
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:44,820
Those are the holes.
What's going on?

1585
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:49,780
Fuck. I would never, so my, my is tried
to get me to watch regular porn. Like

1586
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:52,750

1587
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:57,370
the way you make out in your stupid
boring fucking bullshit. Yeah.

1588
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:01,630
Fucking all of your own.
Buy Your woman.

1589
01:40:01,631 --> 01:40:04,480
You're all a bunch of
fucking pieces of shit.

1590
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:09,910
Oh God doesn't love you and you are you
any more. You're fucked. Oh my goodness.

1591
01:40:09,911 --> 01:40:12,670
Honey. Here I am on the planet
with your mother fucker.

1592
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:17,030
Hmm hmm. Have a good
day, mother fucker. Ah,

1593
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:21,400
so my mom used to say when she threatened
me. Oh yeah. Have a nice fucking day,

1594
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:23,860
which she really, yeah,
she like threatened me.

1595
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:27,790
Horrible letters to me and then be like,
have a nice fucking,

1596
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,310
it's a real crazy person's
thing. New Deal. Delia,

1597
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:35,200
I didn't realize that last one by the
way is solidified the level that that

1598
01:40:35,201 --> 01:40:39,230
dude's really well you think? Well I mean
the 10 or 12 bandage rolls inside. Yeah.

1599
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,760
Did you did not doubt it. But that
would the end there when he was like,

1600
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:45,170
fuck you motherfucker.
Like that's that.

1601
01:40:45,171 --> 01:40:49,600
Is this guy not stumble onto
Methodist point? I know,
right? Good. 30 Benadryl. Okay.

1602
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:54,100
Yeah. I think the next
step is meth. Yeah. I think

1603
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,680
that's the step before this.
Like that's an old step.

1604
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:01,870
He said it hard to get, Benadryl
is not like a controlled substance.

1605
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:06,650
I know like sue DEF Sudafed is to
deference in there. Whatever happened

1606
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:12,190
when I met her, you know everyone's
always like, wait til you meet my mom.

1607
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:16,000
Like that kind of thing. She was
like, wait til you meet my mom please.

1608
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:19,750
And then we met at a restaurant and she
was like, hello. And then she's like,

1609
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,880
I was at Bloomingdale's. And he's fucking
cunt sales woman. And I was like, ah.

1610
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:30,040
I started laugh so hard because
I was so funny. And she's like,

1611
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:33,340
barely. She's like barely registering
me. She's like watching me laugh.

1612
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:37,390
And she's like, I said, fuck you, you
fucking bitch. And I was like, oh wow.

1613
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:42,550
First meeting we were in a
public restaurant or restaurant,

1614
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:45,790
she would frequent and she would always
get the back booth so that people

1615
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:49,690
couldn't hear her, so she
could really unleash. Yeah.
And then Christina was like,

1616
01:41:49,691 --> 01:41:53,650
when she was like, what are
her views on race? Super.

1617
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:57,770
My mother was super racist. She
would, um, she felt slighted by that.

1618
01:41:58,410 --> 01:42:02,380
We went to a Sushi bar once
and they sat us in her opinion,

1619
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,930
very close to the restroom,
which not really,

1620
01:42:04,931 --> 01:42:07,870
but she was too close to the toilet.

1621
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:10,150
And so she got mad at the
waitress and she was like,

1622
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:14,530
this fucking goop bitch set me near
the fucking toilet. Fuck fucker.

1623
01:42:14,531 --> 01:42:18,330
You're fucking gook.
And I was like, oh. Um,

1624
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:22,060
so then we like got up and stormed out
and I had to follow her. I was like,

1625
01:42:22,061 --> 01:42:26,730
something's wrong. Jesus.
She was always right.

1626
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:30,010
And my step father was Indian and
he was racist too. Ironically,

1627
01:42:30,011 --> 01:42:32,260
they're both dead now,
but that's one of my favorite,

1628
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:35,290
like the psychology of like
these fucking immigrants,

1629
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:40,950
like your Indian step immigrated at like
25 or 30 like a grown man came to this

1630
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:45,700
country and was like, we gotta put these
border wall. Like he was like, yeah, pro.

1631
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:48,880
You know what I mean? Like he
probably came in illegally. No, no,

1632
01:42:48,881 --> 01:42:52,090
he fought in our military.
Well he did and he came in legally,

1633
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:56,350
but he was a republican and he gave a
lot of money to the Republican Party and

1634
01:42:56,351 --> 01:43:01,060
therefore felt that he was kind of
like, you know, like a white guy by,

1635
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,270
by money. And he kind of
was like, in this country,

1636
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:07,930
your economic status determines a
lot, right. How people perceive you.

1637
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:12,460
And he was a baller, so
yeah. Oh Wow. That's crazy.

1638
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,490
But pictures of the five last Republican
presidents sign personally given to him

1639
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:20,740
because that's how much money,
he don't know what the party shit.

1640
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:23,560
What did he do for work?
Oh really?

1641
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:27,910
One answer that I'm a little bit a
little bit of everything and they say,

1642
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:32,100
well, this little, it was little, my uh,

1643
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:36,370
one of my friends growing up, not
that this means it, but it's probably,

1644
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:39,820
it was Dominican and they, they were
like, I was like, what does your dad do?

1645
01:43:39,821 --> 01:43:44,260
They live, they were very wealthy and
import, export, import x. That's another,

1646
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,780
it's like four years later it's like,

1647
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:49,530
well what does he do specifically
import export. I'm like,

1648
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:51,980
could you tell me what he,
and mostly important

1649
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:57,710
distribution. Yeah. I was
like, hmm, okay. That was it.

1650
01:43:57,711 --> 01:44:01,520
That was the most you ever got spending
the night at his house. What do you do?

1651
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,260
Import. Export, right. Yeah. Okay.

1652
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,500
Well that's amazing because when you
think about a World War II and the people

1653
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:11,010
that came over you, or even
going back to, you know,

1654
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:15,350
the turn of the 19th century when people
came over here and they had nothing

1655
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:19,790
and, and all of a sudden like, you know,
you got some guy who came over here like,

1656
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:21,890
you know, I was reading
this book about the, the I,

1657
01:44:21,891 --> 01:44:26,720
the famine in Ireland and like people
would come over here and like 1946 with

1658
01:44:26,721 --> 01:44:27,501
fuck,
you know,

1659
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:32,501
zero and all of a sudden they went to
college and then they went to got a

1660
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:38,300
doctor's license. Oh, it's banana
and became wealthy and it's like,

1661
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:42,470
I,
I hope my kids like just break even.

1662
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:44,870
I hope that they can move out
of the house at some point.

1663
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:49,620
Make enough money to live on
their own. That's my, that's
my goal for my kids. Yes.

1664
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:53,410
Wait, can I ask a question
though? Sidebar. He will.

1665
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:56,540
He's a winner because he was, your son's
going to, he's the way you described.

1666
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:59,240
Yeah, he should be. Well, you never
know. Sometimes kids peak in high school.

1667
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,260
Your daughter is going to bring a
black guy to live with her for sure.

1668
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:05,120
Gonna fucking definitely move on.
Yeah,

1669
01:45:05,121 --> 01:45:07,490
I'm expecting the black guy
were already like, you know,

1670
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:10,640
putting hip hop stuff around the house.
It's just a matter of time,

1671
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:14,390
stuff around the house.
You hang gold chains on the wall and shit.

1672
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,710
So he's comfortable. We've got
some like, you know, some like, uh,

1673
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:23,720
African elephant type statues and what,
what else do black people like?

1674
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:28,550
We got cookbooks. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

1675
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,150
I want to ask you a question about the
potato famine in Ireland while there are

1676
01:45:33,151 --> 01:45:37,670
a fucking island.
Why weren't they fishing and eating fish?

1677
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:39,440
We were fishing.

1678
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:44,960
We were growing a multitude
of crops, but we were, um,

1679
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:47,960
we were being held hostage
by the British who were,

1680
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:52,990
who were exporting 99% of our agriculture
and then selling it to other countries

1681
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:58,130
while we literally a million people
starved. It was a genocide. We'd,

1682
01:45:58,131 --> 01:46:01,550
they literally, you know, and so we
were subsisting off the potatoes.

1683
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:05,960
And so when the potatoes went bad,
they didn't give us any of the other food.

1684
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:09,260
We had giant, um, uh, pigs,

1685
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,180
a giant,

1686
01:46:11,181 --> 01:46:16,130
a agricultural as well as
livestock all being exported.

1687
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:18,510
And the Brits were like, fucking
let him die, let him die.

1688
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:22,170
Literally said there are too many of them.
Let them die. And this is what yours.

1689
01:46:22,171 --> 01:46:22,820
Is this happening?

1690
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:27,820
This was like in the 1840 [inaudible]
well the occupation lasted for hundreds of

1691
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:33,140
years. 1840s. Now the British,
you talk about Nazi Germany,

1692
01:46:33,141 --> 01:46:38,141
the British are way worse in terms of
what they've done worldwide colonizing and

1693
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:41,660
you know,
slaughtering all kinds of native peoples,

1694
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:46,730
like the Spanish to Spanish by my
other half. Yeah. Savages. Yeah,

1695
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:50,100
I remember. I still remember that.
I carry this with me, like those

1696
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,850
moments, those conversations. I was in
this, I was in school in, in Madrid,

1697
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:57,920
like in college, taking a class
and they were like, how do you, um,

1698
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,780
when I write the teacher where
the professor wrote, you know,

1699
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:04,380
when I write United States, what is
the first thing that comes to mind?

1700
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:07,920
And a Spanish student was
like, imperialism, like, yes.

1701
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:11,490
And world dominance and
then like what about Spain?

1702
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:14,790
And they said some other shit. And
I was like, how about imperialism?

1703
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,860
And he was like, excuse me. And I'm like,

1704
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:22,250
you have like 600 million people
speak Spanish 2,600 miles away.

1705
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:23,380
Yeah.

1706
01:47:23,380 --> 01:47:26,940
I think it's because they just liked
the language cause you guys fucking fuck

1707
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:30,420
went in there and you just went in
there and just destroyed the place.

1708
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,140
The most ancient civilizations,

1709
01:47:32,141 --> 01:47:37,141
the Aztecs and the Incas destroyed
their temples and their everything.

1710
01:47:38,081 --> 01:47:40,840
Their, their speech, they didn't allow
them to speak their native language.

1711
01:47:40,841 --> 01:47:45,550
And so it's, it's great. And pillage took
everything back and then all the goals,

1712
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:50,770
they're like, you guys are
the imperialist. Like we
learned it from dad. Yeah,

1713
01:47:50,771 --> 01:47:53,330
dad that took all that gold.
Yes.

1714
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,690
Because all of that goal in Central
America and they just carved it and the,

1715
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:00,880
and it's the people in Mexico, they didn't
fucking know. Of course they did gold,

1716
01:48:00,881 --> 01:48:03,430
didn't mean anything to them.
So next thing you know,

1717
01:48:03,431 --> 01:48:07,600
they're hauling that shit
out of the ground with a gun
to their head. And anyway,

1718
01:48:07,601 --> 01:48:09,880
this is,
this has gotten to be a very dark,

1719
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:13,290
I love it. Podcast. Yeah. We're on the
brink of civil war in this country.

1720
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:17,070
And listen, we got to wrap things up. Um,

1721
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,070
fits dog radio if it's a podcast.

1722
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:24,300
So the show airs on Sirius Xm as well,
right?

1723
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,030
Yeah,
I have the Greg Fitzsimmons show,

1724
01:48:26,031 --> 01:48:29,060
which had been on like 10 years
now on a Howard Stern's channel.

1725
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:33,050
It's actually the only other show on
Stearns channel. That's crazy point. Yeah.

1726
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:37,970
So you have that plus Mondays at a seven,
five o'clock on the West

1727
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,410
close. So that'd be Xm
100101101. And then,

1728
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,670
um, the podcast, you've been doing
that for awhile now, like eight years?

1729
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:52,960
Um, I dunno, maybe tomorrow. Okay.
I'm not sure. I think tomorrow.

1730
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:56,010
Yeah,
that's Fitstar checkout.

1731
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:01,400
It's dog radio and a fits dog.com.
And then I got some tour dates,

1732
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:05,570
kind of shit up those hours. Of course.
All right. I will be going to, let's see,

1733
01:49:05,571 --> 01:49:06,321
Spokane,

1734
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:11,321
Washington November 2nd through the
fourth and then I will be in Atlanta,

1735
01:49:11,781 --> 01:49:14,420
Georgia at the punchline.
Uh,

1736
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:19,550
November 16th through 17th through
the 19th. The all new Atlanta. I know.

1737
01:49:19,551 --> 01:49:23,600
What do you hear about it? I heard
good things. Yeah. I can't wait.

1738
01:49:23,601 --> 01:49:26,710
I like the owners. Um,

uh,

1740
01:49:29,601 --> 01:49:33,590
and I think I may be adding some dates.
So good if fits dog.com

1741
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:38,720
for more details. Don't even know. And
we say this, you know, we would say this,

1742
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:42,290
it's uncomfortable to say to the person
you're the one of the best comedians in

1743
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:45,840
the world of Humana. I've, I've like, I,

1744
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:48,490
you're somebody who I 100%

1745
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:52,520
if you're onstage, I want to watch and
then I feel badly about myself. Yes.

1746
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:56,410
Wow. Yeah. And then I'm
like mad is he got a nice,

1747
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,390
thoughtful Joe Rogan.

1748
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:01,780
I were just talking about Greg [inaudible]
on Joe show last week whenever I did

1749
01:50:01,781 --> 01:50:01,930
it.

1750
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:05,500
And you're so thoughtful and you're so
intelligent and you're so funny and it's

1751
01:50:05,501 --> 01:50:08,410
hard to be all those things and you're
really good. And I would say this,

1752
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:10,330
you know, we'll always be, somebody
comes in here will be like,

1753
01:50:10,331 --> 01:50:13,120
you should go see their show. You know,
you shouldn't go see all the shows.

1754
01:50:13,121 --> 01:50:16,680
We tell you to go see it. But,
but we're full of shit. Yeah.

1755
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:18,820
Fitzsimmons is so good.

1756
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:22,000
If you love standup comedy and
you're in any of those cities,

1757
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:25,330
you should a hundred percent good to take
it. He's, he's really one of the best.

1758
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:29,320
So go see. Um, it's, it's awesome. Wow.
You guys are the best. That's very sweet.

1759
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:32,830
My head is very big right now.
It's incredible.

1760
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:36,550
It's so full of trees.
And don't forget as you go to bed tonight,
