1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,780
Christina.
[inaudible].

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,820
Um, all right gene. I think, uh,
we're ready to start the show.

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,960
And you put your jeans on. I got my
jeans up. I got, how are they tight?

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,710
They're pretty tight. They're pretty
high. Teens are so tight. Yeah.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,250
I put on a pair yesterday and I was like,
oh, I don't know if I can do this today.

7
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm not there. This is going to be
a flat maximum, maximum gene edge.

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,360
Let's do it. Ready? Let's do it

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,990
before you have sex. If you want
to be horny for two or three hours,

10
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,991
like you never been in your life and
you have access to marijuana too good.

11
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,490
We'd listen to me.

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,430
Uh,
that go through.

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,920
Fuck yeah.

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,230
All right.
Take two.

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,060
Oh was Randy

16
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,820
will go to your mom's house,

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,113
Christina?

18
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah. That's good. I make beef type and
he goes like, beef writes like that.

19
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,720
Let me see what this is. Where it
gets you a lie. Yes. Tamar Braxton.

20
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,990
So this guy, what do you think
he's giving you? Sex Advice.

21
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,480
I don't understand what the advice is.
So he said,

22
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:29,270
if you really want to have super horny,
like a good horny time, he's telling you,

23
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:33,540
you got to get really good weed.
He's telling you this as he's a inhaling,

24
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,100
laughing gas through a balloon,

25
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,310
but now he's going to tell you the next
thing to really up your horniness ready.

26
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,030
Okay,

27
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,360
true. We'd along can get your
really hornier than normal,
but it's been on drawl.

28
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,710
Take about 10 12 bedroom girl before
you to have your sexual fun with your

29
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:50,410
partner or whatever you do or masturbate.
All right.

30
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,940
Well isn't that way too many? So
many. I think my heart would stop.

31
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,890
Wait,
does that make your heart?

32
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,650
I think also if you wanted to
tell anyone, hey, you know,

33
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,730
any medication is over the counter, take
10 or 12 of them and then go have sex.

34
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,940
Like they're all going to be like,
yeah, that was really more intense.

35
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,110
I remember as a kid, my mother would
give me Dimetapp you want to fuck good.

36
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,720
Take, take a 10 or 12 shots of Afrin
and your nose and then smoke weed.

37
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,920
All right. Crazy. Yeah. It felt crazy.
They're pseudoephedrine isn't there in uh,

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,230
in that, I don't know. Anyway, I used to
take Dimetapp as a kid. It's outlawed now.

39
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,800
It's gone. It is, yeah,

40
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,710
because it was loaded with like crank
and I remember it just makes your heart

41
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,460
pound but also had a downer so at the
same time so that you could fall asleep.

42
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,170
So I'd be like, but you can
breathe real easy. I don't know,

43
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,960
man. This guy, he's got to
figure it out. If you ask me,

44
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,670
I'm about an hour later when he fill it,

45
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:57,671
just kicking and smoke your weed done
and then go ahead and get horny and I

46
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:02,420
promise you it will be millions of times.

47
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,320
You'll be so blissfully horny
that you will not want to come.

48
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,670
Trust me,
it's gonna be restlessness.

49
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,350
If you take it really
late at night and you're,

50
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,130
and you wanted to just go to bed,

51
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,740
I don't do that will make you
have wrestle slaves and rubbish.

52
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,350
You'll wake up and you'll,
you'll,

53
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,410
it's not very pleasing what's going on
with laughing gas when he's out of his

54
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:29,814
sight.

55
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,650
Is he filming in his closet too?
But his pupils are super dilate

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,000
and he's like, he's giving you, I
like that he sold himself. You know,

57
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,390
this is how you do that.
The system,

58
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,470
you can tell he's really honed it over
the years. He's like, I used to do two,

59
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,200
three Benadryl and then four or five,
10 or 12 minutes ago,

60
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,330
God even come in the foil.
You got it. You know,

61
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,280
10 or 12 and then smoke your weed and
trust me there, you're going to be horny.

62
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,060
You're going to be all cranked up and then
you're going to want to bring it down.

63
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,720
Yeah. That's craziness, dude. It's a lot

64
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,010
better than an orgasm. I've been up
for like 48 hours straight before.

65
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm an underling weed. I'm a computer
watching girl. Women wrestling.

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,793
Yeah.

67
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,390
Sounds good. Yeah. Sounds like a
good time. Women's wrestling. Well,

68
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:33,720
and it's better than having the orgasm
cause he's saying you're not going to

69
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:36,900
come now he's saying you're not going
to want to because you're so blissfully

70
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:41,790
horny. So you're so, so enjoying the way
you feel that you won't want to end it.

71
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh, I see. You know,

72
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:47,590
you'll just want it to like keep riding
that wave and riding the snake. Yeah,

73
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,080
man. I'll kind of lives to, people
have, Huh? I don't know man.

74
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:55,680
It's a lot of free time.
It's a lot guess guys really worked out.

75
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,560
How do you feel by the way your,
your special has been well received.

76
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:01,100
It was pretty exciting.
Overwhelming.

77
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,550
It's overwhelming to have this
much approval. Like I legit,

78
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm not used to people liking anything.
You know what I mean? You just,

79
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,580
you slave away in obscurity for 14
years and then and you're just like,

80
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,810
it's fine. I can say what I want. No
one cares. And then one day or like, oh,

81
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,610
people care. It's great. It's amazing.
It's a special amaze. Thank you. Well,

82
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:27,110
without, without you, my jeans would
never be so tight or high and I, yeah,

83
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,080
because you're my love
hearing my support system.

84
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:34,190
You're my family or everything
without you. There is no gene.

85
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,350
There's two mommies and one
jeans. That's how it goes. Again,

86
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,450
if you haven't seen it,

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,480
it's called a shoes with them
and it's on Netflix right now.

88
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,600
I actually had the song in
my head over the weekend.

89
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,380
A lot of no lie a lot.
It's not a bad song.

90
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:55,790
I feel like it's not that bad.
I mean, he can take some work.

91
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,990
It needs work, but it's not
bad. It's pretty amazing. Yeah,

92
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,290
like I feel like if the right band
took it and actually reworked it,

93
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,400
it would be very good.

94
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,480
We'd have a number of submissions of
people that have reworked it, so I'm like,

95
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:13,150
God, it's pretty exciting. We also have
this email. Listen to the latest episode.

96
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,600
It was my way to work.
You guys suck.

97
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm walking around my office and machines
within machines within is stuck in my

98
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,380
head. I'm trying to focus at my computer
and machines within machines with.

99
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,930
It was like that juggle who tapped into
something inside of me. Megan stuff.

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,140
I agree. All right, Chris.

101
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,830
I was laying in bed last night and
you were supposed to be giving me head

102
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,461
scratchies,

103
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:38,810
which were inferior because I woke up
and my hair was not tangled and the whole

104
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:42,080
night I was going machines
with machines with this

105
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,360
whole fantasy about I had this,
I don't know, I do a lot of like,

106
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,410
you know Dimetapp Benadryl.
I do a lot of thinking.

107
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,510
I take like 10 or 12 Benadryl.
No,

108
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,930
but like you know like I'll come up
with jokes and stuff in the shower.

109
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,240
I always thinking the show this weekend,

110
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:05,600
him and I was on the road and I was
doing shows and then I was like machines

111
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:09,140
with the shower and I was like,
we should fly that guy out.

112
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,720
Bringing him to like a friend's
studio and like have a,

113
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,190
a real producer friend of mine
lay a beat and like film it.

114
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,800
And then one of my good friends who you
know is a music video director and a

115
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,500
video that was kind of be the most amazing
thing that ever happened to this man.

116
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,220
I think we should work on, you know, let's
find him. Does anyone know who he is?

117
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,040
Let's find him.
Do you have any contact yet?

118
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,350
Does anyone have contact for machines
within guy? Because I think that could be,

119
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,850
I think we need to make this happen.

120
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,580
We need to fly to La and we need to treat
him like a star and get his Korean do

121
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:45,940
machines within, you know? Yeah.

122
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,960
I think we could really do
something special with that.
But in the meantime, um,

123
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,010
some of our, you know, we are not a lot
of podcasts will claim, you know, they're

124
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,150
this and that. There are no,
there's no podcast in the world.

125
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,040
It has a better, uh, a
library and a better, uh,

126
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,810
musically inclined base than we do.
We have some of the songs, you know,

127
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:14,370
the songs that have come out of this show.
Some of them are incredible.

128
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,930
Like there's really talented
people making music. Anyways,

129
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,160
I actually was dreaming about
this too this weekend. I, I,

130
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,030
first of all thank you to everybody
and Arbor Indie and Northfield, Ohio,

131
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,340
Cleveland,

132
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,110
sold out shows really fun.
We just had the best time,

133
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,500
Josh Tyler and I. Yeah. And like,
we had great, great shows, man.

134
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:41,820
They were just great energy. Never knew
Ann Arbor was going to be like that.

135
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,110
Did you meet anybody
after the shower is like,

136
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,780
did you take any photos of people or is
that just something a personality Cham

137
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,330
does? Uh, yeah, I took photos with people.

138
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,470
What do you mean was I nights I've
been getting reports when I'm in,

139
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,860
I was in Saint Louis teds and, and
in the south. And people are like,

140
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,740
Tom's not a personality champion.
Doesn't really meet people.

141
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,960
What are you talking about right now?
Yeah.

142
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,570
You don't think I took photos with people.

143
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,420
Why would you even say
something like on the streets?

144
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,960
You're not friendly or not a
personality champion like I am what?

145
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,900
But everybody was like,
you're so much nicer than Tom.

146
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,120
At least can get with
your fucking twinsie here.

147
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,240
These are like three versions of the
same person as the Cleveland Indians,

148
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:25,710
baseball players right here. Oh my gosh.
Yeah. Play the game all at the same,

149
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,610
came to, came to the show.
KIPP Zimmer right here. We, um,

150
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
hung out after the show.
Super Nice guys. Cool.

151
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,613
MMM,

152
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,640
yeah, I took a, if you go to my
Instagram, okay, you're on the gram.

153
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm on the gram to the
gram and you do the,

154
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,620
uh,

155
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,270
you go there,
you can,

156
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,740
you can see all the pictures I
take with people they're posting,

157
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,500
but I have so many more
machines. Machines. All right.

158
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,790
So it's not a bad song. I
got slight distraction, but

159
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,253
MMM.

160
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,380
So here's just a few, but you can just
let me know. Let's see. This is a machine.

161
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,830
This is machines within featuring
Charro by DJ socks on to track.

162
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,220
Okay.
All right.

163
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,090
Here we go.
Here we go.

164
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,650
Yeah.

165
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,300
Got It.
Then

166
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,290
what she needs, but she enjoyed it. Then

167
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,510
change. But then she changed. But
then it's a different approach.

168
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,490
Yeah. Yeah. Cause here's the
thing, when I hear, I hear

169
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,110
you say that he used to go that way,
but so this was just someone's take on,

170
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,620
this is kind of an,
it's a chiller chiller,

171
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:25,340
but also kind of scary or vibe
because it had like an Airy,

172
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:28,190
like horror movie quality
to it. I thought, yeah, no,

173
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,630
Charlotte

174
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,890
going, you know what
I'm saying? Yeah, yeah.

175
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,300
60 k 16 it's kind of scary.
Yeah.

176
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,090
Yeah.
Shit.

177
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,380
Six Gene [inaudible] Dan,

178
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,300
Dan home to share files machines was then,

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,320
but I feel like something bad's about
that machine. These machines are,

180
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,530
this could have been in this decaria
movie, you know? Right, right.

181
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,630
Come on up on the house.

182
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,890
Was she injured but take
like shoot 16 Benadryl.

183
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,420
She sitting the shit on a song

184
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,690
we street. That's cool.

185
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,713
I like it.

186
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,780
Oh no street. I like, I was scared, but

187
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,753
then

188
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,280
really good. I mean it's so good. I
should have done this to mind people,

189
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:33,300
but like this is what their work.

190
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,050
Yeah. I'm trying to sing
my song, my song. Oh, okay.

191
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,110
Here we go. Here we go. Okay. I
have another beat down for you.

192
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:46,580
I try to practice talk just
in my own song. Just my
introduction to my song. Yeah.

193
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,690
Coming at Ya. Here we
go. I'll sing it. Okay.

194
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,750
Okay.

195
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,850
Machines wear thin machine.
They've got a gun and got again.

196
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,100
There's all that going on. Terminating
her gun. Yeah. Yeah. Machines.

197
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:01,660
But then the change was
then trying to wreck my rep,

198
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,000
trying to make my rep talk
to someone with the flow,

199
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,100
trying to practice on my floor.
Sharing with them machines was cheese.

200
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,230
That's it.
Hearing my on the street.

201
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,070
I don't care if I f f the
hitters Fr the haters.

202
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,800
Waze say fuck though.
It's good. It's good.

203
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,800
Just needed a producer dude.
Change was then,

204
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,730

205
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,320

209
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:51,830
It's amazing what people can do. So this
is machines within coming up here by

210
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,630
Equis. Yeah. Okay.

211
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:57,180
So this is another version
of machines within yeah,

212
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,510
a different take and um, yeah, just, yeah.

213
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,970
Mastodon.
It's also kind of chiller vibe,

214
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:07,804
right?
Yeah.

215
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:12,520
Okay.

216

Machines with

218
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,633
shoes,

219
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,020
with our students with churn rate my rate,

220
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,780
which would make hour chunk,
chunk.

221
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Here we go. Here we go again.
Here's my song. Yeah. Gotcha.

00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,510
She 16 popping out a week.

225
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,210
Terminators, wheat chunks.

226
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,100

They got the gun and got again?
Yeah. Got It. Just mission.

228
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,813
Yeah.
Machines

229
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,830
again. What's t 16? I don't know.
I don't know what he's doing.

230
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,070
Like guns.
I don't know what he's doing.

231
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,110
Uh Oh, I just remembered, by the way,

232
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,110
that's true because I had mentioned where
it was weekend I went to this place in

233
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:38,700
Ann Arbor called Frieda's. Bodas
Cubans. Not True. Yeah, he does.

234
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,450
Does, yeah. I swear to you.
A toddler restaurant? No.

235
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,350
What do they serve?
Their Brito Bandido um,

236
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,850
I think it ain't all bad
needle. What's it called? Uh,

237
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,370
that's Beavis is restaurant. What's it
called? Freedom by Tito. Sorry? I said,

238
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,570
yeah, I went here. Frieda,

239
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,360
but Tito's Cuban inspired street food.

240
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,200
Oh Man. Diarrhea to I, it
was so good, man. Well,

241
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,000
I looks, look fried egg on top.
Whatever your freedom. Anyways, uh,

242
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,300
one of the guys working there listens
to our podcast. Palm gas. Yeah,

243
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,660
this is our podcast, so you're
kidding. He, um, you know,

244
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:26,540
I ordered the Burger and the egg
and everything, but you know,

245
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,920
I was trying, I didn't eat, I was like,
I'm not gonna eat the Bun, you know,

246
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:31,290
that kind of shit. Right. Like when you're
like, you're doing your primal shit.

247
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah. Just trying to split
fucker. Anyways, so they, you
know, I didn't know that he,

248
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,660
he didn't say anything at first.

249
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,400
So I order and then I had a little
side salad and then a server comes out.

250
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:45,810
It was Tom and I go, yeah. And
he goes, here's your, um, uh,

251
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,980
Judas, you're fried us, like
with sugar and sauce to dip

252
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,520
it in. I go, uh, I didn't, I
definitely didn't order that man.

253
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,720
And then the guy goes to the palm guys,
I thought you would like to try it.

254
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,710
And then I was like, oh, that's very
nice to you. And then Josh Potter,

255
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:04,620
who's with me, I was like,
you know, I didn't order this,

256
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:08,880
but I'm not turning this down.
I just dove in.

257
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,940
It was one of the best fucking things
I've ever hot. Little Chucho Bites,

258
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,000
Hubbard and sugar and then a chocolate,
a hot chocolate dipping sauce.

259
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,883
I was,

260
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,130
I had cramps for 36 hours after
we ate it and we had bites.

261
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,780
We had, we both had cramps. I was
like, I gotta feel good. Later.

262
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,560
He goes,
well you ate just spoonfuls of sugar.

263
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,900
Like it wasn't like sweet.
It's like covered. Yeah.

264
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,720
It's one of the best fucking thing. You're
saying it wrong. It's just true. Right,

265
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,070
right. It's how you eat a Chiro
dude. It's just a Mexican pastry.

266
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,710
But their Spanish, sorry, this was the
Cuban joint. But yeah, in Spain, right.

267
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,690
I don't think there Spain,
Spanish from Spain.

268
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,260
I watched the great British baking show
and they look it up to those are from

269
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,280
Spain again.
Maybe you're right,

270
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:06,630
cause they go this week we're
doing Spanish. She rose.

271
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:09,060
Of course they can't say
shit right on on that show.

272
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,190
Spanish churros and they did the same
thing where they all had to do variations

273
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:17,370
on the Chiro shoe role.
Let's see,

274
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:21,750
a Trudeau or traditional, you're
right, you're totally right.

275
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,670
For once in my life. I'm right on
the fucking show. Fried though.

276
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,510
Fried dough.
It's fried dough and it comes out hot.

277
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,030
Don't forget that there is based,
you know what it is?

278
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,400
It's basically a version of a donut.
Right?

279
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,490
But they're covered in sugar and then
the new shit is they give you a sauce to

280
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:45,540
dip it in the restaurant. It's like
how we added Bacon to Brussels sprouts.

281
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,600
This generation,
everyone's dip in that shit and Charlotte,

282
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,950
can I tell you the best place to get a
tro to get your life all verus street in

283
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:57,800
Los Angeles, but on all Vera Street, one
of those vendors. I mean that's what's up.

284
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,520
They're all over Latin America now.

285
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,010
Anytime there's fried dough that
it's the best. Now in Hungary,

286
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,760
their version of the Chiro
is called [inaudible] and
it's only in the summertime.

287
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:12,150
You can get it and it's deep fried dough,
but then they put butter,

288
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,610
garlic, sour cream and sprinkle
some cheese on that bitch.

289
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,990
Get your, it is so good. It
looks like they said there's,

290
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,230
they don't know the origin of the story,

291
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,560
but they think that maybe the Portuguese
brought it to Europe from China,

292
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,700
China, so that the Chinese maybe have,
well they do because they have before.

293
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,100
I'll tell you I know this. When I did
it, the Chinese guy, Chinese breakfast,

294
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,960
they do a fried donut with
like a soy milk, warm,

295
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,950
warm milk. Another theory, your donut.

296
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,480
The Trudeau was made by Spanish shepherds
to substitute for fresh bakery goods.

297
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,990
Judo pace was easy to make.
And then of course,

298
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:58,900
I guess they brought it all to Latin
America because now you find it.

299
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,710
It says you find it in Peru,
Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala.
So now it's everywhere.

300
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,850
Look at us and our knowledge and our
knowledge. Okay. Back to machines.

301
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,600
Within machines with machines with,

302
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,670
so this is must jeans.

303
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,590
Yes. Most genes within, listen name,

304
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,860
Benny Harper was listening again. If,
uh, if you need a reminder of what we're,

305
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:25,290
what we're going off of here,
it's just just

306
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,270
their shoes with them.
Machines with 10. That's it.

307
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,000
That's all these guys had to
work with. Maze. Here we go.

308
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,000
I must genes within chair.

309
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,930
We're on the right track.

310
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,930
I actually, I don't think
it's bad. Cut Him off.

311
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,363
Wow.

312
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,310
Crazy.
Walking down the streets,

313
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,230
walking down the streets,
walking down

314
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,643
the streets.

315
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,220
Yeah.
Wow.

316
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,950
Yeah.

317
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,160
Pretty good man.
You know that we have your mom's house.

318
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:07,740
We have fans that are actual real like
famous musicians that listen to this.

319
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:12,190
Yeah. We have a few. I would, I challenge
those guys if anyone's got some fruit.

320
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,030
I would love to see someone do machines,

321
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,730
machines within. Man,
that was really good.

322
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,270
Yeah. I feel like Metallica and
if they could cover it would be,

323
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,650
you know what I mean? Oh
yeah. I mean they could go,

324
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,480
I feel like they could come out with
a completely an ironic, that's what,

325
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,560
that's the thing. Here's, and their fan
base would be like, what's Jane's? Yes.

326
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,440
Because me the phrase machines within
his fucking really dope actually like,

327
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,050
oh, that's kind of deep and like, what is,
Oh yeah, I do something with a man. You,

328
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,590
the societal structures, whatever the
fuck that means. Sure. A lot going on.

329
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Last,
uh,

330
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,370
last week you also were a scenes
with Joe Rogan's podcast was

331
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,690
what does Mommy's mean?
It was,

332
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:09,660
it was awesome. It's the first time
I ever did the show without you.

333
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,000
So it felt a little bit like,
you know,

334
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:17,001
on Seinfeld when Elaine would hang
out with George without Jerry.

335
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,770
So at the beginning I was like,
how, how's this? What I mean?

336
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:22,170
I've obviously everybody
call you guys jeans.

337
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,510
We had a great time.
Uh,

338
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,500
Joe is such an easy person to hang out
with and he's one of the most wonderful,

339
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,800
sweetest, which one's the
genes, funniest humans.

340
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,940
And we had such a great time. We had a
really good time. We talked so much shit.

341
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,130
Isn't that crazy by the way?
That literally,

342
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:44,110
I don't know if people
totally understand this,

343
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,140
but doing his podcast to promote your
special is more effective and bigger than

344
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:54,550
doing like a late night.

345
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,360
I know it's so many more
people listen to it.

346
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,390
It is bananas because I'm,
you know,

347
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,740
Netflix is having me possibly do those
circuits too. And it's like, okay.

348
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,150
But the truth of it is, the glamour is
though. That's the one people go, wow,

349
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:11,170
you made it under that.

350
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,330
But the ears and the
focus is in the podcast,

351
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:17,190
podcast world.

352
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,280
I've been getting so many tweets from
people that Joe Rogan referred me to the

353
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,143
special and,

354
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,230
and now it's like I'm very appreciative
to Joe for having me on as usual.

355
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:32,110
Very appreciative.
Mommies put your jeans up high and tight.

356
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,560
He's the sweetness.

357
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,763
Um,

358
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,750
so we had the guide obviously tell us
to take our bandage rolls and how many

359
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,160
have a 12, 10 to 12 and then when
it kicks in dense, smoke your weed.

360
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,740
Okay. Wait, let's, let's
go through it. Seriously.

361
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,730
You know what I realized
about sober October? Yeah.

362
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,800
Cause I'm going to go to hot yoga
here in a little while is um,

363
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,830
drinking and stuff is so much,

364
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,980
not a part of my regular routine that
I could accidentally slip probably more

365
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:10,300
than anybody else.
In other words,

366
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,510
I put so little thinking and attention
into like getting a drink that I'm the

367
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:20,080
one that could easily,
I feel like,

368
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:23,290
I mean we're already halfway through the
month, but easily someone could be like,

369
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,420
oh hey I got your beer.
And I'd be like, oh, okay.

370
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,770
Yeah cause you don't think about
it. Yeah, I don't think about it.

371
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,860
Like I posted a joke this
weekend after a show,

372
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,470
a potter and I went to a hotel bar and
I ordered a coffee and he ordered a

373
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:43,810
bourbon and I was like, Oh I think I'm
going to break. You can do it. And I,

374
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,610
you know, I drank my coffee, but yeah.
Well alcohol's not a big deal for you.

375
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,510
Getting high is not a big
deal for, you know, I know
that's what he was like, yeah,

376
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:54,330
but you're, you're not sober cause
you're eating, you're drinking coffee.

377
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,650
I was like, first of all, it was
decaf straight cause it was like 1130.

378
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:03,180
I ordered a cup of decaf just to
have it crank of something. But, um,

379
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,840
that definitely was not part of
our arrangement was like caffeine,

380
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,130
which I did by the way.

381
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,110
I did do no coffee for the last 10
days of the weight loss challenge.

382
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,930
That sucks so bad. I mean,
I mean, you're not Mormon.

383
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,390
This isn't the no, I know. I
don't want to do that shit man.

384
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,520
Caffeine isn't that bad for you. Yeah. I
feel like I couldn't live without coffee.

385
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,080
It's my, that is my one thing for
sure. Yeah. I can't go without love it.

386
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,930
I love coffee too.
We have a toddler.

387
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,440
How do you get through having young
children without drinking coffee? Yeah,

388
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,700
I dunno. It's fucking nuts. Nuts.
So, but, but Joe's off the weed.

389
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,840
He uh, he didn't do it. I mean, he,
he, people thought he was smoking weed,

390
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:49,610
but he's not, he's not smoking. No, no,
he's fine. He seemed totally, totally.

391
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,730
He's like, it's not party. Also, a lot of
these things were not hard for everybody.

392
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:57,840
For you too. Now there's two other people
in this challenge who are not thrilled.

393
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,280
This actually is much more
of a challenge for Aerie.

394
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,920
Bart,
they are there.

395
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:09,030
I can tell like I think Ari's
more troubled or bothered.

396
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,880
Well definitely by not smoking weed.
He's a really heavy weed

397
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,130
smoker. Smokes weed every day.
So that's definitely a challenge.

398
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,360
He hates the idea of going to this class
just because it's an inconvenience,

399
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,110
which I can say I totally understand
it is a major inconvenience.

400
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:33,060
Like where could we end this podcast right
now where we could be doing it later.

401
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,240
But I have this and I have a meeting and
I'm trying to fit hot yoga either like

402
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,450
I can go either before the meeting or
after. I'd much rather get it in before.

403
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,990
So after my meeting I can
come home because if I don't
then I have to go from a

404
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,340
meeting to hot yoga and then
I'm home fucking you know,

405
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,730
super late tonight. Well cause you
guys are also doing 90 minute class,

406
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,120
90 fucking minute classes and 15 of them.

407
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,560
It's a lot of time commitment especially
because you're not just going for 90

408
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:05,190
you have to drive there exactly what
to get your shit together. Go. Yes.

409
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,760
Now how sweaty do your nuts
get? It's an, I'm just actually,

410
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,980
it's when I'm done with class, it's
like I just got out of a pool. Yeah.

411
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,440
It's just I'm completely soaked.
Do you smell other people? No.

412
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,060
People are pretty decent,
you know,

413
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:22,070
I think they show up clean
and you're not right.

414
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,060
You don't smell people.
I think also because like the smell,

415
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:30,540
someone would be either they're dirty
when they got there or you'd be hanging

416
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,370
out there way out.
You know what I mean?

417
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,600
Like you wouldn't smell right away and
less like one of the teachers one time

418
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:39,890
pointed out like, Hey, if
you're coming to this class, uh,

419
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,720
you like a bunch of before, you're
going to fuck with people. Like,

420
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,410
so don't do that.
So it would be a jerk.

421
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,970
Don't be a jerk to take 10 to 12
Benadryl and then take this class.

422
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,070
It's super hard and see if your heart
just explodes. Yeah. Horny. I am

423
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,220
how Horny I am in Canada now I have to
tell you that I used to take yoga in

424
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:05,370
Santa Monica. Yeah. Like
a million years ago.

425
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,770
And I always noticed that the men,

426
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,770
there's really not great
yoga attire for men.

427
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,710
Like the women have all the accessorizing.
So all dudes are in Speedo, right?

428
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,440
Like it's,
it's a bad fashion.

429
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,020
They just haven't really
marketed it for men enough.

430
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,920
So I remember standing
behind certain gentlemen, um,

431
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,810
when they would do the pose where you,

432
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,240
you got one leg on the floor and then
one leg goes back and up towards the,

433
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,750
he's amazed, right jasmine? Yeah.
W where your leg goes back. So,

434
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,700
you know what I'm saying? So one
leg back, one laying on the floor.

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,350
And I remember seeing countless
nuts. Yeah, countless balls.

436
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,010
And it's funny the first time.
And then you're like, really?

437
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,400
Like you can't cover your nuts
for this class. Like, you know,

438
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,810
balls are a, yeah, I'm
lucky I haven't seen balls.

439
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,790
I've seen some weird dudes.

440
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,650
And then there was one day where these two
guys, I was like, well look, I was like,

441
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,940
the fuck is up with these guys.

442
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:03,020
And then it hit me that they were like
developmentally disabled guys. Oh.

443
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,190
And because they were doing like goofy
faces and they were acting goofy,

444
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:11,450
like they were just acting weird. And
then I was like, oh, I think they're like,

445
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:14,420
maybe the bus brings him here, you
know, as part of a program or something.

446
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,650
And I also noticed that the teacher
never like the teacher will um,

447
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,840
tell, you know, tell
people like our Laura,

448
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,330
you got to keep that
left shoulder aligned.

449
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,040
Tom Tried to roll forward further on
your head, feet stay on the ground.

450
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,520
But these two he never addressed.
And I'm like,

451
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,930
why isn't he addressing
these two goofballs? And then
I realized that like, Oh,

452
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:42,440
I think they're special. You
know yoga. Yeah, they were,

453
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,020
they were kind and one of
them farted and yeah. Yeah.

454
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,940
And then one of them like was just
playing with his shorts and like,

455
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,020
and then one of them just stayed on the
ground and wasn't really doing poses.

456
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:56,750
And I'm like, why aren't you like
as if somebody else, you know,

457
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,470
I reached for water ones,
not a water break, Tom. And I
was like, okay. So it's like,

458
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,560
why are you not addressing these
two guys? And then I realized, oh,

459
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,990
and one of them showed up in Khakis and
a button down shirt and dress socks and

460
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:12,920
we were all like, ah, fuck.
Because it's, you know,

461
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:15,070
it's 104 degrees in there.
Yeah.

462
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,870
And then he left and came back
and pajamas and I was like,

463
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,890
I dunno what's going on with this guy.
Like thick pajamas? No, like regular,

464
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:25,840
but like still no one addressed him.
Yeah.

465
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,120
So that's what you do though, right?
Give him a pass. Somebody of course.

466
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:32,960
But I was like, at first I was just
like, what is up with these guys man?

467
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,800
You can't really chastise them, you
know? No, of course not. No, no, no.

468
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,080
So they farted somebody farther.
Yeah, one of the guys farted.

469
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,950
Did you laugh? Of course. But I
kind of kept to myself. You know,

470
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,070
there's this like culture in,

471
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:52,610
in big room where there's not a lot of
laughing. There's no, it's all pretty,

472
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,473
you have to,
you know,

473
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,030
you don't really get that much
out of it if you're not focused.

474
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:58,750
So people don't have a
beak crumb. Oh, okay. Big.

475
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,630
There's not a lot of goofing off. Yeah.
That's so funny. Most of my peers,

476
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,700
often there is with was when a is
when Burt's next to me, you know,

477
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,640
like sometimes. Yeah, sometimes,
uh, you know, we'll do that.

478
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,110
I forget the plane pose where like
your arms are straight out next to you,

479
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,253
you know,

480
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,220
and then your and your legs are straight
back and I'll reach over and I'll just

481
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:21,710
like touch his arm or touch his hand
and he'll be like, he'll be like,

482
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,880
well then I'll just,
you know,

483
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,030
I pay attention to where the teacher
is and I do like little goofy shit like

484
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,750
that, but it's pretty serious. Wow. Yeah.

485
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,410
Have you had any enlightenment thoughts?
No,

486
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:40,100
not super enlightenment, but I do, I
do say it. I mean you definitely there.

487
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,130
There's some times you get emotional
and certain poses, which is weird.

488
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:46,370
It's interesting. And I do think, um,

489
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,460
you have amazing clarity at the
end of class. You know, if you go,

490
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,980
when you get through a whole
class, you're laying there, you um,

491
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,800
your mind feels very clear.
It's like you can make,

492
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,630
if you had to like make a big decision,

493
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,590
I would go to one of those classes and
think about it afterwards. Interesting.

494
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,430
I like that. That's exciting. Yeah,
it's good. It's good. I mean, I do,

495
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,910
I do see the benefit.
The only part that sucks is with the bet.

496
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,530
It's like you're just having like, you
know, my week is crazy this week. Yeah.

497
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:15,980
Right.

498
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,340
I sent you my schedule because I have to
go to all these meetings and it's like

499
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,820
I'm trying to figure out how to fit in
all these goddamn sessions. You know,

500
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,130
it's the time commitment. The time. It's
not like you can do it at home either. No.

501
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:31,630
You gotta go to the class. That's the
tough part. Yeah. Well you're all,

502
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:36,260
you're halfway through it. Right. If
I go to today, what I'm going, um,

503
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,160
will be numbers seven and
then I can't go tomorrow,

504
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,250
but I'm going to try to go
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

505
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,790
I'm going to try to go three days
in a row, two to tack on a few more.

506
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,870
And at that point I'll only
have five to do, but I'll have,

507
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,960
I'll have enough days to hit
them now at the end of the class,

508
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:58,961
did they hand out some rings and
like bracelets are such weird guys.

509
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:02,600
And the guys are all weird.
The girls are weird girls.

510
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,510
Definitely weird girls.
But there's some normal girls.

511
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,880
Most of the dudes are odd.
Yeah. Yeah. They're awkward guy.

512
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,380
Man Bonds. There's a couple of
man button guys. Um, couple. Yeah.

513
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:19,760
Wristband, leather wristband guys.
All the leather cough, you know,

514
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,990
couple just Petrouli salesman,
you know, just weird dudes.

515
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,470
Weird Sharman guys. Um, come hugs.

516
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,630
There's no dude's where you're like,

517
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,600
like there's not a guy in there or I could
be like, you see the game last night?

518
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,960
Cause they'd be like, what game are
we talking about? The game of life.

519
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,860
I mean like, I don't
know. Would they will say

520
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,870
nobody looks like they watch
the game is all [inaudible].

521
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,400
All the guys like the God,
his twin activator guy for this.

522
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:47,100
A patch of the students. Yeah.
Some of the instructors are God,

523
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:50,610
his twin activators. Yeah. Or like I
can teach you how to come hug and yeah,

524
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,320
a lot of Vegan Vagina dudes and
now the girls are weird. How,

525
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,260
what's their style? There's
a couple like, you know,

526
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:03,150
the girl with like the third I think on
her forehead she wears like a Bindi or

527
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,900
something here. Yeah. Like a sticker,

528
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:11,700
a sticker like hardcore Vegan lifestyle,
you know,

529
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,330
just like real grungy of the
earth. Weird in that sense. Yeah.

530
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,270
Real spiritual where you're like,
Oh god,

531
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,550
you'd be unbearable to talk
to. Um, and then there's,

532
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,940
oh no, there's like some sweet older
ladies, so you know, like go into there,

533
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,290
you could tell like they're,

534
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,410
they're enlightened in life with age
right there, like wise kind of cool.

535
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,720
Some of them seem like they're
cool older ladies. Yeah. Um,

536
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,510
I mean you're definitely not getting
like a party girl vibe in Beek rum.

537
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:47,050
It's not like the class of Beckerman get
wasted after now. There's none of those.

538
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:49,820
There's nothing like
that in there. Sure. Um,

539
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,200
couple of Rehab checks for sure.

540
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:55,380
You can tell this is like part of
getting their life back together. Sure.

541
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,610
You could tell you like you partied hard
before. There's definitely some of that,

542
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,240
you know? That's cool.
Yeah, so that's good. Rob.

543
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,990
Rob. Oh Man. What if you started
doing that during be chrome? Well,

544
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,780
especially if you, the professor,
the on the Thailand Penis.

545
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:18,180
I'm like lamb penis was land is
exactly where I want to do it. You Know

546
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,270
Rob, rob, I wish, I wish you
had some advice for, for women.

547
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,900
I feel like it's very penile.
I cannot believe you just said that.

548
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,090
For people that don't listen
to this show regularly,

549
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,480
Christina doesn't get the folders.

550
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,690
She doesn't get these
clips they're sent to me.

551
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,200
And then if I want her to
see one of ahead of time,

552
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,810
I sent her to them so that she knows.

553
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,310
But otherwise the whole fun
is to play clips and surprise.

554
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,630
Christina upset me. Yeah.
And now he has female advice.

555
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,420
See, I know I'm on the same
wavelength. I feel like I entered.

556
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,960
I feel like I know this guy.
Yeah. Here's the rub up.

557
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:02,640
Guy has tons of rubbing ticks for women.
Isn't that great?

558
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,290
That is a nasty, I'm not even sure.
I want to hear you want to hear it?

559
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,250
Ah, so we have God. Okay.

560
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,470
We have the One lady to practicing
in the vagina because the vagina,

561
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,450
the vulva, the vagina.
When you're too loose,

562
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,970
especially with the delay,
they have baby.

563
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,690
Right. That's kind of
my problem. We about it.

564
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:30,860
And you see there were done. It's small,
right? When the baby has this big,

565
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,690
yeah. Yeah. After that
it's very loose. Right?

566
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,580
So you got loose posters.
When he's talking to this baby comes out,

567
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,710
you got to lose puss.
So then what?

568
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,240
So when they make less before them,
when they,

569
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:49,750
before they had baby, they
make lovely. So amazing.

570
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,680
So after that baby,
when they put the penis in,

571
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,910
the men put the penis in his hand
and I in or out because to lose,

572
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,773
they don't feel it.

573
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,850
I love his face.
Am I in or out to loose?

574
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,180
After we were like, am I in? Oh No,

575
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,170
you have to lose those
fucking no. A bear trap. Yeah,

576
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,220
it's a snug little.
It's like you got,

577
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,250
it's like you've got a little
mouse in there going, all right,

578
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,230
well we have to practice the regimen. The
exercise, we call it exercise, exercise.

579
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,300
It gets up for the
strengthening the vagina,

580
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,340
give him an egg and they'd practice
like clenched down on the leg.

581
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,180
You put the Shit Eric,

582
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,153
the Shag,

583
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,290
you should again, your pussy cover
the egg and shit and you put it,

584
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,500
you put that shit ain't shit egg.

585
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,060
You cover your egg and shit.

586
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,360
Pete Godfrey and the way we teach the
people in the workshop how to do exercise

587
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,500
when Barton, because a
woman, when this was done,

588
00:39:55,501 --> 00:40:00,420
our loose the fest or wrinkle,
but this one type the first time,

589
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,413
how does that work?

590
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:06,940
That was the best, but he was like,
how does that work? But it makes sense.

591
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,870
Your face shutters as he asked
that question, watch Brian

592
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,790
all wrinkled, but this one tight,
the face tighter. How does that work?

593
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,610
Yeah. You stupid. Fuck.
Yeah, right. That's true.

594
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,660
That's a good question.

595
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,120
So what he's suggesting is you
take your shit covered egg.

596
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,220
You put it in your posts. When you're
pushed tightens, your face tightens. Oh,

597
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:32,160
I see. I don't know how that
works. It's all connected.

598
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:36,210
Your Vagina is the same as your face.
God dammit.

599
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,970
Free episode. Every
episode. Every damn time.

600
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,560
Uh Huh.

601
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,460
Because when you lose,
you lose.

602
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,530
Our life was all leak out because I have
flow or lie a big door in the window or

603
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:57,560
your door is leaking all the
heat out and look at week.

604
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,040
Ah, see that's why I'm so cold
all the time. My door's open,

605
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:07,060
my leaky doors,
energy door is open.

606
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,160
If you tighten your posts door
tight,

607
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,930
where do I get this shit? Egg? Is he
selling those at the seminar? We gotta go.

608
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,160
I gotta pay for this. We have video of
him talking about massage your testicles.

609
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,300
Rabie Dick 350 times and now
shove eggs in your pussy.

610
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,760
I really would love to
watch him make love to you.

611
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:32,560
I think it's amazing experience. I
is so nasty. I mean, it's different.

612
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,394
It's not like,

613
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,220
it wouldn't be like one of those hammer
like pornos where it's like some guy

614
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:41,110
like gorilla pounding you.
This guy would like really enlightening.

615
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,290
I think every year you're always hung
up on this technique stuff as if that

616
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:48,530
negates the fact that he is not like,
you know.

617
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
You ever watch that show
Battlestar Galactica? No. Backend.

618
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,700
What's a show that had sleeves stacks on
there? They're constantly stacks. Well,

619
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,920
the guy looks like a sleeve stag and I
can't get over it. Call me superficial.

620
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,660
Just close your eyes. But he let him say
you to a wonderland. They crept bid. Yeah,

621
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:08,240
but you the dollar. The concerned
about reduce the machine. You have to,

622
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,530
when a play that, again, I was understand
what he just said. The mental, mental,

623
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,930
mental already concerned about reduce
the medication. You have to reduce the,

624
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,700
reduce the menstrual cups,
reduced what? The Mentor, Mentor,

625
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,680
Mentor three men. Preregistration.
[inaudible] leaking comas.

626
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,560
Energy. Got To reduce my
menstruation. Yeah. How do I do that?

627
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,041
Here you go.

628
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:35,960
What will reduce the amount of dumb
reducing is the massaging the breast.

629
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,810
There you go.
Every month.

630
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,810
A woman wanted to have
baby or not have baby.

631
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,400
The body producing that every man.
Right.

632
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,910
And in a moment of producing the body
had to pee pee entity to make milk.

633
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,240
Right, right. Wait a
minute to make the milk,

634
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,730
but you only make the
milk if you have the baby.

635
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,060
He's not an understanding how this works.
You don't make milk producing the egg

636
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,220
guy. He's got his science
wrong. I don't know.

637
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,150
So I have to hold on in order
to reduce my menstrual flow,

638
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,010
to keep my energy,

639
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,190
I have to rub my breasts during and
put it on and put an egg in my book.

640
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,330
This isn't going to be a full time job.
So big time commitment.

641
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,040
Yes.
So

642
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,680
who is so book? Uh, I know, right?

643
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:37,681
It's great when these loose
the face Aringo right?

644
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,370
Yep. But see how nice and
wrinkle free my phases. Yeah.

645
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,710
You look like you have a tight pussy.

646
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,700
That's how you can tell
who's machine is like, yes.

647
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,410
That's a whole new way of
thinking about it. Yeah.

648
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,700
Actually that'll never leave my mind again
because it'd be like every time I see

649
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:55,210
a wrinkle face, I'm going to be like, God,
tighten your posts up. Your door's open.

650
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,690
Yeah. All the energy is leaking
out of your box right now.

651
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,980
Tighten your dog your door and then your
face will get nice and they'll be like,

652
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:06,790
what? You should bring this
up at yoga today. Yeah.

653
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,720
Especially if I see a wrinkled lady.
I'm telling you though, if this guy,

654
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:12,610
let's put this way,

655
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,630
if I took his technique and I was looking
at nice blonde lady teaching this shit

656
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:19,890
to people, I can get on like the
today show and be like, ladies, yeah,

657
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,150
you want to fix those wrinkles.
It's totally,

658
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:25,480
you got to tighten your visual with him.
They're just like, it's this a jerk off.

659
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,870
It's all about the packaging.
Yeah.

660
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,410
I feel like we've talked
about that with jokes.

661
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,190
It's like bits work from
certain sources. Sure. You know,

662
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:39,870
of course you got to from a
certain person, they can't.
I mean they can say it,

663
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:43,140
but it's not going to have the same
impact. Absolutely. Absolutely.

664
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,900
It's all about the shell, the
shell, your end. Definitely.

665
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,440
But I feel like I could turn that into
a seminar and really make a living.

666
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:49,951
Go do it.

667
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:53,990
Go make $1 billion getting women's
wrinkles go away and then you have that,

668
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,180
you know people so want the wrinkles go
away. That right away they'd be like,

669
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,720
I see them. Some of my wrinkles are
gone. And you'd have people testimonies.

670
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:05,721
Like I went to Christina's loose puss
seminar and I had wrinkles and now some of

671
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:10,170
them went away cause my pussy
is tied again like that.

672
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,840
We could sell those eggs till
yeah you have your Shit, Egg shed,

673
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,170
ag dip and Shit and put,

674
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,450
I mean he doesn't talk about Ken.
An egg just break in your box.

675
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,010
Theoretically when you squeeze an
egg on all sides, it doesn't break.

676
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,140
You have to have like a ring
on or something sweet like
you did in science class.

677
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:33,630
Right. As a kid, I don't think he means,

678
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,550
I hope he's not meaning a literal ag
that you would eat but like something in

679
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,740
the shape of one like one of Lj Zags.
Yeah.

680
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,820
Like a fan or son lives.

681
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,010
That's a big thing to put up
there to PR. I mean, Jeez Dude,

682
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,150
I dunno. He didn't know what the hell
he's talking about. Uh, bullshit.

683
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,010
He doesn't always talk.
We've been doing this for like 40 years.

684
00:45:56,011 --> 00:46:00,620
He knows what he's talking about.
So when the lady, when when they,

685
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,780
when the egg mature the on up a lot and
he now when he's stuck and you don't

686
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,820
Trump don't do anything with it,

687
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,860
it become lamb and lump become
Puma and they become, we'll call.

688
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:18,690
I said, ah, he's just
sold breast cancer. Damn.

689
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:19,590
I didn't realize

690
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,120
I miss command, which she been
up to. I wonder. I don't know.

691
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,500
Do you remember we had the,
didn't we have that Kim in Mashup,

692
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,280
right?
Yeah.

693
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,770
She's like with what's the
rub rub guy and man together,

694
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,830

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,530

but dyna fat fat in this lovely house.

699
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,860
And when she said that, when she fell on
her porn, she goes, we are here today.

700
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,331
I liked that.

701
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:08,331
She did this lovely house
and I have to paint his dad.

702
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,140
I liked that we had,
um,

703
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,370
the Kim in the sheet,

704
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:21,300
he did a 60 plus MILF 60 process meal,

705
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:26,890
uh, PC, like a clean version. Right.
Then she did the hardcore version. Right.

706
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,120
She did the Youtube version so it
wouldn't get flagged. Yeah. Like the,

707
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,440
the advertisement for it. I Dunno why
they make them do too well to Lauryn,

708
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:39,880
the perverts on you tube I guess.
And then the real one is on the website.

709
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:44,230
That makes sense. Yeah. You want to get
you casting the net for all the pervs.

710
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,630
Yeah. You gotta have, you
gotta have them all there.

711
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,263
How'd you say,

712
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,590
and I'm here to film at,

713
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,240
this is such a beautiful,
um,

714
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:01,510
we CD with the first time
of ever experience in my
life with two young men and

715
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:10,050
they had big heart car.

716
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:15,180
This is the hardcore version.
Pluralize Mark Cox plural,

717
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,260
really quaint place.
Quiet place is really,

718
00:48:19,261 --> 00:48:23,460
really comfortable with
a lot of art effects. Oh,

719
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:25,140
side of the house as well as elsewhere.

720
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:30,120
People are looking at anything else
really, really comfortable being outside,

721
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,580
especially with the two gentlemen
who really tweaked me very special.

722
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,830
Oh my ultimate goal is to
really get them to be really,

723
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:50,301
really hot and I feel that [inaudible]
Kim Allen on a lot to offer.

724
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,530
Yeah. Oh you do though?
It's my first time.

725
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,290
I was a little bit shaking.
Yeah. Do you think would be

726
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,640
worse?
That makes you shake?

727
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:06,070
It'd be harder for me to be with Kim
on or for you to be with this guy.

728
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,250
Oh, you would be key. You
would destroy him on why?

729
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,330
I feel like you would like her
cause she so she looks great.

730
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:18,150
She looks better than me.
Nobody was fit. Come on man. No,

731
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,180
you'd be, you'd be fine. He, this guy's
a troll. Command's got her shit together.

732
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:24,450
At least you think I could
make love to Kennedy.

733
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,600
You would make sweet love to came on.
I think I'd be way too gentle for her.

734
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,100
She'd be like, you don't pound
crowd then pow. I was like,

735
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,840
I'm sorry. You don't
want to hurt it. What?

736
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,620
Oh,
has house asking for attention.

737
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,140
She would let you put it in her butthole.
Oh, that would be like first move. Yeah.

738
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,180
She'd be like,
why are you doing with that?

739
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,860
Push right in there and get
back their peg, get back.

740
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,123
I go with it.

741
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,390
And really satisfying.

742
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,500
It's satisfying like my whole body with
my whole body because they're so nice.

743
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,830
Yeah. She's sweet lady
actually. Do you think so? Yeah.

744
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,920
And Save beautiful words. I feel like, um,

745
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:15,030
there are beautiful words
and I feel experience and,

746
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,873
and I,

747
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,840
I was so hot for them especially,
um,

748
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,340
on the scene that they
put their hard copy.

749
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,980
I mean to my asshole.
There it is.

750
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,050
I was so ready to come.

751
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,530
I feel like it's weird
that cause she's so,

752
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:40,610
she doesn't speak like she's ever seen
porn before. I know. It's like, do you,

753
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,430
have you seen the stuff that
you're filming? You know what,

754
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,120
that's a really interesting point.
And I think maybe not. Yeah.

755
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,470
I think what this is for her,

756
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,400
I really think she's one of
these people who at 60 was like,

757
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:56,450
I want a new experience.
Yeah. And heard about like,

758
00:50:56,451 --> 00:51:00,200
well you can film it. And do all these
crazy things and she went for it.

759
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,990
I don't think she had like years of
watching it and knowing about it. No, no.

760
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,900
I think there's such a naive a tay there.
Cause usually it's the guys being like,

761
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,940
what am I doing today?
And then girls like,

762
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,360
well I'm going to spread my pussy and
these guys are going to come in my mouth.

763
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,940
And you know, they know the jargon. Yeah,

764
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,500
no she doesn't know this is really her
sexual lingo, liberation or whatever,

765
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:25,370
you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:28,670
It's usually a guy. Well you had that
clip playing the other day. We were like,

767
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:29,030
you're going,

768
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,680
these guys are going to come in your
hair and then you're going to massage it

769
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:34,800
and it's like a come shampoo and
you're like, actually it's right

770
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,430
some of this with you here alone
because what's going to happen?

771
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,200
All these guys are going to materialize
all over the place. Okay. Okay.

772
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,980
And then what? You go do it, do it.
Your face is going to lean back here.

773
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,200
Ashley's going to care.
You're like this right here.

774
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,680
This is going to put your
head back and the guys can do,

775
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:58,000
they're going to come up here and
they're to jack off in your hair. Oh,

776
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,060
so got to do where they're doing this is
keep your hat and Ashley's going to be

777
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:07,140
massaging the come into your hair
get and this is really good for you.

778
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,570
Good solid protein in the hair.

779
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,120
Yeah. Yeah. See that's the average
shoot film. Shoot. Yeah. And she goes,

780
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:17,350
we are filming today.
Like she really is nice things.

781
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:21,700
They were saying the artifacts from
yes in the house and she's like,

782
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:25,720
sweet lady caress my body. Like I
don't, I didn't see any of that.

783
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,200
And they're like, ah, I did get
granny. Like nobody's caressing.

784
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,610
Do they anything right? Hammer this lady.
Oh of course. That's the whole thing.

785
00:52:33,611 --> 00:52:38,500
60 press mouth that you get
hammered gentlemen, gentlemen.

786
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,940
And I think she learned the gentleman
because of the gentleman's club, you know,

787
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:47,170
and like they call strip bars the
gentleman's club, which is always silly.

788
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:50,730
Like really like there's guys in
suits that are showing up. Yeah.

789
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:54,760
What gentlemen are coming here and
she probably saw a gentleman, right?

790
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:58,210
She saw a gentleman club and was like,
oh these are, these are gentlemen. Yeah,

791
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,340
yeah, yeah. Like guys are interested in
sex or gentlemen, these are not gentlemen.

792
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,890
These are not gentlemen. Hate
to tell you. Uh, we'll just,

793
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,750
that will not act as for women
as well. Nice. And massage
the breast. Okay. Massage,

794
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,620
massage back forward, backward
and sticking the breadth
and pushing the breath.

795
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,260
There's the,
this is Adam is looking for what?

796
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,270
Cause he could teach you this and
he'll be like, yeah, like this,

797
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:33,270
like this. And you're like,
ah, yes. My Dick get hard.

798
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,520
Yeah.

799
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,800
People pay me $500 I
show up as ridiculous.

800
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,960
Show me the massage again.
It's crazy.

801
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,610
I want to say stop my stop back and
forward back work and checking the breath,

802
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,310
using the breath and
pushing them together.

803
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,270
And that helps you not get breast cancer.
Right, right, right. Just alluded to,

804
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,400
right. Right. To a fight. Breast Cancer.

805
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,793
I have to do it.

806
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:09,220
This is how 12 year old boys
imagine like girls playing.

807
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,240
This was a 12 year old boys.
Imagine what doctors do,

808
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,980
like when you go, if a woman goes, I'm
going for a physical, they're like,

809
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:20,850
I got to play with your tits.
Put an egg in your purse,

810
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,850
right? This guy's like, yeah, it's
actually very effective way to,

811
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,200
to keep a healthy body going.
What?

812
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:33,600
Is this all one interview or did
this guy come back for my debt part?

813
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:37,590
I don't know. I feel like it's gotta be
the same one and we just didn't absurd.

814
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:42,090
He just found out about it and in his
dad shoes. Yeah, those are Nice Nike's.

815
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:46,120
Right, but they're dead and
Nike's. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah.

816
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:51,090
The other dude's got on like dress shoes.
This guy just went for his walk,

817
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:55,380
his morning Tai Chi walk and then Kate
at the interview and you and the women.

818
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:58,110
So the women probably take three to six
months to learn all these techniques.

819
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,900
It's longer, longer, longer,

820
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:05,760
or they have to learn how to feel
the contracting or the uterus.

821
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,980
I can go out the uterus,
London Real,

822
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:15,981
you can watch their a youtube channel
and learn all about this stuff and it's

823
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:20,860
very, very good information. And
then I got to do my urine enema.

824
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:25,860
I don't forget that when these loose
the faced origo you go my urine therapy.

825
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,930
I got to squeeze my egg. I got it
was squeezed my boobs. He's awesome.

826
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,580
I got to take 16 Benadryl
and then smoke pot. Okay,

827
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:42,550
and then you have fun romp Africa. Yes.
I think it has got to be the same idea.

828
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,130
Right? Let's see. Let's
see. Yes. Now you'll do it.

829
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,400
You'll feel, oh really? Yes.

830
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,280
Orgasm without ejaculation.

831
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:58,070
So you feel so you see when you do,
when

832
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,430
you squeeze all guests.
I'm coming up the interviewer laughing,

833
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,610
but don't you feel like we should put the
Benadryl guy and him together? Oh yeah.

834
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,990
You're super horny and then
he's like penis like that.

835
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,320
You smoke your weed. Yeah.
Restless leg syndrome.

836
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,350
He massage like that.

837
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,460
We have two methods that could go really
well together if he just thought about

838
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:38,280
it and you throw a command in there.
I mean it's a perfect, perfect mix.

839
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:42,280
Perfect system. We've got the perfect,
the perfect smile. Perfect system.

840
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:46,750
It's really something Jane or up. What'd
you do? When I was going this week,

841
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,010
just rubbed my titties and
played with my eggs through eggs.

842
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,870
Firmed it all up there. You can see
how wrinkle free my shit is now. Yeah.

843
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:59,410
Hung out with a little jeans that
good. Ah, he's the best dude. Yeah.

844
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,040
He's Super Fun to hang out with the dogs.
I just chilled. I chilled really hard.

845
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,910
I needed to be home for a minute, you
know, doing nothing. That's my favorite.

846
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:11,020
I've been baking lately and I'm a terrible
baker because I watched that British

847
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:14,920
baking show and now I think I can beg,
but I, I just fuck it up every time.

848
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,980
But I still like it. You know, it's,
it's a good to do things. You're not,

849
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,060
you're not great at Joe Rogan.
I were talking about that.
He, he's, he does things,

850
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:24,700
he's not great. And I was like, Oh yeah,
I think I've started doing that now.

851
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,230
Cause it's nice to,

852
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,220
to enjoy something even though
you're not good at it and sure.

853
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,790
And also feel like you can try to get
better at it. So Lj helps me bake.

854
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:38,770
Super Cute and uh, and
yeah, go to the park,

855
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,390
run around, took some naps. Couple
of questions came in via email.

856
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,463
No boy,

857
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,980
conjoined twins who wipes with although
reason curiosity about how blind people

858
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:52,660
experience certain aspects of life.

859
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:57,370
I'm reminded of the mini taboo questions
I have regarding conjoined twins.

860
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:01,540
I identify as an amateur scientist
and according to my research,

861
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:04,810
most people wipe it the same
wipe dominant hand. Huh.

862
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,150
I'm curious about wiping
with conjoined twins.

863
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,290
Do they argue about who's going to
wipe or does one twin always wipe?

864
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,910
I appreciate any input towards my
research, but it must warn you.

865
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:18,840
Try not to go too deep down the
conjoined twin rabbit hole quick.

866
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,930
It gets pretty dark.

867
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:25,170
Thank you for all the work and congrats
on the awesome Netflix Special Christina

868
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:29,020
jeans up posedown Steven.
Wow. Well that's just,

869
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:32,800
I mean I don't think we would not know
but we can put it out there obviously to

870
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:37,730
the universe. Well now we've opened
up a whole other cannabis gets,

871
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,410
I know can join twins
questions. Very, very true.

872
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:45,700
I have so many questions for
conjoined twins. It. I mean,
when it comes everything,

873
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:49,450
everything. How do you do everything?
How do you decide what you do that day?

874
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,710
Do they separate people? How
does that even, I don't know,

875
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,350
but that's a great question.
God,

876
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,670
how do you like someone at the other
person's therefore it obviously obviously,

877
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,960
so you're always in an orgy.
Like basically you both
have to be dating somebody,

878
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,530
let's say theoretically and then you
guys were like, everybody want to do it.

879
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,530
Okay, great. Who, what
guy? I mean, I'm sorry.

880
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,740
Or girl meets a conjoined
twins. Look, I'm into this.

881
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:19,240
I mean,
I don't mean it to sound hateful,

882
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:22,340
but I mean really how it's too hard.
Just just

883
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,540
logistically speaking. Yeah.
You know, just because you're,

884
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:28,520
you're dating two different
people basically. And they,

885
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,640
they have distinct personalities.
So of course you're,

886
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,740
you're always dating the
sister and the sister in law.

887
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,590
Get out of that. How can you get over
that brother and the brother in law?

888
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:42,050
It's a lot. How do you
masturbate? How do you shit,

889
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,340
how do you also with the mash,
I mean,

890
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:47,030
do you realize that
they could be like that?

891
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:51,230
Like my conjoined brother could
be like a, it could be like, um,

892
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,150
I'm want to jerk off and he's like,
I don't want to turn it off.

893
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,960
Like I want to go to sleep. I'm tired.
I have a busy day tomorrow. Right.

894
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,630
I'm horny. No, and then
you have the same body

895
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,030
you're fighting over.

896
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,380
I guess in that case you let the brother
do the jerking and then you're just

897
01:00:08,381 --> 01:00:12,340
like, well, I'm just ignoring this.
Yeah. I mean the whole, I don't know.

898
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,910
I'm so sad is that show,
the show obviously isn't on anymore.

899
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:20,320
Brittany and Sally whenever it was,
two different joints, but they don't,

900
01:00:20,321 --> 01:00:22,090
they don't answer the important questions,

901
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,760
not any questions that anyone
wants to know. Of course

902
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:32,080
there their questions were like,
how do you guys deal with feelings?

903
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:34,670
And you're like, no, I wanted to hear
about that. I don't hear about blow dry.

904
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,990
How do you take a shit? Yeah.
How do you date? How do you,

905
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,980
how do you wipe God?

906
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:43,913
Yeah.

907
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:49,250
If a police officer has to handcuff
someone and that person is missing a hand,

908
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:51,650
what did they do?
How did they handcuff the mist from Dave?

909
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,590
That seems like something
that a police officer,

910
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,990
there's definitely a police
officer's listen to the show.

911
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,650
You must've run into that.
Yeah.

912
01:01:00,651 --> 01:01:03,180
I imagine they would cut
the one hand is then you,

913
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,440
then you do the ankle thinks
they can't run away I guess,

914
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:12,170
but a free hand is too, you
know, too dangerous to have
free so like you got, yeah,

915
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:14,030
you got to handcuff it to something,
but I want to,

916
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:17,690
I want to know like if you're a cop
and you've ever been in that situation,

917
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:21,800
what do you do?
Do you stick his hand down his pants?

918
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,370
Why would he do that?
Just to be like play with it down there.

919
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,480
We can't have that out here.
Handcuff his hand to his dick and balls.

920
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:33,770
That's silly Tom.
It's very silly but it could happen.

921
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,190
Got All these great life questions.
Really great questions.

922
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,610
Important question about come hugging.
Hi Mommy's.

923
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:42,980
I showed some friends the
clip of the Com huggers.

924
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,380
One of my friends raised
an interesting question.

925
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:49,160
If somebody come hugs you without
you knowing or without your consent,

926
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:52,400
is that a crime?
How many Patrick rapers are out there.

927
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:58,170
Scottio and he's demonic. Wife Creep
me out. Thanks. Genes. Check, check

928
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,650
really good. And she is demonic. The, the,

929
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,150
the smile is horrendous on
that become huggers. So weird.

930
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,880
There are so many answers. Yes, of course.
That's, that's a form of sexual assault.

931
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,070
If you come hug somebody
without their consent, Tantra,

932
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:20,250
which helps us too,
the sexual

933
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,960
energy up our bodies.

934
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,440
So actually the longer we make love,

935
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,540
the more energized we get.

936
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,990
Right.
Such a Weirdo.

937
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:37,390
I want her and the rub rub guy and the
Benadryl guy and came in in the same

938
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:41,720
room, all of them. That's a
fun movie. Make that film.

939
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:46,180
And they'd be like, I really feel
like this is enough Benadryl.

940
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:48,520
And that dude be like, got,
have 10 to 12, 10 or 12

941
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,130
the whole movie would be about
getting people to take more Benadryl,

942
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,400
10 to 12 and now even that,

943
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,500
that Thai guy be like too many,
too many pills for five

944
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:10,090
B,
that's so many miles.

945
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,540
You cannot take that. You would,
I would have a heart attack.

946
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:17,490
That stuff freaks me out so
badly. Could you imagine? Yeah.

947
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:22,300
Half of that dose would kill me half
the dosage so much. It's so much.

948
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:31,170
You're so whacked out in your mind.
They're totally crazy.

949
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:35,680
You gotta be crazy to take that much.
No, you shouldn't do that as guys bad.

950
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,200
We should say that is bad.
It's so bad advice.

951
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:41,890
And then to smoke dope on top
of that, like what? I mean,

952
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:46,640
no wonder your brain's gone.
Your might,

953
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:51,400
your everything is shut down except for
your painter. This is, um, we brought up,

954
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:54,970
you know,
inappropriate parents talking about sex.

955
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:59,080
I was that you had this,
Josh Potter has great stories about this.

956
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:03,850
They've got an email. Someone said, Hey,
I was listening to your podcast for 17.

957
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,280
You brought up parents talking about
sex. I was like, also how like,

958
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:10,030
we never want to sexually
talk in front of our son.

959
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:15,000
It's so inappropriate to discuss your
sex lives in front of your children, uh,

960
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,040
to discuss any aspect of your
sex. Life. Person said wrong.

961
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,850
It prompted me to talk about
my 20 year long nightmare.

962
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,430
My father passed away when I was a kid.

963
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,150
My mom raised my brother and I by herself.
When I turned 13,

964
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:31,830
I started to notice my mom becoming more
and more comfortable with innuendos up.

965
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,640
Talking about the female anatomy.

966
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,090
I'll cut to the chase and give you
some very low and loose scenarios.

967
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,230
Here's quotes from her. I
sweat a lot during sex. Uh,

968
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,900
general talks about how when she
gave birth to my brother and I,

969
01:04:43,901 --> 01:04:48,370
we destroyed her vagina one time when
at dinner she ordered a Sunday when the

970
01:04:48,371 --> 01:04:50,590
server asked if she wanted a cherry.
She responded.

971
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,910
I haven't had my cherry and almost 20
years. Oh boy. She has since remarried.

972
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:59,530
A great guy. They will talk about her
sex life with openly at the dinner table.

973
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,650
These are just a few scenarios
I have dealt with in my life.

974
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,740
I agree with you guys. It is not
right. It makes me so nauseous.

975
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,920
I can't even eat moose soup anymore.
Love you.

976
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:13,360
Mommy's keep them high end type
Tom is the personality champ. Hm.

977
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:18,090
Yeah. I mean I I dated. He really
went through, right, right.

978
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,980
It's disgusting. But
my dad, not my dad. My,

979
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,040
I dated a guy whose father would
make sexual jokes constantly,

980
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:31,300
constantly. And that is just
weird. It's so disgusting.

981
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,380
Other kids' parents like that.
My parents were hardcore.

982
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:39,380
The opposite, right? Zero, right. Yeah.

983
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,330
I mean the most I got w I would
pick up on as I was older,

984
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,380
my dad,

985
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,580
but doing a dad joke to
another adult in other words,

986
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,070
like it wasn't for the kids.
Right. You know what I mean?

987
01:05:52,071 --> 01:05:56,840
Like somebody would say a
couple of state troopers.

988
01:05:56,841 --> 01:05:58,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was like,

989
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:03,430
it would be like kind of like add an
earshot but never like to us or like,

990
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,790
oh yeah,
I used to get real hard with your mom,

991
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:12,200
like no mine.
Now it's also like now I kind of,

992
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,540
I'm guilty of like poking
and prodding them to get,

993
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,680
say those things, you know, almost 40
and I'm like trying to get it to happen.

994
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,370
You're asking for my mother.

995
01:06:23,371 --> 01:06:28,371
When my mother passed away in 2015 we
were going through old photographs and my

996
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:34,680
dad, uh, texted me and sent me copies of
these photos he was looking at. He's like,

997
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:38,880
oh, you got a mom had great tits, great
ass. And I was like, oh, thank you.

998
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:43,140
Thanks for telling me. That's
why he married her. Good
tits. Good ass. Thank you.

999
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:43,651
Is that,

1000
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:46,560
that's the last thing you want to hear
about your dead mom is how great her tits

1001
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:49,580
in her ass were very attractive.
Thank you.

1002
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:53,160
Your mom also had like told you
about sex when you were real young.

1003
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:58,270
There is a lot of that. Um, she, I think
she thought she was teaching me. Yeah.

1004
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:03,090
That's the thing is that she wasn't
doing it and like a perverse way,

1005
01:07:03,091 --> 01:07:05,070
but she was like,
you got to learn these things.

1006
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,290
It was like she was way ahead of schedule.

1007
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:12,950
I was about eight or nine or 10 and it
was like she was giving me tutorials on

1008
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:17,880
how to please men and this and that. And
I was like, first of all, first of all,

1009
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:21,150
this stuff and my mother's biggest
thing was having a clean vagina.

1010
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,650
You'll have to keep your what Jina Glean.

1011
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,110
And she had like that
old school douche bag,

1012
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,800
like an old douche with like the big
red nozzle and the black and it was

1013
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:34,740
disgusting. And then she would
uh, she was obsessed with,

1014
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:39,000
you have to let your
vagina breathe so at night,

1015
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,150
no underwear in the pajamas,

1016
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,130
you have to let your vagina breathe.

1017
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,240
Now my mother also weren't nylon
tights under her tight jeans.

1018
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,660
So of course I think she
was strangling her vagina.

1019
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,760
So she really needed to
let it breathe at night.

1020
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,400
Sort of a curious lesson for an eight
year, nine year old though. Yeah.

1021
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:57,330
And too early.

1022
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:03,690
And then she had edible panties that was
the most disgusting and it was by her

1023
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:05,580
bedside.
So I like,

1024
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:09,240
I was privy to her nightstand contents,
you know,

1025
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:12,420
like she would show me what
was in there and it was like,

1026
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:15,680
this is being Yuck Colada
flavor. I'm like, what's Colada?

1027
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:20,150
Like I was so young I didn't even know.
And then I got to taste the edible panty.

1028
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:23,270
She like it was, it wasn't used or
anything. She unwrapped it and was like,

1029
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:25,190
you want to taste it? And I
was like, all right, I thought,

1030
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,730
but at the time you think it's so cool
because you're privy to like grown up

1031
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:32,030
stuff. You're like, wow, a mom's
best friend. This is great.

1032
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:37,940
I'm going to fluid bonded with
Jesse. Yeah. Yeah. It was so wrong.

1033
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,800
Like you're never supposed
to be your parents friends.

1034
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,730
Not even when you're an adult.
You're never their friends. Yeah.

1035
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,550
You're always the child. I'm always
going to be, I should always be a child.

1036
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,080
You're always my parents.
So nasty. Yeah. Oh,

1037
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:54,830
it's so gross.
I taste you taste.

1038
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:59,600
I tasted them and I remember being like,
this is not good. Uh, yeah. So gnarly.

1039
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:03,990
God, so gnarly. It's
just the idea of the hot,

1040
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:08,370
sexy man check leading my
life strangely turns me on.

1041
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,680
That's my favorite part is the,

1042
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,390
the nervous laughter that
accompanies these horny people.

1043
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,100
They're always nervously laughing.
Like what the, the calm huggers.

1044
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,300
It's always this nervous

1045
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,430
laughter. Yeah. By the way, we
are always on the forefront of,

1046
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,930
um,
you know,

1047
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,510
weird speaking patterns and yeah.

1048
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,680
We had that guy from Texas.
Yeah.

1049
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,670
That was the weirdest
fucking guy ever. Yeah. Um,

1050
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:43,800
and I ended up, he's all over Instagram
too, and he has so many fucking,

1051
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:49,440
you know, uh, youtube subscribers,
hundreds of thousands.

1052
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:54,250
But he has that crazy of an
arcade in Dallas, Dallas.

1053
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,280
So weird man arcade and dedicate this
list to everyone who has been affected by

1054
01:09:59,641 --> 01:10:03,720
Hurricane Harvey Harvey. Yeah.
I Dunno how he learned to speak,

1055
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:08,490
but his name's chills and I don't
know. So anyways, there is that guy,

1056
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,500
um,
hurricane Harvey,

1057
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:15,180
I guess the New York Times
named their first female editor.

1058
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,410
Oh. And they did an interview
with her. She has crazy vocal fry.

1059
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:24,200
Wait a minute, this is the first female
editor they'd had at the New York Times?

1060
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:29,250
I think so. I think that's what this
is 2017, right? Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1061
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,990
But I mean, the Nanas chicks don't
even read and that's true. No, it's

1062
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,520
meaningful to me that I'm the first
woman executive editor of the New York

1063
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:42,134
Times.

1064
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,500
Wow. Vocal fry. Cross generational.

1065
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,690
No, and usually you don't see it.
You see it in the young women. Right.

1066
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,860
You see it in the Kardashians
inspired women. Right.

1067
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,490
I'm gonna go to the mall
and get some new maker.

1068
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:01,210
I will say that I can go into it
if I'm just tired and I'm not like,

1069
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,160
uh,

1070
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,090
I almost said to me,
I know I'm not supposed to ask this,

1071
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:09,000
but they'd asked me then
a gender related question.

1072
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:14,001
I'm so proud of the fact that
I am the woman to hold this job

1073
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,900
and I have been together
for nearly three years.

1074
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:27,500
Wild. I liked it. His grammar was
proper there. He said, Megan and I,

1075
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,860
not me and Megan.
So I am partial to that.

1076
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:34,110
Cling to hold this job

1077
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,810
that doesn't even seem real,
uh,

1078
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:45,450
talks like that. This job. I've
never heard someone say that,

1079
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,810
you know, you're the executive editor
for the New York Times and you go,

1080
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,730
it's a good job.

1081
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,430
I think.
Yeah,

1082
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:57,430
the biggest challenge that I face as I
prepare to be executive editor is making

1083
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:03,551
everyone in our news room as comfortable
with this transition that we're now

1084
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:06,650
well into.

1085
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:11,651
And I think maybe under my watch will
arrive at the other side and it's

1086
01:12:12,471 --> 01:12:13,370
happening.

1087
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,240
It's hot fun.

1088
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,260
I'm not saying shit bad
about the New York Times.

1089
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:23,030
They wrote a nice article about me,
so I'm not going to say job.

1090
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:27,970
Yeah, that's true. You were in the New
York Times not saying any of this job job.

1091
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:32,570
Well, this, um, the
article is really good.

1092
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:34,580
It's basically time shutting
the fuck up right now.

1093
01:12:34,581 --> 01:12:36,380
I'm not talking shit about
the executive editor.

1094
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:41,420
It's about the mom lane in comedy.
Right. Ali Wong and I are now,

1095
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:44,420
we're officially declared a movement.
Yeah.

1096
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:48,380
It takes a no and a few
other women are doing. Yeah,

1097
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:50,720
but you guys are really
doing something for it.

1098
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,193
Um,

1099
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,990
Steven Seagal is the latest to
be accused of sexual harassment,

1100
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:04,150
but banana, it's like a 20 year
old harassment, but oh no. Yeah.

1101
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:07,900
Then 1996, that woman, that's
who the picture was of,

1102
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,820
remember I pull up that picture.
She was in the wrong file. She, uh,

1103
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,940
was,
she wasn't to his house.

1104
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,190
He summoned her to his house to read
for a role and she showed up with,

1105
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:23,260
she brought a woman, a casting
director, whether it's the golf,

1106
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:28,261
sat in a silk robe and watched
her do the scenes and yeah.

1107
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:32,050
And he said, and then that same
day the manager called and said,

1108
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,360
[inaudible] God wants
to offer you the lead,

1109
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:38,410
but you have to go back to his home
for a private rehearsal tonight. No,

1110
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,110
and she didn't want to do it.

1111
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:46,590
So they offered her like a one scene role
instead and cut her from the movie and

1112
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,500
she said on set,

1113
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:55,030
he would be like around guys and
look at her and snicker and you know,

1114
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:57,160
wow. Yeah, there you go.

1115
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,790
I am the king of Improv is for free.

1116
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,630
It's so, it's so odd. I mean,
he's usually such a normal guy.

1117
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,160
Like there must be a new movie with him
out by the, because people keep sending

1118
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,970
me clips of a new movie,
which is,

1119
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:21,130
it's like breaking down
all this legal walls

1120
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:24,540
that we thought existed.
No, wait a minute. Is it on
Youtube? Do we have a trail?

1121
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:29,070
I think it's on, I think it's on
Netflix, but no. Well I think so.

1122
01:14:29,071 --> 01:14:31,920
All his movies end up there, right?
We've, we've watched a few on there,

1123
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:33,660
but I think he's got a new one where,

1124
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:37,620
let me see if this is Tiki
Punch in the raper. Yeah.

1125
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,570
His new one looks like a real
hot pile of shit. Um, look,

1126
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:47,630
I fucking just pulled up my
fucking in fucking oh no.

1127
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:53,310
Look at that. In Aries there
too. Airy fairy Shaffer.

1128
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:57,300
See Steve. I'll see if he's
got a new one. Steven Seagal.

1129
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:02,360
You say that's not how you say
it. I say Steven Seagal. Seagal.

1130
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:05,730
How do you say it when he was sick?
Tommy, right. Say Sea Gulls. He Gal.

1131
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,120
Gal wasn't asked to goal Segal.

1132
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:14,320
Steven Segal even.
He's such a weird dude,

1133
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:18,860
man. This whole thing about he
lives in Russia now, right? Yeah.

1134
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:20,930
I don't know if they're alive.
So weird.

1135
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,450
Is it this guy? These
guys, so many movies.

1136
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,940
I mean, are you American or not
buddy? You got to choose a side.

1137
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,250
You with the commies.
Are you with us man?

1138
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:36,140
Asian connection or we watched that one.
Asian connections. Fantastic weapon.

1139
01:15:36,141 --> 01:15:37,280
One Star.
Go ahead.

1140
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,790
Uh, Asian connection. Good man. I
feel like we'd looked at that one.

1141
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,220
We looked at that one.
Yeah. Is it code of honor?

1142
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:47,670
Is this the one maybe
that he's [inaudible]

1143
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:51,770
well why do all these tower title
sound exactly the same? I don't know.

1144
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,340
It's like Asian Guinea pig shit,
code of honor,

1145
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,690
man of words or whatever.
They're all the same.

1146
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,940
They sent me the, there's this scene
where he's clearly, cause you know,

1147
01:16:01,941 --> 01:16:03,500
he's like really good at Improv.

1148
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:08,370
He clearly is improvising
with the actress. Oh.

1149
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,900
And it's so painful.
You know like poor girl is just like,

1150
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,600
can I just stick to the
script and he's like, you can,

1151
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:19,220
I'm going to fucking just
riff. It's so terrible. He's,

1152
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,760
he's just the worst. Um, but yeah.

1153
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:26,900
So now he's the latest to be
accused of uh, harassment.

1154
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,490
Great. I love it. I hope
this trend continues.

1155
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:35,140
I would like to drain the showbiz swamp
of these creeps. That would be fantastic.

1156
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,890
Yeah. I wonder who we're going to
find out is the next big creeper.

1157
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:41,770
Cause you know, once it,
uh, once the can is open,

1158
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,700
once it starts make Hollywood Tan.
Wait a minute,

1159
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:49,330
wait a minute. Did you see
how dark his skin is? Yeah,

1160
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:54,520
Babe.
What you give your life to save the world?

1161
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,460
The world of course.

1162
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:01,750
Dump Shit Babe. He's like
Brown. There's a real actor.

1163
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,630
Like I'm gonna try to act different

1164
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:10,340
and you're not telling me
to take a look at his hair

1165
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:14,900
is crazy. Come on. No, he's, he's so dark.

1166
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:20,490
The Iq can't, I can't even get over.
How's Brown? His skin is news new Pale.

1167
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:24,950
He's normally very pale. He's doing news,
new stuff. Every movie. Keep it exciting,

1168
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:25,784
man.

1169
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,990
He's like that lady on the
Maury Povich that we played.

1170
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:32,650
I remember the Maury Povich lady
who went black with the injections.

1171
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:35,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He might be doing that.

1172
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:40,470
You might be going towards that.
I've been black now for over a black.

1173
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:44,290
I'm like, wait a minute.
No you're not. Yes I am.

1174
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:49,340
I wish someone had told me what that
fucking mom black was because it was an

1175
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:53,470
amazing African American my whole life.
He goes like, I love the fucker cookies

1176
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,800
and serious seeing that he just, Oh yeah,
yeah, I love the fuck out of cookies.

1177
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:00,760
And we know that.

1178
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,470
Yeah. If anybody knows the scene
or the movie that, that that's in,

1179
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:10,270
I would really love to know is it
looks like such a pile of shit.

1180
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,050
His acting is really questionable.
I mean that was like,

1181
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:20,170
that is what I thought. Like he doesn't
even try. I know. Let's see if yeah.

1182
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,960
That that poor other actor was
actually trying to react and,

1183
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:29,370
and have a moment and, and Seagal is
just like, Eh, it does what I'd done.

1184
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:33,340
And then, then, then he's a weird,

1185
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,900
yeah, he's very weird. A weird
dude. Very weird guy. Um,

1186
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:42,220
lastly, before we get out of here, um,

1187
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:45,100
just thought that maybe you
would like to check this out.

1188
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:50,110
Maybe it's a direction you want to go.
And as a parent,

1189
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,450
Sweden is the most forward thinking
country in the world when it comes to

1190
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:57,910
questioning gender.
The gender neutral Pronoun Hen is now

1191
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,740
commonly used by my sweet.
Yes. I love it. Yeah.

1192
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:05,740
So just arrived in out of blue in Sweden.
I'm about,

1193
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:09,400
it's going to be a family here attempting
to bring up that kids free from old

1194
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:12,640
gender norms. Hey. Hello.

1195
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,590
How are you?
This is nick.

1196
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,730
Go.
Yeah.

1197
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:25,350
What answered the door was that you'll
see and not to be gender normative here.

1198
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:30,550
You'll see hen and answered for sure,
man.

1199
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,380
Well, Mama, is that your partner? Yeah,

1200
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,120
my pilot and he goes by Matilda and Matt,

1201
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:41,150
but is also the one who gave birth and
that's just what felt right to me because

1202
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:43,520
I'm intersex.

1203
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,420
I was born with characteristics
of both male and female. Okay.

1204
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,110
Oh Wow. Yeah. Got It all going on.
Dell is an American photographer.

1205
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,670
He moved to Sweden for love.

1206
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,170
Their work has for over three decades
focused on queer identities and

1207
01:19:59,171 --> 01:20:00,490
challenging gender norms.

1208
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,343
Yeah.

1209
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:07,130
This is Nikos Room on how old this Nico.
Nico is two and a half.

1210
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,520
I'm Mayfair is

1211
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,860
a almost five and a half.

1212
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,590
Mika and Nico were both assigned
male at birth and this family,

1213
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:16,980
the sex you were born with does
not dictate your gender identity.

1214
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:21,180
There you go. We could have done
something about that ourselves

1215
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:27,120
to those were born with male
characteristics. Those two,

1216
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,200
those two were, sorry,
born says gender males.

1217
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:35,250
I think so. Right? Is that what you heard
and not just that third born though?

1218
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:38,280
Is that what you heard him saying in the,
that's what the, that's what they said,

1219
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:43,050
right? Yeah. Yeah. They're born male
and then they're being raised age,

1220
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:45,180
gender, age, gender. Could I do,

1221
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:49,680
we don't gender toys. We don't
change your colors. So what happened?

1222
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:50,730
They're interested in,

1223
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,190
it's like they can just play
with whatever toys they want it.

1224
01:20:53,191 --> 01:20:57,320
And you would never dictate what
last squat? No, absolutely not.

1225
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,800
So they both have a lot of cars.
Interesting.

1226
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:07,030
But interestingly enough, she opens up
two drawers and all I saw were trucks,

1227
01:21:07,031 --> 01:21:10,690
cars, Legos, traditionally boy things.

1228
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,280
I mean could that be because they were
born boys and Bro, I don't want to,

1229
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:16,300
I don't want to be insensitive.

1230
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,870
I was worried about with clay thing.

1231
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:24,100
Now Amica is for the past two
months has worn a dress everyday.

1232
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,490
Just about when me is wearing dresses and
because Mick has very, very long hair.

1233
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,550
Most people assume that me because female,

1234
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:37,600
which is, well wait a minute, but that,

1235
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:41,540
wouldn't that be a gender norm?
For instance,

1236
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:43,490
the long hair, he, she,

1237
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:48,350
they had just said the long
hair is traditionally feminine.

1238
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:52,570
So isn't that a gender norm thing?
The TTC,

1239
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,270
such probably what happened
was that the child,

1240
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,530
so I don't want a haircut.
Oh, my hair to be long. Okay.

1241
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,520
We use he for them.

1242
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:06,940
Sometimes it's mixed and it depends,
you know,

1243
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:11,290
because in Sweden we have hen the
gender neutral pronoun in Swedish,

1244
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:13,630
I think Mika has always
said when I've asked,

1245
01:22:13,631 --> 01:22:16,390
it's been she or Ken.

1246
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,070
Oh, there you go. Oh, so sorry.

1247
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:23,990
So the child is asking for she or hand.
Well then there you go. Yeah. Then,

1248
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:25,850
then that's what the kid
wants. And you, you know,

1249
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:30,920
you're the kind of leading comedic
voice. How dare you, don't you dare,

1250
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:35,620
don't you dare. Don't you
dare get me to be the, uh,

1251
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:40,650
the, the, the binaries. You are
a lot. Oh boy. You're that comic.

1252
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:44,860
Now people ask me about the
first 48 and bikes and shit.

1253
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:49,790
Oh wait, what's, yeah. Yeah. You're
the person. I mean, I don't know. It's,

1254
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:54,210
it's uh, I will say that just
watching our kid, uh, he's sorry,

1255
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,810
and they've been,

1256
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:02,380
our son has been privy to both
dolls and trucks and bike,

1257
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:04,840
whatever leg I was.

1258
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:09,330
He doesn't really care for the
dollies and it's not me being like,

1259
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:14,410
don't touch the dolls homo. It's not
that. It's that he doesn't care. No, no,

1260
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:15,430
it's true.
It's pretty.

1261
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:19,960
And he likes dirt and
trashcan playing and stomping,

1262
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:25,240
stomping him like it's pretty,
it's pretty gender specific.

1263
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:27,240
Loves it. Yeah. Yeah.

1264
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,560
Well,
how do you avoid gendering?

1265
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:33,730
Your children didn't choose
anything bit gender neutral names.

1266
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:37,810
We chose not to know what sex they
would be assigned when they were born.

1267
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:41,710
Not answering the question.
Is it a boy or a girl to avoid

1268
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,920
word and the g,
the B word and the g word.

1269
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,890
How do you avoid knowing the
gender they were assigned at birth?

1270
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,600
What does that mean? You
don't look at their genitals?
I think knowing beforehand.

1271
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,760
Oh, oh, caring that the
home for a boy or a girl.

1272
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. All right. They
would be assigned when they were born.

1273
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:04,700
Not answering the question. Is it
a boy or a girl to avoid? Yeah.

1274
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:09,110
Well the word and the g. What do you do
when people say, is it a boy or a girl?

1275
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,910
So that's the answer. I would like to
know what, what is it a boy or a girl?

1276
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,290
I guess it's up to the child now.
Here's my thinking here. And maybe this,

1277
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:22,390
how do you handle a sweet old person?
It's like boy or girl. And they're like,

1278
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:27,230
why don't you mind your fucking business?
Why don't you respect it's pro down.

1279
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,300
It's a hen.
Yeah.

1280
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:34,360
I think I also think that it sounds like
this person was had to deal with a lot

1281
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:38,410
of shit growing up, being both
genders, the intersex person.

1282
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,960
And that's gotta be so horrible
to grow up with your whole life.

1283
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:46,900
But since you were fucked with and
your kids probably wouldn't be,

1284
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:50,470
it's good to push your trauma onto them.
That's a really good thing to do.

1285
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:55,030
Your two kids that were born as boys,
you should definitely be like,

1286
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,870
I'm going to push my
issues on. I mean, yeah,

1287
01:24:58,871 --> 01:25:02,530
and I get the how painful that must
have been for them because that sucks.

1288
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:06,370
It does.
But to go this far with this stuff,

1289
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:09,190
like maybe you just need to
see a third first and then

1290
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:15,560
changing pronouns in book
instead of it always being mama.

1291
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:19,280
We say Mama and my par,
the Natter Sweetie Act.

1292
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:22,490
[inaudible] it's so dark.

1293
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:27,160
Yeah.
I want to know how grandma Margaret,

1294
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,750
of how her grandchildren are being raised.

1295
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,520
So she's a normal sheet,
but which one is her son?

1296
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:54,340
Is it the one that they've
been interviewing other,

1297
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:59,310
the other parent, right. No, because the
other parent is the one that gave birth.

1298
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:03,060
So the other one is a female by,

1299
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:06,980
so that would make sense that that person
would go to kindergarten and address.

1300
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:09,770
So I'm thinking it's the one
that's being interviewed. Right.

1301
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:14,300
But then she did have a normal
old person response was like,

1302
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:18,260
it was fucking weird. Yeah. Yeah.
Meaning like I've adapted. Yeah.

1303
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:23,180
And that like my own son was not
allowed to do that. Yeah. I mean, look,

1304
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:27,950
I, I do feel like this stuff,
these countries are generally
more progressive. Yeah.

1305
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:31,020
There's a lot. This is a lot
healthier society to live in. Yeah.

1306
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,900
And then we catch up to what they're
doing in like 30 years. Yeah.

1307
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:40,000
But my stupid 41 year old brain is
still just like, wait, what? Yeah.

1308
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:43,250
Like I'm not sure. Sure.
I'm fully compensated.

1309
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:48,220
They have like a way healthier, I dunno.
Like criminal justice system. Yeah.

1310
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,530
Healthcare all,
all that is way,

1311
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:55,790
way further ahead in Sweden and then,
yeah, that whole region really. Yeah.

1312
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:59,840
There variant than Netherlands, right?
Isn't that what that's considered? No,

1313
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:04,180
I don't know what they are. Yes.
Scandinavia. Yeah. Um, yeah, they,

1314
01:27:04,181 --> 01:27:07,540
they tend to be way more progressive than,
you know,

1315
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:09,770
in terms of the Western
world and what we are at.

1316
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:10,391
I mean,

1317
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:14,430
the reason I liked [inaudible] so much
is because she thinks I'm a great mob.

1318
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,120
Pop right back.
Yeah,

1319
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,680
yeah, yeah. Well, it's interest.

1320
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:24,290
Thank you.
I know where this one or this one.

1321
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,480
You want this one?
Okay.

1322
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:31,100
We're going to go with the red and
black theme today then. Good idea.

1323
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,790
See how many,
on the other hand too,

1324
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:38,791
it's like you also are shaping
how the kid responds to stuff.

1325
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,760
You know what I mean? Yeah. So it's like,

1326
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:45,910
is it really something that's originating
in them or is it because they're

1327
01:27:45,911 --> 01:27:48,210
watching you do your mob hot?
True.

1328
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,060
Cause kids will just imitate what
the fuck outta you, man. Yeah.

1329
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,550
Yeah man,

1330
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,690
that's really, it's an interesting, like,

1331
01:27:56,691 --> 01:28:00,860
it's a really interesting question to
ask if you're a parent or just interested

1332
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:05,360
in how these things work
because the kid does all kids,

1333
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:08,750
especially when they're around you a
lot, your own kid, they just go like,

1334
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:13,580
you start seeing, they'd start, behave
really doing things like you. Yeah. They,

1335
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:14,151
you know what I mean?

1336
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:17,180
You see the way that our kid picks up
the phone and he's like, wow. Yeah.

1337
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:20,840
So I was talking to the phone and kind
of like imitating the way I do it. Yes.

1338
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:23,840
It's just they do what you do.
They do do what you do.

1339
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:28,330
It's fascinating. I do pawned, and again,

1340
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,190
that's not something I always have to say,

1341
01:28:31,191 --> 01:28:36,130
but it would be good to know today
for the film [inaudible] Ella,

1342
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,390
him just Mikko.
Okay.

1343
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,950
See I'm then again, are we,
is this a lot of, let's see,

1344
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:46,970
that's a big decision like for us,
such a small person personally. Yeah.

1345
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:48,680
What do you want your Pronoun to be today?

1346
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,350
And the kids like how about
just call me by my name?

1347
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:56,650
Doesn't that also rattle their cage in
terms of who their self is every day?

1348
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:59,700
Right. It's like, well
maybe this kid has a, uh,

1349
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,950
an internal compass that's pretty
sturdy and you're now you're,

1350
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:06,240
you're constantly forcing the
questioning of that compass.

1351
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:10,920
Maybe that kid doesn't have the
same stuff you did. Right. You know,

1352
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:13,050
like maybe your confused
but your kid's not,

1353
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:16,200
and then you're making them insecure by
being like, well, what's your pronoun?

1354
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:17,530
What's Your Pronoun?
What'd your phone like?

1355
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:20,100
It's such a heavy thing
to try to break down.

1356
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:24,020
The person that would best answer
this question would probably be

1357
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,270
truweight alone can get you
really hornier than normal.

1358
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:29,850
But it's been an Andrew
will take about 10,

1359
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,450
12 Bannon girl before you want to have
your sexual fun with your partner or

1360
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,610
whatever you do.
Oh,

1361
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,590
I feel like 10 or 12 drill would
solve the world's problems.

1362
01:29:39,591 --> 01:29:42,500
I think that if you gave that
kid 10 or 12 vendor on your like,

1363
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,460
what's your pronoun? You're like,
I can tell you now and forever

1364
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:50,810
it's fucking hen. Okay.
And then that's what it is.

1365
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,740
Hey, there you go, gene. Um,

1366

1378
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,650
Really quiet.
Sometimes when you stand next to him,

1379
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,530
I just put her into his head sometimes.
What's going on in a minute?

1380
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:46,810
You're a psycho. You. If you spot
another psycho, you're psycho. You.

1381
01:30:46,811 --> 01:30:50,450
If you spot another cycle
and the victims is a blonde,

1382
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:56,640
one year old mother of one son named
Alice lived in a suburb of California.

Don't kill, kill, kill

1388
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,740
dark demons inside

he snaps the hookers

1391

Even man that got his legs crashed.

1392
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:56,760

1397
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:27,340
You're laughing at true.
The suffering that gives you the tickle.

1398
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:37,210
You think that's crazy. Really? I mean,

1399
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:39,030
everyone gets excited about something.
