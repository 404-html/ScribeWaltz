stuff that's coming out in

69
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,060
a couple of weeks. I believe. I should
probably check to see if the new,

70
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,730
the new hat is up.
There it is. It's there.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,510
It's the gene beanie. Look, Gee, I
know I saw it today. It's just models.

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,260
So awesome. The gene or the gene?
That Hoodie, my favorite Hoodie.

73
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,150
So this is our winter hat or a beanie.
That's so fun.

74
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,680
I love it. I love it. I love a good
beanie. I know. You know I love what Ilan,

75
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,830
Ethan brought us the state
going to and I like that one.

76
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,410
I'm going to ask that they send us some
of these so we can wear them. Yeah,

77
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,650
it's the best for winter times
when it gets cold outside.

78
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,790
Put on. You're barely keeping
it together here in Los Angeles.

79
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,540
Actually love those cool mornings.

80
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,730
My mother used to say is crispy outside.
Please be and go.

81
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:35,500
I don't think it's crispy, mom. Well,
you ready to do this? Oh my God,

82
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm so, so much to share,
to share. Let's get going.

83
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,490
Here we go and pool your jeans up.

84
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,300
You don't even do it except for

85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
who is Randy.

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,550
Well, we'll go. We'll
go to your mom's house.

87
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,470
It's here on another
episode of Your Mom's house

88
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,820
so you know what to do. Drop
your genes and rob. Rob,

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,450
did you just come up with it?
Yeah.

90
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,830
How long did it take you to think of that
one in a second here. Really good time.

91
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,770
Thanks. Do you think this
lady is not well? You know,

92
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,430
it's really crazy when you see
somebody like her who looks like it's,

93
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,260
she's on the edge of complete breakdown,

94
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,530
saying come absolute nonsense to this
poor truck driver that look on her face is

95
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:49,950
terrifying. Sure. Uh, it's
that she's driving, right?

96
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,260
How does it drive it?
Drive now they have licenses.

97
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,450
They walk among us like normal people.
I know. I think about that all the time.

98
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,620
This show has informed my opinion
of the mass is so much more.

99
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,490
I know that people like this. I mean,
God bless her. I'm not trying to,

100
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,900
I mean, you know, I don't
want to say that like, uh,

101
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,980
it's hilarious that she's super sick.
Sure.

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,270
But that guy just say that my mom
was crazy and it provided a lot of

103
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:24,300
entertainment, like we were saying before.
Yeah. She'd be like, it's cold outside.

104
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:27,810
It's crispy. I have a lot of crazy
crap. A lot of crazy in my opinion. Yes.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,040
But what I'm saying
is, but sometimes I, I,

106
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,300
I think about how many people out there
and especially on the road, oh yeah.

107
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,600
Are really sick and like
shouldn't be driving nuts.

108
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,750
My Dad used to say it all the time.
Everybody is crazy or on drugs.

109
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,970
It's pretty accurate. Now
I'm like, I think he's right.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,390
I think one of the things you'll
end up telling our boys a lot.

111
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,640
All of like the two of us yeah.
Is like,

112
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,610
you're going to navigate a world
of crazy. Yeah, absolutely.

113
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,560
Just be prepared for
unreasonable people out there.

114
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,280
That's what, there's a lot of out there.
I prepared her constantly. Now your,

115
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,430
or hopefully the boys are, but like
a lot of times if you're not crazy,

116
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,910
you're expecting not or you're expecting
crazy people to be able to reason with

117
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,520
you. That's right. And that's the big
mistake. That's my biggest flaw. That's,

118
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,110
can I tell you something?
It took,

119
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,350
it took me 36 years as an adult and an
end 10 years of therapy to realize that

120
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,950
you can't reason with crazy.
So that's a huge life lesson.

121
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,420
It is a huge life lesson.
There's,

122
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:35,010
I'm almost 40 and that's something that
I've recently come to terms with, right?

123
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,280
That you can't rationalize with
totally fucking greedy people,

124
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,660
but you can have a good
time watching them.

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,040
You could have a fun podcast about them.

126
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,870
And you know, like I, like I said,
I love my mother. I'm just my,

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,840
I'll say it again. And for those you just
tuning in. My mother was mentally ill,

128
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:58,380
she a borderline personality disorders,
schizophrenia.

129
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:02,880
Later in life I got an ass load
of crazy growing up. So, hey man,

130
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,720
don't fucking email me and tell
me how insensitive I am. Uh,

131
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
making fun of this shit cause I'm
entitled to do that. Okay. That's true.

132
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,070
Now her point about truckers being not
so sexed up, I don't know much about,

133
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,710
I mean, listen, I know a lot of people
who drive trucks listened to our show.

134
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,530
God bless him.
I love him.

135
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,070
Now my understanding is
truckers are the nastiest.

136
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,200
I mean they have a nasty reputation.

137
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,410
Say there's probably some really
good wholesome truckers out there.

138
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,700
Of course family are the,

139
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,530
they do have a rep for
getting lizard lots. Right.

140
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,410
And, and you know, being the dirty guys,

141
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:45,090
but I think if some of them are probably
very decent people, most are sure.

142
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,250
But then there's things
like you hear about,

143
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,240
we'll let you have a joke in your act
about going to a certain vent in place.

144
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,230
Video plays and there's holes in walls.
That's primarily, from what I understand,

145
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:59,220
like truckers. Yeah. I mean that was
on a high way in Carolina and yeah,

146
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,300
it probably,

147
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,210
yeah, it probably was, uh, uh,
frequented by some truckers. Yeah.

148
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,270
Well, I'd like to, locals were welcome.
I mean they didn't have a policy.

149
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,850
I mean she, she said some real crazy shit
here to the shirt. She says a lot more,

150
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:17,660
but I'll, I'll just replay it so you
get an idea. Oh boy, that was weird.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,580
She

152
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,413
Warner

153
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,290
she's having a like a vision right now.
Yeah. Yup, Yup, Yup. Four Times. That's a,

154
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,800
that's not a, it's not a lot, but how
did she know it was for, she knows,

155
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,890
she sees that

156
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,750
God said a truck to the side of the road.

157
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,340
Yeah.
I wonder if,

158
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,140
cause my mom too when towards the end of
her life got into Jesus and the Bible.

159
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,300
Yeah. Like I, when we
went there and stuff,

160
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,110
there was a lot of leg underlining
highlighting the Bible and like she'd have

161
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,390
these religious cards kind
of stashed everywhere.

162
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,310
I guess that seems like a pretty common,
that's a lot.

163
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,450
It happens a lot when they
know it will go nutty. Yeah.

164
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,010
So it just went like, I have a
like an atheist relative. Yeah.

165
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,830
Who when he got sick and
he was very much like,

166
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,050
not into religion and everybody around
because he knew it was going to die,

167
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,520
start talking like he knew, he knew it
was gonna, he was gonna die. They're like,

168
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,420
just get back on the

169
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,680
time to start hedging the bet.
And then he's like, all right.

170
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,990
He started to pray and stuff, you know,
it has been, you know, makes sense.

171
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:52,760
So you may as well try, like if
it's, if all that stuff's true. Yeah.

172
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,950
I mean it'll be on the right side of
it. Yeah. Makes Sense. Yeah. I mean, I,

173
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,620
I understand why somebody who,
they're like, you're about to die.

174
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
Do you want to just go ahead
and ask JC if he'll take,

175
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,910
then you probably go like, yeah, all
right. I should believe in Jesus.

176
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:11,590
Now there was that famous writer
who was, uh, an atheist who was, uh,

177
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,940
diagnosed and you know, told he
was terminal and he did, he died.

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,990
No, no, no, no. He's a scientist.
I'm talking about this writer,

179
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,010
a writer who's the most famous, I can't,
I'm drawing a blank on them right now.

180
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,000
And they were like, how about now that
you know you're going to die? He was like,

181
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,060
Nah, he still stayed on. He was
like, go fuck yourself. Yeah.

182
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,590
Well start respect to shit. That was Carl
Sagan on his deathbed. They go, are you,

183
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
do you not believe in God anymore?
He's like, Nah, Bro, I'm fucking,

184
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,980
I'm ride or die atheist all
the way, homie. All the way.

185
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,990
He did the double bird double Burt's.
Yeah.

186
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,380
I gave him the double bird.
Yeah.

187
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,160
He was like, Look Dad Shit
homie. Yeah, go to prison,

188
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,460
prison going to hell.
And I respect it.

189
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,060
I respect the shit out of being like,
no,

190
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,200
I'm not buying it. I'm not,
you know, I used to buy it.

191
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,700
I bought it as a kid and the older I get,
the less I believe it.

192
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,890
Especially since having children
of my own where I'm like,

193
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,930
there's nothing out there.
It is lawless.

194
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,960
It is a ruthless world of nature is
a jungle and you just got to get,

195
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:19,841
I think it's,

196
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,470
I think the big thing about religion
is that it's very comforting to people.

197
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,570
Sure is. I, which I, you know,
you can't criticize that.

198
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,970
If it makes you feel sure it's meaning
and gives you come from like I get it.

199
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,460
But uh, yeah. Can I tell you what
really made me think about, yeah.

200
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,190
How there's no, God is watching
that space movie with Ryan Gosling.

201
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,040
My God. We went to see the,
what's it called? It's called
Ryan got us to the moon.

202
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,810
Ryan Gosling shouldn't wear a shirt.
It's called,

203
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,650
why the fuck did they put him
in a fucking astronaut outfit?

204
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,380
That's why I go see Ryan Gosling.

205
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:58,420
So as he shirtless at some point
and he wasn't even shirtless,

206
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,630
he looked like a regular guy. It was
so upsetting. It's called first man,

207
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,870
first man to shit.
And on the moon.

208
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,530
What one of the big flaws we went
to see first man, by the way,

209
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:13,120
I was ready to leave a few minutes in.
I'm serious.

210
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,460
Stupid. I'm serious. You looked
over at me. I was, it was, no,

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,650
it was like an hour in and I was like,
all right, it's all set up. I get it.

212
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,680
Let's go. I know what's going to
happen is I know it's going to happen.

213
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,940
I know he's going to land on the moon
is going to walk on the moon. I know.

214
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,650
I've seen it. Boring. Boring is
exactly right and I was like,

215
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,050
find aliens that we didn't hear
about before. That wouldn't be none.

216
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,010
The MTV flag was up there. There's some,
it's movies. There's, this is a big thing.

217
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,820
Movies about things you
already know about. That's
tough. I know. It is tougher.

218
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,950
Like that's fucking boring. Newspaper
one we saw, oh my God, that was terrible.

219
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,680
What's her name? The one I love, you know,
she's a fan to everyone's a good heroin.

220
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,430
Meryl Streep.

221
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,510
That's what kept me from falling asleep
is at least they had good accuracy.

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,380
The Post, I think it was us. Jesus.
What a boring fucking movie that was.

223
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,950
How many awards did that piece of
Shane as directed by Spielberg?

224
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,230
Spielberg and it,
you know,

225
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,130
it hit the blueprint of
movie making movie solid.

226
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,020
It's a solid movie in that it follows,
here's the setup,

227
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,160
here's the, you know, the
controversy, here's the resolution.

228
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,150
But you see every scene coming.
You see every line coming. I mean,

229
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:30,560
there's no surprise in that movie,
which is what makes movies fucking boring.

230
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,230
You know what the story is and we
all know what happened with, uh,

231
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,370
what's his name? Lance Armstrong.
When he went to the man. Yeah, man.

232
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:41,990
Lance landed there on his bike and
then he gets off and he's like,

233
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,220
so what if I cheated and he puts a
flag in the moon. Everybody knows,

234
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,410
everybody knows what,
whatever.

235
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,110
Here's the things that I find
very upsetting about the movie.

236
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,500
Ryan Gosling wears a shirt.
He wears a shirt. He fucking,

237
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,040
so they show him peeing on the spacecraft,
which is cool.

238
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,970
Finally we got to see how they learn
and it's a pisses and he shuts and he's

239
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:05,030
like, I pissed. And then, and
it was brown. He goes, oh,

240
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,020
there's so much nitrogen in the
air. And I was like, oh, that makes,

241
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,450
that makes sense. No
shitting. And it's like, okay,

242
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,910
these guys are up in space
for four days to get to them.

243
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,560
That I could take a dump the whole time.
Okay. That's upsetting. Well, I'm serious.

244
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:23,120
Like I know we joke about it on the show.
I know serious shit and space.

245
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,560
They don't tell you and especially do
they eat like Mras like they do in the

246
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:31,310
military to kind of block you up.
That's interesting. Also also,

247
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,940
they don't show the guys jacking off at
all or even talking about it like you

248
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:38,930
know they're, they're thinking about,
of course there's no porn. Of course.

249
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,430
They're like,
what do you need when you're up there?

250
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,230
Obviously that'd be like a top three list.
You know,

251
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,790
if they'd probably be like, oh,
we need fluids to drink the food.

252
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,680
I want music, I want to watch some
porn. I would rearrange that list.

253
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,610
If you were going in his face
first is porn, then food,

254
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,450
then liquid.
I Dunno if that's the order,

255
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,140
but I just feel like it's very misleading.
Once again,

256
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:10,640
Hollywood misleads us into thinking that
there's no jacking off going on in any

257
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,020
facet of life for any type of character.
There's no poop and going on ever.

258
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,400
I mean it's like, well, two,

259
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,090
two guys is why people are not
going to the movies anymore.

260
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,520
Two guys alone in space and nobody's
jerking off. I know. I don't buy it.

261
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,790
I think they're both like, how about a
jerk you off and then I'll check you off.

262
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,050
And then they watch the come float
around because there's no grass and

263
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,150
buzz
buzzes a deck.

264
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,710
And I actually wanted to hear him talk
more. It was an asshole in the movies.

265
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,760
It's interesting. Uh, but here's
my point is I saw that and I,

266
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,840
here's the amazing part
about the moon landing,

267
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:54,090
which you don't think about as
a kid when you hear about it.

268
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,010
It was done in the 60s and when you
think about the level of technology that

269
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,990
existed in the 1960s
we barely had toasters,

270
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,520
refrigerators, blenders, all that
shit was new. They didn't even have a,

271
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,300
you don't have a fucking
cell phone and these dudes,

272
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:17,010
it's all dudes put dudes on the moon and
you know how many men died to get there,

273
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,310
which is pretty crazy part in the movie.
I didn't know that there.

274
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,250
I assumed obviously,
you know,

275
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,310
there's a whole program going
on for years to lead up to this.

276
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,440
I didn't realize how many people died.
No.

277
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:36,441
And how people didn't like the space
program because of it and tested it.

278
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,980
A fire

279
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,020
in one of the space craft before it
even launched, like a test day signed.

280
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,500
The three guys died before
it ever even took off.

281
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:51,330
Cause the fire just spoiler alert.
Well it's not really its history but um,

282
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,090
but that's when you realize stuff
like yeah, there, there is no god.

283
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,500
I mean there's no god.
You see him take steps on the moon.

284
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,590
It feels like you are doing it,
which is so amazing with this movie guys.

285
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:04,500
Go and see it. Uh, I just uh, when they,

286
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,070
when they finally show him taking his
first steps and you feel like your doing

287
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:11,340
it the way that it's shot,
it's just brilliant. Brilliant.

288
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,550
Damien Chazelle uh,

289
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,080
Scott or Josh singer and James Hansen,
the director and the writers.

290
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,970
Here's the question everybody has for
you guys. Right. Where is the company?

291
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,060
This movie is missing a big
portion of interest from us.

292
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,340
I'm being serious though when
they have to Brown. Yeah.

293
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,160
Cause it was there like a flap in
the back, like old timey pajamas,

294
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,210
you know like the poop,
the poop shoot flat cartoon pajamas.

295
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,050
Is that how the they do it?
Well maybe we don't know.

296
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,830
We don't know cause these guys decided
to get lazy and not tell us anything.

297
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,410
Yeah. And again, I'm bummed that Ryan
Gosling kind of look like a regular guy.

298
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,400
Like they live in light them all nice.
And he looked like a totally normal dude.

299
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,410
Yeah. It was upsetting. No body
shots. No. Yeah, none. I was thinking,

300
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:11,460
because what I heard before we went to
the movie was that there was a scene

301
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:16,080
where he's on a couch on all fours and
that he took his wife's head and he put

302
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,610
it behind and forced her to,
you know,

303
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,650
he described service from behind. Yeah.
That'd be a cool scene. I heard that too.

304
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,470
That that's how he was
chosen for the space program.

305
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,030
Do you think Eva Mendez Itas
crumb was Ryan Gosling Nasty,

306
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,260
nasty as hell. Why you think she's
so nasty? They got two kids too.

307
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:42,030
I think they do. She just looks kinda
nasty. Oh my gosh. Does nasty things.

308
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,650
Really? She looked like she
down. Hmm. I don't know.

309
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,060
You tell me you're the one that
bangs hose loves her. I mean,

310
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,670
you're the one who's always like
Ryan Gosling, Ryan Gosling Creek.

311
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,710
I'd lick his butt hole. I
would, he looks on selling.

312
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,290
Do you think that she does if,
yeah,

313
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,210
if he's his hairless as I think
he is and he looks really clean.

314
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,590
He just looks like he smells nice all
the time. Yeah, I would, I would do it.

315
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,230
Just how rob,

316
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,030
you know how Robin Wright Penn has that
air of her that she's really clean and

317
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,890
that her butthole, is it Robin Wright
Penn's still or just running right?

318
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,510
Probably just Robin Wright and she
looks like her butthole doesn't smell.

319
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,440
What is it? That shit come
back. I know. How so far?

320
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,770
How's The forest with no Kevin
Spacey to kill dummy. Here it goes.

321
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:27,280
Your career shit bag. God Man. Savage. Oh,

322
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:31,720
that's the price you paid the
price you pay for being dudes. Um,

323
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,550
speaking of touching dudes,
there's no segue for that. But, uh,

324
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,340
well we have a lot of updates
in the cigarette household.

325
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,300
Should we finish this clip first? Oh,
I didn't know it was not finished.

326
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,610
I just want to get to work
days before guests come

327
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,680
specious ladies making.
Okay.

328
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,860
[inaudible]

329
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,840
know. It kind of reminds me of, yeah,

330
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,340
that sounds like him when
he gives these speeches.

331
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,640
It's really off of his lithium.
Right.

332
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,710
Well he said he just stopped taking
his medication. Oh yeah. Yeah,

333
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,560
she definitely did too.
Yeah,

334
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,360
that's the problem my mom refused to
take stuff to and that's when things had

335
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:41,220
southware.
Yeah,

336
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,290
I thought they were going to spell it out.
Like Electric Company.

337
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,060
She's still checking or song.

338
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,480
Oh Man. Yeah. That is
really unfortunate. Mm hmm.

339
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,140
Speaking of scrum, here's a message
we got. Hey Tim and crystal.

340
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,920
I have been with my girlfriend
for just over eight months now.

341
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,600
At one month I asked her what her favorite
thing in the bedroom was and she said

342
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:26,570
getting her scrum licked
as an ass eating virgin.

343
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,980
I was excited to try it out and we
both love it. Fast forward a week.

344
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:34,430
She asked me in the shower if I
would like to have my scrum licked.

345
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,880
This was a huge curve ball is I was not
prepared for an instantly declined at a

346
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:45,401
politeness because as a man I don't
have the prettiest asshole every day was

347
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,000
I pondered what it could possibly
feel like if she likes it so much,

348
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:55,001
then why would nine two one two months
went by of me thinking about it.

349
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,790
Just about every day I finally asked
her to dive in what we were showering.

350
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,410
It truly changed my life. Hands
down. The best feeling ever.

351
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,300
Nine months in our relationship
is stronger than ever and
I really believe it is

352
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,770
because of ass eating.

353
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,280
The fact that crystal has not eaten
Tim's ass saddens me and I cannot stand

354
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:19,520
listening to her,
the climate every time it's brought up.

355
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,910
A couple of days ago I asked her the Ftt
RTD question and she would not turn me

356
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:29,480
in. I believe her answer is a
direct correlation to eating my ass.

357
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,140
So Timmy,
if you want to change Crystal's answer,

358
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,950
you have to start with
her eating your app.

359
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,790
Thanks from Canada's national
capitol. Oh really? Interesting.

360
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,210
Ottawa, Ottawa. Yeah. Well
that's a interesting, okay.

361
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,410
It's just theory. Yeah. I just
think got to get in there.

362
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:54,560
Yeah. Um, somebody a asked
a couple episodes back.

363
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:56,240
This is an email,
a few episodes back.

364
00:24:56,241 --> 00:25:00,200
You talked about due to like to have their
ball squeeze during sex and wondering

365
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:03,140
exactly what the turn was.
Well, I am one of those guys.

366
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,790
My wife knows that I like it when she
grabs my sack and just gradually squeezes

367
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,890
harder and harder and kill.
I can't take it anymore.

368
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,790
Part of it is pleasure and
pain and the other part of it,

369
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:18,440
what makes it a huge turn on is just
that this person who was about 75 pounds

370
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,420
lighter than me is
completely controlling me.

371
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,040
I will literally do anything she asks
me to do because my balls are completely

372
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,940
at her mercy. For some reason, that gets
me going like nothing else. My wife,

373
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,690
who probably was super confused the first
time I took her hand and squeezed it

374
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:37,691
down on my nuts now realizes what power
she has and is also totally into it.

375
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,010
Unrelated note.
She was also not a ride or die wife.

376
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,140
Like how's he murdered a Barista?

377
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,520
He returned my swollen ball asking
to the police without second thought.

378
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:52,580
That's Nate from Milwaukee.
Get Ne. That's nice. Well,

379
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:56,870
I'm glad that that does shed some
light on the, uh, experience here.

380
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,011
It's makes sense.

381
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:01,740
It's kind of a power thing and he
likes that vulnerability of it.

382
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,960
Makes Sense. Yeah. Sorry, are you saying
you want me to squeeze your nuts tonight?

383
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,490
Uh, I okay. Yeah, that's
what saying. Sure. Yeah.

384
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,230
Who's that? There you go.
It's time for that. Yup. Oh,

385
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:19,610
genes. All right, here we go. Uh,

386
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,240
oh gosh. You know what? I did, sorry.
Talk for a second. I got to find it. Okay.

387
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:25,160
I'll talk for a second.
I did the wrong thing.

388
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,340
I'm very much looking forward to this
unplanned thing that you told me will

389
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,760
happen tonight now. So I'm pretty
much very much appreciate it. Okay.

390
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,400
Um, so we've had a really
interesting couple of days,

391
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,360
really months with this dog. Oh,
stop it. I hate that dog right now.

392
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,250
I love her again when I fucking hated her.

393
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,340
I know this dog has pretty
much once a month had diarrhea,

394
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,070
but we tell them the neatest part about
the Cayenne and what time it happens.

395
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:02,260
Yeah. It's always between like
two and four in the morning. Yeah.

396
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,320
Never any other time.

397
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,450
The need part is that you have the
ability to sleep through everything. Yeah,

398
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,300
I do.
You sleep through baby's crying,

399
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,640
but it's not selective dogs
having diarrhea. Sleep. You
can't get mad at anyone,

400
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,860
but I'm the one that has to
deal with the goddamn dog.

401
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,630
Here's the cool thing that
happened the other day. Kills me.

402
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,370
So a lot of times the older
boy who's two and a half, uh,

403
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,870
he'll pop up in the middle of the night,

404
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,140
stand in his crib and just
like yell or cry. You know, I,

405
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,890
I assume he's had a nightmare
or he's just awake, you know,

406
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,810
found himself awake and
wants to be comforted.

407
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,110
So typically I go downstairs at that
time and it will be anywhere from 1130 at

408
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:50,820
night to five o'clock in the morning.
It's just, it's just whenever,

409
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,470
it's not every night, but it's, you know,

410
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:57,270
it's semi regularly eventful evenings
and around. So the other night it's,

411
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:57,870
uh,

412
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,280
it's about five in the morning and he
starts screaming and I hear him on the

413
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,880
Monitor and so sit up and I'm like,
God damn.

414
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:09,070
Cause I was in a deep
sleep. I know. All right.

415
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,190
I go downstairs and I like how you go.
Like I know I'll always,

416
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,170
yeah, I look like, I like how
you're upset that I slept subset,

417
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,870
that you get to sleep. Such a selfish
person. But anyways, I go down there,

418
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,320
I pick them up Iraq, um, you
know, I call him him. He,

419
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,520
he gets relaxed in 10 seconds,
so relax.

420
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,460
And then I just stay with him for a
few minutes. I'm like, all right buddy,

421
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,260
we gotta go back to sleep. And
he's like, okay, put them back in,

422
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,670
walk upstairs and you know, you're,
you're more awake than you want to be.

423
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,210
Cause it's like five now. And I'm
like, fuck, I gotta go back to sleep.

424
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,680
And as I'm walking in,
I walk in the bedroom,

425
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,860
I'm walking to the bathroom,

426
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:57,150
so I'm going to brush my teeth before
I go back to bed. As I'm walking there,

427
00:28:57,151 --> 00:29:00,240
I smelled like there is shit
and this room right now.

428
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,180
So you go like, how's fuck you're in
bed. You're like, how's Ellis? I'm like,

429
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,270
there's shit in the room right
now. And you're like, what?

430
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:12,300
And I go turn on the light.
You turn the line on.

431
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,260
The dog was just so, so
odd. It was horrible.

432
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,290
Had Shit on the like put her ass up to
the edge of the crate and slept and shit

433
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,200
through the crate.
Now for a long time our dogs,

434
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,860
shit or shit slept with us in bed.

435
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,810
But during the pregnancy it was like so
disruptive to your sleep that we just,

436
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,260
we have, you know, dog beds,
they like it in there. It's not,

437
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,590
or not hurting anything. So
the dog though, this is odd,

438
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,020
you had actually heard her moving around.
So here's the thing,

439
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,310
I was up at 2:00 AM pumping my tits,
so 3:00 AM I hear her.

440
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:52,830
She never actually asked
to be let out of the crate,

441
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,510
which she does is she just kind of sniffs.
She'll be like,

442
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,760
like she'll breathe a little
weirdly and she'll kind of like, ah,

443
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,720
like make like a yawning
stress. Yawn sound. Yeah.

444
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,610
And that's how I know it's time
to let her out. She doesn't act,

445
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:06,720
she never paused at the crate.

446
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:11,490
So it's a very subtle sounds that if I
don't hear them it can be fucking really

447
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:14,610
bad. So I heard the sounds
at three in the morning,

448
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,850
I walk over to her and I'm like,
do you want to go potty girl?

449
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:21,300
Do you want to go potty? And she looked
at me like, bitch, why did you wake me up?

450
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,710
Like she did not want to go potty. So that
I thought great. I went back to sleep,

451
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,540
heard Ellis pop up and then you
came back and she fucking shit.

452
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,770
She stuck her ass like you said. And not
just any shit. This is the neat part.

453
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:37,710
Yeah it is dog diarrhea.
It's so,

454
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,030
it's like liquid mushy shit.

455
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,660
And she did it in two corners of the
crazy sad and the other dog is like,

456
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,930
beef is like bitch,
the fuck are,

457
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,070
you can tell he's backed up.
Yeah. He's like Nah. Yeah.

458
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,970
When I opened the door he
hops out like over her shit.

459
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,370
So then we like again, at this point
it's like five 15 in the morning.

460
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,110
We get gloves late. I got the
whole setup, the latex glove,

461
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:12,570
garbage bags, spray spray. It's
fucking horrible man wipes.

462
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,560
And so we're cleaning trash bags,
diarrhea, shit at five 15 in the morning.

463
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,390
So we, I wrap up the dog bed that's
covered in shit throwing trash bucket.

464
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,390
We finally get like the shit in a bag.

465
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,010
And as I'm standing like, like all
right, now let's go back to bed.

466
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,020
The fucking smoke alarm, smoke
detector goes off downstairs. Yeah.

467
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,880
So I run downstairs. Am I trying to
find which smoke detectors going off?

468
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,160
It's in our older boys' room. Oh my
God. So I opened the door and it smells,

469
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,230
it smells like burning
rubber burning. Right. Smells
smoky. Yeah. And so I'm like,

470
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:51,820
Oh shit. And before, I mean,

471
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:56,710
I grab him and before I even turn around,
you're already like,

472
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,820
hell yeah. You're like, yeah,
at the house right now, Dude,

473
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,550
within a couple of minutes,
firefighter, you know what I say?

474
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,790
I call the fire department and I was like,
get over here right now.

475
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,330
I got two babies in this house.
Something's on fire. Hurry up, hurry up.

476
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,660
And there'll, and I'm never called the
fire department in my life. So I was like,

477
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,080
this is crazy. And I told him, I got two
babies, I got two babies. You gotta hurry,

478
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,700
you gotta hurry. And
they're like, well ma'am,

479
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:21,880
get the babies out of the house right now.
So of course we gather up the babies,

480
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:25,390
we're going out to the porch. But
it was amazed. They showed up.

481
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,080
I showed up quickly, so fast. It's
amazing. Fire Department. I mean,

482
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,750
firefighters are just amazing
people. But, and there

483
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,000
came full alarms. Oh, sirens,

484
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,300
fire firetrucks like trucks,
the paramedic ambulance,

485
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,420
and then the fire truck van all show up.

486
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,260
These guys come storming in with axes.
Yeah, I mean, and they were Jews there.

487
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,450
They were ready to go. They're
like, where's the fire? And anyways,

488
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,060
within seconds they calm
down and they're like,

489
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,790
does your heat just run
for like the first time?

490
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,320
And yeah,

491
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:09,410
it's a new heater and we just had it up
to then and then the fire guy goes, well,

492
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,010
it's because it's brand new and it's
burning off all the residue and stuff in

493
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,680
there. It's, it's an Hvac situation. Yeah.

494
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,500
I was so embarrassed and I'm standing
here in my jammies and I'm like,

495
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:23,180
I'm so sorry. I was, I was outside
showing a Ellis the fire truck.

496
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,740
I was like looking at the lights and
he was like, oh, oh, oh. He loved it.

497
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,770
You loved it. That was the coolest
thing ever that he woke up to do that.

498
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,240
I was mortified,

499
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,310
but I wouldn't have called had the
alarm in my son's room not gone off. No.

500
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,930
It's scary to,
in the moment,

501
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,070
it's also five o'clock in the morning
and your brain's kind of scrambling.

502
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,000
You don't know what's happening.

503
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,100
The next thing that happened was they
left and then now it's like five 45 yeah.

504
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,710
And then our kid is like, can
we play now? And I was like,

505
00:33:56,711 --> 00:34:00,500
I know you were going back to bed.
And he was like, oh come on man.

506
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,830
And that took another 20 minutes
to get to use all freaked out.

507
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:11,540
I was like, you couldn't tell somebody
like you couldn't script this happening.

508
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,920
The hidden crying dog shit,
smoke detector,

509
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,400
fire department back.
I mean it was the worst night.

510
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
And then two nights later the dog got
diarrhea again and I was up all night with

511
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,930
that mother fuck dog.

512
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,970
So I took bitsy to the vet again cause we,

513
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,870
we thought it was because
she was eating stuff.

514
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,730
It turns out she has
inflammatory bowel disorder,

515
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:42,080
disease, whatever it is for different than
traditional IBS. Ibs is psychological.

516
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,130
They say it's stress related,

517
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:47,890
but she doesn't have diarrhea when she
gets groomed or anything unrelated to to

518
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:51,980
that. So get something in
Brussels. They're great dogs.

519
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,220
But I think genetically she's got some
stuff that dog's butt hole has been the

520
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:02,990
only problem with his dog is to togs
asshole. Let's um, yeah. So anyways,

521
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:07,280
we put her down yesterday.
Our guest is here, she's here,

522
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,020
she's going to be on a new diet.

523
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,400
And I'm giving her hemp oil twice
a day and hopefully in a new food,

524
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:17,180
a softer food that's going to help
her. So, uh, our guest is here though.

525
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,270
Let's take a quick break and grab him.
All right.

526
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:25,271
We're back and we have with us
our guests preferred pronouns.

527
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,610
He him post transition.

528
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:33,030
One of my favorite comedians
in the world. Also. Uh,

529
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,480
one of the stars of,
we've mentioned many times.

530
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:38,160
I need you to kill the comedy

531
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,160
documentary directed by j Elvis Weinstein
that's available on Amazon prime.

532
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,400
Uh, multiple standup albums, male,

533
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,350
multiple television appearances,

534
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:54,351
a new special that was just shot that
will be coming to you somewhere soon.

535
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,300
You'll announce when you
have all the information.

536
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,710
It is the great Chad Daniels.
Hi everyone.

537
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,110
[inaudible]

538
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,920
Chad,
Danny

539
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,670
[inaudible].

540
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,900
There you go. You're so funny.
You're the best. Thank you guys.

541
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,280
And you're one of those people that more
people need to know about it's time.

542
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,390
It's time. I love when he used to talk
about your wife drinking red wine.

543
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,320
Oh Shit. What was the red wine? Her teeth.

544
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:31,690
It'd be all purple and gross.
So many great jokes.

545
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,490
He's one of the great joke writers,
so that's nice.

546
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,380
It's funny because people will
come up and they'll be like, hey,

547
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,850
can you do this bit tonight?
I'd like to see me before a show.

548
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,310
I can't because I'm divorced
and don't talk about her.

549
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,470
It's just not fair. Do you have a lot of
divorce material? I don't have any. Any.

550
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,310
Uh Huh. Do you do that purposefully?
Because well, it's just like her.

551
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:55,540
It's her life, you know? So if
it's not 100% my story to tell,

552
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,370
then I don't tell it. What's it
do you mean because you have kids,

553
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:03,970
do you still interact? Right? Absolutely.
Yeah. She was eight blocks away.

554
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,640
We live in the same town
style. Wow. Split custody.

555
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:11,170
So we have to talk about a kid's
schedules and cod. I feel like,

556
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,100
not that it's definitely not
the biggest part of divorce,

557
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:19,360
but isn't one of the things that
when you remove the emotional stuff,

558
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,510
you know,
aside the logistics of scheduling,

559
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,590
is that one of the things you're like,

560
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:26,410
God damn it that like you didn't plan
on when you divorced, you're like,

561
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,880
I gotta I gotta set up Tuesday.
Yeah, Tuesday worked out.

562
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,111
You know what I mean?

563
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:36,440
It is tough that the hardest part was
watching my daughter come over with like

564
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,340
her laundry basket and
it's like, I go, well,

565
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:43,780
why don't you put those in the dresser so
it's not such a pain for you? She goes,

566
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:46,210
well, I mean I have to bring it back
and forth. And I was like, Oh God,

567
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,540
I fucking hardest breaking.
You know what?

568
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:54,570
I will buy one of each for one here and
one there and then you don't have to

569
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:59,120
bring shit back and forth.
Now that's the sad part is the worst.

570
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:01,170
But let's talk about the good part.
Say

571
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,240
that new post doc, I wish
what? Like a divorce too late.

572
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,370
Everybody's like, oh, you're
divorced. Sorry. And then
just absolutely. Really true.

573
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,930
You're not getting it in second wife
Tom and I keep talking about what his

574
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:20,470
second wife,
we're hoping that I get like a Dalmatian,

575
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,060
you know like the girl,

576
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:28,420
you're so funny and her and her brain
growth outgrows her skull and she goes

577
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:30,770
crazy. I know. That's
what happens to Dalmatian.

578
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,480
They're adorable. This puppy is
amazing. Yeah. When they're three,

579
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,770
their brain outgrows their skull and I

580
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,590
conscious,
yeah,

581
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,710
I want to get that girl who's just
like, hey, you have guns show.

582
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,170
She's like, I got a hand bat live
at time. And I'm like, that's great.

583
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,400
And then I'm like, anyways. And she's
like, ah, a blowjob time. I'm like, yeah.

584
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,190
And then just, and then
she's like, I'll go to,

585
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,850
I'll go the other room so he could sleep.
Watch your football demands on you.

586
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,950
Ever,

587
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,060
Absolutely. Takes care of everything for
you. Yeah. I could be like fucking go.

588
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,120
I have just work for Alaska going on
a football game trip with my friends.

589
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:26,640
She's like, I have a a labia. Where do
you find, is there a second workshop?

590
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,160
I think they're just out there.
They're there on the road. Their road.

591
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,970
Biebs Phoenix, let's be, yeah,

592
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,690
that road beams out there waiting for you.

593
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,960
Houston there and FEMA and hot places.

594
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,780
There's Tampa Tampa's our headquarters.
Well, I picked northern Minnesota

595
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,220
where everybody gets the pretty girl
from dairy queen gets married at 17 and

596
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:57,640
fucking stays married forever. That's
right. It's a problem. Seriously.

597
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:02,240
You need to relocate where the hot
sluts live. Yeah. Listen, four years,

598
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,960
four years and it'll be here.
So cow. Yeah, I think so.

599
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,620
This weather is unbelievable.

600
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,470
My daughter's a freshman and I might
homeschooler from here sophomore through

601
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:18,700
senior year. So Nice. Maybe.
Um, yeah, I know. So nice here.

602
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,020
It really is. I always say whether it's
underrated when people are like, oh yeah,

603
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:26,560
the weather is like, no, no, no.
Whether his life dictates everything.

604
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,880
When you can go outside.
I mean,

605
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:32,020
it's going to be gray for
nine months where I'm at. I
did my fucking living room,

606
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,260
sky blue,
which is not recommended by anyone.

607
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,660
Only to have blue in my life. Had
a winter. Yeah. Yeah, Bro. Listen,

608
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:44,170
we got sunshine Avocados.
You've had one of those before,

609
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,400
not one that's ready to eat. What
if, what if Chad's whole cynical,

610
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,430
shitty take on everything is just tied
to living in first fault and that he

611
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:57,820
moves down here and he'll be like,
I have a banana every morning,

612
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:02,290
and then his act has turned into like
this. You guys ever rent a Prius?

613
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,550
Everyone's like, what happened
to you? He's like, I don't
know. I feel great. Yeah,

614
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,590
that's his whole acronym.
So happy.

615
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,610
I want it to happen.
I want it to happen.

616
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:17,080
So we've got to keep you from getting
second wife Puss in another town so that

617
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,540
you actually come to southern
California so we can be around you.

618
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,300
I'm telling you, I don't,
it just isn't. It's not a,

619
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,660
people see me on stage and I'm like,

620
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,550
he's grumpy and he has a grown man child,

621
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,630
so we don't need to talk to
him after this. Let's go try
this. So hard to believe.

622
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,990
I really do. It's real. Now you got

623
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,620
to put out the don't.
You got to lace it into the material.

624
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:41,630
Never ever going to do that. Have you ever
seen a fucking divorced comic onstage?

625
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,900
Yeah. Will I learn this new, uh,
you know, bud fucking and it's

626
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,320
office. You sit there and you're
like, are you trolling right now?

627
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,380
I've seen that it's also seen the not
well hidden attempt to get laid with like,

628
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,320
and that's why I don't ever, I
never get to any sex, you know?

629
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:07,190
And then they pull it
out there.

630
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,330
Ladies, you guys are the superior sex, am
I right? And then the pandering to how,

631
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,270
how great women are. Yeah. The fake
feminist. That's my favorite move.

632
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,990
I can't believe that they told you guys
I'm staying at the courtyard Marriott.

633
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,820
I'm in room six oh nine.

634
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,330
And they just open with believe
all women. You're like, how come

635
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,190
I can't chat that exactly.

636
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,020
I want to be in my second marriage.

637
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,830
I want to be the frivolous older
housewife woman who has not a care in the

638
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:48,460
world. Like you've seen her on
reality shows where she's like,

639
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,680
like everything's funny and I just,

640
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,600
I just need to buy a grill
for $5,000 whole life is like,

641
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:00,170
I got to get Amanda here. You're
constantly remodeling. Yeah.

642
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,980
Every year you're like, ah, this
house, it just doesn't feel right.

643
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,720
This kitchen, it's not like what
I'm cooking. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:12,554
And then they're like,

645
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,310
that's what I want you to know that
there's such thing as a chef's kitchen.

646
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,520
And then you're like, what? And
then your husband just like,

647
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:22,190
just build what you want.
That's what I'll have you like.

648
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,240
Do you know there's such
thing as a chef and fucking

649
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,290
fucking cooking lessons bay, but I'm
drunk all the time. I'm always brunching.

650
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,880
You're just like wine buzzed all day.

651
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,430
And the husband worked so hard
just to keep me in the world.

652
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:43,730
You know that I don't see him.
We don't even have a relationship's fine.

653
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,420
You spend recklessly,
epically, recklessly.

654
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,900
So I wanted to be an epic once every
few months. He was like, I mean,

655
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,620
600 grand on the AMX cheese, but don't
I look good sweetie? Pretty true.

656
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,270
And it's cheaper to keep her
head and he puts you behind each.

657
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,560
Just say I'm a be home.

658
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:09,450
Keep me then to divorce me. That's why
he keeps me. Yeah, it's true. Yeah.

659
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:14,430
It has a fair isn't it's fine cause I'm
not giving them a second wife works.

660
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:19,150
That's so great. No, that's how it works.

661
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,330
You guys are really setting this up.
Not a great life.

662
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,900
You know when you make to California,
you're going to find your second.

663
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,153
He's going to get pissy.

664
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,420
Where's it going? Or if I'm not
sperm vine sued. Everybody listening.

665
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,590
Go see Chad Daniels Irvine. This drops
your listing. Yeah. You have time.

666
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:43,820
If you're listening right
now as it comes out tomorrow,

667
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,450
Wednesday night he's going to be in
Irvine and the Irvine Improv looking for

668
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:53,100
love or different. Really?
He's not looking for one.
Making this seem so sad. No.

669
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:57,640
Can someone say hi to Chad Tomas Hog?

670
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,950
He likes his balls tugged right hard.
Do you like pulled hard?

671
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,240
We just read an email about pulling hard.
I have really sensitive nuts.

672
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:11,670
So yeah, so you're like no
thanks. It's like just keep it up.

673
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,810
Just keep it above the
sac. Yeah. Above this.

674
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,400
So you don't want like, you don't want
to like that. They're just real sense.

675
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,440
I don't know. Like there are
always bruised or something.

676
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,840
I don't know what's going on
and I got to have a sec to me.

677
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:28,490
And zero problems didn't hurt no pain.
They uh,

678
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,800
talked to Tom about this cause I, I
need this to happen. You had paint. Oh,

679
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:35,820
you haven't gotten one? No.
Yeah, I can't have another kid.

680
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,430
Yeah, it's something in a,
in a jar and then freeze it.

681
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,560
If you want to have another with your
second wife are having more children.

682
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,090
Are you sure baby man,
I wanted a

683
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,360
sperm set.
Call

684
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,750
it a dinosaur. It sounded
kind of like it, right?

685
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,350
Walk us through the process.
Yeah, we went in and the guy, uh,

686
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,310
he has an APP. He's like a accent. He's
a, by the way, is this in Ferguson?

687
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,270
Do you have a setup appointment
before this to like, yeah.

688
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:21,720
So you have to go in and I'm asking you,
you have to go in and get the consult.

689
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,310
And during the consult though, he
said, uh, because of a vasectomy,

690
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,510
you can speed up cancer in your
crotch area. Why everywhere prostate?

691
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,940
I don't know. Well, here's the thing.

692
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,380
Don't tell people that this is
true because I don't know if he,

693
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,880
maybe he was just fucking with me. Maybe
in a small town, maybe he was just like,

694
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,500
oh, funny man. Huh. Right. But
anyways, yeah. So he gave me the,

695
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:51,250
you want cancer, prostate, prostate exam,

696
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,100
and then I went in and it's like people
I went to high school with or the nurses.

697
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,000
Oh Christ.

698
00:46:57,001 --> 00:47:02,001
So you're sitting there
with a shaved everything.

699
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,330
Right. It's freezing in the
room. Not an excuse. Right.

700
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,440
Uh, but it's just weird. Yeah,
of course. Falls. Remember when,

701
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,350
remember when we had creative writing
together and they're like moving your dick

702
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:18,240
to the other leg and you're like,
cool, this is so comfortable, man.

703
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,560
I've never seen my dick as small as
I've seen it in a doctor's office.

704
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,950
You know? It is funny. It's like
I've looked down and been like,

705
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,990
you've gotta be kidding me. Then
this is just like for a physical, I,

706
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,050
I'll feel like I got to fluff
this a little bit just for
like my own self esteem.

707
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:36,340
You really think he's looking at you and
I don't think so. I think I'm just like,

708
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:38,320
what the fuck? I'm better
than this, you know?

709
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,760
Do you think about like nakedness and Ah,

710
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,890
I think I'm just more like just smacking
around. Yeah, just smack around.

711
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,880
Just to give it like,
just some dignity. I mean,

712
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:56,881
I've seen it literally a new level of
small in a doctor's office when you have

713
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:58,400
to Wipe when you pee.

714
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:06,250
Do we have a concave Dick
Right now? What's going on?
I mean like retreats inside.

715
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,930
I've never seen it. I think it's because
of the medical atmosphere and you know,

716
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:15,250
you're a little, you know, somebody
poking and prodding. Yeah. You're nervous.

717
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,690
It's cold. It's always fucking cold.
Yeah. I got embarrassed when my doctor,

718
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:20,790
I was like nine months pregnant.

719
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:25,150
My doctor was examining me and I farted
right in his hands and I was like,

720
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:28,430
I just, I farted on you. He's like,
it's okay. I remember that. No,

721
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,350
I was there the the time after and he's
like, farts happen. Everybody farts.

722
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,490
But he's still talking about it somehow.
Yeah. Two months later, two months,

723
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,990
two months, 11 months pregnant.
That's, I'm not going to match.

724
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,700
So weight on the, so the console is, he
gives you, he's like, you're gonna die.

725
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,140
And then he, he gives you a further exam
and he was like, okay, sum up the deal.

726
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,170
Really Healy, I have to
tell you, have you ever,

727
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,910
he lubed up the whole
glove and I actually said,

728
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:02,110
my insurance is not going to pay for
all that because there was a doll up.

729
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,060
You know what a dollop is? That requires a
spoon. Yeah. And it was, I was just like,

730
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:10,930
what in the fuck. So he goes,
elbows on the desk. It wasn't,

731
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:15,210
I still don't think this is what should
have happened because it was so weird.

732
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,930
Elbows on the desk and he just goes
in now why is the thumb, I don't know.

733
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,140
Well, maybe it was, I don't know. I guess
I wasn't looking, but I assumed phone.

734
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,160
That's what I would've done. Wow.
So he fingers, you're be home. Yup.

735
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:34,590
And then when you come so
hard all over and he goes,

736
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,200
that's not cancer.
That's just a great time.

737
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,130
I had to go like,
did it come out and do this morning?

738
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:47,190
Did he take his nails and then gently
prod right in between my shoulder blades.

739
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,810
He bunched up my shirt and
twisted it and I was like, Ooh,

740
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,790
I like this a lot. So console, he's
like, you're good to go. Your asshole,

741
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,900
your balls, everything's good.
Yup. And then you come back.

742
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,170
He said it like that cause that your
asshole, you're bald, everything's good.

743
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,210
Come back. How long later? Next week?
Maybe two weeks. Something like that.

744
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,300
And so what's the day like when you
go, is there a preppy, he's like,

745
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:16,900
don't eat before. Like how does
it go? You can do whatever.

746
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:19,780
You just have to shave
everything. Everything. Yep.

747
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:27,160
Nope, but taint twigging Mary's, I
like to get maybe halfway down. Yeah,

748
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,110
I got long taint hair
when I'm in the shower.

749
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,960
Sometimes I'll go down and I'll
look at it. I'll just see like,

750
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,120
I mean everyone does

751
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,370
when you walk, it's like when you wash a
dog though, the hair always looks longer.

752
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:43,230
That's true. That's true. It's
like a dog's beard. Hang. Yeah.

753
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,990
From my tank always looks longer cause
it's like altogether and then pointing

754
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:50,090
down the water's got to go some gravity.
Let's blame it on gravity.

755
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,810
So you go, you go in, you're all shaved
and then he's just like, how does it,

756
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:56,730
how does it, how does it
start? Like what was he like?

757
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,990
Okay,
it looks like the opening scene of up,

758
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,730
there's two ladies in there and then uh,
they strapped

759
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,530
you down. No, I'm just kidding.

760
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,800
But they just, you know,
they tell you don't move,

761
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,870
don't touch anything and
then you can smell it.

762
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,980
You can smell the Qataris
cauterizing catheterization.

763
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,900
Clearly they do Nami that they shoot
you in the, in the vast with the local

764
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,620
cool. But the vast, the
vast offerings. So, okay.

765
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,410
You feel it. You feel different. Zach,

766
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,960
Zach Efron and injection.
Yeah.

767
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:36,810
You feel that and then after that
you don't feel anything. Right.

768
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,370
But you do smell. Yeah, you
can smell when there long.

769
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,150
Does that help procedure take,
I don't know, 20 minutes maybe.

770
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,800
No soreness afterwards.

771
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,040
Why you had to sit on a bag of peas and
I didn't lift anything for the weekend.

772
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,880
But otherwise that's, that's it. And then
how many jackets do you have to Jack?

773
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,790
Before,
I think I had to bring in three samples

774
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,790
to make sure there's no swimmers.

775
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:03,430
The Crystal meth before you Jack,

776
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,260
take crystal meth. And whenever I
see that sounds really easy town.

777
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,020
That doesn't sound too bad
for me.

778
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,550
It was, I mean, your kids are little.
So if you ha if you start over,

779
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,630
no, that's not, I mean, I have a 19 year
old, the 14 year old, that'd be nice.

780
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:26,000
So you throw a fucking baby into that
negative. And where's the bridge? Yeah,

781
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:30,270
for me, not that I'm not a monster. Right,
right. But you would definitely be like,

782
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,840
there goes my life. Well, I mean, imagine,

783
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:39,000
imagine four years left on your prison
sentence and then you shoot somebody in

784
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:42,150
the yard and they're like, you're
here forever now. I mean, that's,

785
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,330
that's how I think about it. I mean,
if, what if you got someone? Yeah.

786
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,780
So now you can't get someone pregnant.
I sure can't. Yeah. And you got,

787
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,620
you tested that a few times
and I've called in and I go,

788
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,730
so do I need to test us like every
six months and a they go, you don't,

789
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,650
and I'll just bring it in anyways.
I'm like, can we make sure we really,

790
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,640
absolutely nuts. And Robbie left and
right. It sounds like it's not road beef.

791
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,230
It's just me needing an excuse to
jerk off and feeling whole about it.

792
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,650
Oh, I see. Wow. So was Tom. I'm,

793
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,130
are we doing this or what? Doing
what? Oh, you're getting snips.

794
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:20,590
I'll get snipped please. Uh,

795
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,920
let's do a live remote from there. How
about December? Since I'm a home from

796
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,690
scratch. Seriously. I would love that.

797
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:31,140
I've been on birth control since I
was 15 and I can't do it anymore.

798
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,210
But you know, they'll make you do mouth
checks. That's what the doctrine is.

799
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,320
Taste test. You have to go like, yeah,

800
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:39,800
there's nothing in there that can get
me pregnant. You have to do it like, oh,

801
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:40,830
okay.

802
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:41,641
Can I just tell you,

803
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:46,641
you just blew my mind because I burped
and kept it in my throat and then you

804
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:49,110
burped in. The noise came through
and I was like, did I just fucking

805
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,340
Melton
respectful exact same time.

806
00:53:56,341 --> 00:54:00,980
I kept it in my throat. God. Oh,
that was nuts. That is got it.

807
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,873
Crazy

808
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,570
synergy. Synergy. Oh wait, two
people bourbon fart at the same time.

809
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:09,430
It's really magical stuff.
You guys are really good friends.

810
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:15,100
We're sinked up our cycle. Do you
have any weird porns that you're into?

811
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,170
Like are you into watch and weird stuff?

812
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,190
I don't and it's gotten to the point,
no weird kinks.

813
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:26,200
It's almost the opposite of that where,
you know,

814
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:31,180
something will be on and then I'll just
have to stop and be like, wait a second.

815
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,650
That's his real mom. Not like a step. I
can't watch this shit. That's disgusting.

816
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,560
I was watching two Russians, one, or
excuse me, two Germans one time and uh,

817
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:45,410
I was all ready to go.
Everything locked and loaded and uh,

818
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,840
and one of the ladies looked at the
other one and goes, sucks these tits,

819
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:54,250
you bitch. And I couldn't stop laughing
and I just was like, well, this is done.

820
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,690
Yeah, I wish we had that audio for
this show. It's you bitches. Great.

821
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,040
I laughed. So goddamn on.
Yeah, there's weird stuff

822
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,810
that's like bald porn.
But we had a,

823
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,360
we played, uh, we had Josh potter
come in. He brought in weird,

824
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,610
like some of the weirdest
stuff he could find.

825
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,430
And then we've put a call out there
for other weird things, you know,

826
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,120
just beyond the normal,
the vanilla stuff.

827
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,380
And we got this email says, hey,
I just watched episode four,

828
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:30,381
69 of when Josh Potter was on and showed
me the video of a nameless hero doing

829
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:35,550
God's work and servicing the genitals
of prep, of crippled, undesirables,

830
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,320
the topic of disabled porn and more
specifically porn with people who are

831
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:44,220
missing limbs came up. And as a
20 year old man missing both legs,

832
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,990
let me tell you, the people who
fetishize missing limbs are very real.

833
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,190
Someone with an amputee fetish
is revert to as a divo tea.

834
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,710
And there are different sides of it.

835
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:58,140
Some people just want to
have sex with an amputee.

836
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,280
Some people get sexual pleasure from
the desire to become an amputee.

837
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,930
There are certain instances where people
have actually mutilated themselves to

838
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:11,340
become an amputee so they can pop a
bone bone and then squirt till sundown.

839
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,570
It is very common for amputees to have
people randomly messaged them on Facebook

840
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,890
and other social media and ask to see
pictures of their stump or ask me if they

841
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:21,870
ever use their stump during sex.

842
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,600
There are mixed feelings in the amputee
community about divo teas because some

843
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:28,750
people think it's gross. Some
people think it's nice. Personally,

844
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,090
I think that knowing someone may want to,

845
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:35,890
Russell my jimmies due to me missing
limbs is awesome. Many people,

846
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,620
many people missing limbs
are very self conscious feel.

847
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:41,350
They may never find someone who
will want to skeet there, mate.

848
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,590
Knowing the Divo t his exists can,
uh,

849
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,030
it gives myself and other crippled hope
too that we can get our dicks lik to

850
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:53,320
thank you for bringing up yet another
important topic and for truly being the

851
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:58,120
voice of the people and America's
podcast piss on me. Beat me.

852
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:01,530
And a face of Fart, Nathan, a pacifier.

853
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:06,370
And these emails are so beautifully
written. Yeah, that's fantastic. Um,

854
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,730
so I didn't know that there was
that whole segment of society.

855
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:10,570
How do you get there?

856
00:57:10,571 --> 00:57:13,690
Do you lose your virginity to somebody
with thick legs and you're like,

857
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,840
I need more access to actually,
how do we do that?

858
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,050
I'm always fascinating to though that
whatever your condition, whatever it is,

859
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,740
there is somebody that's very turned
on by that you can be 600 pounds.

860
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:30,710
You could be missing a limb, you can be
unable to walk. And someone out there,

861
00:57:30,711 --> 00:57:34,360
I was like, God, I fucking love that shit.
Such a turn on. I mean they really do.

862
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,140
There's really something that
turns everybody on. I Dunno.

863
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,570
Not In Minneapolis. Fergus falls, the
Fergus falls. No, maybe not. Well again,

864
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:46,810
I told you they're all married and
they've been non married. Yeah,

865
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,450
we got to find you.
The hot pot weather slots,

866
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:55,150
the hot weather sluts. They're
out there, man. Arizona.

867
00:57:55,151 --> 00:58:00,150
You're right. I'm real slots. Are
Somebody also message that, um,

868
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,690
whoever did that Photoshop gang member
of the guys transitioning to women,

869
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,710
they said that they did me dirty.
You have. And they told me, Tom,

870
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:10,900
you have serious potential
as a super hot chick.

871
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,770
You look like a Russian porn star.
How God should have made Jesus.

872
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,750
I am rock hard and came to
four strokes on these. Uh,

873
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,370
love you both and your
podcast is hilarious. Shaun.

874
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,520
Shaun said this is a better
representation of me as huh? Uh Huh.

875
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:30,280
That's actually, that's
you as a, as a woman. Yeah.

876
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,190
Well that's somebody who
I think put maybe my,

877
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:38,050
maybe my eyes in they're little
and then half did the mouth.

878
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,760
Well, here's the problem with your
transition that I foresee. First of all.

879
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,140
Oh, that's better. That's

880
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:52,150
your hairline. We're going to have
to do some restaurant chain. Yeah.

881
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:55,880
Like major surgery there to bring
it down a little bit more. Uh,

882
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:01,090
electrolysis. You've got so much facial
hair, a lot of hormones and your size.

883
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:01,960
You're so big.

884
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,260
We're going to have to thin
you out three to pass. Wow.

885
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,190
I mean, what are you doing
mentally? She just kicked the shit.

886
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:13,690
I know. I mean, as a woman,

887
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:16,330
I think it's a compliment that
it would be really complex.

888
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:19,670
Like she's been wanting to say all that
shit for a long time and this was just a

889
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:22,880
way to sneak it in. I think
you're, I'm just saying as a woman,

890
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:28,070
as a woman, not pass. Do you think you'd
ever do anything for your hairline?

891
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,720
Um, no. Good for you. No.
No. I've got to let it ride.

892
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:38,600
I think you look great too. I'm
just doing the, uh, the buzzing.

893
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,240
That's it. Trim it down.
Absolutely. Yeah. That's it. Yeah.

894
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:46,550
You've got a full head of hair, right?
I do. Lucky guy. Yeah. Well thank you.

895
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:50,540
It's very, it's nice. Yup. Got that going
for me. I can the full head of hair.

896
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:54,950
Oh my God. You show do fucking,
when we were in Asia together,

897
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,800
every chick walked up to him
and I was like, you're hot

898
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,910
shot. Like serious hair. Yeah,
they did. They were super anything.

899
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:05,800
My sunken in eyeballs because I hadn't
slept in two weeks. It's like, hey,

900
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,650
hey ladies. Yeah. Every
single one of them.

901
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,800
Ridiculous.
He ever dated Asian persuasion?

902
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:14,500
I have not.
Okay.

903
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,490
Maybe single Chad. Well, no, I mean,
not for any reason. It's just again,

904
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,050
because you're racist.
Northern Minnesota,

905
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:25,310
so it's like when we did a white girl or
a wider girl. Yeah, that's true, right?

906
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:25,590
Yeah.

907
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:29,070
It's super white. Is there any
diversity? Northern Minnesota.

908
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,290
Very little.
Yeah.

909
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,050
That's another thing is going to happen
when you move to that hot pissy climate,

910
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,280
you're going to get different,
different looks. Man.

911
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,870
That's going to be exciting for you.
Different look. Definitely Indian girl,

912
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:47,340
Asian girls, fucking black Latina.
It's all gonna come to you.

913
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,180
You're gonna be knocking
the chicks off your Dick.

914
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:55,910
Yeah. I mean there's no doubt
about it. Can I ask you a question?

915
01:00:55,930 --> 01:01:00,620
Yeah. How long does it take you to Fart
in front of somebody after you meet them?

916
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,630
I'm like, do you fart in front of
girls? You fart in front of friends.

917
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,980
Shabby farted in front of Tom.
You guys have been friends for years.

918
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,110
I, I mean, I don't know if I have to.
I do. Do you know where I met Chad?

919
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:16,540
I met him on the flight at the airport
right before the flight to Hong Kong,

920
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:20,890
so we met there. That's when we met. We,
we'd heard about each other and talk.

921
01:01:20,891 --> 01:01:23,590
I think we've tweeted each other
or message each other before.

922
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,280
And I remember one of the first things I
did on that flight was I went to take a

923
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:32,281
shit and that was in there probably 10
feet and I just met Chad and as I walk

924
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:34,930
out of it, you know there's
always a little bit of like,

925
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,070
I wonder if anyone noticed.
I was in the bathroom for like 10 minutes.

926
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,140
So I was on the flight. I just shut the
door head down. I look up and Chaz like

927
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,730
it was 16 minutes and he looked at me.
Yeah.

928
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:56,350
What were you doing? Yeah, he was really
letting me know that he knew that I took,

929
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,600
it doesn't count for the Mile High Club.

930
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,770
So wait,
you're asking me about farting though?

931
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,750
Well, because my husband Tom has this
neat habit of just farting in front of

932
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,960
everybody.
Sure.

933
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:13,800
And he just told me yesterday we
were eating dinner and he goes, I,

934
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:17,500
I was working out with my trainer and
I just farted in front of him on the

935
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:20,070
treadmill and the other guys really mad

936
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,130
and the gym. And I was like,
well, of course they're mad dummy.

937
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:28,400
Nobody wants to smell your farts.
What happened was I'm running, no,

938
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:32,250
that's what happened. And
I go like, alternate story.

939
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:37,200
And then my trainers like, you
know, probably 10 feet away,

940
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:40,350
he's sitting on one of those boxes,
you know, those box jump things.

941
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:44,850
And he was like, he goes,
was that the, was it,

942
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,910
was that the treadmill? He
was, he was genuinely confused.
Like, what was it? I go,

943
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:54,510
yeah, it was a treadmill. And I go,
no, I farted. And he was like, okay.

944
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,110
And then I go, oof man, that smells bad.

945
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,940
Smells were really bad. And he's
like, great. And it's a small,

946
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:03,790
it's like a small chin.

947
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,790
And then like 10 seconds
later I smelled this fresh,

948
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:12,870
like unbelievably fresh scent. I'm like,
what the fuck is that? He's like, Oh,

949
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:16,620
I just sprayed down this
whole gym with this natural,

950
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,120
and then I realized that that whole time,
10 feet behind,

951
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:24,540
he was another guy just sitting down on
like another piece of equipment and I go,

952
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:27,810
oh, I didn't know you were back there.
He was like, yeah, yeah, it was,

953
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,820
you know when people really want you
to put shit particles into the air when

954
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,820
they're breathing their hardest,
right?

955
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,690
Maximum heart rate and you
just shit right in there.

956
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:40,560
And I feel like it's dangerous to
hold it in at the gym for some reason.

957
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:42,120
I always let it rip at the gym.

958
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,070
I feel like when you're like exerting
yourself and they're trying to punish

959
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,590
yourself and you're like,
oh, this is uncomfortable,
I'm not going to hold it in.

960
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,910
I've always thought to myself,

961
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:55,110
you ever want to meet the prettiest girl
in the world going out to a hotel gym

962
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:59,240
and Fart? Because she'll be there in
two minutes. He will, right? Yeah.

963
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,460
And you'll have it to yourself for 45
minutes at minute 47 now all of a sudden

964
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:09,030
you're like, oh, hey, no. Did you see that
other guy walking out? Wow. What a jerk.

965
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:12,180
Right?
He said he was going to

966
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:19,560
say, cause it's become a pattern for Tom
now where he's just been kind of farting

967
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:20,640
indiscriminately.

968
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:25,260
Like we had Doug Mallard in here and he
brought his fiance over within minutes

969
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,011
of meeting her,

970
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:29,920
he farted in front of her at our dinner
and I'm surprised you haven't fired it

971
01:04:29,921 --> 01:04:30,930
in front of our nanny.

972
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:35,070
And then she came right in the
other night and smelled that.

973
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,210
I think once you get
through the first couple,

974
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:43,580
[inaudible] happens.

975
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,910
Sometimes what I do is fart and I go,
oh my gosh,

976
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:53,310
I'm so embarrassed. We try to justify
it. You guys, this is amazing.

977
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:56,580
I haven't floated in, here's the
doctor said I'd never fart again.

978
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,450
It's what an accomplishment.
This is actually a celebration right now.

979
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,190
I can't believe you guys were
here to witness this. Exciting.

980
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,000
So I'm guessing you don't do
this in front of people. I don't.

981
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,200
I don't know what it is.

982
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:14,130
I think a single guy
now that's what it is.

983
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,680
He's looking for that new
road beef and he knows that.

984
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:17,830
You can't find your way there,

985
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,720
but that now if you go
out on a date a few times,

986
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:24,700
let's say if you get comfortable,

987
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,870
how long would it take you to fart in
front of a lady or do you know that

988
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:32,290
normally at first happens on
accident, right? Is it a few
months in? Probably. Yeah.

989
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,760
Probably like something like a,

990
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:37,780
you have a good jumper cables where
they come in and just both sides of your

991
01:05:37,781 --> 01:05:39,640
ribs. Yeah. That happened once.

992
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:43,310
She thought it was going to be so
funny and I just all over. Yeah.

993
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,960
And that that was acting. Then I'm like,
well thank you for, we broke the barrier.

994
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:49,380
Yeah. Thanks for doing that. Yeah.

995
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,930
Somebody emailed in about this. Uh, Hey
Tom McCarthy. I'm a woman in her thirties.

996
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,240
I have more gas than anyone I know.

997
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,170
Dating is hard for me because
I get crippling stomachache
and basically have to

998
01:06:00,171 --> 01:06:01,520
run home just to Fart.

999
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,920
How early is too early to start farting
in front of a significant other? Uh,

1000
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,870
I currently just met a guy.
He's very fun but very polite.

1001
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,920
He doesn't seem like the type of person
I could in front of Fart in front of

1002
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,890
ever. Oh, should I end it now?
Should I just give up on dating?

1003
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,460
I'm not completely haggard.
I'm a pretty normal looking girl.

1004
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:24,560
Just within an excessive amount of gas.
Sincerely Gassy,

1005
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:28,970
Kaitlin. I feel okay. Let's start
from the, the science of it.

1006
01:06:28,971 --> 01:06:32,090
Do you know why you're so gassy?
Have you gone to the doctor?

1007
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,630
Maybe it's your diet. What are you doing?
Is there any way to reduce your gas?

1008
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:38,750
Change what you're eating and it should,
it should affect it.

1009
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,620
Maybe like Betsy puts some hemp oil,
like our dog on your food.

1010
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:47,340
See if that is your stomach. Yeah. Why?
Why do you have to run all the way home?

1011
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:50,520
Can't you just like leave the room?
Yeah.

1012
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,860
It's probably on how smelling
you'd be like, I just, uh,

1013
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,370
I drank so much water before I got
here today and just keep going to the

1014
01:06:56,371 --> 01:07:00,690
bathroom to pee or be like, I'm a good
person and I'm leaving a room to fart.

1015
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,580
Right. Does it this way? You don't
have to buy what we're finding. We're,

1016
01:07:04,581 --> 01:07:07,530
we're missing the, the, the, the, the,

1017
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:12,030
the thing that she should be
pursuing. What the guy that
loves farts. That's your,

1018
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,540
and I gotta say, yeah, there's a lot
of them out there. It's surprising.

1019
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:19,830
We discovered that a while ago and we
got a whole bunch of messages from guys

1020
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:24,480
who are like, the whole idea of a pretty
girl making a stinky smell turns me off.

1021
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:28,870
They love it. Now if you can handle
the smell of your own farts. Yeah.

1022
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:31,920
I'm sure there are guys that would
love to suck it into their mouth,

1023
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,870
come up and then blow
it back in your face.

1024
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,020
There are guys out there that it would
have been nothing more than Kaitlin

1025
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:43,510
farting around. Maybe she doesn't
want like a fetish person. Yeah. No,

1026
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,580
but it's somebody who, who likes her
and like, and also like that. Yeah.

1027
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:50,540
Is a Fraser fight,
Caitlin.

1028
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,210
There's also gas x and phase. I'm, if
you've tried taking those, you may want,

1029
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,940
right. She's asking me, well,
I've got so far it's been, no,

1030
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,340
she's asking you about
what to do about this dude.

1031
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,580
I would say get your diet checked out.
Take the phase,

1032
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,950
I'm the Bino and hang
out with him for awhile.

1033
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:12,040
Or maybe just say, hey man, go off. You'll
be as nice. A lot of interesting. Yes.

1034
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:16,340
But up, Eh, we cheese. Uh, your main

1035
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,840
characteristic, your page
out, your main characteristic.

1036
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,161
Well,

1037
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:26,660
my main characteristic of my
specialty is a face farting.

1038
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:31,870
Yeah. Yeah. I'm playing this like
your power is the best part. Uh,

1039
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,440
let's see. I Dunno. I Dunno.

1040
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:37,983
I don't know.

1041
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,910
Oh, that's it. Okay.
Oh, that's it. Oh yeah.

1042
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,830
I don't know which episode that's in.

1043
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:50,490
Okay. All right. Ready? All right.

1044
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,590
Well this is happening out on the street.
There's a truck driving. Yeah. Yeah.

1045
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,930
It's out on the street. No,
they're in front of like a
dairy queen. It's terrible.

1046
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:09,050
Yeah. It's really stupid. Yeah.
Wow. There you go. You know what?

1047
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,250
I just reminded me of Tommy
talking about 40 at the gym.

1048
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,480
Tom and I used to live in silver lake,
which is a predominantly gay area.

1049
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,730
We used to work out at this gym that
was known for having bears workout.

1050
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,080
They're like big dudes.

1051
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:25,260
And they remember that one bear
that would always build his mosque.

1052
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,660
How can I forget?
And he would like,

1053
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,870
he would use a treadmill that
was placed right? Like the,

1054
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,170
there was a fan right in front of him.
There's always that fucking asshole.

1055
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,690
And then his bear juice
is just being spread.

1056
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:41,960
I'm trying to do a podcast and
rafting and the smell of this guy,

1057
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:45,030
his balls just throughout the
whole jam or that guy did it work?

1058
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,480
Did they attract other cub?
Yeah, of course. At work.

1059
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:51,840
Dude smelled horrendous and
was the biggest guy in the gym.

1060
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:55,800
Like a big Samoan, you
know, like six, three,

1061
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:00,890
three 30 had fucking Pearce knows
crazy tattoos and just stunk that.

1062
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:04,110
He would just proudly walk around like,
and that works a smell.

1063
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,270
I mean it must've worked.
It must have worked.

1064
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:10,920
I don't know what these base by face,
right?

1065
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,040
That's a guy who pretends to understand
what phase farting mates. Yeah.

1066
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,870
So he's like, what these
these, it's Italian guy. And
she's like, let me show you.

1067
01:10:18,871 --> 01:10:23,520
He's like, okay. Soon as she does,
he's like, thank you. That was amazing.

1068
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,193
He's special.

1069
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:32,310
That's what Katelyn needs. Yeah.
Just a face farting guy. A pig. Yeah.

1070
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,000
A real pig. I think you'll find out
that, uh, you know, if the guys into you,

1071
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:38,520
you can fart whenever.
It doesn't matter.

1072
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,370
I've had girls around me
all the time and it doesn't,

1073
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,550
we haven't finished the truth of it.
Let's have Chad way. Yeah, sure, sure.

1074
01:10:44,551 --> 01:10:49,320
So I'm doing the psychopath test.
Oh, great. Psychology test here.

1075
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:51,540
And Christina is doing it too.
Um,

1076
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,770
and I need to answer a few more
questions on the air we all take down,

1077
01:10:55,771 --> 01:10:58,290
aren't here. I'll give you a
paper pen if you want. Sure.

1078
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:01,720
You can take down some answers.
So here's the,

1079
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,470
here is the question number six. Uh,
by the way, that the way that you, uh,

1080
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,470
the number score, this is, um,

1081
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,220
a five is a very good match to the,
to the statement.

1082
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,000
Okay.

1083
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,470
A four is a good three is moderate
to slight and one nothing.

1084
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,930
So think of it as one means.

1085
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,530
I actually do not agree with the statement
for yourself or is that how you're

1086
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:30,530
doing it, right? Yeah. Okay. So the
next question, do you think I am like,

1087
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,880
I feel like if four's good, I got
the rest of them all the way down.

1088
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,760
Just like to give explicit
instructions. Sorry. Um,

1089
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:43,590
I find that I am able to pursue
one goal for a long time. Okay.

1090
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:49,950
Let's see here. I'm
answering that. Okay. Uh,

1091
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,300
next question. My main purpose in life
is to get as many goodies as I can.

1092
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,090
Get a definition on goodies. Yeah,
exactly. It's road beef. Yeah.

1093
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,673
Hmm.

1094
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,860
Okay.
Um,

1095
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,800
next one is I don't play on
anything very far in advance.

1096
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:11,640
Okay.

1097
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:17,470
Oh, next one's interesting. Making a
lot of money is my most important goal.

1098
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,513
It's a fine.

1099
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,930
Mm.

1100
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,260
And let's see, we don't want to bore
people with just reading these questions.

1101
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:31,650
So what, we're going to share our
answers. I know we are very shortly,

1102
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:34,890
I quickly lose interest in tasks I start.

1103
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,013
Hmm.

1104
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,330
And I let others worry
about higher values.

1105
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:49,330
My main concern is with
the bottom line cheese.

1106
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,790
It's a yes for Tom.
Not at all.

1107
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:59,030
No. All right. All right, well that's a
guy that's number six through 11. Yeah.

1108
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:02,130
So let's go ahead and share our answers.
Okay.

1109
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,070
I find that I'm able to pursue
one goal for a long time.

1110
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:08,310
This is strong match for me.
I five what'd you get? Oh,

1111
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,930
were the two a a slight, slight
match for you. Okay, go ahead.

1112
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:17,550
Um, my main purpose in life is
to get as many goodies as I can.

1113
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,680
I'm a too. And what were the
three? I went with a three. Wow.

1114
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,360
These are fucking psychos. Okay. That's
of moderate match shark. Go ahead.

1115
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,560
I don't plan anything very far in advance.

1116
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:35,580
I got a four just because we have two
children who are prone to sickness.

1117
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,980
Standup careers.
Yeah.

1118
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,730
I went with a three because
in my professional life I
have to plan things a year

1119
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:45,750
in advance. And in my personal
life, I don't know what's
happening tomorrow. Trail.

1120
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:50,180
And what was the one you
don't, you don't plan it all.

1121
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:55,730
Oh, I misinterpreted that. Hold
on. Sorry. Read the question again.

1122
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,760
The statement is I don't plan anything
very far in advance and I feel like I do

1123
01:14:01,581 --> 01:14:06,170
plan things very far in advance. So that's
a one meaning you disagree with that?

1124
01:14:06,171 --> 01:14:08,800
I disagree with the statement
that I don't plan things. We do.

1125
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:11,920
You do plenty of things, right, so I
think I interpreted correct. Listen,

1126
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:15,130
I'm just going to admit I put three
down for all of these cause I didn't

1127
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:19,330
understand any of them. Okay. How
about this one? This is very revealing.

1128
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:24,331
Making a lot of money is my most
important goal for hello to Jesus.

1129
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:27,370
I put a four as well,
but you have to understand,

1130
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:30,340
I live in a place where
if comedy doesn't pan out,

1131
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,320
that's what I tell people when
they're not laughing. I go,

1132
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:36,370
do you think this fucking matters?
I could mow lawns and make my mortgage.

1133
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,890
I live in the middle of nowhere.
That's very interesting. Yeah.

1134
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,550
I like,

1135
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:47,050
but I like having all og
money or money's great,

1136
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:50,410
but I'm just saying like where I live,
I don't need a lot of it. That's trail.

1137
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,190
I quickly lose interest in tests.
I start. Where do you go for that?

1138
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:59,740
I'd strongly disagree. That's a one.
That's where I went. Five. Did you really?

1139
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:00,723
Oh absolutely.

1140
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:06,100
I have fucking lumber for stuff that I
was going to build three years ago in my

1141
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,460
garage. Still. I think I
should be more, I think I,

1142
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,500
now that I hear this and like
talk about it, I put a one,

1143
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,970
but I think it's fair to give
myself a couple points higher.

1144
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:19,600
You lose interest in,
I mean, I'm a thing in,

1145
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:24,850
I don't think it's a complete
five and I don't think it's a one.

1146
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,880
I think I probably should be at two
or three. I agree with that, you know,

1147
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,510
because there's things that I'm very
much able to pursue as a task and,

1148
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,760
and then there are some things that I
like hearing him say. I'm like, yeah,

1149
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,580
I've done that where I've bought
the thing to do the thing.

1150
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:40,630
And then I'm just like,
man,

1151
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:45,790
I haven't listened to a full sentence
this entire time, so I'm for sure. Okay.

1152
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,290
Okay. Um, all right, so here we go.

1153
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,740
And then I let others
worry about higher values.

1154
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:56,920
My main concern is with the bottom line,

1155
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:01,120
if that isn't not to bait
the craziest of the crazy.

1156
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:05,760
And people who hear that and
they're like, definitely. Um, I,

1157
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,370
I don't agree with that at all.
I was a two

1158
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:15,250
de got to leave a little space.
Little space is good.

1159
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:20,470
All right. Clearly Chad
is the sociopath. No, no,

1160
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:25,240
I'd say there's no doubt
about it. I'm very calm. Yeah.

1161
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,330
Well, you know, we learned about
our heart, right? That's true.

1162
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:33,540
So I was watching this a crime
documentary thing on Netflix and uh,

1163
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:38,530
they said that one,
it's not confirmed,

1164
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,560
but it's like proposed idea that's
an indicator for sociopath is,

1165
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,720
uh, is that many of them have
a low resting heart rate.

1166
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:55,170
And the theory is that they need
excitement to just feel alive,

1167
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,300
feel normal. Yeah. To get,

1168
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:03,390
to get to normal so that they do
things that are high risk and you know,

1169
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,110
crazy things basically to just elevate
that heart rate. That's always,

1170
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,010
I mean,
you remember when I

1171
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,930
slid down the wet hill and Hong
Kong to traffic? Yeah. Uh, that,

1172
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:15,380
that is right.

1173
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,640
By the way,
a,

1174
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:22,510
that is a not completely vivid
description of what he did was terrifying.

1175
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,520
I mean, on, on it then or purpose.
So on purpose on a hill in the rain,

1176
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,500
Steep Hill and there they have a uh,

1177
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:36,780
in the city and not like they have an
escalator. That's how steep the hill is.

1178
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:40,710
Yes. So everyone's on this escalator cause
there's a top over it and it's raining

1179
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:43,200
fuck.
And with all the soot in the air,

1180
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:46,080
it comes down with the rain and
made it very greasy for yeah.

1181
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:50,780
So that the hillside is like, it's
basically the picture wet brick, you know,

1182
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:55,781
it's like God v and he gets a
trashcan lid off jumps monster going.

1183
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,490
Yeah. And slides down
like, like headfirst.

1184
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,110
Like it's like an angel.
Oh my God.

1185
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:07,120
We just like see him going and then we
just see cars rounding a turn coming

1186
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:08,900
around.
He's down

1187
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:14,080
talking to a taxi, trying to negotiate
to get back across the bay to our hotel.

1188
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:18,700
He pulls his head out, the window
looks at me and goes, what the fuck?

1189
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:23,480
And then back in negotiating it was
wow, it was really scary. Nightmarish.

1190
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,250
But my resting heart rate's nine,
so I need to do stuff like that.

1191
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:30,200
Say both of you are psychos. Like, I
have a really low resting heart rate too.

1192
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:34,990
I had it where like they were
like one guy, the Nice Guy,

1193
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,760
the nice tech at the,

1194
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:41,240
at Cedars when they were
examining my heart was like, man,

1195
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:46,180
it's really low. He's like, uh,
do you work out? Yeah. And I go,

1196
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:50,800
yeah. And then like the nurse
came in who was no nonsense.

1197
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,860
She was like, it looks at the thing. She
was like, wow, it's really low. He goes,

1198
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,940
the guy goes, he works out though. And
she looks at me. She's like, no, no, no,

1199
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,573
not like that.
He doesn't,

1200
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:03,740
this is something upstairs

1201
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,980
mouse. Yeah. Um, anyways,
yeah. So maybe that's,

1202
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:10,620
is that the root of it, you
know? Well, that could be,

1203
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:15,120
I want to see a total fucking pig. Yeah.
At the airport, somebody sent this in.

1204
01:19:15,121 --> 01:19:17,680
Was this from the actual listener says,

1205
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:22,200
I'm currently waiting for my flight
home and witnessed something absolutely

1206
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:26,670
disgusting in a,
in the middle of a crowded terminal.

1207
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:31,730
This is low and loose behavior and has
absolutely floored me in a terminal.

1208
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:36,280
No,
no,

1209
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,290
no. This guy. Oh my God,

1210
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:49,020
this is, I'm going to vomit. She
goes on to say, she says this guy,

1211
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:50,690
I took his shoes and socks off,

1212
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,960
started picking at the skin between his
toes and peeling his blisters right here

1213
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,480
in the terminal.
I mean that is savagery.

1214
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:04,550
That is absolute insanity to witness.
So inappropriate.

1215
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:08,400
I've seen people clip their nails.
Yes. In public on airplanes.

1216
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,590
It's so gross.

1217
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:15,010
My daughter was really bothering
me one week and so I picked up,

1218
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:20,220
I took the whole skin off of a blister
and let it dry and then I put it on her

1219
01:20:20,411 --> 01:20:24,040
pillow.
She hoes fucking murdered me in my sleep.

1220
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,840
But you know what? Don't be an asshole all
week. Yeah, that's true. She was really,

1221
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:33,280
yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, she come
and tell you when she discovered it. Yeah.

1222
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:35,750
She, I mean she screamed. She
didn't come tell me. Oh, she just,

1223
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:40,010
she sat above her bed yard, gas,

1224
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:44,140
gas to just freaking out when
you were like, yeah, go to bed.

1225
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:48,090
Just give her one of those resting
heart rate. Yeah. Very calm.

1226
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:49,530
Very calm.

1227
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:54,570
Do you think that grooming in any
enclosed space with other humans that you

1228
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:58,950
don't, you're not related to is just
disgusting. It's completely unacceptable.

1229
01:20:59,010 --> 01:20:59,671
I vomit.

1230
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:03,940
Even just having some girl brush her
fucking horsey hair on the airplane.

1231
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:04,561
It's crazy.

1232
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:09,300
Why are you brushing your hair and all
your dirty Dandre flakes are everywhere

1233
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:13,580
in the, in the year. Yeah. You know,
and your dirty fucking hair. Yeah.

1234
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:16,980
The thing is everyone knows what the,
I mean, if you're clipping your nails,

1235
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,520
you're so fucking by God to do
that in a plane or a terminal.

1236
01:21:21,521 --> 01:21:22,860
So I've seen people,

1237
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,400
well, just fun clip, clip light. That
actually reminded me of that brush thing.

1238
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:30,660
My daughter has pulled all the hair
out of her bra and then packed it in my

1239
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:35,130
suitcase. That's pretty great. That's
pretty great. It's a smart girl.

1240
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,200
It was a fucking cause. You pull out
your stuff, you're like, oh my God.

1241
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:43,770
It's like, it's my version of a love
note, Dan. I love you. Come back soon.

1242
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:48,930
Oh my God. That's fine. Um, let's
see if this motivates Chad too.

1243
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,150
Maybe. I don't know. Open his mind.

1244
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,650
Open his heart and change the
way he sees things. You know,

1245
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:58,680
I'm sitting here in the desert. It was
just looking at this beautiful vastness,

1246
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,323
um,

1247
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:05,630
and thinking of those times of how I've
compromised myself because I was so

1248
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:10,821
afraid to be alone and this
desert reminded me of lonely
path I've had to travel

1249
01:22:11,311 --> 01:22:15,480
within and how I've had to put everything
that I love and everything I've built

1250
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:21,200
on the line to simply be happy and how
it can be the most terrifying thing to

1251
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:24,750
do.
You can feel absolutely lonely.

1252
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,670
This is why people cheat right here.
This kind of shit. Yeah, right.

1253
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,940
Hey, check out this video. I did all
right. Yeah. You're like, well that's,

1254
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,600
this isn't

1255
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:41,340
Instagram post. Like, this isn't even
just on her website that maybe, you know,

1256
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:43,380
if you're really interested
in Jada Pinkett Smith,

1257
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:45,150
you're going to go and she's
all talking about wellness.

1258
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:49,740
Like this is fucking insane. Do you think
that, um, she bust this out when, uh,

1259
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:53,970
oh my gosh. What'd you think when will's
like a, uh, my new movie I just shot,

1260
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:57,510
you know, it was a, that's coming out next
month. I'm pretty excited by, she's like,

1261
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,670
check out what I just shot.

1262
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:03,170
Yeah, it'd be great if this was on
her Instagram. And then what fought,

1263
01:23:03,171 --> 01:23:06,190
the next thing you clicked on was,
this is a story all

1264
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,350
about how am I gonna fit?

1265
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,270
This is beautiful where she is

1266
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:19,700
so much beauty there and we should all
just look at how we're compromising

1267
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:24,701
ourselves and our lives compromising
our happiness simply to not be alone.

1268
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,970
Sounds like you used to love
and here's to you. Oh boy.

1269
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:29,980
Sounds like there's troubling

1270
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:34,220
marriage. You know what I mean? She's
like compromising myself, not happy. Hey,

1271
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:37,800
when people take that tone because you
know they're lying and they don't believe

1272
01:23:37,801 --> 01:23:39,790
themselves. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, ah.

1273
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:44,450
You guys been working on a lot and I
feel great and I don't have to, it's,

1274
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,100
it's fine. Yeah. That's
horse shit. Oh yeah,

1275
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:51,930
yeah, yeah, yeah. You think that
like, a lot of this is just, um,

1276
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:56,010
it's just directed at, you know,
one person and everything is like,

1277
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:58,320
it's meant to be like this
is public consumption. I'm
just putting it out there.

1278
01:23:58,321 --> 01:24:00,450
But yeah, I'm really just
trying to tell you something.

1279
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:05,870
I think so that's kind of my
favorite stuff. You're like,
this isn't for everybody.

1280
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:08,600
So you have two options, right?
I can go home and be like,

1281
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:12,350
I fucking did everything for you.
Or you can find a desert and be like,

1282
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:13,640
I've put everything on the line.

1283
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:20,790
Um,
I've been picked on a lot on this show.

1284
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,030
I don't believe that I have
been for what I laugh at.

1285
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:28,020
People think it's really wrong.
Sometimes Chad,

1286
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:29,520
I'd agree with that statement,

1287
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:34,180
but he gets picked on for laughing.
Laughs it inappropriate shit. Both. Okay.

1288
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:38,680
Yeah, that's true. That's true
statement. Here's a submission.

1289
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,180
Do you think this is

1290
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,010
okay?

1291
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:45,180
Funny. That's good. Now I
like where it's going already.

1292
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,240
I know for a fact that I saw it though.
There was no question about that.

1293
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:52,220
Rather read time now.
Then fucking retire.

1294
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:55,410
Big Old fish breaks meal
for people listening.

1295
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:59,930
Guy Who's a fishing, great
forearms, great forum.

1296
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:04,950
Veiny probably just has those
natural strong forearms, you know,

1297
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:09,890
just, yeah, he, he lives in
outdoorsman. Yeah. Lean, lean, build.

1298
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,160
Um, so he's uh, getting
his, what do you call that?

1299
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:17,930
His uncle bedded lure is lord or he's,
you know,

1300
01:25:17,931 --> 01:25:21,680
he's sitting there alone on
a boat. Um, fishing and yeah.

1301
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:24,750
I don't know,

1302
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,583
like to see,

1303
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:34,440
get book,

1304
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,050
fuck,
fuck.

1305
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:52,180
Which has happened, which
is Hornet. Hornet stung him
a bunch of times. Uh, yeah,

1306
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,750
I think a couple of maybe.
Wow.

1307
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,350
It's a nice way to get
the fuck isn't nice.

1308
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:05,900
God Damn God fucking damn boy.

1309
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:11,420
Yeah. Kind of freaked out. Yeah. Yeah.

1310
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,780
Ah, her fucking hearse. Gosh,

1311
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,590
he was just so fun for so long.

1312
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,460
Yeah, he was. He actually wrote in,

1313
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:27,461
we rarely get the person who made
the video and send in the video.

1314
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,440
Usually somebody else sending it in.
He goes,

1315
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,800
I recently found your channel
understanding you like
videos of people getting

1316
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:36,080
hurt.
So here you go.

1317
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,880
I personally don't find it funny because
it happened to me, but all my pieces,

1318
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:44,990
shit, quote friends seem to enjoy
me screaming like a bitch. Craig.

1319
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:50,000
Well Craig, I did enjoy it.
Absolutely fantastic. Yeah.

1320
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:52,330
Cause he said I'm going to
get this fee. Like, you know,

1321
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:56,150
the big strategy behind it. Yeah.
And then all of a sudden attack mode.

1322
01:26:56,330 --> 01:27:00,260
And you thought that was funny. I
picked up like a prairie dog. Yeah.

1323
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:02,720
I have the worst posture and all
of a sudden I was like, what?

1324
01:27:02,721 --> 01:27:05,590
Like I'm in the military
trying to watch that shit. Um,

1325
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,360
but do you laugh at like things
like that? Absolutely. You do.

1326
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,470
Now you guys are besties.
That's what I, yeah, yeah, sure.

1327
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:17,610
Oh,
I better do something

1328
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,860
that grounds coming pretty fast.

1329
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,350
You heard it?

1330
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,543
Yeah.

1331
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,500
Why did you launch it?
Took it hard.

1332
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,400
Oh God.
Ah,

1333
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,100
yeah. You heard that shit crunch
that was coming status coming.

1334
01:27:42,101 --> 01:27:45,070
Really what it how funny is
it on a scale of one to five,

1335
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:50,800
five being you very much agree.
Can you go through all of the numbers?

1336
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,840
Just good.
Three being moderately agree.

1337
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:03,480
I think if you jump out of a plane and
something bad happens to you. Yeah. Yeah.

1338
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,590
Then that should be, oh,
here comes another one.

1339
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:15,010
What was that?
What was that?

1340
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,850
Oh well that's straight up a car

1341
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:29,350
was Bakula stuck.
Looked it up,

1342
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,280
send it in.
Yeah.

1343
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:42,670
That guy is that his son's hit the back
window. Right. I don't know. It's so,

1344
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:47,980
these were real concerned though. I
was like, God damn, I slept in my car.

1345
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,140
Yes. What though? We played this

1346
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:55,530
so many times, so we've really gotten
it out there. It happened in Taiwan.

1347
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,950
It turns out, because some people
were like, that guy's definitely,

1348
01:28:58,951 --> 01:29:02,340
his legs are removed.
He was fine.

1349
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,890
He was actually really, yeah.
This was in the news there.

1350
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:10,050
Guide turned out to be totally fine. He's
bruised, but it definitely looked worse.

1351
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:14,080
Yeah. It looked like he was going
to get a lot of that amputee. Yeah.

1352
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,780
Divo t emails. Uh, yeah.

1353
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,340
Is that funny for you to, I mean, don't
stand behind the car I have. It's,

1354
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:25,560
it's all this common sense
shit. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
That's a, that's, that's true.

1355
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:26,760
That's a different perspective.

1356
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,340
People always make fun of me
because when I walk into a bathroom,

1357
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:32,310
I always look behind the door.
If I'm at a bar,

1358
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,430
I peeked behind the door just because of
my friends are like, what are you doing?

1359
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:36,600
I'm like, wow, that's
not gonna be so funny.

1360
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:39,950
When you get butt fucked in
here but I'm not going to, yeah,

1361
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,390
you're a part of that.
The rape culture.

1362
01:29:43,391 --> 01:29:46,630
You're afraid of a kind of how
women have to deal with the world.

1363
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,080
Do you navigate the world the way we do?
Okay.

1364
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,510
Well I just like to know what's behind
the door that way went I'm cause we don't

1365
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,760
have to question it. Right. You
know, we do that to someone in here.

1366
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:57,270
We're going to fucking
attack me right here.

1367
01:29:58,290 --> 01:30:03,150
Makes lot of sense in here.
In this house especially. No,

1368
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,830
no one's going to, you're fine. Right. Um,

1369
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:08,710
no tune tune.

1370
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:14,240
This is my heartbeat tuned to
me. Takes that long. That long.

1371
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:18,780
That slow. Yeah. Have you been,
have you had it checked out? Really?

1372
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,880
You kind of like a problem when
I sleep people think I'm dead.

1373
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,060
You should probably have it looked at,
you know,

1374
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:30,320
they can just do like a sonogram of it.
Cause my mom had some heart defects.

1375
01:30:30,321 --> 01:30:32,810
They checked mine and make sure
I didn't have it. I don't anyway,

1376
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:36,230
they just put a thing over it to do
quick, quick. They can look at it.

1377
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:41,930
I just think it's cause I don't know how
to love if you guys have not yet been

1378
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:44,810
convinced to see Chad

1379
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:51,050
or guessing not so funny
today you have been,

1380
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:56,120
if you have not yet been convinced to
see him live, uh, we highly recommend it.

1381
01:30:56,121 --> 01:31:01,010
But we also think you might be convinced
by the web stuff he's been doing.

1382
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,980
No.
When I say I don't work,

1383
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:08,630
I only mean that I ended regular
full time employment at age 40.

1384
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,700
Since those like me who are on disability
don't seem to need it. I'll explain.

1385
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,170
Oh boy.
Highly intelligent.

1386
01:31:15,171 --> 01:31:20,030
I was born with physical problems and
severe learning disability that got worse

1387
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:21,043
with time.

1388
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:25,880
What the fuck is this? I was just trying
to explain where I was at that day.

1389
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:28,280
Yeah,
it's a cool backdrop.

1390
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,980
I kind of feel like a map of the,

1391
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,160
and a a symbol.
Um,

1392
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:40,720
some might say is a swastika.
Just thought that was here.

1393
01:31:40,721 --> 01:31:45,070
Like wind power. Oh No, I just
letting people know where you stand.

1394
01:31:45,071 --> 01:31:48,490
Can I tell you something? I
don't even know what it, what
is about to happen? Yeah.

1395
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:52,640
My, my why Mh tinglies are
telling me this is going,

1396
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:55,640
this might be something we're going
to enjoy for, for weeks to come. Yeah.

1397
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,190
You might be right feeling like
it's got the makings of a video.

1398
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,180
This is a,
okay.

1399
01:32:01,181 --> 01:32:05,050
So the person who made this just in case
you didn't know is not chat if you're

1400
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:09,670
listening. Um, but they,
they have, uh, they have,

1401
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:14,200
um, uh, a little screen. I
can't even think of words.

1402
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:18,070
I'm an announcement at the top of the
show of his videos that say I'm hosting

1403
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:22,120
this channel as an extremely controversial
speaker. Ooh, that's what the,

1404
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:25,300
that's what it says before these
videos play. And as a citizen,

1405
01:32:25,301 --> 01:32:29,860
the U S I uphold the freedom of speech
that our constitution provides says that

1406
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:32,620
freedom of speech is meant
to protect unpopular speech.

1407
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:37,140
So this guy is really a free
speech proponent when he's
done his research. Yeah.

1408
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,990
It also says that the man
has some mental difficulties.

1409
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,280
He might,
well that's good to them.

1410
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:50,490
He says he might inadvertently offend
or invite dismissal by being socially

1411
01:32:51,671 --> 01:32:54,160
inept and to overlook it instead,

1412
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:58,800
investigate his claims and viewpoints
for yourself. So it's just,

1413
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,040
no one's just an asshole anymore.
I know. It's always like prefacing,

1414
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:04,510
it is like Patrick Ewing.
Well,

1415
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:09,160
my finger hurts just in case I don't have
a great game. I think there's a right,

1416
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:13,020
there's, there's um, so much here that
I'm just going to jump through a few.

1417
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,820
Let's go. I just want to see
what he's, what he's up to.

1418
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:21,390
I could only graduate high school via
a special program for problem students.

1419
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:27,010
I didn't go to college since Snow College
could accommodate my needs. From there,

1420
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:31,690
I worked many jobs.
Could only secure very low paying jobs.

1421
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,360
Half the time I couldn't even find work.

1422
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:39,190
Even the low paying job until my
father stepped in for me. For example,

1423
01:33:39,191 --> 01:33:42,580
one time my father gave my
manager money for Christmas.

1424
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:47,260
One company hired me because my
father's company was funding.

1425
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:51,970
There's a boss from another company
hired me because it's trialed.

1426
01:33:51,971 --> 01:33:55,240
Was enrolled at my father's
daycare center. Oh, Katherine.

1427
01:33:55,241 --> 01:33:56,950
My Dad retired from full time work.

1428
01:33:56,951 --> 01:34:00,090
He told some security companies
that if they hired me.

1429
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:05,200
Okay. That's a lot. There's
a lot. I like the cadence.

1430
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:10,390
It's a kind of Wisconsin eat
cadence, right? Ooh, I don't
know. I think it's more,

1431
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:14,530
uh, it sounds more Amish.
You think so? Yeah.

1432
01:34:14,531 --> 01:34:18,250
Like a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Oh,
I thought it was more Midwest. Okay.

1433
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:23,590
I like that he talks like that. I like
his background. I like his presentation.

1434
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,490
Let's see if he pushes any buttons.
Suffering right now.

1435
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,400
I don't know if he pushes any buttons.
Let's see.

1436
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:31,680
Occasions of mystery and
discrimination. Oh, for instance,

1437
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:36,950
I was fired for supposedly attaching and
raising the American flag upside down

1438
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,220
on the flag pole,

1439
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:43,430
which I never do while he recent Muslim
immigrant from another shift had the

1440
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:46,650
same job and it was
likely to have done it.

1441
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,770
Wow. Oh my muscles don't have to
stress. That is a sign of distress.

1442
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,590
When you raise the flag upside down.
It's a sign of distress.

1443
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:58,040
I learned that from a Robert Redford.
Really?

1444
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,150
Yeah. You remember the movie? Maybe
it's something to do with castle.

1445
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:06,440
Ah, okay. Maybe it was just the castle,
but it was also the guy from Sopranos.

1446
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:10,370
James Gandolfini. Yeah. Who
was the prison warden. Anyways,

1447
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,360
but so I want to go back here.

1448
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:16,361
This guy has a manager and his dad
has a company and a daycare that funds

1449
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:19,430
another company, but yeah, that and
then he goes, but my dad's daycare.

1450
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:23,280
Yeah. Maybe his dad had multiple,
a lot of confusing shit going on.

1451
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,580
Yep.
The company I work at,

1452
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:30,290
the longest fellow employees
kept purposely blowing big farts,

1453
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,060
which I had to smell and breathe.

1454
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:36,180
There it is. So there it is.
I knew I was going to like it.

1455
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:40,590
He might be talking about
me. Yeah. What Jim does,

1456
01:35:40,591 --> 01:35:41,530
he need to likeness.

1457
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:48,990
I was working security at another job.
I found a sweater of blood.

1458
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:53,130
It was a freak accidents where somebody
collapse right in the middle of a tiny

1459
01:35:53,131 --> 01:35:56,490
staircase, which I couldn't
find in time. Therefore,

1460
01:35:56,491 --> 01:36:00,240
they tried to blame me for trying to
murder someone. Believe it or not.

1461
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,730
So far. This guy's got your number
blowing farts. Yup. Murdering people.

1462
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,240
That's the first time he looked
off the paper to just say,

1463
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:12,360
let's just raise his hands up.
Can you believe this?

1464
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:17,730
I have not murdered anyone. A blowout
fights. Not. I haven't. Not yet.

1465
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:19,700
We got to ask him ride or die.
Okay.

1466
01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:20,210
Oh,

1467
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:25,210
so for those who complained that I'm
cheating the governor match McCain.

1468
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,950
You don't know anything. This,
you didn't like me. You think?

1469
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:36,970
Oh judge others until I explain myself.

1470
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,190
Today is a mental illness day.

1471
01:36:41,191 --> 01:36:45,900
I know mom's mental health awareness
last week. Oh, well, there you go.

1472
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:48,600
That's why we're doing this.
That is it just a little late.

1473
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:53,150
This guy should have to read everything
because that keeps him calm. Yeah.

1474
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,250
And then my dad had my manager.

1475
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,840
Why are you doing that was so
scary. Yeah, that's aggressive.

1476
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:03,340
I liked it. Yeah. I like
the why are you doing this?

1477
01:37:03,341 --> 01:37:07,390
And I like the blowing farts part. Yup.
He's hurt someone. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

1478
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,350
He's done big farts. Yeah. Ghana. Yeah,

1479
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:17,290
man. It's a lot going on in that
club. We're going to have to, yeah,

1480
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:21,190
a few more times. I feel like we're going
to visit that again. It's a lot of it.

1481
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,330
I accidentally overdosed.
Yeah.

1482
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:35,850
Ah, yeah. Wow. I
accidentally overdosed. Yeah,

1483
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:40,020
that's a lot, huh? Yup.
World is a special place.

1484
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:43,300
It seems weird that that kind of guy
would have a hammer hanging on his wall

1485
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:45,940
right by the door.
Oh,

1486
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:49,540
you want to lead a pizza guy
just holding the hammer weigh up.

1487
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:52,120
What do you think the justification is?
Like if somebody goes,

1488
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:54,670
what's up with the swastika?
Do you think he has?

1489
01:37:54,671 --> 01:37:56,200
He probably has something like that.
I go,

1490
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:00,540
he goes, it's not the fucking
hammer. What's up with the swastika?

1491
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,320
I'll show you don.

1492
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:06,210
I got get world map is where he's buried.
People.

1493
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,570
One of those guys who does the,
uh, it's like the, you know,

1494
01:38:11,571 --> 01:38:13,790
the old white guy who goes,
how come I can't say the n word?

1495
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:16,370
They say it all the time and you're like,
that's not how it works.

1496
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,970
He's a liquid that's there. They're
like, it's perfectly logical.

1497
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,360
Other people are saying it. Why can I see
it? It's always like a, and you go like,

1498
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:26,930
you, here's the thing. I don't have
to tell you like, you know why?

1499
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,840
You know why you're not supposed to
say it. You know what I mean? Like,

1500
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:34,230
but why can't we go? Yeah. You
go like, why can't you go, ew,

1501
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,230
I you don't need the explanation.

1502
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:39,680
This is just like kind of a theatrical
thing you're doing and it's the same guy

1503
01:38:39,681 --> 01:38:43,190
who would be like, I have a swastika.
And you're like, why would you do that?

1504
01:38:43,191 --> 01:38:43,991
They're like, well, you know what,

1505
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:45,710
actually the symbol existed
before the [inaudible].

1506
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:53,160
So I am a of the belief that we should
celebrate the old Egyptian interpretation

1507
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:59,080
of this Watson Native American.
Yeah. Yeah. You're like, oh,

1508
01:38:59,081 --> 01:39:02,710
so you overlook the people that
kind of misused it. Exactly.

1509
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:07,170
Since then they've used it for other
things. Yeah. Have you heard about this?

1510
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,590
Famous for just to be clear,
I'm using it for something else.

1511
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:15,950
So be, be free to interpret
it as you choose. Anyways,

1512
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,380
that's how I was feeling about the
confederate flag. That's another one.

1513
01:39:20,381 --> 01:39:22,720
It's all these guys are like,
we shouldn't be,

1514
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:26,890
we shouldn't be given participation
ribbons to kids and it's like,

1515
01:39:26,891 --> 01:39:30,790
well that's what the fucking confederate
flag is when that's a participation

1516
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,561
ribbon.
That's true.

1517
01:39:31,561 --> 01:39:34,580
And they keep it in their trucks with
their nuts on the trucks. It's, yeah,

1518
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:37,660
it's nuts. Yeah. In California.

1519
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,780
Not In southern California.
Yeah, true tread here, man. Oh,

1520
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:51,340
see so much fucking road Beave down in
the Osi. I'm looking for road beef, man.

1521
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:54,190
It's just a lot of,
then you got a text and it's a homeless.

1522
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:57,453
I'm just lazy.

1523
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,590
Yeah.
Um,

1524
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:02,820
I recently moved in with my grandmother
who was an email with my grandmother

1525
01:40:02,821 --> 01:40:06,000
after graduating college.
I found myself in a great dilemma.

1526
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,180
I get up every morning and get ready
for work and like any reasonable human

1527
01:40:09,181 --> 01:40:09,421
being,

1528
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:14,421
I take a pre work poop 8:15 AM is my time
just like the great top dog and I have

1529
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:19,920
found myself in a great deal of trouble.
You've heard of pissing on the seats,

1530
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:23,910
I presume? Well, Hal about shitting on
the seat. Yes. You read that, right?

1531
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:28,830
My grandmother shits on the seat every
morning. Oh, and I don't know what to do.

1532
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:32,580
Is this a power play by her?
Is this a way of communication?

1533
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:37,020
Should I leave her some brown as a
message back? Anyway, Tommy and Tina,

1534
01:40:37,021 --> 01:40:38,040
the real question is,

1535
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:42,150
should I become poop pals
with my grandmother instead
of pen pals with her piss

1536
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:45,840
on me, beat me, Yada Yada, Yada.
Ding, Ding. You know the drill Jacob?

1537
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:51,240
I think your grandmother, I don't know
where to begin is begging you to leave.

1538
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:54,070
Absolutely. She's just like, I was being

1539
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,800
nice when I said you could come
live with me. You piece of shit

1540
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:04,030
on the seat or not. I think it's
right on the back of the seat.

1541
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:07,990
That's probably what's going on when
people sit back too far. Yeah, exactly.

1542
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,090
And you know and it like
skims all the way down.

1543
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:14,020
So like your shit is flat on her ass
hole is probably on right by right now.

1544
01:41:14,021 --> 01:41:17,980
Chad. I thought I heard it all. Yeah,
we talk about Brown a lot on this show.

1545
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:21,470
Do I have never heard this tassel is
probably right up against the back room

1546
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,850
dude. I never even thought
because he blew my mind.

1547
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:27,160
It might be because of how old she is.
She's sitting,

1548
01:41:27,161 --> 01:41:31,720
you know one of those things, those
workers, maybe a bad back legs.

1549
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:32,350
You don't know.

1550
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:35,680
And if you're not using the squatty potty
[inaudible] sometimes it can curl up

1551
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:40,480
and go back. But imagine you finding
that shit every morning, every morning.

1552
01:41:40,481 --> 01:41:42,760
Then you're like, God dammit,
there's shit all over the seat.

1553
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:48,640
If that isn't motivation to get your
own place, I dunno what is, yeah,

1554
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,220
that's going to be us.
And 30,

1555
01:41:51,221 --> 01:41:54,180
40 years shitting on the love
that you gave it that long.

1556
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:58,930
Do you think the next week you started
sitting on seats, you will, I'll be like,

1557
01:41:58,931 --> 01:42:00,970
fucking Tommy Shit on this thing.

1558
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,170
I know he's gonna put me in the
home right away. It'd be like, no,

1559
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:08,190
I'll clean your shit. Ah, yeah, this
is your new place. And I'm like, wow,

1560
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:14,030
do you like it here babe? I'm like, ah,

1561
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,960
that'd be nice to you. I'll be the
guy who was like, go on another bath.

1562
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:23,360
They give me another bath. I'm
like, it's still dirty down here.

1563
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:28,430
My grandma had dementia and w I'd always
go eat dinner with her when I was in

1564
01:42:28,431 --> 01:42:32,930
town and a weight that was at a
retirement center in Minnesota. Yeah.

1565
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:34,340
And so she would,
uh,

1566
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:36,680
we ate one day and then they
cleared the plates and she goes,

1567
01:42:36,681 --> 01:42:39,560
when are we going to eat? And I
go, don't you feel full? Let me,

1568
01:42:39,561 --> 01:42:43,310
can't you like nothing. You know, I try,
I try to understand, but for me, I'm like,

1569
01:42:43,311 --> 01:42:46,520
we just fucking eight and then I go,
we'll try to remember what you ate.

1570
01:42:46,521 --> 01:42:50,210
Do you have any idea? And she was
like, I don't, but I, I trust you.

1571
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,570
And then we wouldn't watch checks or
Texas Walker Ranger or whatever that's

1572
01:42:53,571 --> 01:42:57,260
called Walker, Texas. Yeah. And,
uh, but 10 minutes later she goes,

1573
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:01,010
and she looked at me, she goes, Spaghetti.

1574
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,380
No. I was like, well, what
the fuck? That's pretty great.
Yeah. She tasted it. I said,

1575
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:09,900
wow. That's how she remembers. She has
to get it back up. Oh my gosh. Wow.

1576
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,590
That's actually a really sweet story.
It is.

1577
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,270
Was there a long time ago?

1578
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:20,130
Uh, yeah. Yeah. For four years
ago. Not that long ago. She, is,

1579
01:43:20,131 --> 01:43:24,870
she still with us? She's not Spaghetti
Spaghetti's gone spaghetti got her.

1580
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:27,810
Do you have any other grandparents left?
[inaudible] parents. I'm wiped out. Yeah.

1581
01:43:27,811 --> 01:43:32,640
My mom. Your mom? Yeah. You close
to her? Yeah, I live, uh, I dunno.

1582
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:34,410
Two miles away.

1583
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:37,840
The are you serious? That's,
that's kind of Nice. That's sweet.

1584
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,490
I see my parents twice a year.

1585
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,300
Oh, you know what? We
live 2,500 miles from me.

1586
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:48,400
I see my mom twice a year really
to fucking miles and really well,

1587
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:52,100
I'm more than that, but not as much
as I probably should. Yeah. But she's

1588
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,910
retiring October 26 so she said,
I'll be over for coffee every morning.

1589
01:43:55,911 --> 01:43:57,380
And I was like, great. I'm moving.

1590
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:03,280
My Dad retiring December 3rd
and we've talked about it a lot.

1591
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:07,880
I'm worried.
I'm serious.

1592
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:11,810
He's been involved with stuff his
whole life and he's like, next chapter,

1593
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:14,600
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm like, fuck, stop saying that.

1594
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:17,330
I don't know he's going to do. And I'm
like, well, you go off. He's like, yeah,

1595
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:19,860
I'm not interested in anymore.
Like you're fucking lost interest in golf.

1596
01:44:19,861 --> 01:44:22,640
We you supposed to do now. Oh yeah.
I don't know what he's going to do.

1597
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:26,270
That's not good. I know.
He's like fishing. I go,

1598
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,080
you don't seem like the guy with
the patients for fishing. Yeah.

1599
01:44:30,081 --> 01:44:33,800
I'll get into it and then he
goes fishing with like uh,

1600
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:37,990
my nephew next day. He was like, it
was terrible. It's three hours after.

1601
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,550
I'm like three hours isn't even that long.
I've seen this happen.

1602
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:44,660
You know where it ends? Where
Spaghetti. Spaghetti. Yeah. Fuck.

1603
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,610
I want him to get involved
in something which we get.

1604
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:54,310
I don't know anything that's going to
make those videos. Have my dad make bit,

1605
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:55,670
make some videos with stuff on the wall.

1606
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,880
I maybe I might have to get him
more involved in the podcasts.

1607
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:02,060
Maybe like we talked about having him.
Why don't we do movie reviews?

1608
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,610
We were talking about having to do it
cause he loves to go to the movies.

1609
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:07,340
He told me the other day, he's
like, you know what's a great movie?

1610
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:10,490
It's a movie that's out. And
I go okay. And he's like,

1611
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:13,630
you can always tell it's a good movie
cause your mother and I both liked it and

1612
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:18,320
I go, yeah, that's my criteria too.
Like, as long as youtube both like it,

1613
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:19,580
then I know it's a good movie.

1614
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:24,590
He's convinced that other people will
always line up with his perspective on

1615
01:45:25,491 --> 01:45:27,430
movies.
It's the,

1616
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:31,490
he walks out of whatever the number
one movie is like every other month.

1617
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,070
And he's like, I went and saw
this thing. It was terrible. Like,

1618
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,340
I think that's the number one movie in
the world right now. He's like, yeah,

1619
01:45:36,341 --> 01:45:38,240
it's not good. I'm like, okay.

1620
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:42,530
And he's just out of their splits
all the time. What's your mom?

1621
01:45:42,531 --> 01:45:45,340
What did she retiring
from? Uh, she is, uh,

1622
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:49,910
like the marketing receptionist
for a power company. Okay.

1623
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:54,320
Yeah. So she's just ready to get the
fuck. I was just super stoked. Yeah. Yeah.

1624
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:58,070
Yeah. I think my dad is too. I
just wish you had like the, uh,

1625
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:02,810
the other exciting interest he lives in.
Where Florida. Yeah, I'd like to see him,

1626
01:46:02,811 --> 01:46:07,810
man on the streets situation
interviewing millennials. I'm like,

1627
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:12,650
God, this might be a good
idea. Check grade now.

1628
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:16,850
He loves a current current events.
Quizzes at dinner.

1629
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,990
It's one of his favorite games.
That'd be great. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1630
01:46:20,991 --> 01:46:24,570
he likes to humiliate your sisters. Yes.
How little they know about the world.

1631
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:29,090
That's actually, and his goal. He's
just like broads, don't know as much.

1632
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,290
Yeah, he does. He does. He's like,

1633
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:38,030
now let me ask you something.
Who was the secretary of state?

1634
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,980
And like, if they're like, I don't know.
He's like, yeah, loves it. Loves it.

1635
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:45,470
That they don't know.
It's like so old school,

1636
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,980
but he really is thrilled that
a girl doesn't know. I know he

1637
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,720
loves to bring up politics
with me. [inaudible] every
time we talk now, Christina,

1638
01:46:54,820 --> 01:46:59,210
are you happy that the supreme court
is made of old white guys? Yeah.

1639
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:03,340
And I'm like, yes. Talk to. I know what
happened with Kevin on none of that. Yeah,

1640
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:05,940
yeah, yeah. He's very
much into that. Yeah.

1641
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:10,470
You gotta know what the MPF on
sites to bait me. Ah, yeah. Yeah.

1642
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:14,400
We'd have to edit the fuck out
of it, but yeah, he'd be like,

1643
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:18,390
here is a six hour real. All
right. We are talking to people.

1644
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:22,440
One interview a person. Jesus, man. Yeah,

1645
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,010
the movie thing would be fun. Yeah. Well,
I've always wanted my mom to review, uh,

1646
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:30,930
hip hop albums ever listened and that
would be great. And then have her say,

1647
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:35,280
dummy, this is disgusting. Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe not the whole album.

1648
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:38,550
Maybe like one song. Yeah. What do
you think of the song? Yeah, whatever.

1649
01:47:38,551 --> 01:47:40,950
Like the number one song is on the charts.
Yeah.

1650
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:45,740
It could be fun and it probably sounds
like this. Get it, flip it, suck it. Yeah,

1651
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:50,970
exactly. That's about right. That's all
my daughter's listening to you, right?

1652
01:47:50,971 --> 01:47:53,340
Is that, yeah. I feel like
music, I mean I listen,

1653
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:55,980
I'm an old fogy I listened to
same shit I like when I was 15.

1654
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,380
I'm not a good music current music person,

1655
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,590
but I do feel like it has gone that way.
Right?

1656
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:05,720
Like I watched the vms on MTV and I
looked up the acts and I'm like, dude,

1657
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:10,050
all this shit's a exactly the same.
It's like mall music. Yeah. It's a,

1658
01:48:10,051 --> 01:48:13,830
so she listens to that around the house.
It will be like, do the dishes, vacuum.

1659
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:15,750
That's like all that.
Yeah. All that stuff.

1660
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:18,600
And then she plays her Ukulele
and she'll play, you know,

1661
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:22,820
like where is my mind or something by
then. Oh, cool. Yeah. So it's like,

1662
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:27,240
where are you learning this? Well, we
share iTunes and it's all your stove.

1663
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:31,500
Oh. So she gets to learns
it on Ukulele and then,

1664
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:33,960
but the music she listens to, it's
ridiculous. I have a question.

1665
01:48:33,961 --> 01:48:35,520
How long ago did you stop recording?

1666
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:43,930
Oh No, we're still going. Actually looked.

1667
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:47,530
I thought you'd just be like
Spaghetti. Huh? That's the fights.

1668
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:51,070
And that's on the phone.
Here's my dad laughing at his own

1669
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,210
Joe cupcake.

1670
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:59,190
It's like
mock the book.

1671
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:03,810
What's the high pitch?

1672
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,920
Sorry. That is not yet out. Yeah.

1673
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:12,930
Multiple choice questions.
You sound,

1674
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:17,230
are you okay? All right.
So that's so funny.

1675
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,210
I can't believe I'm blanking on the front.

1676
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:22,210
It sounds like someone's laughing
in the background. A female. Yeah,

1677
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,140
that's him completely losing his shit.
And this is my mom.

1678
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:31,000
I'm chattel.
I'm Polly and buy and you can call me z

1679
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:34,120
and making her do reads.

1680
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,560
I love how you're introducing
me to all your fit.

1681
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:40,470
Like you're auditioning me to be your
brother. I want you to be my brother.

1682
01:49:40,471 --> 01:49:42,360
This is my dad. This is a good idea. Okay.

1683
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:46,960
If you have never up, I'm fine.
But at the same time, can you even

1684
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,020
that Julia I own,
are you the double pipe closet?

1685
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:57,913
Yeah.

1686
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:03,220
So those two are going to
be locked in a home together

1687
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:07,780
for the next however long
they live. Jesus, man,

1688
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,430
I think it's going to be crazy.
I really do. I'm worried.

1689
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:15,160
I wish them both the best of luck.

1690
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:19,540
Why don't you have him come
here and live with you guys.

1691
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:23,110
Let's see what else is going on.
Uh,

1692
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:28,030
um, Chadwick was your
birth name, right? Sure.

1693
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:34,210
Chattels Chattels Chattels Matthew.

1694
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,073
Yeah,

1695
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,660
I can tell you anything about me
cause I've had lifelock since I was,

1696
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:46,980
since it came out cause my dad stole my
identity. He did? Yeah. So I was like,

1697
01:50:46,981 --> 01:50:48,810
well if he's going to do
with maybe a stranger,

1698
01:50:48,811 --> 01:50:52,860
will you tell us the story please? He
just a, I don't know. He, he needed a,

1699
01:50:52,861 --> 01:50:57,250
so he went to prison for check
fraud, all sorts of stuff. Yeah.

1700
01:50:57,330 --> 01:51:00,960
I did not know any of this about you.
Yeah. He went to prison and then, uh,

1701
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:05,790
then he took off to Los Vicky actually.
So I bought a car.

1702
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,170
There was something wrong with the engine.

1703
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,630
They gave me a replacement car to drive.

1704
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:13,680
Then my dad made copies of the
keys and when I got my car back,

1705
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,960
had me drive him to the dealership,

1706
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:20,460
stole that car and drove it to Las Vegas.
Wow.

1707
01:51:20,910 --> 01:51:24,270
What? Yeah. And my mom, I couldn't tell
my mom any of that stuff. So she was like,

1708
01:51:24,271 --> 01:51:26,130
I just want your kids to know it's
not your fault. And I was lying.

1709
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:30,970
Well, Kinda no shear. How
old were you? I was, uh,

1710
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,180
probably 19 at the time. Did you, did you,

1711
01:51:35,181 --> 01:51:38,660
what was your perspective on him
then? Well, I just thought, you know,

1712
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:43,700
he's a fucking lunatic. You did? Yeah.
So if he's going to la, he's like,

1713
01:51:43,701 --> 01:51:48,500
I'm going to Las Vegas. Like,
great. Yeah. That's horrible.

1714
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:52,960
But it's, uh, you know,
uh, Chad, Steven Katz.

1715
01:51:52,961 --> 01:51:56,430
Stephen Daniels. Yeah. Is that
your dad's name? It is, yeah.

1716
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:02,270
My piece of shit. Huh? Pretty Great.
I don't know why you're all over him.

1717
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:10,070
Yeah.
What's your fucking problem?

1718
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:15,100
Wow. Right. Just it's my dad.
I loved him. You find it,

1719
01:52:15,101 --> 01:52:19,070
cause my parents were kind of
wacky too. As a parent. Did you,

1720
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:22,420
I don't know, like do you
not know how to, what,

1721
01:52:22,421 --> 01:52:25,810
what a good dad looks like cause
you're just kind of shitty? No,

1722
01:52:25,811 --> 01:52:30,620
I think I go from the opposite.
I know what not to do.
Does that make sense? Yeah.

1723
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:33,230
So I'm not always doing the right thing,
but I,

1724
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:37,980
I was given a checklist of what not to do
at the beginning, so that helps. Right.

1725
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:39,790
I looked at their birth
certificate and I thought,

1726
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:44,500
well I'm never going to take this social
security number, use it to my advantage.

1727
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:46,160
Right.
Interesting.

1728
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,870
Yeah. Yeah. I know you're talking about,

1729
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,840
cause I tried to get a phone
and I tried to get just fuck,

1730
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:55,160
I went to get a car and the guy
for financing and the guy was like,

1731
01:52:55,870 --> 01:53:00,530
um, it says here you owe $40,000 in
child support on your credit report.

1732
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:05,310
I was like, alright,
how do you, how do you,

1733
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:10,760
you know, beat that? Like how do you
overcome that? Like in real life?

1734
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:14,480
Like, what's, what's the
process like when you go, oh,

1735
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:18,740
everyone thinks I'm somebody. Like I went
through this phase of killing animals.

1736
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:26,410
I would, uh, pray over their
body for their soul and like,

1737
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,240
thank you for that. Did that make your
life terrible? Killing animals? No.

1738
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:35,690
Know What Your Dad did? No, not
really. No. I mean it was a credit.

1739
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:40,280
I think Tom's asking, you know,
you just have to call and say like,

1740
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:43,670
I was living with my mom the entire time.
I didn't have this apartment.

1741
01:53:43,671 --> 01:53:46,040
I didn't have, don't they not
believe you? They don't believe you,

1742
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:50,570
but so you just have to get the records.
And which is it a hassle for you?

1743
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,420
A bit of a hassle. Sure. Yeah.

1744
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:59,540
My mom would take my,
my social security number as a teenager,

1745
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:03,260
as I was like 15 years old and
open credit lines, credit cards.

1746
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:07,440
One time I checked my credit
accounts open that I didn't even,

1747
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:09,560
was it to build your credit though?
No,

1748
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:14,270
there's so she could credit cards
because my stepdad had ruined her credit

1749
01:54:14,271 --> 01:54:17,510
because he was a criminal. Oh,
can I, can I tell you something?

1750
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:21,350
Your mom stole your identity,
you know that, right? Okay. No,

1751
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:23,900
I'm telling my therapist that
justify it and I'm like, no,

1752
01:54:23,901 --> 01:54:26,180
that's straight up theft.
It's happened.

1753
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:30,600
It's a good therapist for
your daddy issues or, uh,

1754
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:35,120
I ha when I went through my divorce,
I saw a therapist and a minister,

1755
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:40,100
but I'm not religious, but it was just
nice to, uh, to chat two times a week.

1756
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:43,640
That's awesome. Yeah. I would go
every day if I could have helped a ton

1757
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,630
because they have, you
know, you're like, well,

1758
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,010
why do I think this and
why do I think this?

1759
01:54:49,011 --> 01:54:51,380
And then he draws a little diagram
and you're like, oh, all right.

1760
01:54:51,381 --> 01:54:53,670
That makes total sense.
That helps a lot of shit.

1761
01:54:55,400 --> 01:55:00,200
I thought I was a crazy person and I
didn't want to be near my kids because it

1762
01:55:00,201 --> 01:55:03,500
might hurt them. No, that's not true.
But you, how long did you see them for?

1763
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:08,960
I probably saw all sudden done
by two years. Wow. That's great.

1764
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:11,110
That's awesome. I feel
much better. I do not.

1765
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:15,520
Sometimes I go now I'll go like once
every four months cause I'll be like, ah,

1766
01:55:15,521 --> 01:55:17,510
I'm fucking this,
this thing sucks.

1767
01:55:17,690 --> 01:55:21,950
Better call that guy and then I can't
get in for 10 days and then I get there

1768
01:55:21,951 --> 01:55:26,450
and I'm like, it's all fixed. So
you want to grab lunch? Yeah. Yeah.

1769
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:30,860
I go every week. So. Okay. For uh, uh,

1770
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:33,740
to see a therapist. I mean
for what? Let's talk about it.

1771
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:38,720
Just whatever's on my mind.
I didn't have like a big jump off thing.

1772
01:55:38,721 --> 01:55:41,800
I just feel my oil change. Right? Yeah.

1773
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:43,980
It feels like a d scrambling your mind.

1774
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,370
So the way I feel like it,

1775
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:48,600
like you go in there like I'm all
fucking fixated on this thing.

1776
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:54,050
And then sometimes like the person can
just say two sentences to you and you're

1777
01:55:54,451 --> 01:55:57,180
like, yeah, I should just chill the
fuck out. You ever picked it or not?

1778
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:01,560
Yeah. Forever. And the more it gets
tighter and your fucking frustrated yeah.

1779
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:03,410
And then you just need
that one person to go,

1780
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:06,140
you're pulling on the wrong side or
whatever. It kind of feels like that.

1781
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,600
Yeah. I'm a big, big fan of it.

1782
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:12,320
I really encourage people
to go as often as possible.

1783
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:16,160
I'm trying to tell you to make more
appointments and keep going. Yeah,

1784
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:18,620
I don't think I'm, I think
I'm fucking fine. All right.

1785
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,380
Go See Christina.

1786
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:27,280
Do stand ups now we're talking
Plugin Christina's act.

1787
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:28,403
Cool.

1788
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:33,393
It's really neat

1789
01:56:39,290 --> 01:56:42,080
about in therapy. Well, I
make my mom say all this shit.

1790
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:50,020
All right. Um, okay. Uh, Chad, Kathy,

1791
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:55,150
thank you for stopping by for having me.
We have a lot of fun with you.
