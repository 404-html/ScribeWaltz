There it was.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,330
Just keep on moving as you
like to say how he's like,

8
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:46,080
just keep on moving. Keep on trucking.
That's the saying I invented.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,900
You did not invent, keep on tracking.
Didn't invent that. I didn't. Nope.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,520
I feel like I'm a hippie and that's Kinda
my thing is like whatever happens and

11
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,650
die there will goes.
We have a lot to get into.

12
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,640
We have a very exciting podcast today.
We do a,

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,840
we have not one but two guests,

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,980
which was the very first time we've ever
done that. Unprecedented, unprecedented.

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,710
Maybe the last time we'll ever
do it. It's harder. No, I know.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,800
Not a reflection on them.

17
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,570
It's just like we have one
seat so there can only be one,

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,740
but now we have to do,

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,150
but then I know another duo that has asked
to come in that we should accommodate

20
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,660
too. Oh yeah. I mean, I just
tell you off Mike, I think, oh,

21
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,190
what if I tell you and you're
like, Oh god, tell me, tell
me. No, I can't. Oh, come on.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,430
I'll tell you off mic. But
they're coming. All right, let's,

23
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:39,290
let's do a proper show open. Let's
get this thing going. Right party. Ah,

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,470
those guys suck. Yeah, that's what I'm
saying. I look to that. Here we go.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,190
I'll tell you. I'll tell you, but
come on up. Here we go. Here we go.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,430
Hi, I'm Lucas were and I
want to have kids someday.

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,090
I'm prepared to offer $1,000 to the
woman with similar needs that wants to go

28
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:01,480
out with me to dinner
and Herschel in Spokane.

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,550
So if this is you,
please post a video response,

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,670
um,
detailing why you want to go out with me.

31
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,363
Yeah.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,530
What does he want? He wants
to have children. Yeah,

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,700
but he's offering $1,000 just to go
out to dinner. Oh my gosh, I see that.

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,480
Do you think he's that bad?
No, I think this is a bad idea.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,730
I think it's a bad video. Well,
first things first, bad angle.

36
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,640
You don't want to make a video where
you can see the smoke detector on the

37
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:50,630
ceiling. That's always the sign of a
lunatic is when the smoke detectors in the

38
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,610
background is, don't even show it. I mean,

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,580
and also it's unflattering
to have the camera below you.

40
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,880
You want it to be above you or
at least even with you. Sure.

41
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,730
He's standing over it like anybody
want to have dinner with me? He's nice.

42
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,690
Um,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,220
he must have really hit some huge
barriers to have to make this video though

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,170
$1,000 to have dinner with him and
Spokane guys. We, we have fans in Spokane.

45
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,080
Please. Somebody go out with this guy.
I mean, you don't need a grand, do you?

46
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,790
Hi.
I'm looking for,

47
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,830
and I want to have kids someday done
prepared to offer $1,000 to the woman with

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,950
similar needs that wants to go out
with me to dinner. And it sure.

49
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,170
In Spokane Churchill,
if this is you,

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,440
please post a video response.
He Alien.

51
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,990
Why you want to go out with me?

52
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,460
Is it a nice restaurant? I'm hoping.
That's what I'm saying. Let's look it up.

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,870
Get a church hills and Spokane.

54
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,770
Let's see. That's kind of a
desperate a steakhouse. Oh, well.

55
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:54,650
He's got good taste in food and it's
a nice steak house. It says. Yeah,

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,260
I'm a lot of the thousand dollars.
I mean,

57
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,320
I think there's a lot of women out
there that would love to have a family.

58
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,730
They don't need $1,000. He's
not very nice, but he's not
that unfortunate looking.

59
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Oh yeah, they got a wireless. I got to
pull up to these entrees or lobster tails.

60
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:13,850
This is a nice place. The stakes
are beef is strictly USDA prime.

61
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,050
Top sirloin Ribeye. Cowboy rib eye. Yeah,

62
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,250
a flat house filet mignons.
There's a fancy, this is a,

63
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:26,990
this is a high ticket place to, it's
$50 for a steak. This is a nice joint.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,000
You can have cougar gold Mac and
cheese on the side of the cougar claws.

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,853
Sounds good.

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,050
It asparagus with balsamic
syrup or hollandaise sauce.

67
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,700
This is very nice. Yeah.
Oh, cheerful photos. Oh,

68
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:46,610
so braised beef tips. I
love it. Alaskan king crabs.

69
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,000
Now you know how many holes he's going
to have just shown up for this free meal.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,500
[inaudible] stone crab claws here.
Listen to me, that's only in season.

71
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,560
You know how many slots are going to
show up just to eat for this the thing.

72
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:00,740
And of course be interested in children
and I know they're going to abuse him,

73
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:03,850
but he's, he's setting himself up.
I'll tell you why man. Cause you're,

74
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,270
you're leading with the,
the money to have do that bad idea.

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,910
Well you should be doing is
just like, Hey, I'm single. Um,

76
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,340
I live in Spokane, I want to have
a family one day. But you know,

77
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:19,040
one day what I really want to do is
just meet someone. Does anybody like,

78
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,490
would anybody like to get together,
have dinner and talk about some of your,

79
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:26,330
maybe some of your interests fortnight
or whatever you're playing these days.

80
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,340
What? I'm work night, four
nights video game. Oh, um,

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,590
you know, I think he should
just lead with what, who is,

82
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,870
what is genuine interests are.
Would anyone like to have dinner?

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,060
You can just say that. You don't have
to mention that. It's Churchill's.

84
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,440
Anyone like to have dinner.

85
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,830
I bet you're going to get a response
from someone in Spokane that this single

86
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,850
and wants to have dinner with you.

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,460
I think you're right because
actually I need to have,

88
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,810
his approach is like a rich guy,
douche bag of pressure, and it's wrong.

89
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,720
When you think about it. It's like
the guy that owns girls gone wild.

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,273
What's his name?

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,340
That's how I imagined that guy approaches
bitches. Like, Hey, I want this. Uh,

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,210
I'll give you $1,000 to just
show up. Take it. It's like,

93
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:09,680
it's such a douchey thing. Totally
Douchey to lead with money. Yeah,

94
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,010
and to be like, you know, if you're,

95
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,030
you're conflicting what your desire is,
how you're getting it,

96
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:21,440
because you're saying what I really want
does meet someone and have a family.

97
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,140
Yeah.
I'll pay you just to consider me.

98
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,810
You would get off on the wrong here. He
says more. Let's see what else he said.

99
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,960
This guy is really sad.

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,420
I'm 37 years old and the quencher here,

101
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,180
my date has to be under the age
of 26 I know it's a weird request,

102
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,210
but I'm offering $1,000 so I think you
can see past the age of them to go out

103
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:48,060
with somebody that is fully
prepared to become a father.

104
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,910
Oh wait a minute.

105
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:54,911
This is way weirder than I thought it
was five seconds ago under 26 that's a

106
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:59,180
weird age cut off.
So they have to be at least 10 years.

107
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,680
11 years younger than him. Why?
I mean I get you like young,

108
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:06,590
but I mean why is it that specific?
Hell don't know.

109
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,370
So she's a smoke show
and she's 28 you're like,

110
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,160
you just didn't make the cut smoke shell,
you know?

111
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,110
What did you learn that word from?
I don't know, about six years ago.

112
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,550
I've never heard that. Really? I've said
it a hundred times in front of you. Smoke.

113
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,000
Show me like she's smoking
hot. Yeah, I've never,

114
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,710
I maybe I've never listened to you talk,

115
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,360
but you're also kind of removed
from culture and slang. Terrible.

116
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,940
I don't know. I don't know any
of this stuff. I know Nana,

117
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,560
but smoke shows pretty
common. Um, so I shit,

118
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:41,450
brick house, brick shit house.
Fuck. I can never get that one.

119
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:45,160
You always get it wrong. I know
why? Because my, it's a Hungarian.

120
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,350
It's probably because my mother said it
wrong and I put it wrong so that this

121
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:51,290
guys knows Joe.
Joe,

122
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,840
how you say martyr?
She said she mispronounced everything,

123
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,670
but this is all fucked up now.
You got to do what's going on when he six.

124
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,670
He's a Douche bag. I was,
yeah, you're right. I actually,

125
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,310
I was giving him more credit
because he looks sweet.

126
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:11,690
The problem is like the look, he has
his kind of like a doughy software guy.

127
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,490
This guy could find a nice girl. That's
not hard, but he's at now. He's like,

128
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:20,540
I think you can oversee. I'm giving
you a grand, but here's the thing,

129
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:25,190
what are his, what is he expecting that
at dinner at Churchill's he's like,

130
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,930
so I want a family that she'd
be like me too. And he's like,

131
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:30,980
do you want to just try to start one? You
do on a fight. How families are started.

132
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,110
You don't just eat dinner.
And I go,

133
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,410
did you imagine that courtship
story to their children?

134
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,770
And I put it out on the Internet asking
$1,000 for any hoe under 26 I paid your

135
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,820
prostitute prone mother to have
dinner with me. Yeah, your slut mom.

136
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,970
A free steak is what
she got out of the deal.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,660
She had children with me and that's it.

138
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:55,620
That's all it took for your materialistic
slut, mom. Okay, he's going to get worse.

139
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,454
Here we go.
Why worse

140
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,620
a little about me.
I want to go and get my AA degree.

141
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,300
I am writing a book about Calamari
through research suggests that men between

142
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:07,840
the ages of 35 and 55
give kids for her DNA,

143
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,340
uh, associate's degree. So yeah,

144
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:17,341
but see now I think what he's actually
trying to suggest is that he is in the

145
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,910
cause as part of his,
uh,

146
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,050
his research or something that he's
in the age group to give better DNA,

147
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,440
but for creating a family and a child,

148
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,370
the younger woman would
be the better. Yes. Oh,

149
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,840
I mean biologically speaking, I should
have had children like 16 now I know.

150
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,350
Perfect. But to put it in your
ad is, is still the straight,

151
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,760
so he's saying that 33 year olds to
50 year old men have power outages.

152
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,250
That DNA. Yeah. Jess. I
don't think it's just,

153
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,790
he's talking about what's in
the jet deep in the gym. Yeah.

154
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,360
Well you're just is very powerful.
Powerful time.

155
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,920
[inaudible] we've made two children
off your ges. That's very true.

156
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,250
Giving is duty or accelerated age.
You're 48 years old. I'm not 48

157
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,920
the doctors were like,

158
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:16,390
is he 58 how long to see your
spirit and was very fertile though.

159
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,130
We always test your sperm before we had
Ellis. Yeah. Cause like, yeah, I'm older.

160
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,430
And then what was your, he's like
your sperm counts through the roof.

161
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:29,260
You're like 20 million. How many did you
have in alone? There was a lot. Yeah,

162
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,710
it was good. He was like, yeah, you
keep nothing bro. He said it like that.

163
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:35,080
I was like,
that is not medically appropriate.

164
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,660
Remember when you just in the
Filipino nurse helped you?

165
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,840
That was so fun. Yeah.
What did you say to her?

166
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,800
Well I went in the room and that they
were going to make sure I have good judges

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,120
and she's like, you know, she's
at, her eyes are down. She's like,

168
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,940
here's a TV here and here's a remote.
Yeah.

169
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,710
And you can find some porn on there
cause they have it set up to watch porn.

170
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,240
I was like, oh cool. And they go,
so do you stay? She was like, no,

171
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,570
I can't stay with you. I was like,
I'm kidding. Stay has the best.

172
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:14,320
Yeah. But she got, she was like, Oh
yeah, this is before we had Ellis and uh,

173
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,910
we decided to hide the plumbing checked
out because yeah, I'm an old man.

174
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,940
I was all mom. Oh bitch was 38. Yeah.
They read you the riot act to do with it.

175
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,370
And you know what's weird about
the judges when they test your ges,

176
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,350
they go shoot it into this cup.
Yeah.

177
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:30,910
And make sure your penis doesn't touch
the cup. That's like impossible. I know.

178
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:34,660
And you're like, what do you mean? And
they're like, don't have it touch inside,

179
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,180
outside the rim.
Just have the,

180
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,280
just go right in there and then then
just cover up. And how big is the cup?

181
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,530
Is that it's a shortcut? Is
it like a Dixie Cup? No, no,
no. It's, it's a plastic cup,

182
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:50,470
but it's, you know, it's
not that deep and it's not,

183
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,190
I mean it has a big enough opening
but just not deep. You know,

184
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,550
they should have bigger openings for
your Dick [inaudible] and they have a

185
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,750
specific,
I remember they were like,

186
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,090
make sure you haven't come
within the last 24 hours,

187
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,570
but no more than three days.
Oh.

188
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,200
Cause that's also bad to have it
backed up for too long old Jay.

189
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:15,700
Interesting as Algiers. Yeah. So
you gotta have like semi fresh Jess,

190
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,310
how's or the days those
were the days they no more.

191
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,790
Here we go on.
Herschel's is a very nice place.

192
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,610
We offer the $65 porterhouse steak.

193
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,210
Oh my God.

194
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,070
We'd go out to dinner and
enjoy each other's company.

195
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,020
Maybe have further dates and similar
restaurants in town because I have enough

196
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:37,920
money to do this.

197
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,240
All right. We get, we get it. This
dude, this guy's fucking tool. Yeah,

198
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:46,150
this guy's terrible. You need it so
much worse than I assume now. I hate it.

199
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,860
I thought he was like, I didn't realize
how calculated and just delusional he is.

200
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,290
Yeah. I thought he was just
kind of Goofy, like I love,

201
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,250
I just want to go on a date.

202
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,860
He's just, he's wrong. He's
going about it all wrong. Yeah.

203
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,210
He might be like Asperger's or
something or he doesn't understand it.

204
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,260
Sure hasn't blinked a lot
since this thing started.

205
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,170
He probably doesn't understand
human relationships. Yeah.

206
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,790
I'm guessing he's on the spectrum.
He's touched just a little bit touched.

207
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,713
Just touch.

208
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,100
Are you touched just a little
smattering of touching. Yeah.

209
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,730
He's touched somehow.
He's in disguise.

210
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,320
Fine.
I will talk to you soon.

211
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,280
What is so wonderful? He would take me
to dinner. You're not going to, man.

212
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm going to Spokane and May, but
what if I, what if I just do a video?

213
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,670
I shave.
I put on a wig and I go,

214
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:43,671
I saw your video on the
24 I love Churchill's.

215
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,020
I love steaks and I want a family one day.

216
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,330
I like $1,000 and I want,

217
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:56,331
can you wire it to me before we go and
I liked houses and then I'll do a little

218
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,693
kind of shoulders.

219
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It could be. You could
dial me up to look pretty enough. Never.

220
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,140
I think you'd be the ugliest woman I've
ever seen. Excuse me. You would be,

221
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,950
you'd like, you could never be
transgendered. You would never pass.

222
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,540
So it would take so much surgery. Cause
your, your shoulders are so broad.

223
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:22,040
Like you're such a macho looking man.
The laser alone,

224
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,790
the Lasik on your face to get rid
of that beard. Yeah. Oh my God.

225
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,670
You have so much testosterone
swimming in this body.

226
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,650
I really think it's rude that you
said, Oh man, you're a hideous woman.

227
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,610
God dammit. Do you think I could
pass for a boy? Yeah, I can.

228
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,120
I kind of have like eastern blackie
features and the older I get,

229
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:44,390
the more I look like my dad. Like I'm
aging into my dad, not my mom. No,

230
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:46,250
you don't look like your
dad. Oh, I look terrible.

231
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,380
I can pass for like a fake
kind of guy, right? No,

232
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,970
no. You look great. Like
a gay guy. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,410
I should dye my hair.
Look like an ice skater guy.

234
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,910
All those ice skating guys.
You're like sad.

235
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:07,940
I asked the guy what those plump rumps
that you liked so much plump rump.

236
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,500
High cheekbones. Yeah.
Those guys are all straight.

237
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,280
I could, I could almost go on
a date with one of those guys.

238
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,180
They did something with the hair and
put on an APP. If they were like,

239
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,570
do you want to have dinner? I'd be
like, sure. Yeah. Cause their bodies,

240
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,850
the suits that they wear.
Yeah.

241
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,350
I kind of Foxy lady bodies and the
rumps the rumps got to die for.

242
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,930
It would be like, Ooh, it's
going on. Yeah. They kind
of do just lemon, a wallets.

243
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:37,910
Do you walk around with that's
really thick in the back.

244
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,100
They do look like just bigger women.

245
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,900
Slightly bigger than the women
they're skating with. Yup. Yeah.

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,330
I wonder if they're like the hottest
commodity in the gay world figure skaters.

247
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,000
I know. What is the hottest
combined? Who's the,

248
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,480
who's the top of the totem pole in the
gay world because there's so many like

249
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,690
different, yeah. Well it's just
your, what are you attracted to?

250
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,520
I think it's the same thing, you know,
because there's the super successful,

251
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,110
um,

252
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,740
there's that lane of the executive who
also spends three hours a day in the gym.

253
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,450
Like Andy Cohen. Like,
yeah, like Bravo TV guy.

254
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,640
He's super successful gay food chain
for, yeah. Yeah. For sure. He's up there.

255
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,650
But then there's what I'm saying,
like the super yolked once,

256
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:22,101
you know what I mean?

257
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:25,520
Like where you see it's like just
all muscles and you see them,

258
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,720
but they're like 50 and you would
be like, dude, you look amazing. 25.

259
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,420
Yeah, it's really nuts. There's that.
But then there's the, the bear lane.

260
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,400
No, no, I'm saying like the objective.
Okay. Cause in the straight world,

261
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,630
objectively speaking,
you know,

262
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,490
the handsome rich guys are the
top of the food thing. It's this,

263
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,700
it's the same thing.
The Jack and,

264
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,400
um,
there's degrees to jack though.

265
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I think ultimately the Gay George
Clooney type who's top of the food chain,

266
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,380
he's also top of the food chain
in the straight world. Right.

267
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,500
It's just the like the symmetrically
good looking super successful guy.

268
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,980
Yeah. Yeah. I guess so. And
in my and the woman's world,

269
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,340
you have to be like 12 years
old. Like 20 right? No,

270
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,990
no older than 28 otherwise
forget it. Yeah, just hot,

271
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,260
super hot. It's a good thing is that as
a woman, you just really have to be hot.

272
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,670
You don't have to have a degree.
Like guys don't care if she's successful.

273
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,790
There's a brain out doing your
own thing all the time, knowing,

274
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,550
and then the talking, if she has a brain,
you don't want to hear her talking.

275
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,390
And that's true. That's true. So
basically it's a woman, you know,

276
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,060
you want to hear her talk,
you just want her to hear her say like,

277
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,500
you're totally right. You're
the best. I love you. You're
so impressive. Yeah. Yeah.

278
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,080
God. So much easier being a woman. Oh
my God. I don't want more qualities.

279
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:56,070
This is good the way it is. It's
good right now. Right? I mean look,

280
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,930
the expectations are so low for us,

281
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,690
it's like if you achieve even more than
what's expected of you, you're like,

282
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,990
people are blown away. So great
for me. You on the other hand,

283
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,050
why guys bar's way too
high for you even vented,

284
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:10,770
everything is achieve everywhere.
It's like too much pressure.

285
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,320
You have a lot going on there. Like you
don't have that much going on. Right?

286
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,740
Like what? But for me people are like
super impressed by what I got going.

287
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm like sign with that big of a deal
compared to my husband with white guys,

288
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:23,930
I feel like they go, if you
go, this person did this,
this and this. Most people go,

289
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,460
that's pretty great.
You know what this other guy did?

290
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,150
That's always the next sentence.
Cause the other guy he did,

291
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,230
he did what you did and like 10 other
things and he invented penicillin and won

292
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:38,090
the Nobel prize. He's Ilan Musk. You
ever heard of that guy? That guys,

293
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,910
that's the thing is that the gold standard
for men is like Elon Musk, let's say.

294
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,990
It's totally different standards.
Obama, of course being president,

295
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,200
no matter whether you like
or dislike any precedent,

296
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,480
that's an unreal achievement. And the
female gold standard is like Gal Gadot.

297
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,600
You decided to be like hot, super
hot. She's talented, very talented.

298
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,510
So maybe not even her,
but the thing about being super hot,

299
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,650
cause you have nothing to do with it.

300
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,020
You deserve no credit
for being super horse.

301
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,530
No one's saying this is an equal
system. No, I'm just saying in general,

302
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:14,340
men or women, when you're beautiful
or stunning, gorgeous hair,

303
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,650
you deserve zero accolades.
You did nothing. You were
just born. Of course. Yes.

304
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:23,310
That's why being a woman is advantageous
in some regards. If you're attractive,

305
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,370
right? If you're a dog,
forget it. You've got to work.

306
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,490
You got live like a guy and it's even
worse because they don't respect you like

307
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:32,280
a guy I know. Fucked up man. In the way,

308
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:36,270
it's kind of good if you accept that
you're unattractive as a woman because you

309
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,100
actually start getting treated like
a human being. Yes. Men will be, uh,

310
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,850
you know, sorry I spilled that
mustard on you anyway. You know,

311
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:49,710
it's like they just treat you like a gag
me get you a beer and like they don't

312
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,970
treat you like a puppy. Treat you
like a person. Yeah, that's true.

313
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,380
I would say in my twenties I was treated
like totally differently. And then you,

314
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,340
you age and to being a person when you're
turning 40 as a woman and you're like,

315
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,700
oh, this feels so much better. Like I'm
being treated like are like, uh, not like,

316
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,530
uh,
Amit.

317
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:11,160
Her big fuck with a lot of women is
that when they're in their twenties and

318
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,620
they're being treated special
and they're attractive,

319
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,130
if they don't have foresight and the
ability to see that that will change.

320
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,760
Then when they age thirties
and forties and 50s,

321
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,680
they go through their own selfimposed
trauma. Yeah, true. True. Through trauma.

322
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,450
And they don't know how to adapt.

323
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,630
And this is when you see
certain women go crazy,

324
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,620
they go crazy with surgery,
they go crazy with philosophy.

325
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,390
They go their philosophy on life.
They're reading Heidegger. No,

326
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,320
they're not reading Heidegger.

327
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:48,250
They're saying that like they have
conspiracy theories about this and they

328
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:52,440
started to, yeah. But
the women who have, uh,

329
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,900
a real head on their shoulders go
like, oh, this is a time in life.

330
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,000
And then there's one other time
and I need to not just rely on

331
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,700
exterior. Yeah. Well I think that's great.
Good. Uh, counsel for men and women. Yes,

332
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,970
it's true. Listen, the, the outside
fades. Glory Fades. Beauty Fades.

333
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,560
No one looks amazing at 70.
We're all going to look like shit anyways.

334
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:16,080
You might as well develop a
nice personality, right? Yeah.

335
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,660
And interests and it'll be a good
person. Geez. Yeah. Well I like that.

336
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:22,790
We just broke down all of society.
That was really good.

337
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,291
Well,

338
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,290
the reason we were talking about it is
because we were watching an interesting

339
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,550
show about society. You, I have to give
you full credit for this. Thank you.

340
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,350
You have an ability that I have
never seen anyone else for.

341
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,830
Would you rather the best? Would you
rather you've ever heard on the show?

342
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,340
Kristina came up with,
I don't know how your mind works.

343
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,430
Your diabolical, evil, twisted,

344
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,870
truly psychopathic mind works.
Uh,

345
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,910
and also to find these fucking shows
that are horrific and fascinating and I

346
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:58,070
can't turn them off. You're
welcome. This one, you're welcome.

347
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,260
Is it age gap or love gap?
I think it's a lot of, yeah,

348
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,380
age gap on Netflix. Okay. Yes.

349
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:07,050
I do feel as though I'm
drawn to the truly depraved.

350
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,080
I like to find these shows that really
make you feel gross inside called age

351
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:16,560
gap. Love, age, gap love. Yes. So
this one is a, it's a British show

352
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,060
finished. We talked about recently
that we've finished love after lockup,

353
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,140
which I just didn't think it could
be topped. It's so fucking fantastic.

354
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,790
And that's a show where ultimately what
we walked away with is we have much

355
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:33,791
greater empathy for the fellas that had
been released into society than the sad

356
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:37,590
souls that insist on dating them and,

357
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,600
and basically manipulating them to be
how they expect them to be once they're

358
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,694
out of prison.

359
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,870
It's all about control. It's like I
want to hold this person hostage. Yeah.

360
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,840
They're in prison. They're not going to
cheat on me. They can't do anything wrong.

361
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,650
And then when they get out this immediate
push to marry because they want to

362
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:58,110
keep my log down even more.
It's so sick.

363
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,250
So with this show it's about
people who are dating or married.

364
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,360
I think they actually all married on
the show married who we just finished

365
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:11,200
episode one, so you can join
right along with us. Uh,

366
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,280
who are married and there is
a significant age gap, uh,

367
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,520
between the two people.

368
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:20,510
These are married people at the show
was filmed all in the UK and they're all

369
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:23,270
hideous.
They are horrifically unattractive.

370
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,760
I mean the ugliest human beings on earth.

371
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,280
Love these people have
age gaps in between them.

372
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:36,020
I think perhaps as
little as 18 or 20 years,

373
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,870
as much as 40 years in
between them. Uh, we have uh,

374
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,080
an 80 year old woman and a 40 year old man

375
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,920
cause I was like something's wrong
with this guy. And then he was like,

376
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,754
something is wrong

377
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,060
cause he was like,
I fell in love with her.

378
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,000
I lived at home until I was 30.
I enjoy playing the organ.

379
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,760
You're like,
this guy

380
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,760
tied to this guy and then he comes
in his goofy ass fucking sweater.

381
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,580
She's like, no, he'll pull up.

382
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,360
He's up on baseball robot.
Oh,

383
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,060
I have my own problems.

384
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,660
It's called pink Avnet. Em, my jumper.

385
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,990
It's so bad. Then there's
the set. Our favorite Ah,

386
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,040
is the 74 year old man who drum roll just
became a father for the seventh time,

387
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,900
right? Seventh time by seventh
child, he's five adult.

388
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,910
He has five adult children who the oldest
is 50 to get your life and then he's

389
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,160
on baby number seven.

390
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,190
He's 74 which I don't know as a
father and as an expectant father,

391
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,010
the idea that I'm going to be 74
new this you see us with rock star.

392
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:55,590
Mick Jagger has done this and

393
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:55,891
no,

394
00:24:55,891 --> 00:25:00,750
John Stamos was on the cover of people
at least having my ultrasound 50s and

395
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,370
people are celebrating him.

396
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:06,870
Like I knew dad at 55 like why are
we celebrating this Douche bag?

397
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,750
You're an asshole. You're fucking
total selfish piece of shit.

398
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,930
You are setting your kid
up to not be around. Yeah.

399
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,130
Like chance at the May.
Of course you're like,

400
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:20,030
well what if I do live till I'm
a hundred okay, that's possible.

401
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,430
But you think like
you're guaranteeing that,

402
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,050
well not these English motherfuckers.

403
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,730
Cause the guy who's 74 he runs
a pub so his face is bright red.

404
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:31,640
He drinks every day.
He looks eight and a half months pregnant.

405
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,890
You got one of those.
It looks like there's six tablets.

406
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,580
You mean it's hard and round like
Kate from John and Kate looked,

407
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,430
she parable. He looks terrible. Yeah.

408
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,020
He's not living the life that's
conducive to living together.

409
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,340
Then there was the other guy,

410
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,910
I mean at least he's not having children
and he really looks like dog shit with,

411
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:54,650
they all look my fucking dog shit. Then
he's just great. He fucking, he's like,

412
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,350
Oh ah, I lost my breath there.

413
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,160
And she's like, sit down, sit down. So he
just loses his breath every few minutes,

414
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:07,480
just standing, just standing.
And, and of course he's gonna,

415
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,030
he's gonna die by the
episode too, for sure. Yeah.

416
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:14,510
But these people have in kids
at that age are such assholes.

417
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,780
Yeah. Cause I don't care. There's
no, there's one couple that,

418
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:18,340
there's two couples that anger me.

419
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,510
It's the one who the woman was 40
and she hooked up with a 16 year old.

420
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,410
Of course that is a illegal,
he's a child. It's wrong. Yeah,

421
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,290
so that's fucked up. It's abuse. It's a
really, it's not okay. And then there's a,

422
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,410
the couple that have children,
the 74 year old guy in the 30 [inaudible]

423
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,970
and that from a 16 year old,
by the way,

424
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,300
maybe when she was 40 I can
see if you're 16 is enticing,

425
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:44,880
but she turned in to a
full on hound and she is,

426
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,240
she is whoof whoof brigade.
It's not good.

427
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,320
Oh yeah. They're all bark. All dogs
though. What are you talking about?

428
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,840
Even the guys are dogs. They're
all fucking dogs. Yeah, it's bad.

429
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,250
But what's my favorite
is the elderly lady, she,

430
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,910
she had a husband for 50 years and on the
deathbed the husband said to go find a

431
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:09,710
toy boy is what they call them in England,
I guess not a boy toy. And she has,

432
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:14,630
she wears is Cleopatra eyeliner. Oh my
God. And she has white, white, white,

433
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:17,120
white hair and what?
Tom?

434
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,290
Oh yeah, she's got, um, triple H. Yeah.

435
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,820
Tits big fakers. They go fakers, which
is fine. She's actually, you know, she's,

436
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:29,150
she seems fun. Yeah. But
during the sh the episode,

437
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,630
it's got these crazy triple h tits.
She's like,

438
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,340
I think I want to go get bigger tits and
goes to the doctor and you get an exam.

439
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:40,100
And he was like, I really don't think
you should. You tits are enormous

440
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,460
cause he goes, the skin is sagging
already. So you're going to have these,

441
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,740
these cantaloupes that you can't even hold

442
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,850
up. I think their worst thing
has to be, cause I mean,

443
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:53,120
I'm at a certain age now
and I'm okay with it.

444
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,340
It's gotta be horrible to
resist and resent your aging.

445
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,980
I think that's going to be what I, one
thing I don't, I don't give her so much.

446
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,280
I don't care so much about the
physical appearance of me aging.

447
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,820
I'm worried about not being able
to do the things I want to do.

448
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,200
That that bothers me. Like rock
climbing and all the love rock climbing,

449
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:14,870
karate, all these things.
I do scuba diving.

450
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,850
It's just like jumping out of bed
quickly or going up the stairs without

451
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,140
worrying about my hip breaking.
Um,

452
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,440
you got a long time hopefully for
that to worry about just doing Pilati.

453
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:29,030
It's like I was listening to Jane Fonda
talk about it and she was like the

454
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:33,320
workout queen, you know, and she still
works out and she was asked like,

455
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:34,790
well how do you work out
now? And she goes, well,

456
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:38,810
very slowly and very carefully even though
she's still does like stuff like that

457
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:39,980
kind of bums me out when you're like,

458
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,470
I have done this thing now.

459
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,500
I've been doing weightlifting with a
trainer and now as opposed to just a few

460
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,350
years ago,
I do a ton of warming up before I lift.

461
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,830
I don't go like I used to just walk in
and be like, just pick it up and go.

462
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,460
I have tweaked and just kind of hurt
things so many times now that I make it a

463
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,590
20 minute process before I do anything
of significant weight, which is smart,

464
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,670
which is going to, I think it's gonna
get worse obviously as you get older,

465
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,580
you know, so you have to get
your body ready for that shit.

466
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:20,140
But I'm not so much worried about that.
I'm saying that like when you're like,

467
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:24,160
when she, that lady's like 75
or something, the tits one,

468
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,550
the big tests and she's,
she's essentially like,

469
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,770
I gotta be hot and you're like,
you're 76 years,

470
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,720
you're not in that category anymore.

471
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,070
Yeah. And she's, you know, always wearing
tight and revealing things in this thing.

472
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,160
Just be old.
Just be like a really

473
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,900
good looking older person.

474
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:48,370
That's fine to be dignified for your age
as far as where you can't buy that low,

475
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,700
you can't by being distinguished her.
Well, cause the thing is, I mean,

476
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:53,980
you and I've talked about this before,

477
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:57,130
especially like let's say women
in their forties in my age, uh,

478
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:01,570
you can get all of botox and all that
shit in your face. You don't look younger,

479
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,970
you just look shiny or, and weirder. Yeah.

480
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,680
You never really look younger because
of this crap that you do. Right.

481
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,760
You just look weird.

482
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,070
So you choose between looking shiny
are looking your age. Yeah. It's like,

483
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,850
okay. And you're not fooling anybody.
You really are fooling people.

484
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,200
There's not a lot that are,

485
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,630
you're definitely not pulling
anyone unless your doctor drew.

486
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:25,690
That guy looks fucking
amazing. God Damn. Yeah.

487
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,230
He's like jacked and his face
looks great too. I what? I bet.

488
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,050
I bet he has some secret Dr Formula.

489
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,180
He's not telling us how he's doing
doctor Shit. For sure Doctor Shit.

490
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,370
We're going to get him aside
one day. He'll be like, oh,

491
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:40,390
I didn't tell you guys have been doing
secret. Dr Shit. Yeah. I drink blood.

492
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,990
He's a vampire. It's children's
blood badge and law. Should we,

493
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,640
uh, take a quick pause since our guests
supposed to be here any moment. Yeah.

494
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,500
It's probably easier to do it now.
Yeah. All right. We'll be right back.

495
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:56,340
Hopefully when we press record again,
we'll be with guests. All right.

496
00:30:56,341 --> 00:31:00,450
And just as I promised, uh,
before we took a quick break,

497
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,870
we're back and we're being joined by,
not one,

498
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,740
but because of their own
demands to guests. What? Yeah,

499
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,310
which is a first for this show. It's
always, it's in our podcast writer.

500
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,690
It's in the rider.
So you have to have us have both on hand.

501
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,430
We have like an a lengthy
writer. Uh, don't look us.

502
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,460
No eye contact throughout
the entire thing. Yes.

503
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,340
You guys are known to be jerks kind of
in the, you can look at my tits though.

504
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:26,520
You can look at him the whole
time. I, when I, when you
talk to me, I'm like, Hey,

505
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,470
I'm down here, down here. I'm
down here. They go by the Bros.

506
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:31,801
They say,

507
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:36,510
always say they always lead with like call
us bros or don't call us at all. Yeah.

508
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,050
Yeah.
What's up bro?

509
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,550
They go by the joke Bros Bros
or hear a funny bunch. Uh,

510
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,870
by the way, so I should say it. The
sly brothers, of course we are here.

511
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,600
They're the supplier brothers. Yeah.
They are comedians. They have specials.

512
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:55,500
They have, um, great pot. You have
more than one podcast to podcasts,

513
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,300
dumb people town, which you've done.
And you will tell people is really fun.

514
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,870
You're coming on
a and then a view from the cheap seats,

515
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:06,840
which is sports and comedy.
But we took a deeper dive into sports,

516
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,830
which is actually really fun.
But sports too, you guys are uh,

517
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,420
we're known even before obviously the
podcast you guys had ESPN show you gotta

518
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,610
show on ESPN called Yeah, cheap. Yeah.
Back in the mid two thousands there.

519
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,980
Michigan men. If I am. Yes,
you are correct. We just
won the big 10 tournament.

520
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,260
What a great dad and a feelings.
Good feelings.

521
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:27,550
It was like that is going to come
through a dude. It's going to work out.

522
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,300
Come through.
You're wearing like Michigan colors.

523
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,500
Do you think that's an accident? No. No
it's not. Yeah, I did it for you. Um,

524
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,210
it all free.

525
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,460
But before we get too far out of the way
and I know we'll get sidetracked with a

526
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,050
bunch of stuff.
Uh,

527
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,440
one of the main reasons you came on
besides the fact that we are thrilled to

528
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,880
have you and we love you is that you are
promoting a new movie that I think is

529
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:52,760
going to really click with our audience.

530
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,980
I will let you go ahead and tell us
the name of your new documentary.

531
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,090
Well first of all, it came out last
week. All right. It's called poop talk.

532
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,470
It's a documentary about poop.

533
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,080
Why is it something that everybody does
but people really don't talk about it.

534
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,000
You guys talk about

535
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,950
and your fans talk about it quite a bit
so that you will love this will love

536
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:19,370
this movie. So it is people talking about
it. We released it last couple weeks.

537
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,830
We're like, we should have
called the movie the Brown
Panther. That was a misprint

538
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,670
toilet water lady.
Turd lady term would have been great.

539
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,953
Thank you.

540
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,200
It's like the week after you shoot
your special and then you're on stage,

541
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:36,320
there's no pressure and you're like, why
didn't I ever say it this way? So good.

542
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:40,330
Now I understand what the bits really
about get it out would have been fun to

543
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,090
come on. Why so many? So many.

544
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,710
So it's called pep talk because I
mean truthfully as we were naming it,

545
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,180
we as Canadians wanted to give it
like a clever name. We're like,

546
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:56,660
we should call it fecal matters, you
know, something. Another good one. Right.

547
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,070
And then every or we said talking
shit or shit talk or whatever.

548
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,750
But the people who were kind of in
MDF would sue you. But yeah, I got it.

549
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,120
Well he'll say he's going
to sue US anyway. Yeah.

550
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,830
Cause we did one college last year.

551
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,990
He's going to sit this way and we're
huge in Australia. Uh, I love Edia.

552
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,180
So wait a minute. So tell me,
take me through the origin of,

553
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,930
I mean we're already fighting,
but like how does the idea,

554
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,550
like the idea come to let's make this,
it was not our idea.

555
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,770
Our friend who we went to camp with WHO's
actually a really smart filmmaker set

556
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,640
came to us with this idea
two years ago and said,

557
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,670
I want to do a movie about the history
of Poop and I want you guys to help me

558
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,370
produce it and get past. So here's the
thing, you know how with every car,

559
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,770
I'm sorry to cut you off,
every comic especially, uh,

560
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,280
you talk about there's certain
wheelhouse topics that you know, like,

561
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,440
like make them smile, light them
up. So if you say, you know,

562
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:53,090
you could talk about like, I'm
definitely a, if it's sex, dirty,

563
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,260
dirty dirt old school dirty jokes. Yeah.
That always makes me go, I go like, yeah,

564
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,690
somebody tell me and murder,
but a,

565
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,710
there is fantastic 100% through the
more than 12 years that I've known

566
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:09,980
Christina, if you, if somebody says,
and then someone took a shit over there,

567
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:12,170
she's like,
what if she starts laughing?

568
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,300
[inaudible] I actually have to pull back
from writing so many poop jokes in my

569
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:24,290
act. I've had other comics and be like,
Whoa, poop jokes once you had a baby.

570
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:28,920
Like it just like everything comes out
when the baby, Oh yeah, other people,

571
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,270
shit comes out of you. It's like all
sorts of stuff comes out. So wait.

572
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:36,260
So your family's secrets was said,
I want to do this. See? And we said,

573
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,100
I don't think we can do this

574
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,370
movie because I don't know that we can
handle this the way we just weren't sure

575
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:44,400
that we can handle it. And
so he said, don't say no.

576
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,460
Think about it over the weekend, the movie
you'd want to make. And we were like,

577
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:47,910
all right,

578
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,630
if we get funding people to be honest
about how they feel about it and try to

579
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:55,260
make an honest film, it'll still
be funny. And if we get at like,

580
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:58,440
why is this something that, obviously
you're comfortable talking about it.

581
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:02,220
We're comfortable talking about it as
Comedians, but why or why do everyone,

582
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,800
why do we pretend we don't
do it? I mean, that's just,

583
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,430
it's an insane that there's like we've
passed, when you think about sexual stuff,

584
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,290
you've passed so many tab. What used
to be taboo is like, that's like way,

585
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:16,240
way. Do you feel like we're swinging
back around the call to sac to him,

586
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:21,090
more Victorian era. Millennials? Yes.

587
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:24,600
Hannah called millennials or you know,
just the entire movement of like,

588
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:29,600
can I put my hand on your hand? Is this
going too far? And you know what I like,

589
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,100
this is a job interview so you can't,

590
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,000
I didn't experience this
in the past 10 years,

591
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,150
but this year I have never had
such strikingly different sets.

592
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,290
Blowback, indifferent. I'm saying
saying you can do a set yup.

593
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,680
In two different venues and feel like
you did them 30 years apart. Yes.

594
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,270
That I've never had before where I'm like,
cause you're like,

595
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:56,870
I know this material works everywhere
and I know exactly what the last points

596
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:57,561
are going to get on them.

597
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,770
30 minutes apart where I've
been in a venue in Los Angeles,

598
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,590
Donna said ain't shit to
a point where I'm like,

599
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,270
I don't even know if I know how to
do standup anymore and I'm scared by,

600
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,580
by the reaction that I got and
then drive to another place,

601
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,890
do the same set and have it like a stroke.
Right.

602
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,710
Yeah. Well, what's interesting,
I mean, I'm always a big,

603
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,940
I think that's a great thing,

604
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,360
like we should always be staring into
the abyss of your own career saying like,

605
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,920
how the fuck are we gonna do what's next?

606
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,190
Because I can't trust
people who just are always,

607
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:28,430
they're essentially just straight up.
I'm like, not that I can't trust them,

608
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:31,730
but I have nothing in common with
that person because you always have,

609
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:35,180
I feel like you are a better comic and
you're a better person when you say like,

610
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I mean that's why actors who rise
up don't lose touch with reality.

611
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,040
But when you're a comedian and
you put yourself out there,

612
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,510
you stand on the stage to liberty.

613
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:50,511
I on this to show on Saturday night in
Detroit and it was a show for the next

614
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,700
generation Jewish Federation,

615
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:57,400
800 people at this big Butte of the film
or theater play the showroom downtown

616
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,110
in Detroit. Very cool. Nice
place, beautiful venue.

617
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,460
And I thought 25 to 40 year old Jewish
people were going to like light it up.

618
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,410
We'll just live in the pocket
of our material and they, it,

619
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,820
I'll fucking exactly you open
with that that goes with that.

620
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,580
But I was like, and again with material
that we've been doing this with tail,

621
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:20,450
we know it works. We know where
it's going to do what it is and uh,

622
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,240
it was definitely like we were sledding,
we were,

623
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,260
we were slugging it out with these
people and I literally at one point where

624
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,830
it'd be like, what are you
guys doing? You're here,

625
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,210
here and here's the, here's
the truth man. The worst I,

626
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,100
I'll say it from myself as somebody

627
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,640
that we live in a progressive city,

628
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,010
we all are pretty liberal minded people.

629
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,800
The ultra liberals are the worst comedy.

630
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,950
They're terrible. It was hard. So I
have no sense of humor. They don't know.

631
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,480
Like part of what we do is cross lines.
You want to cross. That's the fun part.

632
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,010
Set up. Yes. Go ahead and let the
audience laughs. You haven't crossed it.

633
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,960
You've just found that lovely edge. It's
right. We say where is the, we were,

634
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:07,710
we were hosting the final
draft towards okay. Finally

635
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,920
writing thing. And there
was, and there was,

636
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:14,100
it's still around and they would give
these lovely awards out and it was at the

637
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,190
paramount theater was about 500 people
there was really cool and we're like,

638
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,400
okay,
let's bring out the trophy align,

639
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,740
let's bring out the trophy so you can
see it in our beautiful woman who comes,

640
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:25,540
comes out. They're like, can we please
have the trophy girl out here? I'm like,

641
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:28,370
that. That's maybe a little too
offensive. Knowing the audience,

642
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,600
right scholar what you really is,
trophy wife.

643
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,580
So that was a joke. That was fine.
We knew that was going to be okay,

644
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,070
but then I said, listen,
you know, I'm sorry,

645
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,710
sorry for that joke and
we're sorry to her. I said,

646
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:45,660
I'm sorry for everything that Hollywood
has done and probably will do to you.

647
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,500
So I like that they are like that,
but I was like, you know what?

648
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:50,161
I don't give a shit.

649
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,920
The first thing worked and that's all
that I really care about. But it was,

650
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,300
it's just, again, that's what we do as
me. It's this fine line. Those people

651
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,400
start to get when they're at show start
having such an awareness of like they

652
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:05,920
want to be right rather than have fun.
Yeah.

653
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,730
I mean it goes both ways.
It's like,

654
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:11,300
I mean the crazy thing is we have material
in our show that is anti, you know,

655
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,970
anti Trump.
We tell how we feel about things.

656
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:17,840
You're being yourself in Rochester and
we kind of present the topic out there

657
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:20,380
and like half the people don't
want anywhere what we do.

658
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,190
I had to say no and we're like,
all right,

659
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:25,040
well you're jumping on board with us
because we'll actually make a point that

660
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,740
even if you support the guy,
you can't deny that we're right.

661
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,750
That we're wrong on this.
We're right.

662
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,470
But it's interesting that
we're what we're all saying.

663
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:36,220
It sounds like everybody's divided.
There's two kinds of comedy audiences now.

664
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,550
It's split much like people who
support Trump and don't like,

665
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:41,650
I think the country is just
divided, right? You did all that.

666
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:46,150
We just did a project that is also,
it's coming out on audible.

667
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,290
It's like an audio book and we were
jumping off the poop more jumping off the

668
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,590
pool. They're moguls. We do this. We have,

669
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,840
oh yeah, I'll go over like little tiny
little bumps at the bottom of a ski run.

670
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:01,060
That's what kind of mobile, so that's
the kind of models we are and so like we,

671
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:04,120
so anyway, it's about, you know,
you go, you guys go into a town,

672
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,360
we try and experience as much as we can
in that town and then write comedy about

673
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:11,110
it. So we set the challenge plane lands
on Thursday. If you're doing Thursday,

674
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:12,250
Friday,
Saturday night shows,

675
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,040
can we write 10 minutes of material
about the town that we're in?

676
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,240
That's your guy's like selfimposed yes,
we did this on this project.

677
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:23,100
And so like local material that
then speaks to a larger, broader,

678
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,010
it's an audio book.

679
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,090
It's each city is a chapter and they
follow us from the second we land

680
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:30,100
throughout the second
observation and the field,

681
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,700
like each chapter is about 35 minutes
long, 40 minutes long. And so, you know,

682
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,560
he's basically three documentaries in one.

683
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,410
What it's like to be comedians at
our level traveling around right now,

684
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,100
I grouped, you know you guys are
the guys are beyond our level.

685
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,610
You guys are in a different level then
what it's like to be in those cities

686
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:49,490
right now. What? What is, what is
Denver dealing with? Right? How has,

687
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,500
how has we'd change?

688
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:53,810
Never can gay people still live in San
Francisco who they can't because they've

689
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,380
been priced out by tech Bros. What's
Kansas City grappling with right now?

690
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:57,771
Like how,

691
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,890
like what's Houston like
after the hurricane we were
there for the hurricane and

692
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:04,130
then after the Astros one, like
what are they, what's their mindset?

693
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,360
So it was so it was all that and then it's
about what it's like to create a joke.

694
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:12,290
Like how do you observe something in the
moment? Like when we were up in Buffalo,

695
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,610
we did this like a long time ago.

696
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,040
I didn't know that Rick
James is buried in Buffalo.

697
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,930
Fucking buried above that should be
on their airport. Welcome to Buffalo.

698
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:22,520
Rick James is buried here,
bitch.

699
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,330
So we go out to his fibia statute.

700
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,090
We got the guy forcing a woman this
beating a woman with a crack pipe.

701
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,040
So we go to his grave and we're like,

702
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,560
and taking the audio at
the grave and it's insane.

703
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:39,020
We're walking out to this grave
and there are people at the site,

704
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,860
they're like Hawaiian Leis rest because
I guess nobody repped Hawaii better than

705
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:47,990
Rick James. Why? And they're like empty
beer bottles and stuff and we're like,

706
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,880
what was artfully placed here versus
what just blew in from the highway.

707
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:55,900
And that is probably a better, the
best metaphor for the guy's life. Yeah,

708
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,970
it's like his trash was also
going on to other people's,

709
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:02,000
because this is an audio book that's
coming out audio, so it's on auto,

710
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,440
it's called Sklarz and stripes.

711
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,130
And what I've gathered so far from you
guys being here with us, we'd gone,

712
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,630
you guys are lazy and you really
get your shit together.

713
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,820
And then you guys will love this.

714
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:17,900
As we pulled six minutes out of each of
the 10 cities and we made a comedy album.

715
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:21,500
So the album is going to cry as well.
And each track is like just Tulsa,

716
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,910
Kansas City. So it's just a different
way to do comedy. I'm so that,

717
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,720
the crazy thing about that is the first
weekend we did was San Diego American

718
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:34,190
comedy company. The weekend after Trump
got elected. So that was bat shit crazy.

719
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,050
And then the next 13 months it was
crazy going around to Kansas City,

720
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,130
St Louis, Madison, you know Houston,

721
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,540
these are not all blue state.
We're not all going. Yes,

722
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,530
you went to Portland yesterday
in San Francisco, but San
Diego is a little mixed.

723
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,300
Went to a lot of different Louisville

724
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,250
the week that he was elected. And what
did you do? You did like a a theater. No,

725
00:43:56,251 --> 00:43:59,430
I did. I did the club. I did the club.
That's the club in lieu of laughing derby.

726
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:03,510
I don't even know if it's still doing
it right, but it was the week of and a,

727
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:08,400
that's a blue city in a red state class.
But for the shows is definitely mixed.

728
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,750
Yeah.
But what I learned that week,

729
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,880
and this is like the week of like he
got elected Tuesdays and Thursdays.

730
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,700
Those are weekend in San Diego for
my show, which I'm like, I don't,

731
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:21,840
I didn't have a lot of political stuff
and stuff, but like when I brought it up,

732
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,050
everybody was like,
can we just talk about something else?

733
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:29,160
And then we would, you know, I would
joke around about a couple of things,

734
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,920
but as soon as I just moved,
everybody was like,

735
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,900
oh think like you could tell
that they were just like,

736
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,180
it was a literal that week for sure.
Legal though was worried.

737
00:44:37,181 --> 00:44:40,350
Like we got into the wall. We're like,
Shit Wall's coming ball. Do you want it?

738
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,870
Whether you fucking want it or not. We're
like, what do we do with it? We said,

739
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:46,780
you gotta have fun with it. Rock
climbing wall on our side, on our side

740
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,880
to help them over the wall. And
then we still have you, boy,

741
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:52,360
you've put a rock
climbing wall on our side.

742
00:44:52,361 --> 00:44:55,570
You could book your kid's birthday party.
Where are your kids?

743
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:57,240
Had to breath down with
a wall if I can go on.

744
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,880
And then we sat on the other side of
the wall for 200 yards up to the law.

745
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:02,470
It should be the American Ninja
Warrior course. Yeah, Mexico.

746
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,880
Cause if you make it through that,

747
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:07,600
you just deserve to be an American citizen
on the stock. Had a drummer. Hilarious.

748
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,300
Great idea. That's how we get our
sentence. I guess the citizenship

749
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,230
not only remained calm
an American citizen,

750
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,570
you already own your own crossfit gym.
Small business owner.

751
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,160
And so then that's great. So, so we wrote
that that weekend that we were there,

752
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:24,100
we're like, okay, this is what's on our
mind and this is what's bothering us.

753
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:26,800
And as we were feeling very helpless
and frustrated and we're like,

754
00:45:26,801 --> 00:45:28,210
this is going to come,
no matter what,

755
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,570
maybe some people will are going to
be psyched about it. Maybe they won't.

756
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,730
But if we can make the whole room laugh,

757
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,020
then we've done something in this moment.

758
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,220
Even if they're laughing at some
of that's not political. Okay.

759
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,700
And you have read that we, like you
said, you did the rest of your set,

760
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,970
the rest of your step,
they're laughing at,

761
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:47,530
you get what you're saying
to them essentially without
them even knowing it is,

762
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,480
hey, you guys have stuff
in common. Like let,

763
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:53,350
let's let the homerooms laughing
at his old sex jokes. Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,460
And the whole room that you made a
room full of people who probably,

765
00:45:57,461 --> 00:45:59,710
if you weren't talking we'd be
yelling at each other. Right?

766
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,950
You made them come together and laugh
at this and that is what we truly,

767
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:04,570
that's like the beginning point.
Yeah.

768
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,400
I do believe that that is
the beginning point. Hey,

769
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:09,190
we have stuff that we can all laugh
about. Let's, let's start there.

770
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:13,330
And then obviously we disagree on other
things, but it was, that was fascinating.

771
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:15,730
So that's called scars and to drive.
That'll be out on April 5th on audible.

772
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,090
But it was a fascinating thing
and I think his standups,

773
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,860
you guys totally can appreciate.

774
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,450
The other thing is you go on
the road and I know it's hard.

775
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,340
It's hard because you guys
aren't together. Do you
travel together sometime? No.

776
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,350
So you go separate places. Yeah. You get
out there, it's very easy to get isolated.

777
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,760
Just stay in your hotel and
not lead really the whole
time. You just stay there.

778
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,910
Shit.
You just jerk off the whole,

779
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:41,340
he does. I order room
service, I eat, no, I eat.

780
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,690
I feel like it's got you start
to, what is it like, you know,

781
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,990
retract into a dark place. Yeah.
The week as long. Oh yeah. So like,

782
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,890
you know the, yeah, but you don't bring
someone to open for you though. I do.

783
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,700
So what happens? But even then, a
lot of times they're like, you know,

784
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,890
they'll text me, hey, what do
I do? And I'll be like, just
leave me alone. And then,

785
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,980
but then you know,

786
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,750
I'll bring the opener. Who will leave me
alone? I don't, he's gonna leave me alone.

787
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,030
Person with a heart condition. You
can't walk up hills. They're like,

788
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:17,500
I'm just not going to walk up that hood.

789
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,440
You're conditioning yourself
to the point where you're like,

790
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:21,640
I don't need to go that way.

791
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,080
But now it's been enough years of touring
where I'll recognize that it's not

792
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,220
healthy. So what I'll do is I'll,
I'll tell the person, like, we are

793
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,220
having lunch and like seeing a movie or
doing something tomorrow for the next

794
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,500
leg of my tour.
Tony Robbins is opening.

795
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,810
He's going to motivate me to get my ass
up because sometimes you go, you know,

796
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:46,840
you're, it's like day two or three
and you're just like, God damn it.

797
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,640
And just the act of leaving the room and
doing any, it could be the most Monday,

798
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:54,400
it could be coffee at the corner.
You're like, oh, this is better.

799
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,590
I'm not just sitting in the road.

800
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,320
So when we were getting out and then so
we would put it on us to like write this

801
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:02,560
stuff. We were like, and with
the crazy thing about this, this,

802
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:06,880
we did it in Rochester and we weren't
even doing it for the project.

803
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,650
So we were in Rochester this
past weekend and we're like, oh,

804
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:11,470
let's see how much material we can
write about Rochester. And the guy who,

805
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,590
you know, open for us was
really cool and we were like,

806
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,260
and we brought our buddy up from New
York who feature for us. So we're like,

807
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,880
all right, we're like a
Forman. Cause when we go,

808
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:23,340
well if I like a descending on a
town like you're a band. Yeah, yeah.

809
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,570
Me and were like, we're going to go
do this and we're going to do this.

810
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,880
We're going to go out afterwards and
we're going to do this. Because for us,

811
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:29,830
we're like, if we're away from
our kids and our families,

812
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,040
we're already getting shit
for being away from home.

813
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,900
I am not going to have a bad time.
Right?

814
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,160
Like I want to enjoy myself because the
amount of flack I'm getting from being

815
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,720
away,
I've never heard of that.

816
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,840
Or you don't get anything that she
does not give you any flack whatsoever.

817
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,340
Five months pregnant and he leaves. It's,
it's fine. It's fine. It's still fun.

818
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:51,340
You can handle, you can handle it. I
mean talk about something else. So that's

819
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,070
the good news is that your
son's on a handful either age,

820
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:59,200
rage is self sufficient.
Yammer likes to take,

821
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,600
never likes to take your lipstick
out and write on the walls

822
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,150
and it should be fun. Number
two, there it comes out.

823
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,270
The second child talking
about guys who have two kids.

824
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,080
I've got 10,
a 10 year old and 12 year old.

825
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,380
I just dropped my 12 year old off
yesterday and you want to talk about like

826
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:19,330
moments.
I just dropped her off.

827
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,800
He yesterday at the roller
skating rink for like, uh,

828
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,960
just her and her friends.
That was such a moment.

829
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:29,530
I literally was like about
to cry and then Michigan,

830
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:33,040
one of the big 10 tournament, I was
like, ah, there is a god. And I was like,

831
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:35,600
don't ever happens to her is fine.
Just don't get stabbed.

832
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,590
Do you like Your Life Christina?
Oh my God. We witnessed that once.

833
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,270
Witnessed a couple who
invited us over and it was a,

834
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,290
were older than us, very nice
house, like very successful.

835
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,020
And um, we were new,
you know, like a new cup

836
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,630
and we're just sitting there and
they're serving like this. Nice.

837
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,820
It's like a late lunch and they have it.

838
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,640
They invited a couple other neighbors
over and they have this big nice house.

839
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,970
And then she,
she uh,

840
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,600
started telling him, she was
like, Jesus. He was like,

841
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:14,710
look at your body cause like you're
really like really have let yourself go.

842
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:18,250
And I'm like taking a boat
to her husband in front of

843
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,830
and, and then I'm like, oh my God, he
let himself go. I just want to know dude,

844
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,650
I would pay. So had he had, first
of all he was at four pack abs too.

845
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,090
He was an all American in college at
a division while American douchebag.

846
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:40,340
But like, so he just looked
like a like a 55 year old.

847
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,010
Slightly added. Yeah. But like
not bad and look bad. Okay.

848
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,910
And then rate for 55 every morning.

849
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,100
We heard him doing his fucking
laughs at five in the morning.

850
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:54,101
So can we just say he goes great
for 55 average for 36 fine.

851
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,330
So she said you really let yourself go.
You guys go,

852
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,320
because I think he took like a big
serving. It's just because Jesus,

853
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:04,990
you're going to eat all of ad.
And he was like, she's like me.

854
00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:06,950
You should have seen what it
looked like when we got married.

855
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,160
And then I like put a, I
put like a spoon. I'm like,

856
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:17,590
I guess I'll have small portions.
Right. She shamed you. Oh Man. Yeah.

857
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,380
And then we just kind of, you know, she
says that melts and goes, let me say it.

858
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,590
Let me ask you this. Do you like
your life? Do you like living here?

859
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:28,790
How do you like your life? And I was
like, you know, did you add one point?

860
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:33,080
I was really like, he's got
a point. Yeah. Oh, of course.

861
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,080
Because she did nothing for her.

862
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:40,090
Children were grown and like living at
home didn't like her life is the answer.

863
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,530
Well,
I mean to me,

864
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:45,020
and you guys were talking about
the Olympics on a previous episode.

865
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,740
I mean that is, and this is,
I love when anybody starts,

866
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:52,980
this is why I love your podcast because
it's like deep, deep relationship.

867
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,870
We were talking about why we love, I
guess is great. Okay. Here's what it is.

868
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,760
You can talk about it. You're both
funny. That's it. That's the end of the,

869
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,670
that's the end. That's the
beginning of the end of the day.

870
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,610
It's not a funny guy with his wife who's
also along for the ride or hilarious

871
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,580
dom husband. It's like you guys, boop,

872
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:14,390
you guys both attacking on a high level
and your relationship was so great.

873
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,253
I ran in and we're like,

874
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,330
can we ask them at some point today during
the podcast if they would open their

875
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:24,331
relationship up to just the two of us
can we'd show tomorrow with you guys and

876
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,900
let me just ask you both.
Do you like your life?

877
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,700
You guys have to commit to family dinner.
I fucking love.

878
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:35,900
I just love how you guys talk to each
other and even if this is the only time

879
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:39,920
you talked to each other like
this. No, I love it so much.

880
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,300
It's the healthiest aids like,
do you want to know why? Why?

881
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,090
Because we talk about pooping in
front of each other. That's it.

882
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:50,630
Did comes back to our movie, comes
back to poop talk, which I can,

883
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:54,320
I just lament that we have you guys
in the movie. It's very upsetting.

884
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,820
I'm going to get out in front
of this apology. You know,
here's the thing. I first,

885
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:03,740
we had dinner a few weeks ago with,
uh, Brian Volk wise. Yeah. Who

886
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,460
in charge of, and he goes, oh, you
know, he goes, I have this, uh, the,

887
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,170
we have this documentary
talking it up. Yes. He goes,

888
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:15,290
I have a documentary coming up. You're
going to love it. And I go, what is it?

889
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,990
And he goes, it's about a poop.
And I go, what's up poop document?

890
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:20,541
And he's like,
well,

891
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:23,660
it's like a bunch of comedians
though talking about when I'm like,

892
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:26,100
my heart's sinking. I
know. How would we not

893
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,670
invite,
you don't invite us literally.

894
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,500
But this is literally the
studio that poop built.

895
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,200
This is this work in a
poop building right now.

896
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,550
We only make the sequel number to seduce.

897
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,920
Guys are all over weight. When your
friend tells you you, you think about it.

898
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,190
And we said,
no,

899
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:46,590
I don't think we can do this cause I don't
know if we can do this the right way,

900
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,470
you know, truthfully. But then
we came back to him. He said,

901
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:52,080
think about how if we could get comedians,

902
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,860
I mean there was no budget and we had
like a day to do it. I guarantee you,

903
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:59,130
by the way, if we would have asked you,
you guys would have been gone out of town,

904
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:00,080
but I'm not trying to,

905
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:03,180
you're totally posture and then because
we had like a day to shoot or two days

906
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,440
to shoot,
but it was one,

907
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,230
it was one of those things where
we call the Improv and said,

908
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:09,240
can we film here during the day?
Yes.

909
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,300
They gave us a fair price and
helped us with, which was amazing.

910
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,890
We pulled a bunch of people on we,

911
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,250
Brad Williams is a comedian who I love
who's in the film and he's so funny.

912
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:18,900
He was not someone we thought to ask.

913
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,110
He just happened to be at the Improv
that day. He's like, what are you doing?

914
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:26,130
We're like, we're making a
movie about poop. He said,
I said, do you have a story?

915
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,910
Just for the hell of it, and he was
like, I have the story. And I was like,

916
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:32,270
do you want to hang? You know his
story, I don't know his story.

917
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:36,010
I'll do the setup for it. And then you
have to watch the movie. Did he tells,

918
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,210
by the way, I think the centerpiece
story of the movie and we didn't,

919
00:54:38,211 --> 00:54:40,770
we didn't even ask him to be in the
movie and he just shows, luckily there,

920
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,660
so he goes into a public bathroom at a
restaurant, it take a shit and he's like,

921
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:49,340
it was a club maybe. I Dunno where
ever it was. He said the, he has like,

922
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,350
I guess I have to use the handicap stall
because that was a little person worth

923
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,310
coming into our community in his
way. He describes it. And so he's,

924
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:00,670
but he's got big ideas guys. And he's
very sensitive. He would never use it.

925
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,890
Oh No, no, no, no, no. He's
like, I go into the bathroom,
I go to take a shit. And I'm,

926
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,920
I guess I'm the one who's supposed
to use the handicap stall,

927
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:11,190
so I'm gonna use it and he gets in there
and the toilet is somehow higher than a

928
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:14,130
regular toilet.
So he's got to get up on and his,

929
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:17,930
as he describes like the parallel,
parallel and back,

930
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,470
we'll say, can we take a look at the
trailer just for a moment? Let's just see.

931
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:26,460
I mean, I don't know if it's
a, it's in it. You're going
to be, I'm going to be mad.

932
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:29,280
Let's see what,
don't yell at us.

933
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,140
I just hated pooping so much that I
figured poof is excess food or whatever.

934
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,970
Oscar loser obsessed,

935
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,450
but trying to keep the right
amount funny on the Oscars last,

936
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:45,500
but then I would still poop people clock
my restroom visits because somebody

937
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:46,940
will see me go into a
bathroom and be like,

938
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,180
oh that's the guy from modern family
and be waiting for me coming in and it's

939
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:53,770
like, man, I'm glad I
poop. They'd be like, Whoa,

940
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:56,120
he's bigger than I was.
Five minutes in.

941
00:55:56,121 --> 00:56:00,590
There was this very powerful disgust
biology associated with it and then the

942
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:04,070
culture reinforces all that with
shame and embarrassment. Okay.

943
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:05,570
With you knowing that I'm doing it.

944
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,600
I'm just not okay with you hearing it and
I'm not okay with you smelling it idea.

945
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:11,270
I really think it's
called number two because

946
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,370
the second best thing you
can do with your body.

947
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,860
My mother used to call them bowel
movements. Oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop,

948
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,160
Ooh,
right.

949
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,300
I definitely think about where
the most people, I don't know,

950
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:34,630
maybe everybody thinks about the block
is the only thing that we can all agree

951
00:56:34,631 --> 00:56:37,960
on that everyone does.
It might be slightly different,

952
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,880
but we all get it the way that we
can take in and eliminate impurities.

953
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,020
It's a biological marvel. I don't think
I've ever pooped in Royal Stadium.

954
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,120
I don't think I've ever
pooped in Dodgers stadium.

955
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,020
I know I've never pooped at staple center.
Great Line hoop all down my leg. Oh,

956
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:57,400
I love making my legs. Didn't dangle below
the door. Another dude, when he left,

957
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:00,520
he thought he was by himself in the
bathroom, so we just turns off the light.

958
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,730
I was freaking out.
Terrified by me.

959
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:07,090
I may have cleaned up nick Swardson's
poop a hundred percent true by the way.

960
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,090
It's a super funny movie.
That's great.

961
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,270
I'm done with my poop talk.

962
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,370
So his daughter named the movie cause
she called it a little Virgo. Uh, yes,

963
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:25,150
we are bummed that we didn't ask
you guys to do it. Super Sad.

964
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,940
They deserve all the shit that you guys
can throw. Well, I tell you this, we were,

965
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:32,200
um, when we first heard about it and
we processed that after Brian, I was,

966
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,120
we were kind of hurt and then
angry and then, you know,

967
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,590
all the stages of grief. I go through
all those stages when I took a shit,

968
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,120
of course, literally something that
could leave, then we realize that death,

969
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,260
the two of us are actually, um, working.

970
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,360
We've been working on a
documentary and it's not, yeah,

971
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,450
something,
we're 45 years old,

972
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,380
I guess who we didn't call it.

973
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:12,860
I am addicted. I'm addicted to Becky. Uh,

974
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,353
one of 'em

975
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:22,250
w w are uncertain days.
Does the novelty, um,

976
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,690
get old. There are moments
where you're like, Eh,

977
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:31,970
and we fought for years to
not be seen as a gimmick.

978
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,390
We wanted people to be like,
that's a great comedy team.
Oh, I mean though, not on,

979
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,070
honestly, you guys are are a great
comedy till you guys are great comedians.

980
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:44,100
It's a, it's no doubt at all about
it, but I'm saying like, you know,

981
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:47,780
if something like six eight everyone's
going to be at least as the weather up

982
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:51,700
there bro. And every day,
all the time, look, we're,

983
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:56,860
we are grown men with families and we
aren't seen as the Sklar brothers or twins

984
00:58:56,931 --> 00:58:58,130
in our family.
Like just,

985
00:58:58,131 --> 00:59:01,700
the guy was gone for two days and didn't
get anything done around the house and

986
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:02,510
one's mad at me.

987
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:06,500
I'm the guy who forgot to
pack the undergarments for
my daughter, for Les Mis,

988
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,200
you know, I'm like, that's who I
am. I am identified as that person.

989
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,900
So when we're walking,
especially like if we're doing,

990
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,640
you know how many at a city,

991
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:16,700
some other city or somewhere that we'll
just walk down the street and they're

992
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:20,960
like, you got, that's so cute. We're
like, no idea. Be Six year old.

993
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,130
You guys

994
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,130
quiet guys. That's so funny. You
guys finish each other's sentences.

995
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:27,620
That's so great. We're like,
Hey, let's stop focusing on us.

996
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:30,980
Finishing each other's sentences. And
let's focus on Oj finishing one sentence.

997
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,200
How about that? Yeah, how about that?

998
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:37,400
Because the guy hasn't no are are a
really is annoying and, but you know, we,

999
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,870
we're, we're nice people. We try to not
get in. People get the fascination though.

1000
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,590
I understand the fascination too because
on some level where like we are trying

1001
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:48,830
to judo that fascination
into something deeper,

1002
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:53,030
which is most people see it and they're
like, did you guys ever switch on girls?

1003
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,970
That's a, that's a deep seeded
thing where like he says,

1004
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,030
you mean pull off a rape?
Is that what you're asking?

1005
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,710
Am I really excited to hear the
story about that? Number one,

1006
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,120
we didn't go to Michigan State.
No.

1007
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,050
Number two like that is the most bizarre
thing for, yeah, that's what I mean.

1008
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,260
And you're just like, because we use
the good one and who's the bad one?

1009
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:20,990
We're like, yeah, that's right. You
know, people aren't nuanced at all.

1010
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,780
I mean there's no, you know,
there's no, we're like, we're both,

1011
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,610
we're all that thing in,
in every,

1012
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,390
so there is a little bit
of that fascination and
truthfully we understand how

1013
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:33,020
much we bring it on ourselves by working
together, being on stage together.

1014
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,070
It's like we know that like we're
stepping into the store, those girls,

1015
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:40,430
we don't dress alike and we are
addicted to it. We are like,

1016
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,840
there are moments where we've like shown
up at shows and like similar without

1017
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:49,040
even checking with each other and like
why I got to go onstage in a Parka.

1018
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,360
I mean that's what I'm wearing today.

1019
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:54,980
One of us has to die go home shirtless
thing where you pick up the phone on.

1020
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,900
The other ones are,
I don't know if we can do that nowadays,

1021
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:59,330
but back when we had regular phones
and then the other one's on the,

1022
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,230
on the line right there now,
although the one time in our lives,

1023
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,250
this is pretty recent,

1024
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:08,200
which is insane that something weird
happened that we couldn't explain it and

1025
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,880
now we just want to pretend
it didn't happen. Uh, we,

1026
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,630
so we were going out of town to do it,
get totally explain it by the way.

1027
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:19,380
We're going out of town to
do a Gig, clearly explain
it. And we always take the,

1028
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,420
the last possible flight out to go to the
Gig and the first possible flight home

1029
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,160
to be with our kids and our families.

1030
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:27,890
And so we're getting up
at five in the morning,

1031
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:31,720
like day of the show to take a 7:00
AM flight, probably east coast.

1032
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:37,550
And sometimes we'll call each other
just to make sure the other one woke up,

1033
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,830
you know, and is in the car
and heading to the airport.

1034
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:44,830
So I called him to find out if he was
coming and he called me and I saw that he

1035
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:47,060
was calling, but I couldn't
answer the phone. Why?

1036
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,750
Because I had to pee so badly in
the co and this never happens.

1037
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,340
I Pete at home on the way to the airport.

1038
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,880
It's like 12 minutes after I got in the
car, something strange was happening.

1039
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,300
I thought I was dying. I was like,
I gotta pee. I go into a seven 11,

1040
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:01,700
which for some reason I guess I'm the
only person in the world and knows that

1041
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:03,800
there's no bathroom in any seven 11

1042
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:09,110
so rude guy said, we don't have it. You
said you can pay in the slushy machine.

1043
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,800
We'll make an improvement on
it. So I go around, so I'm not,

1044
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:14,060
I don't know where to go.
Nothing's open.

1045
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:16,880
I walk around the corner the
way I called it a slushie.

1046
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,750
It's a slurpee straight that I fucking,
I gave it. You've ruined the pot.

1047
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:24,590
I took a while.
How would use for Randy?

1048
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,880
I walk around the corner
and there's nowhere to go.

1049
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,910
I crouched down between
two apartment buildings,

1050
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:33,600
like a homeless man and just pee in the
street. Okay. That's, I had no choice.

1051
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,840
It was coming out of Sop and
sitting down with it. It was odd.

1052
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,320
I didn't have to pull my pants down
way down Ip as squatted. And Pete, uh,

1053
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,180
I get up, I run back to the call
our call Randy. I'm like, Hey,

1054
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:47,730
I saw you were calling. I
didn't want you to panic. Worse.

1055
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,770
Call my house and wake my family up.
I am up.

1056
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,580
I just had to piece so leave that message
on my machine because I was driving to

1057
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:55,980
the airport too.
And for some reason I had a cup of coffee,

1058
01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,600
I had to fucking pee and I went
between an apartment. Okay.

1059
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:03,870
So that's a weird I fucking Pete.
And I was like, because I was like,

1060
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:06,180
there's nowhere to go. There's nowhere
for me to go to the traffic is so bad.

1061
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:10,860
I got weird. It is weird. And that
was the moment where I was like, yeah,

1062
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:12,960
this is a little too weird
and we kind of don't want to,

1063
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:15,000
it's almost like we're denying the weird.

1064
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:19,440
Why were you at were denying that
nine 11 was an inside job? Why?

1065
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,720
Why are you saying I can call it explain
it. I could totally explain it though.

1066
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:22,080
I think it's,

1067
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,260
cause I had a cup of coffee and the
ride was like 45 fucking minutes.

1068
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,940
I didn't have a cup of coffee and it was,

1069
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:30,390
I was only like 15 minutes into my ride
or 20 minutes in my right. And I had,

1070
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,540
I also think I didn't want to like go
into a bathroom and get a key and then

1071
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:36,660
have to wait and whatnot. I was like,
well, maybe I can go and pee at this.

1072
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:41,661
It was very odd that that is probably the
most odd only thing our audience wants

1073
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,770
to know. Okay. He couldn't
get inside. She was too tight.

1074
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,210
They were friends. I thought it
was like you couldn't fit inside.

1075
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:56,930
So he called you in because you
have a narrow a penis and he like,

1076
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:02,400
we got everything just to say,
oh,

1077
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,700
we were talking to twins about their
dicks. Just to kind of show you're on.

1078
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:11,170
What do you guys, what show is
that on? This is, um, this is our,

1079
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:15,720
is that Good Morning America? Our new
series identical every wake up brothers.

1080
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,840
Um, uh, I, is there an age though?

1081
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,640
Like is it like a 15 or whatever
in puberty where you're like, Yo,

1082
01:04:26,641 --> 01:04:31,410
our decks exactly the same. Did Not
do it. You know what our parents did?

1083
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:36,390
It was so never did it because our parents
very smartly put us in separate rooms,

1084
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,610
separate rooms, changes, everything.

1085
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:40,380
This is what I would tell
anybody who has twins,

1086
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,760
give your kid a separate rooms because
it allows them to understand that.

1087
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,360
So they,

1088
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,350
they were good with just being naked
around each other in front of with like

1089
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:53,900
other women also. By the
way. Good looking guys. Okay.

1090
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,290
They seem like both like dicks but
good looking guys who good and guys who

1091
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,000
should be able to get women.

1092
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:04,980
And so now you also need this ruse where
you're both kind of double teaming.

1093
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,430
One girl like that to me. Yeah. I just,

1094
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:10,890
I don't understand it but I don't buy it.
I don't get it.

1095
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:15,180
It to me feels like literally step back.
Yeah. Little rabbit. Yeah. Step back.

1096
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,510
What you're saying is you guys have never
show each other dogs and then like is

1097
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:22,160
it identical to
really,

1098
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:29,360
ours are different than mine has glasses.
Glass Hole.

1099
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,750
Do you guys poop in front of each other?
Yeah,

1100
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,930
definitely. On that. No. I'm
imagining every parent of twins did.

1101
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:43,030
They force the era of like
the match and like, you know,

1102
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,390
everything's the same matching up. It's
our, again, our parents didn't do that.

1103
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:50,490
Either of your parents are smart.
They were amazing, super evolved and,

1104
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:54,940
and the truth of the matter is, and this
is like super deep, but our mom and you,

1105
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:59,080
this is crazy to even talk about, but
our mom a year before we were born, uh,

1106
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:01,660
delivered a baby that live
for four days and then,

1107
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,970
oh so terrible like to go through
that I came to, you know, as you know,

1108
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:09,460
you're holding a baby inside
you right now. Imagine.

1109
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:12,400
And again at a time when
they didn't have technology,

1110
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,790
she was pregnant amongst all of
her friends who had had kids.

1111
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:19,580
And then suddenly four days after
she gives birth, no kid. So like the,

1112
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:24,581
the devastation in that area a
year to the day when that loss,

1113
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,140
when she lost that girl,

1114
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,950
we were born to two healthy babies.

1115
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,850
I'm not a firm believer in,
you know,

1116
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,280
some other presence that
makes things happen.

1117
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:39,430
I really believe that it's all going
to happen on earth while we're here and

1118
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:41,800
people have to do it between each other.
And you can't just be like,

1119
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:43,990
I was an asshole. But I believe
in Jesus, so everything's cool.

1120
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,580
You know what I mean?
Like I can't do that.

1121
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,630
But if you were to believe in a higher
power, like that is the time to be like,

1122
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,270
okay, I had nothing and was in the
worst place and now I just have to.

1123
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:56,980
So I think that informed the way their
attitude was towards us and they were

1124
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:59,770
very like they cared about
us and then had an eval,

1125
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:04,510
had a lot of like internal gratitude
that it worked out. It wasn't just like,

1126
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,470
oh yeah,
those are the twins.

1127
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:08,170
We just through the same fucking
trash bag on both of them.

1128
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,310
And that's what a way,
you know what I mean?

1129
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,880
It was sort of like we cut it up
in APP and now they're both right.

1130
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,890
It was a lot of thought was put into,
hey,

1131
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:17,740
we're the only kids and we want something
like we were like an only child on,

1132
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,750
there was a lot of attention
and love and care about still.

1133
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,770
And I would argue this is parents today,
like our parents loved us.

1134
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:26,590
I would say more than our friends.
Parents love them. And that's not,

1135
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,570
that's not even bragging.
That's just the truth. Sure.

1136
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,330
There are definitely
super way more thoughtful,

1137
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:36,550
especially in that era to be like,
let's give these to their own identities.

1138
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:41,230
It's not rhyme. Their names not make them
sit in the same room, not dressing like,

1139
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:42,850
not to all that stuff.
And so,

1140
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:47,830
but they also didn't know what we were
doing 95% of the time since the seventies

1141
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,870
and eighties. Yeah. They
were like, where are they?

1142
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:52,150
Like we'd be playing football
on the corner with like
all the neighborhood kids.

1143
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:56,620
No fence, basically like a chance for like
a child molester to swing by, you know,

1144
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,230
Reddit or buffer editor.
Buffet just like grabbed the predators.

1145
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:02,380
You never planned to rape and
executed it like you said. No,

1146
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:06,070
but did you ever do something fun like a,
I don't know,

1147
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:09,280
like with an employer or um,
you know,

1148
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:11,200
a test or something like that.

1149
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,920
We did switch once in school and
there it is buddy. It was at,

1150
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,070
it was not as great as it was like one
of those things that kind of said to

1151
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,710
write on paper,
but terrible.

1152
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:25,580
And also that like we should never ever
do comedy cause we kinda got into comedy

1153
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:29,720
and we were like 14 years old so this
kind of told us never do this stuff on

1154
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:31,120
this would never do that on stage.

1155
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,920
Like we switched classes cause we're
like we're going to really full.

1156
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,160
No one really knew. Our friends
kind of knew but, but it was,

1157
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,870
you did it for a gag though. Like April
fool's day and then I was like, Oh shit,

1158
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:46,070
I now have to take a quiz in his class
and I don't know what is going on.

1159
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:49,580
This is stressful. This isn't
fun in any way, shape or form.

1160
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:53,580
It was probably like fun for like four
minutes and then there's another like 50

1161
01:08:53,581 --> 01:08:58,130
minutes that has to go below it that
same year I had a home economics teacher

1162
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:00,260
who was terrible.
This is frank.

1163
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:03,530
She was like absolutely horrible to me
about cooking and sewing and all this

1164
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:07,970
other stuff. Stuff that you should
know. Horrible human being on,

1165
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,640
on,
on Halloween.

1166
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:15,620
She had like an apes mask on it and she
came in with like an AP racist, racist,

1167
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,210
but she can't wait.
She came in with an AMC mask on,

1168
01:09:19,211 --> 01:09:21,500
on Halloween and people are dressed
up in costumes and everything.

1169
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:24,380
And so for three quarters of class she
taught the class with the apes mass.

1170
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:29,330
I hated this three quarters of the way
and it got too hot and she took off the

1171
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,960
mask. She took off the mask and
I screamed when she took it off.

1172
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,050
That's horror. Took you off. And
I was like, oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.

1173
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:42,290
That's a great bit. Good
jokes, good laugh, Harrison
to the US switching classes.

1174
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,490
That was a way better bit.

1175
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:47,930
And that to me tells like you everything
we need to know about where our minds

1176
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,090
are in how we use this thing that we do.

1177
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:54,440
Although I do think over time what we've
realized is that they're having two

1178
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,960
people on stage. Actually,
now that I think about it,

1179
01:09:56,961 --> 01:10:01,940
so much funnier than the reaction
I gave me. Imagine that as like a,

1180
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:04,350
like a 15 year old kid, Paul,
in that bit off. Yeah, no,

1181
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:09,080
it's very integrated funding. So, and I
got in trouble and I, we told our, my,

1182
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:09,721
I got in trouble,

1183
01:10:09,721 --> 01:10:13,610
like went to the principal and the whole
thing and they called our parents and I

1184
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:17,930
told my, told my dad what I did and
our dad, who was not a great, he,

1185
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:22,070
he was a great businessman. He's no longer
alive. Great Dude, great businessman,

1186
01:10:22,071 --> 01:10:26,540
but not great in school. And I said, dad,
this is the bit, and this is what I did.

1187
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,540
And he's like, that's funny.
He said to get laughs,

1188
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:32,510
I think you said didn't get laughs.
Laughs I was like dead. It's funny.

1189
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,610
Did it kill it, kill it, kill it.

1190
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,570
He couldn't be mad in that moment.
I'm like,

1191
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:41,570
I mean if you're a kid pulled off a good
job, like a good joke, you'd be like,

1192
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,680
I dunno what I can do. Like, look, we're
in front of these people. I'm gonna,

1193
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,200
I'm gonna yell at you. I might
even spanking. But that's good.

1194
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:51,650
We're going out to dinner.
You can get some ice cream for that.

1195
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,920
But I mean it was just again,
but that kind of said it,

1196
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:56,900
but I was saying about the
stand up when we're on stage,

1197
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,040
we just have to figure out,

1198
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,740
and we talked deeply about this
with you just in terms of uh, set,

1199
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:05,630
cause we always call him the
setup master 2000 set of pastor.

1200
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:07,860
He is so economical with his,

1201
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,420
I can take your setups and cut them
in half and make it more powerful.

1202
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,560
Caught them in half and make a more
directed and make them and we're like

1203
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,190
fucking set

1204
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,960
up master 2000 do it up man.
It's all set up to all my and,

1205
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:23,610
and what I love in watching your standup
is that the set ups get last as you set

1206
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:24,091
things up,

1207
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:28,010
you're like if it's set up right you
get credit for the constable double,

1208
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,830
double last and then you see it executed.
But we were always like well what's,

1209
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,240
how do we then, you know, two people
on stage is very different. Like again,

1210
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:40,080
you know, your point of view and
your special comes through so deeply.

1211
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:41,700
Your point of view on the
show comes through deeply.

1212
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:46,110
But like if the two of you are on stage
together you kind of have to like what's

1213
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:50,370
our point of is like when we do our
live podcast, which is a lot of fun.

1214
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:53,250
We haven't done one in a while,
but when we've done live ones,

1215
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:57,840
part of it is that you know the audience
there is so familiar with the show,

1216
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:02,870
which is actually like a cheat
code for setups. Oh yeah.

1217
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:07,560
In other words we bring up a topic and
they're all like I know what the topic is

1218
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:11,060
and then you can just go joke, joke,
joke, joke, joke, joke, joke. Cause it's,

1219
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,380
it's all very much set up for you,
which is done.

1220
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,760
You've established your
voice on the thing,

1221
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,960
but you know a singular
point of view on stage.

1222
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:22,910
This is the way I think about this.
So we have to kind of figure out it.

1223
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:26,220
It's like one layer removed as we do
our standup and then as we play our bits

1224
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:27,150
out,
how do we do it?

1225
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:30,300
Is it just examples and we're both
rallying them off or are we acting out a

1226
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:34,680
scene like we've just realized in our
latest our of standup as we're sort of

1227
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:35,514
turning,

1228
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:39,660
cause he did an hour that we did an hour
for a CSO that see so folded and now

1229
01:12:39,661 --> 01:12:42,900
it's going to be on stars,
which is at least I've got
a second home. That's great.

1230
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:46,750
We were discussing like what happens to
all these CSOS and there's so many great

1231
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,840
Dominique Cim.

1232
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:53,160
Anwar Diaz had one on
Stan hope has right now,

1233
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:57,270
so ours, so ours had never premiered. So
it's actually to premiere on, Oh my God,

1234
01:12:57,271 --> 01:13:00,780
it's going to be on stars. And my first
question was why not black stars? Come on,

1235
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,000
play that clip again.
It was too small

1236
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:10,870
or narrow.
Is that the same saying?

1237
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,510
But you guys might know
something about this.

1238
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,670
Last week we were talking about our,
uh,

1239
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,650
at our son's preschool where
we leave him 14 hours a day.

1240
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:24,110
We dropped him off and
uh, we, uh, he liked it.

1241
01:13:24,111 --> 01:13:29,000
He locks the locks up, locks up. But they
were telling us, oh, there's a little bit,

1242
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:31,290
it was a kind of a case as of hand,

1243
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:34,560
foot and mouth going on and we
were talking about it. I was like,

1244
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,210
I don't remember anybody
ever talking about that. When
we were kids, split mouth,

1245
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,870
fluffing mouth, no one ever
said, I remember chicken pox.

1246
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:46,460
We had chicken parks growing up. Well
somebody, I dunno if this even address it,

1247
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:51,150
somebody says, I recently contracted
hand, foot and mouth as an adult.

1248
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:55,370
I have to tell you, it sucks a fat
donkey Dick. You get how he got it.

1249
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:01,380
He gets terribly painful. Blisters on
your hands, feet in your mouth. Go figure.

1250
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,790
Walking was a fucking nightmare. Keep your
kids away from that shit. I fly a lot.

1251
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:08,400
My doctor says I probably touched
them baby, just on a plane.

1252
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:11,980
I didn't even know it. Make sure you
wash those pause every time you get

1253
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,630
off of gross ass airplane.
I didn't know that if the shower,

1254
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,040
but what was that?
Do you remember that thing?

1255
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,220
I don't remember that being
a same babies that you know.

1256
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:25,200
So pleasured wait, did your
kids ever get that one? No,

1257
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,460
but it was around in school.
I remember it. Someone I'm
like, and then you're like,

1258
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:35,410
we have lice, lice. We, I
never had kids have had it.

1259
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,950
There was always like a time when you
went to the nurse and she had like plastic

1260
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:43,240
bags on her hands
through your hair.

1261
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:46,570
Like she's looking at records at a
record store cause hoof and mouth,

1262
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:51,040
the new strokes out.
That's, that's horrible.

1263
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:55,770
And as an adult to deal with like
a kid sickness that feels, I mean,

1264
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:00,280
you get it, you get everything that
they give you. It's three weeks now.

1265
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:02,890
I'm like praising Jesus. You don't
even know how it feels. You're like,

1266
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:06,520
this is what it feels like.
Take a full breath,

1267
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,390
uh, because your kids around him because
you're about to have another kid and

1268
01:15:13,391 --> 01:15:15,070
eventually that kid will be in prison.

1269
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,590
It's whenever your kids get out of
preschool, preschools to the ground,

1270
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:22,591
zero for all this shit is a fucking
petri dish of disease and kindergarten,

1271
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,750
I think.
God Damn does it.

1272
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:28,870
I think it does the adult
hoof and mouth disease,

1273
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,050
I'm just going to call it a hook.
Adult huff and mouth disease.

1274
01:15:32,051 --> 01:15:36,070
That to me is like the fact that this
person contracted that and definitely

1275
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:37,480
probably got it from on a plane.

1276
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:41,530
Everything is tired of all
this motherfucking hoof
and mouth disease on this

1277
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:44,790
motherfucking plane.
Wasn't that Sam Jackson Jackson.

1278
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:51,140
Do you guys talk about your pooping on
this documentary and we do because what

1279
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,550
did you find? Did you find that women are
more squeamish obviously about pooping?

1280
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,780
Absolutely. Women in
the movie went off. Uh,

1281
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,760
I like they have some confidence right
there. We were like, yeah, there's no,

1282
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,080
yeah. The truth of the matter is like
it really shows how he wouldn't touch.

1283
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:10,810
You are with your body. If you are
pooping and you have a good poop,

1284
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,050
you know it's a body,

1285
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:17,040
a shit and only Abdo and you
wipe and there's nothing there.

1286
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,170
It's like walk away literally.
What's up? Mike drops

1287
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:27,760
you ace a solid shit when the all comes
together and nothing gets on the wall.

1288
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:32,260
I will do like I'm a casino pit
boss and I'm done with my shift.

1289
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,950
Yes. Not the dealer. Yes, that's right.

1290
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,630
And is also want to show you that
there's nothing up their sleeve here. No,

1291
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,730
but I mean, yeah, it's a great
feeling, right? Shit out these slaves,

1292
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:46,780
we accomplish something.
Right. So, you know,

1293
01:16:46,781 --> 01:16:49,090
we haven't done it for me.

1294
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:53,830
I had hemorrhoids that ruins the
whole pathway too. It's horrible.

1295
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,510
It's a bad thing.

1296
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,930
But when you do it and you get one in
and you do it right and it feels easy and

1297
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:03,910
it comes up having hemorrhoids is like
trying to stuff like an odder through a

1298
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:07,810
pinball machine. Terrible. Well, I get
them pregnant at the end of my pregnancy.

1299
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,010
It's horrible. I don't
have now, thankfully. But

1300
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,240
towards the end do offer it all. Should
have had my dad on, you know, he's really,

1301
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:19,040
he's quite famous for his hemorrhoids.
No, it's shit talks. I mean he's,

1302
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:23,120
he did he tell you about his shit's
like, oh, what was it like door opened.

1303
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:27,880
This is what happened. Report. It's just,
it's adequate shit today, Tom. Yeah.

1304
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,340
And it's a, it continues. I mean to
this day, I mean, I get phone calls,

1305
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:34,580
I had a great one that was great and
he's like, I tell you a story buddy.

1306
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:39,190
I was just down the hall
and just tell him no,

1307
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,560
no paper and stall.

1308
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:44,300
So you know what you gotta do is you've
got to stand up and squeeze the cheeks

1309
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:44,961
and my pain,

1310
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:49,580
my trousers were still down and I had
to waddle over the next stall and there

1311
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:52,430
was barely any paper in there.
And I had a wattle out. I'm like,

1312
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:55,250
are there people in the
bathroom like waddling down?

1313
01:17:55,251 --> 01:18:00,080
Why don't we know with pants down, hands
down. And he was like, it was a blaster.

1314
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:04,530
So there was shit all over my
cheeks and holy cow. And it's uh,

1315
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,320
I mean this is at all the toe that
is really phenomenal. Super Old.

1316
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:10,850
But this might be him,

1317
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:15,440
I think talking to me about it years ago
and I pulled out my iPhone and he just

1318
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,274
started recording.

1319
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:17,933
Yeah,

1320
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,860
he might bring it up immediately because

1321
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,070
this is how I used to just call him and

1322
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,340
calm and just see what was on, what's
going on and then go straight. He starts,

1323
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,520
starts conversations with this right away.

1324
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:32,780
Hey Buddy,
how you doing?

1325
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,340
They make any announcement or,

1326
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,660
oh, sorry. I was just, one's being
recorded. I used to get him like a buddy.

1327
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,840
Hey Buddy. I love it.
I love it. I love it.

1328
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,800
It's like he entered the
call like to wipe down.

1329
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,340
Tell me about wiping.
He needed a wipe down.

1330
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,960
I love how well that was.
That was advice where I go when I go.

1331
01:19:00,961 --> 01:19:04,200
Sometimes you just keep wiping
your wiping and your wife.

1332
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,210
I don't know what to do.
He's like,

1333
01:19:06,211 --> 01:19:10,680
you need to wipe down and then he would
say you stand up and let everything fall

1334
01:19:10,681 --> 01:19:14,670
into place and sit back down and wipe it.
Maybe constant white.

1335
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,920
You definitely don't and
I think your dad was,

1336
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:21,570
what he was alluded to is you don't
want to get poop in your vagina. Now.

1337
01:19:21,571 --> 01:19:25,350
Have you guys ever had a bad day and
we talked about this in the movie?

1338
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,990
Let me tell you the day,

1339
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,500
whoever crushed like the electric car was
crushed by a powerful lobby and it the

1340
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:33,930
lobby saying don't do the Bidet.

1341
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:37,500
Do you guys have the Japanese application
to their fucking best thing in the

1342
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:41,170
world? What happened was street
we going up into your ass.

1343
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,670
You can rob Corddry says in the movie I,

1344
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,120
I can really dictate what
the temperature of the water,

1345
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,720
whether it pulsates or not and I do
blow dry

1346
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:59,000
blow dry. Your asshole is like
that. Just have a blowout. So good.

1347
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,950
That is the equivalent of
having your hair blonde. Nasty.

1348
01:20:01,951 --> 01:20:06,450
When we take a dump and hotels and then
you're dashing the toilet paper against

1349
01:20:06,451 --> 01:20:08,010
her, but it's, it's vulgar

1350
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,840
when you're used to washing it.

1351
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,060
Friend of ours said like if
you got shit on your arm,

1352
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,480
it says in the movie you don't Shit
on your head, little shit on your arm.

1353
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:16,620
Would you grab a piece of paper,

1354
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,170
the paper there and just wipe it off and
be like, all right, I'm calling today. No,

1355
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:20,610
you fucking wash it off.

1356
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,510
You put soap and water on them
and then wash your ass. Man,

1357
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:31,050
I think Americans have a have an
aversion to it and this would doctor we,

1358
01:20:31,051 --> 01:20:35,010
when we did dr drew show, we were like,
what is the deal with this? And he's like,

1359
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,560
I think Americans have a psychological,

1360
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:42,650
they think have a day is like how to wash
or don't shower and they just use the

1361
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:46,440
day that somehow getting into
that will mean that you'll just,

1362
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:48,210
that's all you're going to do.
Here's the thing,

1363
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,500
maybe the old days that
were around when we grew up,

1364
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,870
I always thought that I was like,
that's crazy.

1365
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,390
You're just going to like you just
waddle over to that thing that just,

1366
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,280
and let it do that. Now with washlet
where you just go press the button.

1367
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:07,380
We rented a house and what happened was
they had one in one of the toilets and

1368
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:10,890
where you like this. So when we
were done, is it a little sexual?

1369
01:21:10,891 --> 01:21:14,640
It's a little sexual. That
a little bit. A little bit.

1370
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:20,010
It is in the best way to
Brown. It's, it's pretty great.

1371
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,140
It is great man. Yeah. Here's the thing.

1372
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:25,410
You feel like now that we have
them in our house when I travel,

1373
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,790
you feel like you're app?
No,

1374
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,780
Adam Carolla said it's like trying to use
a paper towel to get peanut butter out

1375
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:38,600
of the carpet. That's what am I
doing? What am I traveled with the um,

1376
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,640
the wipes. The White? Yeah, the white
flushable wipes. Flushable wipes. Yeah.

1377
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,610
I've done it a few times on the road just,

1378
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,290
just to have a little bit of
a sense of that, change it up.

1379
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,750
But there is nothing like that.
Have a day. I mean it, it,

1380
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,680
our thing is like if nice hotels
would start to just have that Japanese

1381
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:57,450
application, you don't have
to use if you don't want to,

1382
01:21:57,451 --> 01:22:01,140
but I think people start to get curious
about it. They'll start to do it three,

1383
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:04,830
four day stay and then there'll be like,
why don't I have this day?

1384
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:08,310
Curious and am I think we're all on a
spectrum here, but I have a day curious.

1385
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,290
You guys want to take your
shit before you leave. I might,

1386
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:12,120
I might not take a shower.
I took one already,

1387
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:15,740
but maybe I'll take a little walk gray
one this morning. I took a, I mean,

1388
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,760
not gray. Can I, can I just get your ass?

1389
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:23,400
I just do that just on a fresh enough.

1390
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:27,030
I'll just freshen up a little reason
for a set. You're like, I just need to,

1391
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:31,400
I want to up their
preset. I said when I got,

1392
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,810
when I flew home yesterday
and when I got here,

1393
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:37,470
it's like 10 minutes later I was like,
I'm just going to take like quick rinse.

1394
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,050
It's so great.
Yeah.

1395
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:43,430
And does Tom let you perform
analog him all day every day?

1396
01:22:43,431 --> 01:22:48,250
Can you imagine begs for it?
You have to obviously clean out that.

1397
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:55,500
Oh No, I don't love that.
That to me isn't a, it's not,

1398
01:22:55,530 --> 01:23:00,090
if it were something I loved, I'd be
like, what can we do? How can we get,

1399
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:03,540
it's happening. But it's not
something that I crave. So I mean,

1400
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,730
for people who had somebody crave you
that you definitely have to find someone

1401
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:11,290
who's cool, hands and
knees every day, begging.

1402
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,460
She, Christina, um,

1403
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:20,010
mobs meet thinks that I'm ridiculous for
how much I enjoy my bodily functions.

1404
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,960
I was, yep. I, by the way,

1405
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:27,130
I am a little bit on his side
because like if you do good, good.

1406
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,150
Tell me by the way, a good
sneeze, like not in cold season,

1407
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:35,840
so you're not in the throes of a cold.
It's just clearing the decks. Fields.

1408
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,700
One bag goes,
I'm the one who goes down to this end.

1409
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,780
I'm the one who goes downstairs and does
everything in the morning for my family

1410
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:47,620
and part of the, I get two, I get two,
three positive things out of it. Okay.

1411
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:51,300
So I let my wife sleep. Wake up in the
morning. We both, I meditate. Okay.

1412
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,280
Half to like do like 22
minutes at six in the morning,

1413
01:23:54,281 --> 01:23:55,960
I go back to sleep for 20 minutes.

1414
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:00,130
Best deepest sleep Evers right after I
get up and meditate. The next 23 minutes,

1415
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:03,820
six 45 wake up, take breakfast orders,
go downstairs and turn off the alarm,

1416
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:07,870
let get the dog food ready, all that stuff
I put on the record of my choice. Okay.

1417
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:09,790
We have a record player that plays in the,

1418
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,630
in the kitchen where
everybody is and I'm like,

1419
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,210
well I'm going to put
on what I fucking want.

1420
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:14,410
This is what daddy wants to listen to.

1421
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:18,370
If I want to listen to a founder
listened to Pinkerton Weezer album. Yeah,

1422
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:20,800
there's a song about lesbians on it,
you know all of it.

1423
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:23,920
We're getting into all of it. I'm going
to tribe called quest. If I want this,

1424
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,410
I'm going to put it on. It's my record.
So that's what I get to get that.

1425
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,740
The other thing I get to do is when I'm
downstairs alone in everyone's upstairs

1426
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:34,680
and the music is playing, I fucking
fart. So I literally let it rip. It is,

1427
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,740
it is literally what the Book Trumpet
of the Swan Song was written about.

1428
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:43,930
I am like ripping so hard all over the
house and it's like getting out every

1429
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:47,430
little bubble that was in my stomach and
I'm not around anybody and just cause

1430
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,330
it's blasting it. It feels so good. And
then I have coffee and then that's when,

1431
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,110
that's what cleans me out to
take the browns to the Superbowl.

1432
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,880
Coffee is like,

1433
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:02,050
it's the second gift it gives you is it
literally cleaned your asset does every

1434
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:02,920
day.
We sat us on stage.

1435
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:06,910
Every day is like the last 15 minutes of
like an episode of hoarders. We're like,

1436
01:25:06,911 --> 01:25:07,690
get it all out,

1437
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:12,690
get the rabbit [inaudible] Matt Pacsun
is kind of like drinking coffee.

1438
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:18,730
I like drinking coffee so much
that sometimes it'll be mid,

1439
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,150
you know, later in late afternoon and
it won't pick you up. No, I'm like,

1440
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,700
I'm going to keep going. I'm having
a bad patch shits today. Yeah.

1441
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:29,620
And she'd be like, how much coffee you
had? I'd be like, Nah, like six cups.

1442
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,640
Yeah Dude. That's why I'm like,
yeah, I didn't think about it.

1443
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:40,260
We weren't showering at our old house
and he peed and it smelled like,

1444
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:43,360
and it's an entire craft coffee.

1445
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:47,950
Even Drink Water Cause You
pee brown liquid coffee.

1446
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:52,840
You all you have is coffee inside your
bag? I'm sorry. Was that a Sumatran blend?

1447
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,890
Well, I didn't look, I've
got a golden shower or brown
show, but she was like, Oh,

1448
01:25:56,891 --> 01:25:58,880
you enjoy your body
functions. See it. Look,

1449
01:25:58,881 --> 01:26:02,080
somebody wrote sneezing
and coming as I was time,

1450
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,000
I was fucking this girl doggy style.
And

1451
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,150
that was about to pull out and not Jesus.
He's really start to sneeze.

1452
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:09,830
It felt like time had stopped.

1453
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,240
I closed my eyes and everything went quiet
for a second while I sneezed and came

1454
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:14,840
on her ass.

1455
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,510
At the moment I remembered that he
feels high after he sneezes. Well,

1456
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:22,520
imagine the feeling you get
from doing both the same time.

1457
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:27,560
What would you call this amaze
experience? Um, I what I call that? Yeah.

1458
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,550
I don't know. Call that the, uh,

1459
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:33,620
like the moment in the matrix when you
can bend backwards and the bullet goes up

1460
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,820
in your face. Here's the thing
though. Reading his, his message.

1461
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:42,200
I don't want to experience that one.
Yeah. I like sneezing. I like orgasm.

1462
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:46,450
I, you kind of think he's an asshole.
Right? And the phrase is, I don't think,

1463
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:50,690
I don't think it's possible. I have
a phrase for it. Yeah. Ejaculation.

1464
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,540
Hey, totally. Think you're right.

1465
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,660
Ejaculation is a little
bit sneezing all over.

1466
01:26:56,661 --> 01:27:00,160
One was black and I bet he made her
clean it up. Yeah. Yeah. Really?

1467
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:04,150
Can you go get the towel and real
assholes? You go get the towel, man.

1468
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:08,270
I'm going to lay down here. Do you guys
ever burped and farted at the same time?

1469
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,850
No, I don't think I've ever burped
it. Uh, I probably have. That's it.

1470
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:15,170
Anything coming out to you?
I'm like,

1471
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,110
if there's something inside of you
that's got to get out of you, get it out.

1472
01:27:18,111 --> 01:27:21,230
That's what I tell my daughters. It was
just a fart all the time and I'm like,

1473
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,790
just say, excuse me. Just say,
excuse me, and that's cool.
I'm like, what about this?

1474
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:30,360
Do you think you can get this
out of you? Oh God. Oh, what dad?

1475
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,290
I don't want to say those.
Oh God.

1476
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:37,760
I don't want to say those and get
bowls are long. This is all fucked up.

1477
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:40,280
My Dad, is it really? Those lists,

1478
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:43,800
those nibbles or those nibbles are longer
than a Francis Ford Coppola film. Yeah.

1479
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,750
This was a was artistic must see.

1480
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,780
Yeah. That's how my dad talks, by the way.

1481
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:58,190
All to breast feed you these big MIPS.

1482
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:03,310
Yep. Watch suck me dry. Yeah,

1483
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,420
of course. He's German of course.
Or Nazi chairman. I liked,

1484
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:13,730
I liked, I got to put some
into a rock. The problem is,

1485
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:18,440
and this is what I feel bad for this
guy, he can never wear a tee shirt. Oh,

1486
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,100
think about this guy at a teacher
get works in this context.

1487
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:25,910
If he's naked standing over you
asking you to suck his nipples, fine,

1488
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,710
but then it's appropriate.
We're all buying it.

1489
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:30,590
I'm not saying that that's something
that you guys got to wear a sweatshirt

1490
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:35,590
every day. I at like in and out
Burger. It's like how much laser?

1491
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,940
How much do you have to
torture your nipples to get
those going to ask you that.

1492
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,610
Do you think this is nature
and nurture? I think, yeah.

1493
01:28:43,611 --> 01:28:46,680
I don't think he knows that. I
think this is my theory. Okay.

1494
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,160
I think they were a little
longer than a regular nipple,

1495
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:52,580
but like slightly and he definitely
tied weights to it. He's like,

1496
01:28:52,581 --> 01:28:55,580
this is now how people know
me, so I got it. I'm that guy.

1497
01:28:55,581 --> 01:29:00,020
He's literally drooping it and he's
drawing and my son doesn't want to wear

1498
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:02,000
pants to school. I'm like, why don't
you ever want to repaint it? He's

1499
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,410
like, can people know me as the guy who
wear shorts to school? And I'm like,

1500
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:08,250
that's how people know. If you had
nipples like that, I'd be like,

1501
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:10,610
that's how people know you.
I that is not, I can do it.

1502
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:14,610
That sort of like we were talking about
like if you were really into anal,

1503
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,550
you got to find someone that you know,
I don't feel back.

1504
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:21,030
I honestly feel bad for this guy because
that like what if this guy is just like

1505
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:24,900
really into prog rock or are just like,
hey man,

1506
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,240
I'm in a skirt.
I'm on a scrabble too.

1507
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,720
Like you're never going to
know that about this guy. Okay,

1508
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:34,370
this is literally all about lead with
this and he's going to be like Burton

1509
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,360
Chrysler just shirtless
everywhere and they're like, man,

1510
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:40,140
we always see your net gross.
Come on machine.

1511
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:44,520
Come on.
That's such a distinct sound.

1512
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,470
Gross. I liked it. He leads though with

1513
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:56,990
that phrase has been said
by more than one Nazi.

1514
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:02,910
That's like a line from Schindler's
list and Hogan's heroes.

1515
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:08,260
I've been cooking in Tampa.

1516
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:12,310
He's giving you those nibs,

1517
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,430
which are like a little
more milk in your coffee

1518
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:25,350
cup. I want to breastfeed.

1519
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:30,330
My favorite thing is when I sneezed and
MC squared right to that or is he just

1520
01:30:30,331 --> 01:30:34,230
like taking on like he knows there's
a section of society that's into that

1521
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:37,180
oversight. He's and he's in. Yeah. Yeah.

1522
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,660
So this might be like the
head of the organization.

1523
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:43,810
We listening to our,
our friends who we just had on a,

1524
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,660
I love doing the live podcast too.

1525
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:49,040
So we did a live dumb people town in
Brooklyn at the Bell House so far. Oh,

1526
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:53,760
snap smiles. You love the in
the balustrade saw our friends,

1527
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:57,930
uh, Christina Hutchinson and Corinne
Fisher from guys we fucked. Great podcast.

1528
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:01,620
Very popular but very popular.
And there's this fascinating stuff.

1529
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:03,990
I was learning like Great Shit
when I'm listening to podcasts.

1530
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:06,350
So there is a woman who,

1531
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:11,380
her sexual proclivity or her thing
that she does other people's things.

1532
01:31:11,811 --> 01:31:16,280
It's other people's thing is
that she is Claudia coming today?

1533
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:21,770
Oh No, am I retarded? Hey,
you can't say that. Hey, hey,

1534
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:23,950
come on.
You're doing the next thing.

1535
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:27,240
You know you're going to make
fun of a Louisiana folks. Uh,

1536
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:31,930
I say that so, uh, it'd
be so retarded. Okay, so,

1537
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,090
hey, come on. So she was,

1538
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:38,350
she was telling me about a person
and who people will call guys.

1539
01:31:38,351 --> 01:31:40,270
We'll call her up on the phone,

1540
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:46,020
call her up on the phone and she will
say hello and then ignore them and they

1541
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:51,100
will pay thousands of dollars for
like an hour. It's a cup of tea.

1542
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:55,600
She's like all put the phone on speaker
or I'll put it down and I'll go around

1543
01:31:55,601 --> 01:31:58,450
and just do all my housework for the day.
It's for an hour.

1544
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:00,280
The wants to be ignored.

1545
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,730
Like that's how he sexually gets off and
these are like executives and whatnot.

1546
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,680
I was like, that's great. Actually.

1547
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,240
The two that you could do that with
a new baby, a new baby. I would do,

1548
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:14,930
I would fart.
We're talking about lists.

1549
01:32:14,931 --> 01:32:18,010
That's easy Gig to Fart on
people or fart on cakes.

1550
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:20,350
Cake Harding is a big
party is a big thing.

1551
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:24,700
I'm just saying like to ignore
someone to like that ignore.

1552
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:29,780
Is that just unbelievable? How do we
get found money? That's fun exercise.

1553
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:34,810
You can make these videos for
sure. Yeah. This is what I can do.

1554
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:42,310
I can have a subscription based following
that is already interesting and of

1555
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:44,170
Benny Hinn is like a Benny Hill episode.

1556
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,670
I mean it strikes me as funny that
her walls would be finished. She's

1557
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:54,320
partying but just have an unfinished
wall there. Well that shed far.

1558
01:32:54,321 --> 01:32:57,820
It's dot com it's all about you got
to drive all that shit. You know what?

1559
01:32:57,821 --> 01:33:01,090
I really liked my girls in Pajama
bottoms farting with a drywall.

1560
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,980
I can't do it. I'm curious now at
the ignore thing. It's fascinating.

1561
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:09,490
I believe both does the guy the whole
time and he's like, hello, hello.

1562
01:33:09,491 --> 01:33:12,350
I wanted to and just talking and
it's like saying, so anyways,

1563
01:33:12,351 --> 01:33:14,530
so I did this today and I did that.
Isn't that cool?

1564
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:19,060
Not Saying was fine and then I went and
did this and then you have to tease with

1565
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:24,480
a little bit and he says hello and
that's it says hello and then ignore.

1566
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:28,030
Yeah. So it's so and so, so
and so, uh, how were you doing?

1567
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,653
Uh,

1568
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:36,380
isn't that guys are so painful but also
like a woman would never pay for that.

1569
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:42,340
The other women would never have to deal
with that on a regular basis in front

1570
01:33:42,341 --> 01:33:43,390
of strangers.

1571
01:33:43,391 --> 01:33:47,220
And if I can do in any of this weird
shed Harvey Weinstein and people and so

1572
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:51,230
create you guys. So great. Do
you know what you're having?
You know you give a boy,

1573
01:33:51,231 --> 01:33:53,650
so you have two boys.
So He's,

1574
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:57,880
he's one wanting one and I have two girls
so like I'm trying to like figure it,

1575
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,370
which is crazy because it was just us.

1576
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:03,680
So we grew up in a male
dominated the house.

1577
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:09,410
I'm the only child, only child.
So so girl dominated house. Yeah.

1578
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:14,940
A lot of time alone to raise your girl
to be proofed against douchebags razor

1579
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:19,540
mean just a little bit.
Just a little bit of content.

1580
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:23,500
My younger daughter cause because Douche
bags back away from that Douche bags,

1581
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,670
it's repellent

1582
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:31,630
my classes end doors and the
supermarket block out people.

1583
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:36,110
Yeah, it gets him out. My older daughter,
he's laughing because he's like,

1584
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,350
well that's true and
like I got a good guy,

1585
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:43,410
got a nice guy who who's like I can soften
her but definitely daily Beta like I

1586
01:34:45,491 --> 01:34:48,580
got this. That's what I take
the edge round them up first.

1587
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:54,700
When she was, I was like, she gave you
shit and she was like, she wasn't like,

1588
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,770
because I would hate going
on dates where it was a,

1589
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:01,250
she was just like the two
pleasant or like you just know,

1590
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:04,360
opinion point of view on
anything and it's a fucked up.

1591
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,450
You guys communicate so much.

1592
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:09,530
Are you afraid now that he's like losing
weight and getting good at getting good

1593
01:35:09,531 --> 01:35:12,500
looking and now super famous
and like what's going to happen?

1594
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,550
He's going to get on the road and like
there are definitely women who come up to

1595
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:18,710
him after the shows and
they're like, let's, let's go.

1596
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:21,330
Let's take this to the bones,
my titties. Let's go rangers.

1597
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:28,380
What do you say to me? I
don't remember. Oh yes.

1598
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,620
Think of your family.
I'll take half your shit.

1599
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:34,310
Your shit is a little too threatening.
It's pretty fun. That's her,

1600
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,730
but that is what she'll do. Also know
he has a conscience. You'd be like,

1601
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:38,840
we love you.
Yeah.

1602
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:43,730
That's what that quickly fire off a
picture of you and your son all the time.

1603
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:47,510
She was like, we're at home right
now. Loving you fun with your hookers.

1604
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:51,840
Thinking about thinking about
you were thinking about you.

1605
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:56,720
You just had a conversation about how
much I send videos of Ellis being like,

1606
01:35:56,721 --> 01:36:00,830
we miss you Daddy.
Father was in his life.

1607
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,560
I really don't think it's comedy
sluts, right? Audience members.

1608
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,193
Can I say this?

1609
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,190
If we want to have sex with
like bearded dudes like, oh,

1610
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:19,200
we'd be on fire but serious
woke white dude from Portland.

1611
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:25,220
Seriously woke white dude from
[inaudible] who owns a tattoo parlor,

1612
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:27,920
but he's like opening up a line of teas.

1613
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:34,570
I get hit on by a woman doing stand up
once every six years by a woman doing

1614
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:36,121
standing.
I don't know,

1615
01:36:36,121 --> 01:36:40,090
like from my address show once
every six years and it's Christina,

1616
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:45,500
zero happens is all guys, there
are moments. It's all dude.

1617
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,410
It's not only is it all guys eat,

1618
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:52,510
a lot of times there'll be a guy with an
attractive woman who will stay away and

1619
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:57,050
go, it's his birthday. So I agreed to
bring, bring them and I'll be like,

1620
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,720
you don't want to meet or anything.
And she's like, absolutely not.

1621
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:04,040
Like they walked away. It's tends to
be more male. Yeah. That's what it is.

1622
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:10,470
Now. There are comics who are
in our position who but there,

1623
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:11,503
here's the thing,

1624
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:16,100
they're putting that energy out there
and the set is actually about how you out

1625
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,710
late. So it's like I love
this and all, you know, like,

1626
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,550
and they'd get a pro and
they'll get a certain button,

1627
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,750
I'll slap a bitch around and
then suddenly people are like,

1628
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:25,070
you can slap me after the show.

1629
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:30,650
And I've seen my friends who are trying
to get laid and you then you start,

1630
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:34,910
it's even direct and indirectly in
the set it's like almost like under,

1631
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,950
you know what I mean? It's, there's
a layer of it. You guys are talking.

1632
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:41,150
If you're saying I'm a C, okay.
If you're onstage and you're like,

1633
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:44,720
I'm a single guy, I'm singled out.
So now you've just put it out there.

1634
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:46,190
Then later in the set,

1635
01:37:46,191 --> 01:37:49,070
if you tell a story about how you
did something nice like you're like,

1636
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:52,830
I'm a nice guy. I'm not one of
those guys who does this, I did it.

1637
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:56,100
Those two dots exist in your set

1638
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,580
and you drew a line between them and
you just need someone to like, yeah,

1639
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:03,120
and then also if that guy farted,
it makes it where he's not trying to,

1640
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:06,780
he's not trying to get laid. In other
words, he doesn't make it too blatant.

1641
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:10,000
That's right. My mission, I
wish I could meet or like, ah,

1642
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:13,530
I wish someone would just like,
if they're like kind of carefree about it.

1643
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:18,860
Then it starts to to you guys were talking
about on your show about just calling

1644
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:21,480
regular people slots,

1645
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:25,710
like an old five year old,

1646
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,110
just like literally in a walker.

1647
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:32,190
Let us let us what that concept to me,

1648
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:37,640
I heard it and I laughed about it and
then I saw somebody look at little baby.

1649
01:38:38,131 --> 01:38:41,730
I'm like, really? That's what
it's fine. Right? It May,

1650
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:46,710
it's so inappropriate, but it made me
laugh. So hard, joyful experiences.

1651
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:51,330
The fact that you guys could
do it together, the judge
other, I mean it's a bit,

1652
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,030
but that's all the bits I are not slots,

1653
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:58,660
anti slut shaming person who
thinks that joke is hysterical.

1654
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:06,530
That's our, oh wait, by the way,
speaking of ball hogs. Okay,

1655
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,830
so she just slept for sure.

1656
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,320
You guys tweeted a little bit from
the about the Oscars last night,

1657
01:39:10,321 --> 01:39:15,070
and I will say this, but like post
Oscar stuff. Here's, here's the,

1658
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:18,030
the headline. Jimmy Kimmel did a
great job. He handled it in a very,

1659
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:21,060
he had a lot of sensitive shit that he
was handling and he was actually really

1660
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:25,530
funny, really funny about it. Kumail was
hilarious. What did he do? He presented,

1661
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,610
he presented and then he was in this video
of like sort of like the next wave of

1662
01:39:29,611 --> 01:39:33,930
filmmakers and people and
he's even mentioned something
that his wife who wrote

1663
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:37,400
the movie with him, Emily Gordon said
that that she wants to start a wedding.

1664
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:42,120
It was so funny and I want to start a
website of Muslims doing fun things like a

1665
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:46,280
muscle. It's eating ice cream or riding
roller coasters. I laughed hysterically.

1666
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,160
She's like,

1667
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,650
I see it all the time with you and I
want it the rest of the world to see it.

1668
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:53,100
It came from such a beautiful and real
place and it was hilarious and he was

1669
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:55,620
just really funny and he was really
funny and his whole thing. He's like,

1670
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:58,320
I changed my name to Kumail
Nanjiani in Pakistan.

1671
01:39:58,321 --> 01:40:01,860
My name was Chris Pine and this guy's
an actor and I had to change your

1672
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:03,090
imaginary embarrassment.

1673
01:40:03,091 --> 01:40:06,750
He was really funny and Tiffany
Haddish and Maya Rudolph, I'm like,

1674
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:11,730
they did a bit. That was so like a bit
that we would like you guys would do that.

1675
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:16,650
They're just interaction with each other
was so specific and funny and it was

1676
01:40:16,651 --> 01:40:19,590
literally just between the two of them
and everyone was dying and I was like,

1677
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,030
that was,
that was fucking great.

1678
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:25,410
The crazy thing is obviously we're
in the me too moment of all moments.

1679
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,920
Koby Bryant goes up there and gets an
Oscar for this short film for like of,

1680
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:36,120
what is it? Love of basketball
or something. Basketballs
made me do whatever.

1681
01:40:36,121 --> 01:40:39,610
He wrote a movie and let her
to basketball. Yeah. Lovely.

1682
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:42,810
Or basketball like w and got
applause and people were like,

1683
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:43,680
doesn't he look so great?

1684
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:47,730
Like we're all forgetting that he raped a
woman in Eagle, Colorado, like 15 years,

1685
01:40:47,731 --> 01:40:51,600
I guess 15 years is the statue of
limitation there. That's it. That's it.

1686
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:54,700
You fucking raped a in eagle,
Colorado

1687
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:58,660
and he was convicted or what happened? He
wasn't convicted, but like they settled,

1688
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:02,180
they settled and they bought his
wife a $4 million ring to apologize,

1689
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:03,700
which is totally legit.

1690
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:07,730
I remember that bit for the million dollar
ring makes up for it. Right? I mean,

1691
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:10,600
but here's the thing though that's
interesting about that because one of the

1692
01:41:10,601 --> 01:41:14,700
things that nobody likes to talk about
during this movement is the, um, uh,

1693
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,080
the slots left this severity,

1694
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,980
severity and separation of
degrees of crimes people don't do.

1695
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:25,060
So in other words,
there'll be like, you know,

1696
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:26,650
Harvey Weinstein and
then there'll be like,

1697
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:29,290
and then the guy that like leered
at somebody and you're like,

1698
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:32,050
that's not the same thing. No, but
Kevin Spacey is terrible. Right?

1699
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:33,580
But further to that point,

1700
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:38,280
he actually falls in the
category of the bar side. So,

1701
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:39,880
so we're going to just let that slide.

1702
01:41:39,881 --> 01:41:41,760
I know it's going to say
anybody want championships?

1703
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:46,940
We didn't dilate dude's lives and Niley
their lives like the Kevin Spacey's

1704
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:51,520
Louise for Jackie deserves it, does
it. But the guys who do deserve it,

1705
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:54,090
let's ruin fucking Kobe
beef sliders colon.

1706
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:56,950
But the truth is the truth of the matter,
because no one does.

1707
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:59,990
The truth of the matter is, you know,
when you're doing something wrong. Yeah.

1708
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:04,180
And I would say in this day and age,
like by the way you,

1709
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:07,780
when you walk through an airport and this
way I feel about like guns and any of

1710
01:42:07,781 --> 01:42:10,960
that shit, yet your life is going to
change. You walk through an airport,

1711
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:14,350
you either get to get Tsa precheck or
you take your fucking shoes off when you

1712
01:42:14,351 --> 01:42:15,184
walk through.
Why?

1713
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:19,180
Because one person got a one plane and
had a shoe bomb and our life has changed.

1714
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,060
You can no longer go to
the gate and get your kit,

1715
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:24,300
get and meet someone at the gate
and come back. That's right.

1716
01:42:24,301 --> 01:42:27,250
That's the way life has changed and you
know what? We all fucking accept it,

1717
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,460
right? Yeah. You know, if you're
in this scenario now we're like,

1718
01:42:30,461 --> 01:42:34,150
you can't use your power to make someone
else feel like if you're in a powerful

1719
01:42:34,151 --> 01:42:36,730
position and make a pass at someone and
they make them feel uncomfortable and

1720
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:38,470
then make their life a living
here in a power position,

1721
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:41,110
you make a pass someone they say yes and
then you get married in the match your

1722
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:45,430
life. Good on you, right? There's your
life. That's fine. But if you say,

1723
01:42:45,431 --> 01:42:49,510
I want to hang out with you, and the
person who's lower power position says no,

1724
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:54,130
then he got to stop you guys. Dot.
Oh, that's common sense. That's not,

1725
01:42:54,131 --> 01:42:54,964
you don't stop.

1726
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,760
And if you don't stop and you press the
issue or you treat them poorly or you

1727
01:42:57,761 --> 01:42:59,060
make their life a living,
hell no,

1728
01:42:59,061 --> 01:43:01,870
you didn't rape anybody but
you made their life terrible.

1729
01:43:01,871 --> 01:43:05,410
Like you have to step away and you have
to know that you're going to get shit.

1730
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,290
And in this movement right now,
you get shit fair or not.

1731
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,990
And this movement right now and
the way things are right now,

1732
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:14,770
you can't get away with that shit. Yeah.
So like you have to understand the,

1733
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,480
and I'm not saying like
you think I want to go,

1734
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:19,000
I want to go to the airport and just walk
right through the thing and that's it.

1735
01:43:19,001 --> 01:43:22,030
And, but no, we have to all accept that
it's going to take an extra 30 minutes.

1736
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:25,660
And for people who travel like us
all the time, it fucking sucks, man.

1737
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,170
But that's what it is. And
you have to accept it. And
that's the way it goes. Yeah.

1738
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,880
That's the way they feel about the same
way I feel about guns. I'm like, look,

1739
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:33,700
I can't like ban it.
We can't have them in.

1740
01:43:33,701 --> 01:43:36,160
Everybody's got to be cool with that and
this is the issue and that's what it is.

1741
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:40,730
Well, and I'll say this as we
move on in Coby Brian's defense,

1742
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:45,380
they settled and he's really
good at basketball. That's true.

1743
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:50,390
It's kind of insane plan. Woody Allen
too. He's good at basketball. Too Long.

1744
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:55,310
She's not as at basketball, but he's took
a long time for people to even like a,

1745
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:58,610
it's amazing how long it takes
for someone to be like, yeah, no,

1746
01:43:58,611 --> 01:43:59,870
I think he is kind of shitty down.

1747
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:04,990
There's no new news because he puts it
in the movie. Go Watch Manhattan again.

1748
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:08,600
It's all him like hitting on a 17
year old Mariel Hemingway girl.

1749
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,040
She said it happened while they were
filming the movie and you're like

1750
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:21,730
that really? Okay, you can legal, but
by the way, given I already awkward,

1751
01:44:21,731 --> 01:44:24,850
but this is what I would say.
You can do this. Go for it.

1752
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,220
This is really what you want to do
when you're in love with this person,

1753
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:29,350
you want to do it, do it. But now,

1754
01:44:29,351 --> 01:44:33,340
except the backlash is there will be
a fucking backlash. But there wasn't,

1755
01:44:33,341 --> 01:44:36,330
he made like 12 films after he
did that just moved to France

1756
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,170
and the other thing. Yeah, with Polanski,

1757
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:43,840
the one that made me so upset with me at
a 10 year old girl over and had her get

1758
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:48,400
completely naked. I have a 10 year old
girl, he fucked, she was 13 but he fought,

1759
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:52,640
he had 10 year olds and took pictures of
them naked. Well fuck the 13 year old,

1760
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:56,820
which in like there's daughter
is 12 right now. There's no,

1761
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:00,710
you would never be like,
you know, it was awhile ago.

1762
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:04,270
Uh, there is no, we had
as a while ago but for,

1763
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:08,840
but everybody in Hollywood that
worked with that guy was like,

1764
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:13,460
they would yell at you for bringing
up yeah. That and it's like,

1765
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,730
it was indefinite time and it's like,
now they're like, those are the,

1766
01:45:16,731 --> 01:45:21,300
those are the him two
years. Yeah, that's right.

1767
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,300
That's what we're starting with our,
with our movie work.

1768
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:28,060
Starting with the Hashtag. Me Too. Me Too.

1769
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:33,650
All right.
We have to get going here in a moment,

1770
01:45:33,651 --> 01:45:35,930
but let's give the,
the,

1771
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:40,370
the full rundown of like the podcasts and
the movie and everything up. All right.

1772
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:43,640
So, uh, we have a podcast of
which you are going to do.

1773
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:47,720
It's kind of dumb people town. Yana
yeah, you got to do it. So w town,

1774
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,610
you did it and it was really funny.

1775
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:53,300
I highlight the fact that you just out
of nowhere started doing that southern

1776
01:45:53,301 --> 01:45:57,240
lawyer did Yana on Ronald to Justin
that yeah, cause we had like a legal,

1777
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,090
I don't teach us.

1778
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:01,380
Yes,
injustice.

1779
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:06,430
Unjustice justices have a curve
on that wall right there. Yeah.

1780
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,010
Oh, justice brown lock. He said.

1781
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:16,630
So let's go back and listen to his
episode people town. And then we,

1782
01:46:16,631 --> 01:46:19,750
if you're a sports fan, then we do
view from the cheap seats every week.

1783
01:46:19,751 --> 01:46:22,480
Talk about sports in a way that is,
I would say,

1784
01:46:22,481 --> 01:46:23,950
funnier and fresher than what's out there.

1785
01:46:23,951 --> 01:46:28,420
So we do that and talk to great people
on there. Uh, the movie poop talk,

1786
01:46:28,421 --> 01:46:31,560
it's on Amazon, iTunes, VOD.

1787
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:36,570
It was in theaters for a week and now
it's all iTunes and Amazon video date.

1788
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,540
So that's exciting.

1789
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:41,500
I'm excited and I'm heartbroken
that we didn't have you in it.

1790
01:46:41,501 --> 01:46:45,520
And I do think that was a function of
how quickly we had to like just try and

1791
01:46:45,521 --> 01:46:50,250
pull it off. It was wrong.
It was bad. We'll take the
heat for it and we put you in

1792
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,790
the twin document. That's what we're
gunning for it. And then we have this uh,

1793
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:55,270
audio book,
commodity audio books,

1794
01:46:55,271 --> 01:46:58,560
Sklarz and stripes with the album
coming out April 5th on audible.

1795
01:46:58,561 --> 01:47:03,360
And then our special finally we'll see
the fucking light of day on stars in,

1796
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:05,640
I believe, May. That's a big deal man.

1797
01:47:05,641 --> 01:47:09,740
Cause for a special to like the habit
and not be seeing, it's so frustrating.

1798
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,060
A three year, two e, two
and a half years down,

1799
01:47:12,061 --> 01:47:15,360
the majority of shoot this one Chicago
tag with Lincoln Hall, which was awesome.

1800
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:18,210
Great. Chicago. Such a
great, great town. Great.

1801
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:21,060
Because Chicago has smart people,

1802
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:25,680
but they're also like regularly irregular
people and they don't care. Right.

1803
01:47:25,681 --> 01:47:29,920
They don't have the hangups quite.
Yeah. Yeah. Kind of Nice that,

1804
01:47:29,921 --> 01:47:31,200
that's a great space.

1805
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:35,050
So that's probably in May and that's
called a hipster ghosts hipster guy.
