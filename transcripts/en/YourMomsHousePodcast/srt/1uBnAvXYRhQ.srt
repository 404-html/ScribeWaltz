Christina.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,120
Judge a judge was a judge.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,590
One of the things I think we
haven't even mentioned gene,

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,740
these episodes are happening,
um,

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,440
at a pace that is different than
normal because of this movie schedule.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,220
So like right now when you're hearing
this episode, I'm shooting my dps,

11
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:50,810
my boy girls, my boy, girl, boy girl
scene. This is like call my scenes.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,640
We record, we recorded this probably
three weeks or so before you heard it.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,710
I know.
We usually do it in real time.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,160
Like we do it right before two days
before it comes out a day. Just say fresh.

15
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,960
Cause we're kind of a current event show.

16
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:07,880
We like to be up on what's
happening in the world. That's
right gene. And um, yeah.

17
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:11,360
So it is one of the things it's
sort of a pain about right now,

18
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,710
but all we're doing it, we're doing
it, we're trying, we're trying,

19
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:19,130
we're trying to make it work.
We want to keep doing our show.

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,690
Can we please talk about, so we get
obsessed with, let's play the show,

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,670
fighting it, and we're doing that.
Let's to the show open as we go,

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,730
as we always do, and then we'll,
we'll get right into it. Here we go.

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,400
New episode of Your Mom's house.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,960
Go ahead. Fuck your mom.
Okay Glen. Fuck your mom.

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,050
Fuck your mom. Your mom to
shut the fuck up. Okay. Yeah.

26
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,970
She gave birth to the wrong baby.
Okay, Mama, she gave birth to you.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,760
You was a mistake.
Okay.

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,843
No,

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,680
we'll go to your mom's house.

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,130
No. Are you saying fart mix? You
want to book with my money? Oh,

31
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:07,600
that does kind of say yeah. Yeah. She's,
she got real upset. She's very feisty.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,450
You know what? Uh, what's that? Is that
like a game thing? Yeah, she was on a,

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,810
was it twitch and I'm streaming
thing and people can come and check.

34
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,680
What really jumped it off was this,
was this

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,500
shut up CX. Okay. You don't want to
say that I look and salary Todd. Okay.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,410
We taught is, is you okay from
seeing other people are retarded.

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,540
Okay.

38
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,370
Well,
you see other people are retarded.

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,930
It means that your mom actually give
birth to the wrong baby because you don't

40
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,640
ever have to rise to judge people when
your Dick is not even as this thing.

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,840
You can't even,

42
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,820
you can't even like have a proper Dick
and you say that I look like a retard.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,870
I don't know. I don't think she looks
that way at all. I don't know what's,

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,060
and I don't know if it doesn't look that,

45
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:56,180
I don't even know what the insult is
that she's saying about the Dick. No,

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,170
I want her to know,

47
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,020
fuck your mom. Okay. Go ahead and
fuck your mom when you fuck your mom,

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,670
mom to shut the fuck up, okay. Because
she gave birth to the wrong baby. Okay.

49
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,300
From the moment she gave birth to
you. Okay. You was a mistake. Okay.

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,500
I had a girl, I like
it. I liked, by the way,

51
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,290
I don't think I've ever heard go fuck
your mom and when you fuck your mom,

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,153
tell her shut up.

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,390
So it's actually double
a pretty great insult.

54
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:25,370
It's saying go fuck your mom and when
whatever noise she's making you told her

55
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:30,180
to shut the fuck up and take it.
She's ruthless man.

56
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,200
She's great.
Yeah.

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,400
I really like your rights to say I'm
retired because your mom didn't give birth

58
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:39,390
to have shit hole like
you acid. Oh yeah, girl.

59
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,940
Good for you. She's fired up. I liked
the heat. Yeah. I like her fire.

60
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,080
She was very fired.
If we trained women to be more like her,

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,570
I feel like the world
would be a better place.

62
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:54,140
Like to stand up for yourself
and not take any shit. Be a lot.

63
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,290
I think that's good. It'd
be so retarded. Yeah. A lot.

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,910
A lot less Harvey Weinstein
action happening in the
world. You know what I mean?

65
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:05,900
Striking back. You think you
think he could take advantage
of her? I think she's,

66
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:09,800
um, she's, she's calling the
shots today. She really is.

67
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,590
She's a fucking animal. I like her. Yeah.

68
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,960
You get a sense her rage
if he's really upset.

69
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,190
I felt like that's what the Internet's
for a lot of people at functions as a

70
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,250
place to just let your rage out.
Yeah.

71
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,830
I have a feeling she's been called that
a few times though because the r word.

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,880
Yeah. Whew. I don't even want
to say it, but the r word, uh,

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,750
you think she's been called? I don't think
she seems that way, but you know, hey,

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,610
yeah. Potato Patato very
hurtful word, you know,

75
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,010
and do I have a giant?

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,250
It is so you shouldn't say it.
Yup.

77
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,480
Yeah. Goodness. I mean, you know, she's,

78
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,800
she's maybe not as sensitive to the word
as we are because she's of a different

79
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,410
culture. So we're going to be
a little forgiving here. Yeah,

80
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:02,700
you can let her say what she said.
That's her opinion. But yeah,

81
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,450
it's uh, here in the
United States, sensitive.

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,790
I don't know where she's from, but here
in the United States, um, you can't,

83
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,250
you can't talk like,

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,550
do you want to fuck with my mind?

85
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,330
Similar. Yeah. Similar.
Sorry. Similar. Similar.

86
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,790
I think she's might be tie.
You think so ty? What? No, no,

87
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:28,760
like that, that a little, I hear that.
Okay. Well you're the master of accents.

88
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,950
You tell us. I Dunno. Actually. I
know where she's from, Cambodia.

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,450
So I need to polish up on
some of my Asian dialects.

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,400
Can we please talk about our show now? Uh,
yeah, we can talk about our show now. Um,

91
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,850
a lot of good stuff happening. Where
is it? I had it here for right.

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,160
Oh yeah.
Ah,

93
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,520
oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh,

94
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,960
um,
so that's our,

95
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,380
a reality show Stinger that we
hadn't been a long time ago,

96
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,650
but we haven't dove into delved into a
reality show in a while and we've been

97
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:11,000
watching more scripted stuff, which is,
you know, good quality. Tell you why.

98
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,120
I'm a huge fan of the reality genre.
I love it.

99
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,700
I feel as though you've got me into shows.
I used to never watch a lot of those,

100
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,120
but if they're not making
them as real as they used to,

101
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,170
there's so fabricated now,
but this one's a hundred.

102
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,740
It's a documentary type style. Well,
yeah, it's a series. I mean it has a run.

103
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,250
It's on,
it's on Netflix here in the u s uh,

104
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,850
I say that because we have
a worldwide audience. Uh,

105
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,030
oh boy. Uh, anyways, the
show his age gap love, right.

106
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,280
They just got glove and we talked
about it last week, but my goodness,

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,820
I thought it was a one off cause
that's kind of how it was presented.

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,280
This is just tackling one subject and
then I hit more episodes and there's a

109
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,130
whole season.
I'm so obsessed.

110
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,040
I know I haven't seen you this joyful
since you got into your narcos a

111
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,940
Telanovela. I think the reason
that I'm so obsessed is this.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The show is permission for me to
bring up my worst personality traits.

113
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,870
My most critical mean,
mean spirited,

114
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,900
but funny and fun
personality traits because I,

115
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,850
the whole time I just shake my head,
I'm like, Ugh, this is disgusting.

116
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,700
They're so gross.
All the old people are gross.

117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,820
Makeup's all fucked up on the teeth
are all young people are gross.

118
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,200
The whole thing is just gross.

119
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,620
And I have so much fun just
hating them the whole time. Oh,

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,430
I think that's going to be a
guest. One second. All right. Um,

121
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,720
our guest is here. He is,
uh, fueling up with caffeine.

122
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,310
Said he refused to come on unless he
had coffee. I was like, all right. Yeah.

123
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,140
It was very, very demanding. So we uh,
you know, we, we cater to our guests,

124
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:55,850
so, but yeah, so age gap. Um,
yeah. I love, I don't know.

125
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,770
I you're right. I haven't had, cause
sometimes when a reality show, uh,

126
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,210
we get into,
you know,

127
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:06,670
it's usually like kind of background
music if you don't have to focus on the

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,880
grounds of sunset. It's kind of the, what
did that below deck, the yacht thing.

129
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,190
It's like I can miss an episode and I'm
like, oh that's, yeah, that's the guy.

130
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:20,270
That's cool. It's, yeah, it's like candy,
you just kind of cat. But this one,

131
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,570
I am so into studying and I also love
making a list as it goes on of WHO's

132
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,320
grocer? Like who like to fuck less. See.

133
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,500
And the thing is with us as a couple,
everyone's like,

134
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:37,340
you guys love each other so much. There's
so much love. And, and I'm like, you know,

135
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,850
a lot of our relationship, we're
United by stuff we hate. Yeah.

136
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,160
It's actually our ability to sit down
and watch a show like that and criticized

137
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,120
the shit out of people.

138
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:51,870
We don't even know they were really
bonds us ruthlessly do it. And uh,

139
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,290
with no heart and just, it's really,
if someone were listening be like,

140
00:08:55,291 --> 00:09:00,000
you're a real asshole man because
we're doing, it's such a mean way,

141
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,840
but it's, it's, it's just you and I
like no one's really getting hurt.

142
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,660
I would like to do,
if we could through licensed,

143
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,490
I don't know how that would work is due
like alive streaming of us know how we

144
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,570
could do it or watching the
shots or we could do it.

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,660
We just say this podcast is going
to accompany episode two of age.

146
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,494
Got Love.

147
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,610
And then you press play on it here and
we have a different feed and then you

148
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:27,000
just talk as you do it. Yeah.
Can we do it in bed though?

149
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,320
I want to be able to lay it. Just bring
a zoom recorder up there. What I was,

150
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:36,050
I mean, well my favorite was so
the new champion of gross next,

151
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:39,180
cause every episode you introduce
new older people who were like,

152
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,560
that person is disgusting.

153
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,770
So there's a guy now who is like the
champ of gross and which one you feel it

154
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:51,160
cause we had no, he had the really
long white hair and he's got,

155
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,950
he used to be a minister. He's so
nasty. And his, his uh, so age,

156
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,370
they're, this age gap is
40 plus years or something.

157
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,080
And she's like pretty nice looking.
Gow Normal. Yeah. And she's like, yeah,

158
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,080
they start talking about the
makeover that he's, you go, oh,

159
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,740
she's going to give him a
makeover. And he's like, no,
no, no. This is him. Postmates.

160
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,780
So he's got his long, white people
had it. And you're like, what?

161
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,440
And she starts talking about when I met
him, his breath was really sour or what,

162
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,120
and she goes,
his teeth.

163
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,410
I asked him when the last time he went
to the dentist and he said 20 some years.

164
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,670
And she goes, so she goes, you could
really smell his breath strongly.

165
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,420
And she goes, now, you know he's had his
teeth white and you're like whitened.

166
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,650
Those motherfuckers are grains. They
went from green to yellow and she's like,

167
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,800
and his breath is like passable
now and you're like, oh my God.

168
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,960
I mean so, so gnarly.
And this poor girl is,

169
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,740
she's like fucking 30 or something and
they have five kids running around the

170
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,470
house. I just loved, you know what it is.

171
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,540
I think it's why everybody
likes those shows.

172
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,680
You just end up feeling better about
yourself and the decisions you've made and

173
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:02,410
where you're at or you get to look
into somebody else's home. Well,

174
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,510
I was wondering,

175
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,800
the breath alone is such a deterrent
for me and somebody's mouth being that

176
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,770
jacked up. Like what? What did
she like about him? I'm not sure.

177
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,090
I don't know. That's the problem with
these. I think it was just, you know what?

178
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,690
I think it was because they met in church,
I think it was,

179
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,560
there was some type of power dynamic.
She saw that he was the minister,

180
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,630
so she sees him in front of the church.
He's the, he's not, he's a father figure.

181
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,850
Literally two people, not, you
know, in life. In other words,

182
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:36,150
he's giving them guidance and advice.
Yes.

183
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,890
She was attracted to that paternal
energy and he told, you know,

184
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,290
he would give the sermon every
week and this and that. And then,

185
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,010
but then she's like, but physically he
was repulsive. And you're like, what?

186
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:50,910
How are you banging this guy? I Dunno.
It's, it's astounding. It's really crazy.

187
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,250
Jesus. My, my least favorite actually

188
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,960
is the Florida,

189
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
the acting couple or the guys like 60
and she's 22 and she was homeschooled and

190
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:06,430
she grew up in a religious upbringing.
So she's totally socially are worded.

191
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,690
Yeah.
One might say

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,650
and he's like not, he's not bad looking
objectively for an older gentleman,

193
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,420
but he's such a, that I look
and saw we had, okay. Yeah.

194
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,580
He, he's such a Boner, a dad Boehner,

195
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:28,150
like his jokes are like loves and the
size of a small child. And I, I'm like,

196
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,980
Oh my God, your personality so
unbearable. You are right. Okay.

197
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,980
About this.
This is my,

198
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:36,981
one of my favorite people in the thing
is that that guy I thought was less

199
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,140
physically gross,
but he is creepier.

200
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,440
Creep factor is a creep factor
because there's something,

201
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,230
he's disguising it with that.
Aw shucks.

202
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,520
Yes. It's phony. Yeah.
And it's a, it's yes.

203
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,340
Because you know, you know,
he's preying upon this.

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,460
She is now 22 they met when
she was like fucking 18 yeah.

205
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,210
And you know, and he's like, Aww
shucks, there's some bullshit there.

206
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,680
So that's scarier for that guy. He's
really taken advantage of her naivete.

207
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,300
Definitely. Yeah. It's not fair. They,
you know what it is too. I almost,

208
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:17,680
I have more respect for the trophy wife
and the older gentlemen couple. Yeah.

209
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,800
Just because there's an even exchange
of power. There's an even exchange.

210
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,690
It's right. Good looks and getting laid
for money. Yeah. Older guy, younger woman.

211
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:29,260
But she's hot. He's the got the money. So
there's an exchange, there's a contract.

212
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,060
But when the balance is totally not fair,
where it's like she's,

213
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:38,110
you know, 17 when we met
homeschool, totally naive. You know,

214
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,800
you know the world, Bro. You
know what, you're fucking
dealing. Right, right, right,

215
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,500
right. Any aid that wealthy,
you know what I'm saying?

216
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:48,070
Like she's doing her own dishes
and shit. Yeah, they gon,

217
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,660
they're gonna fucking Chili's for dinner.
I would like that camera to,

218
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,480
they were rolling that house.
Ooh.

219
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:56,440
I know that one's the one for a couple
of years. When she finally wise up,

220
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,050
she'll wise up at some point.
Yeah, it's, it's unequal.

221
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,000
What about the older lady who her 28
year old booboo is doing her toenails

222
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,530
filing her nails and her
feet and they're rotten.

223
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,550
They're rotten and crusted
there likes to give me a panic.

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,540
She's a, they're American, right?

225
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,890
She's,
she is a troll.

226
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,790
She's hideous and something's really
fucked up with that guy. Yeah.

227
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,440
He's weird too. He's on some type of
spectrum because he doesn't, it's not,

228
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,370
the eyes are not registering regular
emotions and he's looking at,

229
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,070
I saw her and we kissed and we kissed
and she keeps me, she's like, oh, she,

230
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:39,980
she's dude.
He's touched too,

231
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,470
so she's taken advantage of
some nice looking touched guy.

232
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,130
You know what I'm saying? He's touched.
He's really tough. Definitely our word it.

233
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah. And she's taking
advantage of this headache.

234
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:51,930
Hearing those horrendous fucking on hurt.

235
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,330
It's just gross.
What are you going to give me a pedicure?

236
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,450
If they looked on shut up,
I wouldn't let go near anything like that.

237
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,540
I can't even reach my toes anymore. When
are you going to start doing it? I mean,

238
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,270
I would do that for you, but
you don't. But here's the truth.

239
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,970
You don't look like that. And that's
why I would do that for you. Thank you.

240
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,770
If you look like her, I just filed
papers, so just serve you. Hey,

241
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,570
so disgusting.
She is disgusting.

242
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,400
It is fucked up too as a spouse where
you just let yourself go. It's not fair.

243
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,690
It's not fair to do to some
money. [inaudible] all.
Alright, let's get our guests.

244
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,150
Okay. Keep you one second. Let me bring
our guest in and a very excited. Oh,

245
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,260
all right. We're back.
We're back. Um, yeah.

246
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,900
We were talking about our
son's name, Ellis. Uh,

247
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,350
it is true that we saw the movie month

248
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,050
after Doc Ellis.
We both have immigrant.

249
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,730
I know. It's a good one. We both
have immigrant parents as you do.

250
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,890
So then people were like, oh, Ellis
island. That's where we're like, yeah,

251
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,950
that's the last thing I would
have thought. So I'm like, Eh,

252
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,560
but actually that's the one I have
to bring up. Whenever somebody goes,

253
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:07,070
what's his name all I have to go like,
you know, like Ellis Island. They're like,

254
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,650
yeah. I'm like, okay,
that's just like the island.

255
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,340
That's a great name.
He's a great kid.

256
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,170
Well with us is at the fantastic Tom
Rowe international comedic superstar.

257
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,830
Tom Rhodes,
who's not a stranger to your mom's house.

258
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:26,000
It's been a long time in
Redondo. We has a long time, man.

259
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,630
We had such a good time. I thought, wow,
I'm going to be a regular on this show.

260
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,120
We stopped doing guest guest
for two years. Okay. No guess.

261
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,330
And we did the Culligan Man.
He goes, I got Lincoln man

262
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,250
cause I had fans.

263
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:47,150
Have you got the part of your podcasts
that came to my shows and said, hey,

264
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,070
can we get rid of silly?

265
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,920
But you tour where you were like a world
renowned comedian. You're at, like,

266
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,220
you really do your road dog to the
Max. Like people are like, Oh yeah,

267
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,480
I'd do the road. I'm like, you don't
do the rogue like Tom Rhodes the road.

268
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,420
You really, you've done it. You've done
it. Comedy fucking everywhere, man. Yeah.

269
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,790
Well I, you know, I, um,

270
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,970
I've been doing the international
circuits for 20 years and you know,

271
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,870
I had,
uh,

272
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,370
I had that Sitcom many years ago in
NBC and when the Shit come finished,

273
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,330
I had a lot of money and I had played
everywhere in the United States and I

274
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:26,330
looked at my money is like
kind of my NBC artist grant.

275
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,340
And I started taking trips to
London and invested in myself,

276
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:36,260
slept on a friend's couch and uh,
actually the movie phantom thread.

277
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,630
Yeah. Everything I liked the best about
that movie is it takes place on Fitzroy

278
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,800
Square. And I, my friend rich hall, um,

279
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,130
he lived on Fitzroy Square and he
gave me a key to his apartment.

280
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,990
So that's where I would stay
when I would go to London.

281
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:55,350
And it's like a short walk
to the London comedy store.

282
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,730
And so there's some thread, so
you know, people know that's PT,

283
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:03,000
Anderson's new movie, Pt
Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson.

284
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,020
I love Paul Thomas Jenner's. Oh my God,
he's so amazing. I haven't seen it,

285
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,570
but he's such an amazing,
I bombed in front of him like a month ago,

286
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,200
so I really cool guy. It's you
and it's a, it's a great film,

287
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,670
but I love the fact that it takes place
on Fitzroy Square, but you've also,

288
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:25,150
you've done, I mean London, but you've
done all over the South Pacific.

289
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,620
But what I was going to say was London
was the key to the international circuits

290
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:29,101
for me.

291
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:33,240
I got him with London and then that
led to gigs around Europe and Asia and

292
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:37,860
Australia because I want to know if
this happens to you when you step into a

293
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:41,650
whole other country. In other words,
whether it's a European country, Asia,

294
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:45,210
I'm going to do you have
first show anxiety of like,

295
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:49,830
is this going to work for me? That's
kind of the drug, that's the fuel.

296
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:52,590
Is this,
this fear of Oh shit,

297
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,290
this might not work well
and what is going to work?

298
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,700
And then the fact that you have to
think so quickly on your feet, like, um,

299
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,130
people don't read those references
and going to work. Yeah.

300
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,670
You know how like when you're locked and
loaded in your brain and you're telling

301
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:08,280
a story and you're like, how
you say brain is thinking, okay,

302
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:12,540
I'm going to go into this little section.
Yeah, I'm going to talk about this next.

303
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,990
And then you get this little
panic fear of, oh my God, is that,

304
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:20,580
that's what you're addicted to. In a
way. It is actually so funny. Yeah.

305
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,620
Like it's really cool. Like
when I'll do, uh, you know,

306
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,180
I didn't live anywhere for 10 years. I
put everything into storage and like, uh,

307
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,170
the last time I did your show, I wasn't
living anywhere. No, that's right. And,

308
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,640
and it was really cool.

309
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:37,000
So I would do three or four months a year
in Europe and then a month in Asia and

310
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,440
Australia, six months
all over the states. Um,

311
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,180
but like when you got like a week in
Ireland booked and a week in England and

312
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:49,860
then a week in Holland, it's like,
it's different. See like, oh,

313
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,200
okay, wow, Ireland was great and you know,

314
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:55,890
I really got the hang of it by the end
of the week and Irish audiences are the

315
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:59,250
best. And then you go to England and
you're like, it's completely different.

316
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,050
Really. Yeah. I would try to use this. I
was just down for it. Irish audiences, uh,

317
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:07,400
Irish, you can tell it, you can
see it in their comedians. It,

318
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,850
there's a storytelling tradition. Yeah.
Yeah. So they really love stories. Yeah.

319
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,320
And then you go to England and they,
they like self deprecation. Right? Uh,

320
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:20,820
you know, you don't see, I've never
see like a real arrogant Jimmy Carr,

321
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:24,880
but you never see like jacked
up arrogant English committee.

322
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,160
They're always a blessing on themselves.
Seen as like an American quality. The,

323
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,130
yeah,
the bravado and the like.

324
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,280
And then I saved the day is an American
thing and like the British sentiment

325
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:42,120
would be like, and then I fucked up the
day for everybody. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

326
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,500
I remember I did the Edinburgh
Festival in 2014 and this,

327
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,510
this wrote this review of me and she said,

328
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,590
don't we all wish we could be
as confident as the Americans?

329
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,250
And it's like, it's so stupid. Like, um,

330
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,380
I've had up ups and downs in
my life, you know, and uh, I,

331
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,780
you guys know me
personally and my, my, My,

332
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,660
my dad and my sister died and I,

333
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,810
I went into the emotionally
I was in the toilet,

334
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,380
I was heartbroken over losing
these people that I loved.

335
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:19,381
And it took me a while to build back my
confidence and then here's this woman

336
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:23,800
going, oh, it's this
American quality. No, it's,

337
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,950
we're each individually fighting
our own fight in life and you know,

338
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:33,160
things happen and you've got to
constantly be coming back from the brink.

339
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,890
Whatever you are,
you are

340
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,430
do not like about the
festivals and the overseas, um,

341
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,410
comedy scene. Like the one thing I do not
like the idea of reviews all the time.

342
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,560
I really don't because you don't have
any exposure to it when you're kind of us

343
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,420
based. Like you do shows everywhere.
No one ever does a fucking like,

344
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,240
you know what I mean?
Once in a blue moon,

345
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:59,830
maybe some city beat blog will be like,
I went to their show and they kind of do.

346
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,360
But like when you start doing some of
these festivals and you see all out,

347
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,780
um, I think it's just such a
departure from what I'm used to.

348
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,900
I was never a fan of that. Even if it's
like a nice review, you still like,

349
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,080
I don't know, it just feels like
you shouldn't be doing a writeup.

350
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,620
Yeah. Who are they qualified? What is
your qualification? Just some funding,

351
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,400
you know, it's gotten even
worse because like in Edinburgh,

352
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,760
the newspapers in England used to pay
for these reviewers to go up there and

353
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:31,710
most all of those newspapers
cut there. Oh sure. Budgets.

354
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,010
So they ended up your guide to budget
with a website viewing things and you're

355
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:42,150
like, Nah, I like, there's
like college kids writing.

356
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,280
It was like what are, yeah. Who are
you? I've seen some of those by the way,

357
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,390
that are absurd for a cause.
The one place you do see the review here?

358
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:55,310
State side is colleges.
I've done colleges and the reviews,

359
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,360
it's not even that they're,
they're critical.

360
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,890
It's so bad.

361
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,230
Just such a terrible writing because
it's just like a freshman, uh, you know,

362
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,330
journalists. It'll be like, I
went to see Tom Segura at our, uh,

363
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,770
student performing arts center.

364
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,510
He opened with a joke
about how cold it was here.

365
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,930
The joke went like this.
I thought it was very funny.

366
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,150
He next tackled these topics, some
of them like, and it's very just,

367
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,920
you know, stating a fact, stating a
fact, stating the line, stating review.

368
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:35,570
And it's like you're putting that out
into the Internet, uh, memory bank.

369
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:38,510
It's just, it's, it's
terrible. Gave away your joke.

370
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,610
Of course you gave away the joke
and he would do like, quote,

371
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:45,100
like long things and you're like, yeah,
just, uh, yeah, there's, uh, English. Uh,

372
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,100
I hate

373
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,090
to bring it up. This website
is it comedy website? Uh,

374
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:55,091
and they wrote some thing
about a joke that I did about,

375
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,820
not a joke. It's a story that
happened to me. And, uh, it's, uh,

376
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,330
it's a joke on my new album. And, uh,

377
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,230
my wife Ashton and I were talking about
the, the me too movement. We did a,

378
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,910
uh, an episode for my podcast
and talking about experiences,

379
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,590
and I talked about this comedian who,
uh,

380
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,480
had tricked me into going back to his
apartment when I was very young man.

381
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,010
And a,

382
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:24,011
and then this comedy website in
England wrote this salacious story.

383
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,940
I mean, they wasn't, wasn't salacious.

384
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:33,941
The headline was Tom Rhodes accuses such
and such comedian of sexual assault.

385
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,900
And then they quoted my joke and they
quoted us talking about it on the podcast.

386
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:46,220
And one of the things that bothered
me the most, well, I mean, you know,

387
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:50,630
they're trying to get clickbait. Yeah. I
didn't accuse the guy of sexual assault.

388
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:54,860
I tell the story of the creepy
older famous man yeah. Who,

389
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,760
you know,

390
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,530
tried to trick me and got me back
to his apartment and manhandled me.

391
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,280
Yeah. But he didn't punch me. He
didn't penetrate me. Yeah. Uh,

392
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,530
it wasn't,
you know,

393
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,160
and I think that sexual assault
is such a serious issue in the,

394
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,520
in the world right now.
Yeah. How dare this,

395
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,020
this site is kind of trying to
get yeah. Trivializing the, the,

396
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,420
the movements. Yeah. And uh,

397
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:24,810
and then also they gave
away my story punch like,

398
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,610
oh Geez, that's the worst though.
It was rolling on many levels.

399
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,780
Qualifies anybody to be a critic.
I mean,

400
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:36,420
even if you look at a Cisco and,
and fuck bird or what are their names?

401
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,150
Yeah, he's dead. They're
dead. They're both, yeah.

402
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,700
Apparently they both hated each other too.

403
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,740
So these are two men
who were full of hate,

404
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:48,640
I'm assuming to either a failed artist
or whatever. And one of them made like,

405
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,720
it's one of those celebrated awful
movies Ebird like a rotten tomato,

406
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,660
like valley of the dolls to or something.
So like,

407
00:25:55,661 --> 00:26:00,340
so you're a field filmmaker yourself and
that qualifies you to criticize other

408
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:03,160
people. How I know like
it's just, I don't know.

409
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,550
I hate people that criticize already.
Like what are you talking about?

410
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,550
That's why I roll my eyes
at every top 10 list. Ah,

411
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,640
like as if anyone in your life,

412
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,670
everybody can write a top 10 list and
technically everyone's right because it's

413
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,320
your fucking top 10 list.

414
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,590
But the idea that we would make one
person's top 10 lists as credible,

415
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,490
whether it's movies, music,
books, comedy, it's like, why?

416
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,510
Why is your top 10 lists of value?
You're just, you don't even do it.

417
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,500
You don't do the thing that you're
saying you have the authority on.

418
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,070
Like you're not a musician, right?
Don't write music. If Bill Burr,

419
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,220
what a print out like,
hey, top 10 specials,

420
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,130
I'd be like, all right,
that's fucking bill Burke.

421
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,130
Let's listen to that guy's opinion on,
you know, comedy. It's absurd. But uh huh.

422
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,090
I know it's silly.
Fucking listen to these Jack Offs.

423
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,690
There's a lot of good movies that they
got terrible scores on you and I want,

424
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,710
we don't, we totally discredit when you're
going through the iTunes or something.

425
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,340
Like I don't even listen to that
guy. Let's see if it's good. I mean,

426
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:09,810
the only ones that are pretty much
they're spot on is if it has single digit

427
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,220
approval. If it's like 8% of
people liked this movie here,

428
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,450
like it might be dog shit.

429
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,030
If it's 35% it could be a decent
movie. Some people, you know,

430
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,400
just didn't resonate with
that and their sensibilities.

431
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,530
Or you look at the Oscars and you're like,

432
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,540
is America really watching these movies
that the academy has a big heart on

433
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,550
fire.
They made this big push now,

434
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,420
but now every category
has like 10 nominees.

435
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,040
It's a too many nominees. Madness.
You've got too many people up for,

436
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,620
I watch shape of water last night.
How was it?

437
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,200
You know what I can see,

438
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,640
I think that's the,
I mean,

439
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,670
I really want to get out to win,
but I can see why shape of water did,

440
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,650
did win because, and I, at the
very end of the movie, I go, ah,

441
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,030
I get it. It was a love story. I mean,

442
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,870
it's a woman in a fish and they're fun.
You remember splash,

443
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:14,580
we all loved splash, right? You
know, it's, uh, and so I thought,

444
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,180
yeah, well get out was a horror
movie and horror movies never win.

445
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,300
My wife loves three billboards,

446
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,130
which is about hate and people dealing
with hate, which really speaks to,

447
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,680
you know,
where the world is today.

448
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,450
There's so much hate and all
these lovely it out. Dude.

449
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,020
It's such, I, I, I'm,
I don't know I could,

450
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,850
I could step into a class about that.

451
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,710
I think so too.

452
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,710
I think I saw a fascination of one
because the guy invented his own genre,

453
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,080
which hasn't been done since Quintin
Tarantino in 1992 with reservoir dogs.

454
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:59,820
That was like such a, Oh wow. It's kind
of, it's mine. He'd wanted his own genre.

455
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,780
So for that alone, hearing him
talk about like, I love Jordan,

456
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:09,781
Bill Peele saying that he started and
stopped writing this movie like 20 times

457
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,040
and thinking that people wouldn't
like this, maybe never get made.

458
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,600
And Amsterdam, uh,
Jordan Peele was in boom,

459
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,480
Chicago, this, um,

460
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,170
Improv theater in Amsterdam.
And uh,

461
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,250
I had a late night talk show on the Dutch
television and I would stop by there.

462
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,080
Uh,
there was a bar out front,

463
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,920
it was in my neighborhood and he
was the guy that I would talk to.

464
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,050
I would pop in there and, uh, he
was a sweetheart of a guy. And,

465
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:45,310
uh, I, I, you know, I very
lovable, wonderful guy.

466
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,540
And, uh, it's funny, like when
you know somebody and they,

467
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,080
they knock it out of the park, you
know, like guy watched your special,

468
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:57,970
I've felt the same way. Oh,
thanks man. Yeah. Um, it's,

469
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,780
it's like a good feeling when you see
people totally knock it out of the park.

470
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,370
You didn't mention him. I did love jury
special as well, but what was the I, it's,

471
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,730
um, was that a year ago? Oh my God.

472
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,950
I haven't had one in many years
this October. Was it October?

473
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,143
It's a while ago now.

474
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,020
It's October 27 incidents.
It was a really, okay,

475
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,270
go ahead. Go ahead. No, but here's
the thing. I'll say this before. Uh,

476
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,820
that thing about, that's fine. It's fine.

477
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,470
The thing about that,
your specialty is great.

478
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,530
Now I'm going to feel bad
about me over this time.

479
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,430
The mom or something? It's a
cold. Oh my God, you guys, uh,

480
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,340
her special now it's called mother and it,
which is the best title mother.

481
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,103
I'm just kidding.

482
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,070
But one thing I love,
the thing I love about,

483
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,350
I'm so disappointed in so
many movies, you know, I mean,

484
00:30:57,351 --> 00:31:00,450
you go into movie, you want,
you want it to be surprised.

485
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:04,640
Do you want to have things happen
that really you didn't expect?

486
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,690
And so many movies when you press play,
it's a blueprint that they're following.

487
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:09,830
You go like,
this is this scene.

488
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,280
I know what the next thing does that
sets up that this is that relationship.

489
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,700
Here's the conflict, here's
the resolution. Yeah, I saw
the movie the whole time.

490
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,660
The thing I love about get out is just,

491
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:22,330
just so many layers and so many
elements of surprise. Like you're,

492
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,420
you're constantly like, Holy Shit,
this means that and this, you know,

493
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:27,920
like you're the fact that,

494
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,040
that you could watch a movie and be
surprised so many times captivated by the

495
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,410
story. That's what to me was like
the most amazing thing about that.

496
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,300
Totally. Like when the woman's hitting
the tea cup and he's fallen down the hole

497
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,620
metaphor of the sunken place and you know,
institutional race.

498
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,940
It's just an incredible, if you haven't
seen get out at this point, uh, it's,

499
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,050
you know,
it's really,

500
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:55,051
it's an amazing movie that people so
sorry to people have emailed that a few

501
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,440
weeks ago.

502
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,010
They were blown away by your chicken
noises that you do a really good chicken

503
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,510
noise.
Um,

504
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,350
I guess you did one on the show and I'm
so used to your checking calling that it

505
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,420
didn't really stand out,
but hey, your chicken.

506
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,670
Well, I mean it's in my
special time and you know,

507
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,190
I am not going to watch any more movies
until I go watch your special I guess.

508
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,420
Got It. I'm going to write the most loving
review where it is ever been written.

509
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,400
It's the craziest, most unique, odd,

510
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,050
I mean I like your hat people do things
here that you don't ever see any place

511
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:30,884
else.

512
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,740
One competition that people flock to
for locals really needs no introduction.

513
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,290
Wow. Because it's not hard to hear. This

514
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,730
is the national cluck off where people
from all over the United States come and

515
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:52,660
sweet to see if we can mimic a chicken
the best. Um, that's great. You know,

516
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:56,430
uh, I'm from Oviedo, Florida and then, oh,

517
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,320
veto is famous for,
uh,

518
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:03,010
the Oviedo chickens really walk
around on the little downtown area.

519
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,860
Where is, oh, veto. It's uh, the panhandle
area. No, no, no, no, no. It's um,

520
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,640
east of Orlando About,
oh,

521
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,590
I mean it was a charming go beach
kind of towards cocoa. Okay.

522
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,890
Uh, it was a charming little citrus
village when I grew up there.

523
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:22,660
And now they built a circular highway
around Orlando and it is a highway exit.

524
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:25,480
Now there's a chili's and
a target and all that,

525
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,160
but there's still a little downtown area
and there's a Popeye's fried chicken,

526
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:34,720
which is funny because these chickens
walk around in the parking lot. Oh God.

527
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:40,290
And that's the one thing my
little town was known for was the,

528
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,910
as the chickens. Chickens. Wow.
Two, um, tied us all together.

529
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:50,110
I mean, people are asking, can we make,
are in for it? They want to, they can.

530
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,620
Christina. No, I can't do
the call. The rooster call,

531
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,130
but that's a specific time.
But you do,

532
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,290
you have done some impressive animal
noises. I think you did. He'd goat.

533
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,920
Is it sheep goat? Yeah. Let, we'll start
with the chicken. Okay. That's all right.

534
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,830
Yeah. Yeah. The pressure's on now,
but this is when the winter step up.

535
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:15,280
I listen to my face. I can't
laugh though. I can't laugh.

536
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,893
Well,

537
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,220
that was great. Really Great. Yeah. Hey,

538
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,560
hey.
That was really good.

539
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:32,830
Yeah. Thanks guys. That was, what
do I win? You could kind of have,

540
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,020
you could compete. Really
great checking. I don't think.

541
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,720
What kind of animal sounds can you guys
do? I don't know. That was really good

542
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,633
per day.

543
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,070
That is is not you. That was me.
I just did it. Ah, I come on.

544
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:50,330
What animal sounds like he's stuck
at your Chin like that too. I'm not,

545
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,770
I don't do the a master of accents,
but I'm asked from animals. Yeah.

546
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,630
They weren't know if
you can beat this guy.

547
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,980
One man entered the cluck the gun and
didn't lay in it because he took home his

548
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:02,870
12th. That's right. 12

549
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,320
national cluck off title. Oh, it's like
music. We say you have an ear for it.

550
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,550
I have an ear for animal sounds. Any
barnyard animal I can pretty much mimic.

551
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,560
Wow. Where was that? I don't know.

552
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:22,070
I wish it were in la. Yeah. The craziest,

553
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:26,020
most unique chicken show. God, I mean,

554
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,560
I don't know where that this is.
It's been an old age question.

555
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,940
What came first? The chicken or
the egg? Kind of boring intro.

556
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,740
I mean drawing here my goat.

557
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,900
I do. Okay. Ready? There's
also a visual way, right? Yeah.

558
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,733
Ah,

559
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,770
I was really good.

560
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,670
That was really good. So you do have
a skill for this. People were right.

561
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,010
They spotted it correctly. You're
really good. Terrible reality shows.

562
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:04,900
And I can make animal noises.
That's all I got. That's what I got.

563
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,070
What's your talent? What's
your odd talent? Oh Wow.

564
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,680
Can you wiggle your ears?
Double jointed.

565
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,640
Can you flip your eyelids?
I wow.

566
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,880
I haven't.
You pick your nose with your tongue.

567
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,180
When you travel. You traveled Europe
so much. Did you ever meet this guy?

568
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,000
There's nipples are
disturbing

569
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,930
this video. That's Europe.
You've traveled to Europe a lot

570
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,650
in Europe. That's how they are,
right, Jeremy? I don't know.

571
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,580
You spent more time there than
me. Those are so thick. Right?

572
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,860
That is so bizarre.
Yeah.

573
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,580
What about the offer from that gentleman
in his apartment? Should we play that?

574
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,310
Should we have roads? Necess
which offer though? I'll try.

575
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,690
Oh. Oh yeah. You want to
go all classic on them.

576
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,590
It's like it's been a while since
you've been in your mom's house.

577
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:16,410
You should know what we're
talking about. Okay. Yeah.

578
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,330
I don't know if you're down with this or
if you want. Oh yeah, cause you always,

579
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,250
you said that.
Well now you have a place to live,

580
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:27,670
but if you ever travel again
and you need a place to live

581
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,570
black, God's love to fuck and fuck
good. Yes. You're a hot black guy.

582
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:38,070
You want to fuck me at 2195 if you
want to move in, you can move in,

583
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:41,400
but you got to fuck the, I have
any, I need to be fucked a lot, man.

584
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,300
You can rent free food, free rent and
everything else, man. He has a GL man.

585
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,190
Men from jail, homeless or
um, your thug median income.

586
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,940
Then Franklin boot cheer, man. If
Vicky would have at least you got up,

587
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,650
it's a bad angle to be
lying down when you're like,

588
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:05,280
when you're looking for like a sexual made
partner, there's a whole lot of wrong.

589
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,850
Right. You don't want, you
don't want that dumper in angle.

590
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,100
You're the first guy to
mention his position.

591
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:17,080
You should be setting up definitely a
little more lighting. Better lighting.

592
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,720
Cover up those under eye circles.
Yup.

593
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,010
Foundation a little something.
But anyways,

594
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,930
free rent if you're ever in, I
don't know, I forget what city,

595
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,600
but I'll find out the great thing about,

596
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm not living anywhere for 10 years
and then get everything out of storage.

597
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,120
Um, my apartment looks like a
national geographic gift shop. Oh,

598
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:44,150
does it? Really? Yeah. And then I, uh,
I, you know, I was blown away to fight.

599
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:48,670
I didn't know your mother was
from Peru and if you come to my,

600
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,210
my apartment, I've got Peruvian
blankets that you love. Peru.

601
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,380
Peru is my favorite place I have ever
been in my life and my all time favorite

602
00:38:59,231 --> 00:38:59,980
souvenir.

603
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,940
I ever bought anywhere in the world and
I've been doing a joke about it is, um,

604
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,850
my handcrafted Peruvian
chess set and it is, uh,

605
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:14,680
the Incas versus the Spanish
conquistadores. Yeah. Well
we know who won that one.

606
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:18,880
Well, and I suck at chess whenever I play,
I'm the INCAS. When I get slaughtered,

607
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,710
it's historically accurate.
Hilarious. Uh, but uh, but yeah, I,

608
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,510
when I lived in Amsterdam,

609
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:29,980
I had a late night talk show for
two years and then the same network,

610
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,880
let me be a presenter on a travel show
for a year and I got to film a highlight

611
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:37,210
on Peru.
So I didn't go to the Amazon north part,

612
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,700
but I went almost everywhere else.

613
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,590
I travel what was there for
like almost two weeks. And, uh,

614
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:48,250
it was one of the greatest experiences of
my life. Did you do eyeliner? I did not.

615
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Uh, you know, when you're
filming a television show,

616
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,280
they don't encourage this or
Anthony Bordain or something,

617
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:56,530
then it would be all about,
I've never taken my wife there.

618
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,070
And you let this man and pregnant you
were not taking you to the motherland.

619
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,370
I gotcha. There. I,

620
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,710
she's nervous about it. She read something
about Shining Path. I'm like, damn,

621
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,920
that's gone. Let's expand. That's
the terrorist organization.

622
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,710
I was there when they were
setting off bombs like living in,

623
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,840
I was spending my summers in
Peru and you would hear like,

624
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,120
oh my law and see like buildings shake.
Wow.

625
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,020
Windows shatter. And the next morning
I would call my parents, you know,

626
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:36,870
in the u s and I'd be
like, yeah, they, you know,

627
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,620
shiny path set off a 2000 pound bomb
let yesterday. And they're like, yeah,

628
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,060
so, uh, everything else good buddy. I'm
like, Jesus, you're not nervous at all.

629
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,160
They're like, no, we're not.

630
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:53,161
We went to Machu Picchu when we left
the road outside of Machu Picchu,

631
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:58,810
some like kind of country road people.
They had a,

632
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:02,560
there was some protest of some kind
going on and they had rolled massive

633
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:06,430
boulders off of the
mountains into the road.

634
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,370
They would block the,
that was apparently

635
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,510
way of protesting and
Peru have not know though.

636
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,490
That's some like really rural
shit though. Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,580
We've got no other way
to voice our displeasure.

638
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:22,570
Of course somebody get up there with
a, now they got, I mean that, that,

639
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,460
that organization's long gone
man. I know, I know. I do.

640
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:29,740
My Elk Guzman as the leader of the
Shining Path. He's in prison for life.

641
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,550
He's there on an island prison,
like their Alcatraz, uh,

642
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,930
I want to go back and spend more
time in Cusco. Gray was the, uh,

643
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,900
was the Rome of the Inca empire
and there's this famous Cusco.

644
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,290
Can I ramble about this? Yeah.
There's this famous 12 sided stone.

645
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,070
The ink is, did not use mortar. There's,

646
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:57,071
and this stone is like 10 tons and
it's as 12 sided stone and it's in this

647
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:03,170
foundation, uh, a wall. And uh, the,

648
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:08,150
the metaphor is that no stone is too
irregular not to fit in place somewhere.

649
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,100
That was the way that they, that's
the way that they did their masonry.

650
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,850
I love that. That when you're in much
appease, when you see these, you know,

651
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,800
15 foot,

652
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,890
5,000 pound stones and they're laying
flush with another stone and all they can

653
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:29,070
do is hypothesize about like,
there is there, like they're like,

654
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:34,090
we would today in 2018 we would use
tractors and bulldozers and you know,

655
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,610
equipment. And they're
like, we have just theories.

656
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,910
We don't know how the fuck
they built this and how things,

657
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,420
it's crazy he moved in late like that.

658
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,590
And some people think aliens might have
that. Maybe they just don't know. It's,

659
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:48,680
it's, it's really, it's so impossible.
And they're like, you know,

660
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,150
they had thousands of people,

661
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,570
but we still don't know how they
would make it look. And I mean,

662
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,030
they made buildings out of rocks.
It's crazy. [inaudible] PG, uh,

663
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,930
the way the did like home
dwellings or are laid out that, uh,

664
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,830
there's still running water that
runs through them, which is amazing.

665
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,980
And they took you to the
sacrificial Chandler.

666
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:12,710
They used to just slaughter people.
Cool. Everything is positioned so that,

667
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:13,101
you know,

668
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:16,660
you could worship the sun because
they're fucking stupid primitive place.

669
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,340
We got to bring this stuff back
then, man. But my favorite thing, uh,

670
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:26,350
the train from Cusco to Puno that you can,

671
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,720
the last car,
the Inca classes,

672
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:34,610
the first class in the last two cars on
the train have leather arm chairs. Yeah.

673
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,170
So the regular train ticket is like $14.
And then that's from Cusco,

674
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:41,450
Machu Picchu, Cusco to Puno. Oh,

675
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:44,180
to put in seven hours through the Andes.

676
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,960
Puno is the biggest city on
Lake Titicaca. Okay. And Yeah.

677
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,350
Um,
yeah,

678
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,660
you don't even know what's on the shores
of Lake Titicaca has a statue of Beavis

679
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:54,500
and butthead laughing.

680
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,170
So one of my favorite things
I've ever done in my life, uh,

681
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,670
so the last two cars is the first
class and it's only like 27 bucks.

682
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:10,090
He got leather arm chairs in the caboose
is a bar car and the ass end of the

683
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:15,590
caboose is an out open air Bannister.

684
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,060
So you can get a cocktail at the bar
and then you're like leaning against the

685
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,720
banister as you're
going through the Andes.

686
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,760
And then there's like birds of Lama.
It's just absolutely amazing.

687
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,470
It's awesome. You should go
sometime. Yeah, we'll see.

688
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,350
I got other shit going on. Yeah. You know,

689
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,690
so funny you said that your parents would
send you to Pei-ru and my parents, uh,

690
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,630
let my friends, my best friend
Shauna and I go in the summer of 94,

691
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:44,970
we were 17 years old,
not yet 18.

692
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,920
My Dad like just let us go to Hungary
and this is right after communism fell.

693
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,420
This isn't only two years after the
Iron Curtain. So Budapest was still,

694
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,720
it's like pretty much corrupt,
still run by the Russian mafia.

695
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,600
The apartment that we stayed
at didn't have a phone.

696
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,550
We had to use a phone,
see later bitch and uh,

697
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:10,050
on the corner of where our apartment was
in Hungary was a place called the black

698
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:14,160
roof. It was a strip club. So there was
like terrible elements and we would just,

699
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:15,270
you know,
we were 17,

700
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,720
so we were out at night like boozing
cause you could drink in Hungary.

701
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:22,590
No one gives a shit.
I was 17 with my best friend,

702
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,670
like running these streets.
I would never let my kid go at 17.

703
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,020
But they thought Hungary was the
way it was when they were, you know,

704
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,070
when they were living there during
communism, when it was safe.

705
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,720
But like not at all.

706
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,630
Here's what we're going to
panic the morning after this
one particularly notable

707
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:42,890
bomb was set off because it was so
powerful that, you know, we were,

708
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,810
we were let's say 15 minutes outside
of downtown Lima and, uh, in the house,

709
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,470
uh, that I was staying in with my
uncle and my cousins and aunt lived.

710
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,960
They had this a window that
was like an old school.

711
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,970
It was a like 150 pound try Amazon think.
So.

712
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,130
No. So it was like 150 pound
window that you had to,

713
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,460
you used to crank, right. And
then it would let go, Ooh.

714
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,290
It was open by a crank,
really heavy and enormous.

715
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,240
And in the middle of the night,

716
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,270
the bomb that went off was so big downtown
that that window blew open and then

717
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:28,070
just shattered everything. And it wasn't,
it was national news, international news.

718
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:28,940
Cause you know, the, the,

719
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,930
the Shining Path movement was growing
and I thought they were going to be like,

720
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:37,470
you're getting on a plane today, right.
It barely registers to my parents.

721
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:41,870
I was like, could you see it on
CNN? They're like, yeah, well,

722
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:46,370
you know how it goes. You're going to,
so, uh, you guys going to go do this?

723
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,490
You're going to go to the still going to
school today? I'm like, yeah, like, yeah,

724
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:54,140
worried about this shit at
all. And they're like, hey.
And my uncle was in media,

725
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,660
so they're like,
your uncle is a target because the,

726
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,650
the shiny path would target people with
influence, you know? So they were like,

727
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,980
he had body guards and I'm like,
wow, you're not worried about this

728
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,580
family didn't have any influence.
Yeah. Scumbags. Just Hungarian.

729
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,840
Totally everyday. What the fuck man?
Um, what's wrong with their parents?

730
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,840
So did you know that, uh, one of our guys,

731
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:20,410
this guy here who was a
also legendary on our show

732
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,550
before you have sex,

733
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,040
if you want to be haunted for two
or three hours, like you never been

734
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,480
in your life, you have access
to marijuana too. Good.

735
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:36,820
We'd listened to me.

736
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,400
True. We'd alone can get you
really hornier than normal,

737
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,970
but it's been an Andrew
will take about 10,

738
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,580
12 Benham girl before you want to have
your sexual fun with your partner or

739
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:49,990
whatever you do or masturbate.

740
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,630
So what do you think? First of all, about
10 or 12 minutes after looking at it,

741
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:55,290
that guy,
I never would have sex everywhere.

742
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,040
That guy was really disturbing. Yeah. Um,

743
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,660
so he's been featured on the
program a few times and he's back.

744
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,390
This is a, and we've an
update. Well he has a, uh,

745
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,480
I guess this is just a commentary that
he has on a topic that is important to

746
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:19,160
us. I've gone way up,
let's say for what reason?

747
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,710
It's Kinda nice now. See what, see
if you agree with what he says.

748
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:27,570
Are you sure it makes sense
for now?

749
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,000
What the Dennis Dennis questioning Dennis.
Okay.

750
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,301
For now,

751
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:38,080
what the dentist do you really wish that
all of us would have no more troubles

752
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,570
with their gums or teeth?
Because if you do,

753
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:43,750
then you don't make any money and you
don't have a life anymore and you wasted

754
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:47,020
your life. So if Christ comes
right now and says, well,

755
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:50,350
I'm going to heal everyone on this
planet, Amount Hill, their teeth,

756
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,600
then where does that
leave you man? Wow. Right.

757
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,370
I have more a serious
issues with my dentist.

758
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,410
Yeah, I mean that's
ridiculous. I mean, wait,

759
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:08,870
you're saying that he has a ridiculous
beef with something irrational?

760
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,610
It's irrational beat for, first of
all, if you're going to make a video,

761
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:16,200
put on a shirt, put on a
shirt, opposite philosophy.

762
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,790
He's never had shirts.
It,

763
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,460
it did look like he had some kind
of hair gel in his hair though.

764
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:26,870
But my dentist displays vacation photos
in the waiting area and I think that

765
00:49:29,851 --> 00:49:32,090
just breeds resentment. Um, you know,

766
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,730
you're sitting there and like there's
pictures of him like on a boat in the

767
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:39,360
Caribbean or wherever and it's like,
he's like, you're about to pay for that.

768
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,010
How many calories?
You didn't have a cavity,

769
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,710
but I just got the bill
on this fucking Bahamas.

770
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,230
My kids want to go paragliding.
God, Jesus Christ. Yeah.

771
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,130
Well this guy has got beef with everybody.
I love about find this guy.

772
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,250
People just cousins. He
sent them in. I Dunno. Yeah.

773
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,090
I think that my favorite thing though
is that he really thinks he cracked the

774
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:06,910
case with this. Where
he's like, he's like, Nah,

775
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,470
if you don't have cavities anymore,
where are you going to make your money?

776
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,810
And he really feels like he
solved the case. Totally.

777
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:17,790
My crop that he's like,
where's that?

778
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,980
And where does that leave you man?

779
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,180
Yeah, he's talked some shit.
He really ties and nailed you

780
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,470
figured out your whole scale. Yeah. He
just like a, like a homicide detective.

781
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,500
He's just a really solved
the case detective shall
Lacey's on it. So if you, uh,

782
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,060
how has it been by the way?
We haven't seen you in a while,

783
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:45,410
but how do you feel
being housed now as you,

784
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:50,070
for you went 10 years without a
permanent address? I love it. Ah,

785
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,571
yeah.

786
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:55,571
Cause Oschner loves to cook and it's
interesting the little things in life,

787
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,840
like having a sock drawer and
underwear drawer a really thrills us.

788
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:05,490
And the fact that,
uh,

789
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:10,050
we can buy family size shampoos and
everything was traveling, travel,

790
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,960
see everything was travel size forever.

791
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,030
And then we opened the fridge and
we're like, we own this mustard,

792
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,320
our third man. Uh, and it's,

793
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,620
it's nice to I,

794
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,460
this is my third time living in Los
Angeles and I used to not like Los Angeles

795
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,980
and now I love it because I'm
older now I'm married and uh,

796
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,880
now I can appreciate the,
uh,

797
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,850
fine fruits and vegetables that
are available in the mortgage. Um,

798
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,640
you know, I lived here 20 years
ago when I had the Sitcom.

799
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:50,810
I lived on top of the Hollywood
hills in this rockstar apartment,

800
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,830
all glass walls.
I view of all the lights of Los Angeles.

801
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,300
I was swimming in cash and then 20
years ago I lived in, I'm sorry,

802
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:04,050
10 years ago I lived in Korea
town and I was broke. And um,

803
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,860
now it's like the three bears
porridge is just right. Awesome.

804
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:14,390
Not broke. I'm not rich.
Just kind of uh, you know,

805
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,220
life enjoyable but seems like you're very
content and a good, a very good place.

806
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,660
Like, yeah. That's awesome.
Got to feel so displacing.

807
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,300
I that one thing I didn't like about
being on the road was that the constant

808
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:29,540
living out of the suitcase, like my Tom
and I were really hardcore road dogs.

809
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:32,660
There's a few years there where,
you know, you go out Wednesday,

810
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:36,260
you come home Monday and then you reset.
It was just living out of it.

811
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,950
We had to take Austin,
uh,

812
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,010
my wife traveled with me for eight of
the 10 years did I didn't live anywhere.

813
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,260
And I told her when we got together,
when she's from Holland and when we,

814
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:52,790
you know, the first year was a long
distance relationship and then I said,

815
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,860
if you want to be with me,
you have to reduce your life.

816
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:59,300
To one checked bag and to
carry owns and for a woman,

817
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:04,820
for a woman to reduce her life to like
four pairs of shoes. Very admirable.

818
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:09,740
She rolled with it and we had a
great adventure. Um, you know,

819
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:14,240
when we had time off, depending
where we were, we would go like,

820
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:19,130
and especially now with like airbnb
and Uber and you know, you can,

821
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,330
you can basically live anywhere
and have a nice life, you know,

822
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:28,260
four years in a row we went to Rome and
rented an apartment for a week or two

823
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,430
after I did like a couple months,
once of gigs in Europe,

824
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,780
did a month in Asia than we went
to Bali for a couple of weeks. Um,

825
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,480
when I was still drinking in the states.
When we had time off,

826
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:44,250
we would go to New Orleans. We loved
New Orleans, um, San Francisco,

827
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:48,930
depending where we were when we had time
off because we didn't live anywhere we

828
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,420
could live wherever we want it.

829
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,550
It's great cause I want to know
with all this traveling with,

830
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,410
I mean she was with you. How often did
she go to the show? A Lot, actually.

831
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,570
Yeah. Uh, I mean, that's probably why
I married her. Yeah. Uh, but yeah,

832
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:06,400
no, she, and she, that's
one of the things that I,

833
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:11,350
I love the most about her is she loved
not coming from the comedy world. Yeah.

834
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,150
Uh,

835
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,950
she instantly loved comedy and
loved hanging out with comedians.

836
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,320
It's so funny when you start hanging,
hanging out with comics,

837
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:22,380
it's more fun than watching them
do that. Totally. So like did that,

838
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:23,640
that was the best thing.
And then, you know,

839
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:26,730
doing festivals around the world and then,
uh,

840
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,890
having comedian friends and all these
different countries go to Australia and

841
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:35,100
then there's this group of
comedian friends to hang out with,

842
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:39,390
go to whatever country, and then
there's, you know, or go to Chicago,

843
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:43,500
good in New York and there's that new
group of friends every week to hang out

844
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:45,420
with. And, um,

845
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,840
I also liked the fact that she
was a heavy drinker. Did she,

846
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:54,540
cause she could hold her
liquor and, uh, and you know,

847
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:59,160
I was a heavy drinker forever.
And, uh, and yeah, you gotta
have a partner in crime,

848
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:01,530
right? You don't want her to be.
Yeah. So it was fun. We were,

849
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,830
we were partying and hanging
out with comedians and, uh,

850
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:09,810
when I busted my head open and
stopped drinking four years ago, she,

851
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,150
she dialed it back enormously. That's
great. You guys are a perfect match man.

852
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,020
Yeah. And it's funny because Tom and I
are the complete opposite of you guys.

853
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,620
Like when, if I would go on the
road with him like years ago,

854
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,520
I would never go to his show
and like pretty much vice first.

855
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,540
I don't think he ever

856
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,720
really now because we're so over it.

857
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,850
Well like I get anxiety being
in the room of a show period.

858
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,970
It doesn't even matter.
It's really actually so I don't like it.

859
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,030
I don't like being in the showroom know,
like when I'm not up there,

860
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,420
you guys would have like us that um,
you know,

861
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,750
when your partner sees you so often,
you know,

862
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,630
you gotta make your show lively
for them. Oh God, now no,

863
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,190
I'm the opposite in the room.
It's my Kryptonite

864
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:06,360
and he's watching.
There were years,

865
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:09,240
I would not let him watch me cause I,
it was like,

866
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,580
it gave me so much anxiety because I,
you know,

867
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:16,581
me as a human and then to see that
that would happen now would be is like,

868
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:18,870
you know,
because we know each other so well.

869
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:22,220
It's been so long and it's such like,
you know,

870
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,130
a deep rooted relationship

871
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,540
is if, uh, if we're in like a work
mode where another word, she goes, um,

872
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:32,230
I'm work shopping this thing, let me
know what you think. She might say like,

873
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,490
so watch this specifically or vice versa.
It'd be like, I'm doing this thing,

874
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,230
do you think this is this or that?

875
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,100
But then it's like we put
on like workbrain it's not,

876
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,480
and I don't feel like I'm watching my
wife feel like I'm watching. Disassociate.

877
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:49,630
Yeah. Disassociating on. And then
we're like, we're talking about a bit,

878
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,820
but just for like the joy of watching
it, I can't do it. I don't like,

879
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,290
I don't like watching, like if I
have a spot at the store tonight,

880
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:04,150
if I go there and they're like, I'll
find out, when am I up? Oh, you're up in,

881
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,150
you know, 20 minutes. Someone's
on stage right now. I'll pop in,

882
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:10,660
I'll start to watch them and after
a couple minutes I'm just like,

883
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,240
I got to get out of the room
so I have to leave the room.

884
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:18,290
I, I, it's funny, I, I uh, I like
standing there watching it. I,

885
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:22,040
I still eyes love watching comedy.
I like sometimes I'll,

886
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:27,100
I'll get there early when I'm at the
comedy store and I like when like somebody

887
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:33,090
is destroying the room before where
you can say something and then it's uh,

888
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,910
I'll give you an example.
Like the, at the,

889
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:40,130
I go to New York once or twice a year
just to do sets at the comedy cellar.

890
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:45,540
I love it.
And last summer I went to New York and um,

891
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,070
I had to go on after Amy Schumer.
And so Amy Schumer,

892
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,080
I had to follow her like three times that
week. And you know, she's from New York,

893
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:58,010
she's just hometown hero.
Everyone loves her. She's,

894
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:01,640
she's destroying the place.
And she told the story about her father.

895
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,450
She said he kind of an asshole,
he's got ms or whatever.

896
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:09,740
But she's just for her father and she
loves him and she's been paying somebody

897
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:12,320
to come and Jack him off.
Oh God.

898
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:17,230
And so this was her
closer and uh, and, and,

899
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:21,200
and, and she absolutely destroyed the
place. So like you got the, you know,

900
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:22,580
there's the normal anxiety,

901
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:25,880
nervousness as comedian when you're
about to go on stage and you're,

902
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:27,800
you're in your mind about
what you want to talk about.

903
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,240
And then when somebody is on before you
and they're absolutely ripping the place

904
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:34,370
to shreds and they're being adored,

905
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,140
and then that adds even an extra
layer of intensity to your, yeah.

906
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,003
Anxiety.

907
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:45,490
And so I guess for me it just
came to me the first night,

908
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,660
I'm like,
oh my God,

909
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:52,330
she's absolutely just can't believe she's
talking about her dad like this. Yeah.

910
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,300
It just came to me like moments
before I walked on stage.

911
00:58:56,301 --> 00:59:01,140
I walked out there and I just
acted very kind of shy and,

912
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,230
and sheepish. Hi everybody. Um,

913
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,800
please forgive me. I'm a little nervous
tonight. This, this isn't my normal job.

914
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:13,030
My normal job as I jack off,
Amy Schumer's fine.

915
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,870
I'm not used to working under
these bright lights. And, uh,

916
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,960
normally I worked to candle
light with some soft Sinatra,

917
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,590
the backgrounds and like, it
just, it's like, it's, yeah,

918
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:30,730
it's like surfing, you know, you jumping
on someone else's wave. Totally. Um,

919
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:35,810
no, but you know why you,
you do that though, because
you're a better comedian. Ah,

920
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,660
actually that's the only
time I'll tell you this,

921
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:42,620
the only time I do feel inclined
to like, Oh, pay attention,

922
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:47,090
pay attention is if someone is ripping
the room, perform. Yeah, that is,

923
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,020
that will make me, but I'm doing
that not for my own curiosity.

924
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:55,420
I'm doing that to be able to be effective
and know what's going on. You know,

925
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,880
watched the person before me
just so like, Oh, if they, oh,

926
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,310
they do this topic or
this topic or you know,

927
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:05,360
if you ever thought about with all the
touring and all the years you've been

928
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:06,230
doing it,
do you ever,

929
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,670
have you ever thought about how many hours
you've probably written or no? Uh, no.

930
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,960
Uh, well, I mean I've put out a,
I just came out with a new album,

931
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:19,970
all hail laughter and
that's my fourth album. Um,

932
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,000
how much unreleased stuff?
Yeah, I have no idea.

933
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:26,810
I mean I videos and videos of
things from the past. I don't know,

934
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,310
it's just amazing to me how long
I've been doing comedy and uh,

935
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,750
it's, I that I can't sell more
tickets in certain places.

936
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,010
I got to a, I'm in Sacramento
next week. I be doing that.

937
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,360
The punchlines is such a great room.
Great Room. I love Sacramento and,

938
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,040
and Lady Bird was one of my
favorite movies of the year.

939
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:49,760
I thought Greta Gerwig should've
won the, the, the best act.

940
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,000
And I loved the fact that the
film took place in Sacramento.

941
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:55,850
It's this girl coming of age story.
Anyway,

942
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,760
I get this a email yesterday.

943
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:04,110
I'm just saying that a minimal
tickets have been sold and it's like,

944
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:07,870
when does this anxiety leave
you as a performer? Yeah.

945
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,830
How much do you have to do in your life
and career? Get where it's like, you know,

946
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,050
I shouldn't have to worry about, I
know a room like that. So what though?

947
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:20,030
But the weird thing is they're really,

948
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,710
everybody will have a theory and that
nobody is 100% right because there is no

949
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:29,120
formula. If we all knew the formula for
sure and everyone would just be like, oh,

950
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:33,360
just do this. But that's the thing. It's
like you just don't know. I mean some,

951
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,360
I mean sometimes it's a something online,

952
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:40,220
like people started selling tickets off
of viral videos now, you know. Oh yeah.

953
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,640
I mean you can just do something
that just blows up online.

954
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,740
All of a sudden that sells tickets.
Sometimes it's more traditional, it's TV,

955
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,740
it's movie or it's a special that
really resonates with an audience.

956
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:56,690
But even that you just don't
know it. There's no formula.
That's the most, I dunno,

957
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:00,680
frustrating part. But that's the part
that if there was an answer, you know,

958
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,730
it's like trying to, how do you
make a a movie be a blockbuster hit?

959
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:07,360
And they like, well, you know,
it's like, I dunno. It's,

960
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:11,060
I guess you'd think about things
the way you are in your life.

961
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,410
Like my eye,

962
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:18,020
there are certain comedians I
love and like I will go see them.

963
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,100
Uh, I'm fans of certain
people. I love Van Morrison.

964
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,920
Van Morrison played at
the Wiltern last week.

965
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,740
I W I saw him once before in New
York years ago. And he's older. Yeah.

966
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:35,220
And, uh, you know, I went
and I, and I'm a fan. I,

967
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:39,150
it's like I can appreciate just being
in the same room with the guy because I

968
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:43,290
love him so much, but only because
I'm a huge fan of Van Morrison.

969
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,250
I could pick out the
five songs that I knew.

970
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,870
I think anyone else who went to that
show would have thought, oh my God,

971
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:56,540
I can't believe he didn't do,
have I told you lately, or x,

972
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,740
y I wish she'd done more hits
or whatever, you know? Um, I,

973
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:03,840
it's, I don't know. It's,

974
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,950
I guess people who knows what I'm
trying to, no, I dunno. I mean,

975
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:12,690
I know what you're trying to say. If you
love somebody, you would support them.

976
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,050
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.
Guests. No, it's true. It's true.

977
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,900
It comes from having a devotion to

978
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,950
being real. That's what a fan.
But I mean, there's like, there's,

979
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:29,010
there's some cities like San
Francisco and Chicago and Atlanta.

980
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,240
What's your best city?
Ah, I love San Francisco.

981
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:38,730
The punchline. I like Minneapolis.
Acme. That's great. Uh,

982
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:42,070
the Atlanta punchline had
been playing for years. Um,

983
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,440
Chicago xannies you know,
there's, there's, there's,

984
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,550
there's a lot of them
that I love. Yeah. Uh,

985
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:52,600
the Sydney comedy store in Australia is
one of my favorites and they're good to

986
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:53,434
you.

987
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:58,930
I was there last year and it had been
a few years since I had been there.

988
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:01,480
But yeah,
I've played there a lot through the years.

989
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,050
One of my favorite rooms in the world.
If you played there. Uh, I did. Uh,

990
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:08,860
I did a guest set there when I was,
I was in town for

991
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:13,720
festival a few years back and I
got to do like a guest sat there,

992
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,700
which was really fun. That
was it. That's the most,

993
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,280
I love Australian audiences and Sydney's
one of my favorite cities in the world.

994
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,350
I just had to cancel for
someone's going to do

995
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:27,430
ne next month and then let you cancel
because I booked that, that movie.

996
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,800
So it's like a good reason
to have the cancel. Yeah.

997
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,600
But it's fucking my second cancellation

998
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,160
or a, well, maybe when you go
back you'll do the Enmore theater.

999
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,240
That's what I was booked to the more,
it was amazing. I was booked to do it.

1000
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:46,070
We were, we were in that part
of town. New Town is like the,

1001
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:50,870
it's the cool gay, artsy
area. Like if you were a,

1002
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:53,980
an artist or a musician,
I'm just bomb because here's what

1003
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:57,060
now I want to do.
I want to rebook Australia,

1004
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:02,130
but I cannot book something
again and cancel. Right.

1005
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:07,140
But I don't know what like, so I want
to book something without a lot of,

1006
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:11,280
uh, a heads up. In other
words, I want to be like,

1007
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,060
hey man, can we try to book Australia
for like eight weeks from now?

1008
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,070
So that I know that I can definitely

1009
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,900
do it right. But I don't know if
they'll go for that. It's pretty,

1010
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:26,650
I Melbourne of course, uh,
is amazing. Awesome. Yeah.

1011
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,820
Brisbane Perth. Yeah. Love these poets
supposed to do. I got to New Zealand,

1012
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,600
the New Zealand comedy
festival haven't been, um,

1013
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,770
that's god that was one of the best
months. Yeah. I refuse to go. Really?

1014
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,280
No, I actually asked to go and, uh,

1015
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:47,080
the promoters were like, ah,
we don't think you should
add a New Zealand to this.

1016
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,430
And I was like, why? And they're like,

1017
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:52,660
because it's not that big of a market
and you're not that big of a name.

1018
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:55,880
And I was like, all right. I just
thought it'd be really, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,420
So I was like, okay, so I'll
just leave it as it. I mean,

1020
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:02,380
there was there talking about it like,
I, after all you've done, they were like,

1021
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:06,560
oh yeah. They said, no, I know
when I tried to add new field,

1022
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,200
what does the performer have to do?
It's a funny, Tom and I talk about that.

1023
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:15,640
Like in our business, you're never
ever enough on the food chain,

1024
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:20,890
no matter how successful you are, you're
always a piece of shit. We're saying.

1025
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:26,140
We were saying that like, Bill start
saying things to you, like they'll go, uh,

1026
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:26,950
and then,
uh,

1027
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:30,610
this is the offer you're going to get
and somebody in your position should be

1028
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:34,480
pretty happy with that
off. Wow. Wow. Oh yeah.

1029
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,820
That was what we were talking
about when you were going,

1030
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,920
I got a message about my,

1031
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,770
my ticket sales for next
week and Sacramento.

1032
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:48,400
Fuck, do I have to worry? Yeah. And
by the way, what point in your life,

1033
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,650
and it's not, it's not
only that, the real,

1034
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:55,100
the real job of a real
club is that they are,

1035
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:59,410
suppose you're supposed to deliver the
thing on stage and like you do what you

1036
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:02,680
can and your, your podcast or you
post that you're coming somewhere,

1037
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,870
but they are your promoter.
That's the job they,

1038
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,410
and a lot of clubs don't
look at it like that. Now.

1039
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:15,130
It's not your job you're doing is
like extra as far as promoting,

1040
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,880
but they're supposed to promote your show
and they're supposed to be creative in

1041
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:23,260
ways to get people to come to that show,
you know? And so when they're like, yeah,

1042
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:26,410
you didn't sell tickets, I feel I'd be
like, now you didn't sell tickets, right,

1043
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,750
because you were supposed to let p,
what did you do?

1044
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,860
You send out an email once or something,
right?

1045
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,750
Why don't you be a little more proactive
about it and then they tell you, oh,

1046
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:38,890
we got to back out this amount from your
pay because it costs me like five grand

1047
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:42,130
and advertising. And you're like,
what did you know that you can ask?

1048
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,740
I have five grand.
I didn't see any bus posters.

1049
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,380
You can legally ask for receipts on that.
I would like to,

1050
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,040
whenever whenever you do a build Burgo,

1051
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,630
if they do like deductions, they'll
say, you know, advertising this,

1052
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:04,150
you could be like,
I need to see the receipt receipt or,

1053
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,010
or the ubiquitous radio spots
where they're like, oh, we
spent thousands on radio.

1054
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:11,110
You're like, okay, that's really
hard to trace. Like she'd be like,

1055
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:15,740
why would you do that? You know
who's listening? Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1056
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:16,250
my favorite

1057
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,570
is always, oh, you, you just
missed your bonus by 11 people.

1058
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,850
Yeah. You sell a hundred tickets,
you're going to get the bonus.

1059
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:30,500
And we only sold 89 fucking counting.
And I had one

1060
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,530
say more. I did a weekend a few
years ago at a club that held, um,

1061
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:37,950
I think the club,
the club,

1062
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:43,140
let's say three 50 and I had a bonus
that would kick in regardless if it were

1063
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:48,540
free or paid tickets.
And I had paid tickets,

1064
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,360
bonus would kick in at 300 capacity.

1065
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:54,210
So if as long as we're throwing people
in the room, I would get the bonus.

1066
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:59,250
And I had like between two 85 and
two 95 at every show, but paid. Oh,

1067
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:02,780
that's great. And they
didn't give me wow. Anyhow.

1068
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:06,900
And then I called, that's the business.
What kind of fucking deal is that?

1069
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,110
I sold tickets, hard
tickets. Right. And then,

1070
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,230
but I didn't hit that magic number and
they're like, we'll get them next time.

1071
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:17,030
Next time. Yeah, no, I do the other
club next time as well. How about

1072
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,670
exactly? I love it. He's like,

1073
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:24,250
like some of these club owners driving
a brand new Mercedes Benz every year and

1074
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:27,590
it's like, wow. Yeah.
Just missed the bonus.

1075
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:31,210
There was a place in town here where
the guy would, they don't pay for,

1076
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,000
they don't pay you for spots and he would
pull up people like we can't pay for a

1077
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:37,970
spot to pull up in like a
new Lexus. Yeah, you can't,

1078
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,740
you can't dish everybody
15 bucks for the set.

1079
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:45,260
And he was my favorite story in the
world. Chad Daniels, who's Hilarious,

1080
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:48,010
who your friends are. You guys
did that documentary together. Uh,

1081
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:52,760
I need you to kill. So he did some
club, I won't say where. And the guy,

1082
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:57,110
the owner of the club pays you a different
rate contingent upon what time of

1083
01:09:57,111 --> 01:10:00,020
year you do the clubs.
So in the summer,

1084
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:04,250
let's say he'll pay you 1500
but in the winter it's $2,000.

1085
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:09,850
And so Chad goes in the summertime and
he's working out new material and the

1086
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:14,090
club owner is like upset with that
because you know, Chad's working it out.

1087
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:17,900
So it's not like kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill. And he
knows a child's capable of it.

1088
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,790
He's a really funny comedian. And so the
owner is like, hey man, what the hell?

1089
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:26,330
Like you came and you did all this
new stuff, like you're not killing.

1090
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,210
You know what the fuck?
And he goes, well, he goes,

1091
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:32,760
I'm doing my Somerset to go.
He summary,

1092
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,790
he stuck with doing this
new set that wasn't killing.

1093
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,560
That's just just to tell that
guy I'm doing my Somerset.

1094
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:47,250
I don't know him, but now I
love it. That's fantastic.
Yeah. Somerset, I'm still,

1095
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,770
the guy's like, dude, what the
fuck? He's like, well, you know,

1096
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:55,910
I'm giving you what you pay
for in Somerset. I mean,
have you ever heard of that?

1097
01:10:55,911 --> 01:11:00,640
I didn't know that. The club, I
never, I know. Yeah, I know that like,

1098
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:05,240
I know clubs, especially old
mark. Is that a room in Texas?

1099
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,570
No, I'll tell you. I'll tell you
after the shades in North America,

1100
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,640
cold market clubs especially,

1101
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,040
you know your mom and pop
clubs midway will, they're

1102
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,460
always packed in the winter because
people sure pack up, fill it up. Yeah.

1103
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:21,750
And then clubs in like Texas and
Florida in the summer because of the air

1104
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:25,950
conditioning. Yeah. Therefore too. It's
interesting. Yeah. So, but like those,

1105
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:29,490
those cold places in the, if you sell
tickets there in the summer, they're like,

1106
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:30,360
all right,
you're legit.

1107
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:35,250
But they expect to have more empty seats
in the summer and that the idea that

1108
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:39,370
they'd be like, and that means we're
not going to pay you as much is yeah,

1109
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:43,890
it's the business where
it's the shittiest man. Um,

1110
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,110
do you think this lady is touched or no?

1111
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:54,770
Seven oh 4:30 PM.

1112
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:58,730
I'm just wondering what the
heck is then our water supply.

1113
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:03,260
What the heck is going on?
Why? I've done the Metallica.

1114
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:07,730
I thought that create a
rainbow effect in a sprinkler.

1115
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:09,080
She thinks there's a government,

1116
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:10,983
Huh?

1117
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,350
Get out of our ground.

1118
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:19,530
That allowed rule type of effect to
happen like prisons done and our moon

1119
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:22,110
anymore.
Everywhere we look,

1120
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,860
the visible that crumb is rainbow.

1121
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,830
That cannot be natural.
It wasn't.

1122
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,300
Well, you know when you're offended by
your beauty, you know, because I agree.

1123
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:36,740
Baby checkout. So I agree. You know,
she lives in a good neighborhood.

1124
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:41,450
When you can hear the sirens
in the background and the
bullet holes in the fence,

1125
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,343
that's a nice touch.

1126
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:47,670
But now it happened and now we
have the naked have got there.

1127
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:52,830
What the Hell is going on?
What is oozing out of our,

1128
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,430
we as a nation need to appreciate a
rainbow baby on a small level. Well,

1129
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,620
for people who aren't watching the show,

1130
01:12:59,621 --> 01:13:03,240
so it's a sprinkler and it's
created a natural rainbow. Yeah.

1131
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,300
And she's convinced that the government
has poisoned her water supply. Water,

1132
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:09,760
the light colors. Yeah. She really,

1133
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,800
she really broke through
that conspiracy though.

1134
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,990
Can, does that leave you man? Huh?

1135
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:20,120
I think to,
to quote Dr drew when he came on our show,

1136
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,740
there is a huge problem with
it. Right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1137
01:13:24,741 --> 01:13:27,530
I really are fucked.
That's pretty bad.

1138
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:33,500
I feel like a fifth grader knows
that, you know, light through water.

1139
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,650
Of course. Yeah. They teach
you that stuff. Clouds,

1140
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:41,260
rain rainbows. Um, Tom,

1141
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:46,700
they uh, do you have dates listed
on your site? I do, yeah, of course.

1142
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:50,910
Um, let's, uh, let's go through
because this, we are doing, um,

1143
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,820
well that's hardcore pornography.
We have, uh, not on my site.

1144
01:13:55,910 --> 01:14:00,800
No, no, no. Sometime around
so you can see her car. I, um,

1145
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:05,930
I have, uh, he loves us. Porn. Thanks. Or
plugging my, uh, dates I'm going to be on,

1146
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:10,140
this is not happening. March 16th.
Oh, a fun. That's great. Yeah.

1147
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,500
This, this episode will drop in a few
weeks, so that's what I'm kind of, Oh,

1148
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,840
so you might have just missed

1149
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:22,550
Thomas Thomas Sacramento or
has this is not happening?

1150
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:29,470
Malaria. You might see him. Well,
no, but it's just a, you know,

1151
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,133
it's true.

1152
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,510
Um,
when's your Sacramento?

1153
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,680
It's march 15 through 17. He's at
the punchline. Maybe we can wait.

1154
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:43,230
We can swap in episode. Do this, trade out
the other one. It doesn't matter. Right.

1155
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:47,640
Try it. Try it out. Uh, then
he's going to, Holy Shit.
He's going to be in Thailand,

1156
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:52,650
Vietnam, the Philippines. Jesus
Hong Kong, uh, later in Austin,

1157
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,840

like Tahoe. He's doing, uh, oh,

1158
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:01,230
the Great Tacoma Club. We've both done
that and enjoyed that. It's a great room.

1159
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,060
Spokane. Yep. I haven't done spoken. I've
done that. It's great. I've done lol.

1160
01:15:06,061 --> 01:15:10,200
Looks like you're doing an lol and
San Antonio, the La Jolla store.

1161
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,740
Xannies in Chicago. You're doing
poly, you're going to go to

1162
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,130
Paris. What's that? Have you
done that before? Actually,

1163
01:15:17,131 --> 01:15:21,600
I was in Paris in January at this. I,
I've, I've, I've played in Paris a lot.

1164
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:26,520
Uh, but there's this theater
that I played in January and uh,

1165
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,130
theater la over. Ah, oh.

1166
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:34,340
And I'm booked back there October 15th
and I am going to fill my next hour

1167
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:39,000
special
on October 15th.

1168
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:44,110
So if there's any listeners who is
looking for a reason to go to Paris,

1169
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,210
that you should come to my,
my,

1170
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:52,590
our special dude. Now we're going
to be awesome. When you do Paris,

1171
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,290
is it mostly ex pats? I mean it's
obviously, no, actually this,

1172
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,000
when I was there in January,
it was,

1173
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,150
it was mostly French
people watch spoke English.

1174
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:05,360
So for my hour special,
I need to, uh, I need,

1175
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:10,220
I need to get some more
English speaking people there,

1176
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:14,070
but, and it's a phenomenal room.
I have a long history with Paris.

1177
01:16:14,071 --> 01:16:17,500
My first love of my adult life.
Uh,

1178
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:21,660
I lived with a Parisian woman in
San Francisco for seven years,

1179
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:26,820
not to Lee. We're still good friends. And
the very first time I went to Paris, uh,

1180
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:31,440
some guys tried to rob me
and I was maced and really,

1181
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:34,110
ah,
I've got some great stories.

1182
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:39,100
I almost drowned in Thailand
on this French resort region.

1183
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:44,070
Audiences get all the nuances of your,
like if they also like stories and they,

1184
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:49,500
they really love theater. So
you'll like, you'll never,

1185
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,910
you would never get a heckler
in pay in France, right.

1186
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:56,100
Because the audience is just
conditioned to watch the show,

1187
01:16:56,101 --> 01:17:01,020
respect the performer on
stage. But uh, yeah. But uh,

1188
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:06,300
you know, so I've got my, you know,
best stories traveling the world.

1189
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:10,280
I haven't done a special in like
five years. Think so do this is,

1190
01:17:10,281 --> 01:17:14,120
it's all my anxiety. I cannot
believe you're going to do
it in Paris. Yeah. Wild.

1191
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,510
What size venue is the,
is this theater?

1192
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:21,320
It's holds three 50. Perfect.
Wonderful. When I was there in January,

1193
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:24,540
I sold 240 tickets.
It's amazing.

1194
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:29,570
I can sell more tickets in Paris than I
can in some clubs in the United States,

1195
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:37,880
international comedian. Like you're
kind of a trailblazer that way.

1196
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:41,340
So this is fantastic. It's great. And I,

1197
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,800
thanks Christina. And I, uh,
you know, I, I love Paris.

1198
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:50,780
I got great stories and
observations and a pair earth.

1199
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,140
It's magic and eat a lot while
you're there, man. There's this,

1200
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,120
I this last summer when I was there,

1201
01:17:56,121 --> 01:18:01,121
I discovered this a Archna googled best
patisserie is there's this place called

1202
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,910
storer, s, t, O, h, r,

1203
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:12,740
e, r. And uh, I followed them
on Instagram. It's the rate,

1204
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,300
it's the number one rated patisserie in,
in Paris.

1205
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:21,520
It's on this street
called roof mount to Goya.

1206
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,050
And this street is,

1207
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,380
it's got bread shops and
cheese shops and it's,

1208
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:31,220
it's such an amazing food street,

1209
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,850
but this patisserie places the
number one rated patisserie.

1210
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,090
And when I go to Paris now I'll
take the metro straight there.

1211
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:45,840
And like they, they, there's these
custard tarts with like raspberries and,

1212
01:18:45,841 --> 01:18:50,000
Oh man, I'm trying to be carpet on
top of it. Well that's the thing,

1213
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:53,150
like when I was there, it's,
you know, I'm trying to be,

1214
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:57,080
I left breadcrumbs all
over the city. The, these,

1215
01:18:57,081 --> 01:19:00,770
these baguettes are only like a
dollar 20 and these, you know,

1216
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:05,760
you just just walk around nibbling
on bread and then you like,

1217
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:11,380
I got my little patisserie pastries in
a box for done for whenever I'm ready to

1218
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,153
sit down,

1219
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,620
easily old me out out.
I would look like, uh,

1220
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:21,140
what's that guy that Burt looks
like Gerard dip? I'll do, I'll,

1221
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:26,440
there's a, there's a fee as a
is a food channel show. Yeah.

1222
01:19:26,441 --> 01:19:29,460
Where it's, I saw it when I was in
Europe, so I don't know if it's, if it's,

1223
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:31,900
I thought it was the food channel,
but it's,

1224
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,730
he's basically eating his way through
Europe. Dude, he's been, he no badness.

1225
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:41,200
You see like a couple of years ago
there was a big story where he was on a

1226
01:19:41,201 --> 01:19:42,610
flight and he pissed in the,

1227
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,240
I'm in the aisle aisle of the plane
and they're like, what the fuck man?

1228
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,010
He's like, he's like, he's well over
three bills now. And they're like,

1229
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,290
you know what kind of
behaviors? And he's like, well,

1230
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:55,640
I drink several bottles of wine every day.

1231
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:00,340
So that's a contributes to him gaining
that much weight. And also he's just like,

1232
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:01,151
so of my behaviors,

1233
01:20:01,151 --> 01:20:05,660
just kind of erratic because I'm drunk
apparently in the aisle I'm drinking

1234
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,130
constantly.
He like he out with like

1235
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,870
a, with lock cores. He's,
he's got a, I heard about,

1236
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,730
he's got a regiment of
drinking but he's the on this,

1237
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,820
he's on this food show and this friend
who he travels with like explains to him

1238
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:24,270
and he's just like stuffing his face with
everything and like everything is like

1239
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:28,350
fried in duck fat course.
It's a so good,

1240
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,200
he knows what's up dude.
But in moderation,

1241
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,920
I mean they don't have to eat the whole
God damn a bowl at duck fat and you just

1242
01:20:34,921 --> 01:20:39,520
rally even a dog Turd with tastes
good Friday duck [inaudible] Gerard.

1243
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,590
Oh Wow. When you go, that guy
doesn't want to pay his taxes.

1244
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,410
When you pull it up over the belly button,

1245
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:52,380
that's when you're committed to
the lifestyle. You know, you don't,

1246
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:56,340
you don't sit below the gut
lining. Yeah. You're like, this is,

1247
01:20:56,341 --> 01:21:00,390
that's like when you're a kid and
you're drawing pictures of people. Yeah.

1248
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,070
That's what that is. Andy Cigarette. Wow.

1249
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:09,330
Interesting. Tom. I think we can
trace Burdis fat to that time.

1250
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:14,220
We put dried [inaudible] picture up naked.
And then one of us was,

1251
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:15,054
I don't remember,

1252
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:23,040
but he, um, yeah, he's a where's the,

1253
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:26,460
what was that movie James in a film
and it was nude in a film and we were

1254
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:30,060
watching it and then we brought it up on
the show and we were like, God, that guy,

1255
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:32,640
look at that belly. It looks like
Burt's belly. I think that's how this,

1256
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,550
you're right. It kind of started
rolling like burping. It's this one.

1257
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,800
So he's totally naked here,
but it's, it's the shit,

1258
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,880
this is that movie where he's playing.
Um,

1259
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:50,210
it's basically takes the story of the
whatever the head of the International

1260
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:54,960
Monetary Fund was member of the, Oh
yeah. What was that guy's name? K.

1261
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,640
They had some Strauss.
Kahn,

1262
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:04,200
French dicks. Dominique Strauss
Kahn. Yeah. Oh Shit. Oh.

1263
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:09,030
And he played him in a movie. Well,
he played a character that was like,

1264
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:13,490
like him, but they mimic the
story, you know, and um, yeah,

1265
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:18,510
that, that guy, that was god,
man, that is drink booze, man.

1266
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:23,070
It's just hard, hard booth.
Um, Shit. Tom Rhodes.

1267
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,610
Dot Net and that's r h o d e s.

1268
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:28,890
Dot net slash tour.

1269
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:33,720
Try it out and um, you know, have
all that information about, uh,

1270
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:38,760
my pair of special on the website.
Great. Next few months. So exotic,

1271
01:22:38,761 --> 01:22:41,880
top be awesome and exotic.
I love it.

1272
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,710
It's so cool. Let me just check
here. The future of Comedians,

1273
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:51,090
that's what eventually we're all going
to be world tours. You know what?

1274
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,940
I can do it now and there's, there's
great comedy fans all over the world.

1275
01:22:53,941 --> 01:22:57,030
You know, I could, I'm
just lazy and you know,

1276
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,130
I'm gonna have two small people
to look after. Maybe I don't.

1277
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:03,120
Maybe in a few years. Oh, you'll
be able to bring them with you.

1278
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,130
Oh,
says the person

1279
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,960
without a toddler. Right. Some people
do. They're very brave. But Tom and I,

1280
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,520
it's just not in our constitution.

1281
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:15,190
Like we've traveled with Ellis
twice now on an airplane.

1282
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:19,260
I think I had more anxiety,
you know, and it's, it's just,

1283
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,290
it's makes me so anxious and
talk to you having a home base,

1284
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,330
having just leave him home for now.

1285
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,530
Maybe when I had asked
you that I have a child,

1286
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,550
maybe way maybe my world travels will.
Um,

1287
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,590
well no, you can, you can tour with your
child. Definitely like, uh, Ali Wong,

1288
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,440
our good friend brought her
daughter with her, you know,

1289
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:45,730
the first couple of years of her life.
So I think it's a really up to the parent,

1290
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:48,850
you know, it's like what you're
comfortable with. And I was trained them.

1291
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:49,990
Allie loves it.

1292
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:52,900
She know she has helped that she brings
like her mom I think or whenever.

1293
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:57,660
But anyway, uh, yeah, you can just
start doing it early. The, the,

1294
01:23:57,661 --> 01:24:02,100
the mom with the young child
crying and everybody, you know,

1295
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:06,110
looking when they look,
they look, they look, uh,

1296
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,780
but if you do it early,
like you fly,

1297
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:10,210
like when that kid's like
two or three months old,

1298
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,720
I feel like that's the way to do that.
But we did not do that. No, no we did not.

1299
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:16,900
We are chicken shits. All right.
We got your chicken one more time

1300
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,433
please.

1301
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:27,640
Thank you. That was really good.
Really good. Thank you for coming.

1302
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:33,050
[inaudible] was really fun and
that's it. We'll see you guys. Uh,

1303
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:37,290

of my favorite. Like, fuck boy,

1304

1305
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,790
It's the PC version of faggot.

1306
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:02,070
I like, fuck boy. If I can't say Faggot,
I'm going to say, fuck boy. Fuck, fuck.

1307
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,130
Sounds like you're already doing it.

1308
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:11,050
Fuck boy, boy, faggot.

1309
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:16,740

1312
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,550
Sounds like you're already doing it.
You're already doing like,

1313
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,393
you're already doing it.

1314
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:31,970
Good.
