the grid, which is kind of weird to do.

101
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:43,580
I know on a Pi Cap, but I've found people
who like live in crazy parts of Alaska.

Yes. I like to find out what that's

00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:52,730

very curious about, yeah. It's so cool.

104
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,960
It's such a fantasy of mine.

105
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,780
That's it. It's, I think everybody to
a degree has that fantasy. Even not,

00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,160
they don't do have it all the time,

107
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,640
but there's some parts of
you at some point that go,

108
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,390
let me get away from all of this.
And what's that like to dip it? Also,

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,470
it's really philosophical as far
as far as esophageal heartless.

110
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:15,471
Offical what's the point of being
so involved with this madness?

111
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,670
The Society's consumer? Yeah.
It's all consumerism and
America. It's all nonsense.

112
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,730
Donald Trump is going to be the president.
It's all going downhill.

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,690
I want to thank, does the

Christina.

143
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,990
Oh my God.
That's really out of line.

144
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,580
When did you do that? When you're off?
What's that? That's an that guy's video.

145
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,300
You were like, no, I think it was.

146
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,560
It was a different thing. So really,
um, so we're back for a second time.

147
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,080
We should address that now. Um, people
probably don't know what that means.

148
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,410
What that means is we actually did this
podcast yesterday front to back over 90.

149
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:31,610
We always wipe front to back. Oh,
it's front to back over 90 minutes.

150
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,210
The first time ever with the Monitor.
First Time in the studio.

151
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,600
And one of the things we did
when we set up the studios,

152
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:41,450
we've got new microphone.
Yup.

153
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,920
And did I do a microphone
test? A microphone one? Yes.

154
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,990
That I do a microphone test. I'm
microphone to know. And what happened.

155
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,970
I wonder why that is.
Microphone too was, but

156
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,900
it's interesting now if you would ask
a psychologist why you didn't test my

157
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,783
microphone

158
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,600
July.
That's what I would say.

159
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,990
You didn't want me to have a
voice and that's ridiculous.

160
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,810
I definitely wanted you to have a voice.
It just,

161
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:12,330
it was the absolute biggest bummer.
I mean,

162
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,430
the worst thing is to
do work for no fucking

163
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,410
yes. I've done it on that Steve, Bro,

164
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,010
like three times where I've recorded the
entire episode and then gone back and

165
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:26,640
found that either sound studio had
fucked me. The mikes weren't working.

166
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:31,080
I've screwed up at least three or
four episodes, so I totally get it.

167
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,780
And we're right.
Yeah,

168
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,210
no,
I mean horrible.

169
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,870
Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Anyways,
we're back. It's going to be better.

170
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:41,770
We're getting so much better now.
That's like about our file better.

171
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,380
Um,
as we discussed yesterday,

172
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:49,360
one of the things that I really like
about this opening clip is that it brings

173
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:53,950
me back to childhood.
This is clearly sibling on sibling fart.

174
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,850
Um, it takes me back to memories
of farting on my sister. Right.

175
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,150
Sometimes they got me with their farts,
you know, but I don't believe that.

176
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,260
I don't think either of them had the same
kind of heat they had. I mean, there's,

177
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,690
you know, they were healthier, rancid,

178
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:11,210
but sometimes real healthy
eaters of real nasty farts too.

179
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,230
They definitely farted.
They forward it to mean game.

180
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,240
I think Maria would have worst ones.

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,940
He for sure files flat files.
She, yeah, she definitely,

182
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,330
oh my God, you guys are so disgusting.
Definitely drop some cars. Oh my God.

183
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,340
Oh my God. Seriously. Um,

184
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,550
so god, Oh my God. This girl though,
it's perfect. I mean, yeah, she sets,

185
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,100
I just respect it so much.
She says the trap,

186
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,170
she Bates him where she just goes,
hey ty. And he's like, what's up?

187
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,060
Yeah. And she rips a real, a real
daddy farther [inaudible] yeah.

188
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,790
And the smell. So it's hard to
get the sound down. The smell.

189
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,780
You understand that it had two lives,
right?

190
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,610
There was the initial part and then
there was that kind of backdraft. Yeah.

191
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:03,280
If you will like a fire. I mean, listen to
this whole fart. It's pretty crazy. Sure.

192
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,890
Really.
It really is something they tie.

193
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,770
I'll get his face as

194
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,050
he said the time.
No.

195
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,690
Yeah.
Okay.

196
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,770
They're so cute. They're cute. Uh, this,
this really went viral, this video.

197
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,200
Of course. It's perfect.
It's perfect. Perfect.

198
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,860
When I first saw this video is
probably a little over a week ago. Um,

199
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,310
I I saw with a few thousand views,
it was sent to us and I was like, oh,

200
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,860
that's cool.
It's a fart video and it's got,

201
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,630
well it's almost got 4 million views now.
Amaze, I mean just shows you that we're,

202
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,620
we're onto something with this first time
around the sun thing. Yeah, of course.

203
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:06,060
Your mom's house has always been on the
cutting edge and people are like, oh,

204
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:09,130
you know, you guys are shows
just about farts and no, no.

205
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,590
God who found Thursday lane? Yeah.
Your mom's house. Chaos river. Yeah.

206
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:18,150
Your mom's house. Yup. Peter
Kane. Your mom's house. Yup.

207
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,380
We break major stars on
their show. Yup. Okay.

208
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,070
You think it's America's got talent? No,
it's your mom's house. Your mom's house.

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,330
Linkedin is helpful.
Yeah.

210
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,910
Linkedin is helpful. Breakdown is
helpful or no? Ghana's helpful.

211
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,230
Nobody really uses linkedin. I don't
need the hell. I don't know. So,

212
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,840
um, wait, seriously. Cause I get,

213
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:51,510
I get invitations every day like so and
so wants to add you to linkedin. Yeah.

214
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,660
The fuck is he using it though?
Complete maniacs and assholes.

215
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,650
Linkedin is for nerds, man. You fuck, it's

216
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,190
helpful. Breakdown is helpful
and what's not? It's not.

217
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,120
Um, it's not, it's just not all fall off.

218
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,191
Um,
yeah,

219
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:17,320
and I love that it's a girl farting that's
always the breast and it's not sexual.

220
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:19,340
It's just like sexual,
you know what I'm saying?

221
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:23,220
It's not like fart on me.
Right.

222
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,530
It's not in the context of fetish. It's
just like a girl farting. It's still,

223
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:30,820
as much as I respect,
everybody's different,

224
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,230
you know, turn ons. Right.

225
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,220
It is crazy that that far, it's
really get people going. Sure.

226
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,820
Is. You know, it really is.

227
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,890
It really is. I know. It's just,
it's just cause it's not your lane.

228
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,390
It's hard to fathom. And I get it.
I mean, people don't get it. No.

229
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:58,370
I mean I get that people, that reality
that you're laying is your lane.

230
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,830
If something's not you and you're like,
that's fucking crazy.

231
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,990
But so people like fart.
It's good for it's,

232
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,910
man,
that's a lot of people's lanes.

233
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,560
It's enough people's lanes that there's
a lot of categories on the Internet.

234
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:17,010
So many. Uh, well, why? I mean a lot
of, there's whole studio's videos,

235
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:19,370
dedicated hire sites to farts.

236
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,390
Red Bands sent me a link of a site
that is a tube site just for farts.

237
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,250
He said that to you? Yes. He's like,
I know. I know. You'd appreciate,

238
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,780
they just like check out this park site.
Yeah,

239
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,060
yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Red Band knows what's up. Yeah.

240
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,820
We should check in by the way, a
little bit later on. I'm kicking ass.

241
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,130
We're bribing. Even look pretty
stuff lately. I get notified.

242
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,380
I don't know if you subscribe
to him on Youtube. I do.

243
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,310
So I get notified of any new,
Oh, I didn't know if you did.

244
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,150
I'm probably one of his sub
five subscribers. Sub Five.

245
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,950
What's that first five
subscribers? Dumb. Is that real?

246
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,180
I don't know.
I just said it.

247
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,860
He just made that up.

248
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,560
He made a chess to get a channel up and
I was like subscribed. Yeah. Speaking.

249
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:15,710
I have subscribed guys,

250
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,140
you should be subscribing to our
youtube channel right now. If you don't,

251
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,270

You know why we do behind the scenes.

252
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,260
We do extras.
We do unaired stuff.

253
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,330
Talking to my dad off the air,
but my shit didn't bother him many times.

254
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,320
He's told me that if you
watch that video on our,

255
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,450
on our page at least a thousand times,
he's told me,

256
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,370
never bothered me when you shit.
I'm like,

257
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,250
why do you keep saying he's letting you
know that he loves you? I know Ellis.

258
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,050
This shit doesn't bother
me. It makes me laugh. No,

259
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,290
this smells still is an impact though.
It's impact. It's horrendous. Yeah. Wow.

260
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,630
Quite smelly. Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah. Um,

261
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,990
speaking of it, so like my dad's ripper,
I haven't noticed any a new ones,

262
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:05,550
but let's, let's do check in.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean,

263
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,570
yeah, it's, let's not let that fall by
the wayside. You know what I'm saying?

264
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,700
Okay.
I don't want to overdo this theme,

265
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:19,560
but do you want to make your
special announcement or,

266
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
oh look,
don't you think it's time for,

267
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,660
you should notify people
though with an olive board,

268
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,520
Brown dog,
Brown drawn from coming off

269
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,100
for people who are like, I listen to
this show on speakers in my cubicle.

270
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:45,060
God dammit. Yeah, there's porno and
shit. Talk. Give you a little warning.

271
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,670
All it's kind of a late warning.
It's already started. Yeah. Um,

272
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,370
all right.

273
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,370
So this is something that
really happened and it's so,

274
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,690
um,
substantial,

275
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,740
the age substance to substantive that uh,
you know,

276
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,890
we're stopping the show
essentially. Yeah. All right guys.

277
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:09,891
Here goes March 3rd at 7:22 PM I,

278
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:14,370
Christina Biedrzycki had a double pipe.
Classic

279
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,120
[inaudible].

280
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,840
It's pretty amazing.
It is amazing.

281
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,180
You were sitting there. Describe it. Yeah.

282
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,490
I described the moment for
me because I was living in,

283
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:34,110
I didn't really want to say, feel it. You
know, you were holding our child. Yeah.

284
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,210
What a really special, more special
moment that I even recognized.

285
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,440
You weren't holding our child and I
was sitting only a few feet from you.

286
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,010
I was distracted and you said Tom and I
was like, hold on. I think it was reading,

287
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,960
man. I go, what? And you go,

288
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,420
I just had a double pipe
classic and I dropped my phone,

289
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,580
I dropped my phone on the
ground and I said what? I said,

290
00:19:56,581 --> 00:20:00,420
what time is it? What could you
write down the time you did mark it,

291
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,840
you wrote the time down. I mean,
what was it like? You know,

292
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,880
people ask because we've had people email
about them and yeah, tweet, you know,

293
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:13,290
a guy even came up to me at a show has
girlfriend and he was like a double pipe

294
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,620
class, I guess week. And his girlfriend
was like, it's so disgusting.

295
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,720
I go, I said, that's really special

296
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,450
car. Yeah, it's the Halley's
comet. A body functions.

297
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,160
You don't cause me to have somebody who's
obviously well respected in the body

298
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:36,990
function game, you know? I mean
they happen literally once,

299
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,280
maybe every five years maybe. Really
they're not, they're not a common,

300
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,020
yeah, no. Cause you have to,

301
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:47,560
everything has to go just
right for a little bit to go
up in a little bit. Right.

302
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,950
Picks a path like 99% of the
time. Well, yeah, you're right.

303
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,220
And the reason that I happen doesn't it,

304
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,150
sorry to interrupt shirts and go burped,

305
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,610
fart or four simultaneous,
which is the hard part. Now,

306
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,390
luckily my anus has loosened as
I've discussed, due to childbirth.

307
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,140
And I think what happened was the burp
happened and usually I have more farc

308
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:14,110
control, but because I've lost
FARC control, Bam. And it happened.

309
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,630
And you know when you're in
the moment you're in the game,

310
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,820
you don't realize it until a second
later. Maybe. What I don't maybe,

311
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,080
I don't know. Will this be
a more common thing? Oh,

312
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,750
because of the pregnancy.

313
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,830
In which case does it count as much?
Of course it counts.

314
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,200
Maybe you know they're not as
genuine. That's not true. Tom,

315
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,400
don't you rob me of this gift.
Look, childbirth ravaged my body.

316
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,780
Pregnancy ravaged my body.

317
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:51,490
The one gift nature gave me
was the gift of farts. Now,

318
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,540
uncontrollable bowel movements
that are uncontrollable.

319
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,070
I'm going to enjoy this wonderful gift.
Okay. Okay. Well, you know, I'm just,

320
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,900
I'm just thinking out loud.
You know,

321
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,940
how dare you try to take the validity
of my double pipe classic from me?

322
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,170
Well you just brought to my
attention that things have changed.

323
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,280
Don't shake your head. I just feel
like dare you robbed me of my joy.

324
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,840
I think that it's fair to bring
it up to discuss it. That's all.

325
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,540
It's sort of like fuck you.
Okay. You heard what I said.

326
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,130
It's sorta like you kids
face is just amazing.

327
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,830
Maybe you could use a little
bit of a lesson. Idexx,

328
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,000
FedEx, Fedex. I can't,

329
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:44,090
you know it's weird.
My earphones or I can't hear that.

330
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,130
Is there sound in this? There is
sound. I don't hear anything Tom.

331
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:52,390
I can't hear anything in the
decks. Fedex, Fedex is what I hear.

332
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:54,070
You don't hear that you're making that up.

333
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,960
Only a retarded person would be like
Fedex and a retarded person saying Fedex

334
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,470
would make a lot more money on tour.
You know, trying to make me retarded.

335
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,650
It's so new.
One tour as retarded.

336
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:09,750
Tom and one is normal time and just see
what the difference in ticket sales are.

337
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,580
Well you know I have new agents.
That's the time to bring them new ideas.

338
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,393
So

339
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,890
sounds like you like to do a
retarded theater tour, guys.

340
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,443
Here's the thing.

341
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,660
I know you're thinking of booking
me out as this not retarded.

342
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:31,840
Stand up.
What I'm saying is let's,

343
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,110
let's revisit the game. Maybe I am
retarded. You know what I'm saying?

344
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,490
And see if a retarded comic,
you know what I'm saying?

345
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,440
Could bring in more ticket sales. You
feel me? You know what I'm talking about.

346
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:45,080
You know what I'm saying?

347
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,210
You know what I'm talking about me coming
and what do you think they would say?

348
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,790
They'd be like, absolutely
Mr Segura. Absolutely.

349
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,120
They want to commission and you're going
to make so much money as Thompson were

350
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,990
retarded comedian,
but you're going to make so many,

351
00:23:55,991 --> 00:24:00,991
like what I'll need to do then
is establish that I'm retarded.

352
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,880
Like people that are coming to the
shows now know me as a not retarded guy,

353
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,600
so I don't want to get a new persona.
I mean, I knew name, right? No,

354
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,350
I think it's just the evolution.
You know? I have a solution.

355
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,220
It's like I'm retarded. Yeah. Lino
like Lucy Kay. His children got older.

356
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,710
He talked about that. He got a
divorce. He talked about that. Right?

357
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:22,290
This is just your evolution as a comedian.
How did I become retarded though?

358
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:27,230
Those natural, it's not natural.
You woke up one day retarded,

359
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,310
so just walk out on stage.
It's fine.

360
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,950
People just let Twitter. Let the
people on Twitter tell you. Oh good.

361
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,660
That's where I like to take my cues.

362
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,380
Let the Twitter people telling you how
to do it. We'll see. Let's see guys,

363
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,620
do you want to hear Tom Sager
retarded comedian? Just tweet at him.

364
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,710
Let him know that's harm cigarette.
Thanks baby.

365
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,060
Oh Jan was in you.
You say you go forward.

366
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,180
I had to show a challenge.
He's throwing down the gauntlet.

367
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,480
I feel like that sounds kind of retarded.
What if I walked out on stage?

368
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,493
Yeah,

369
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,080
as wrong.
He's retarded.

370
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:16,230
You know with Dany Jakks
what's her name? Danny. Danny.

371
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,800
That was the first obviously mentally ill
person that we've kind of poked fun at.

372
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,870
That's a bit of a stretch of a comment,
but, but that's what I'm saying.

373
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:27,450
I don't think
like,

374
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,200
I think they've all been a little and

375
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,810
hey, hey, hey. No Hitler.

376
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,770
Just wanted to tell you
that. I really do. Let me a,

377
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,523
yeah.

378
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,900
I also want to tell you that the place
where I'm actually going to poop in your

379
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:58,110
mouth is actually in your mouth.
Oh,

380
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,250
not actually outside of it.
Um,

381
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,560
and I probably might
smear it on your nose and

382
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,580
but see, yeah, she just said I'm going to
do it in your mouth, not outside of it.

383
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,700
And now she's married on your nose.
I mean like where are you pooping?

384
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,180
You know what I mean? It's interesting
cause they must've had a, the,

385
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,420
the preceding conversation where he
was like, wait a minute, do I need,

386
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:22,870
you're going to poop in my mouth
in my mouth or around my mouth?

387
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,440
And she's clarifying. No,
no, no. It's in your mouth.

388
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,730
You know what I think actually happened?

389
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,430
She probably told her plans of pooping.
Hmm,

390
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,660
I'm going to poop on his mouth to Hitler.
Oh, hello. I was like, wait a minute.

391
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,770
That's a main labs. Are you doing
in the mouth or on those? Very,

392
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,200
very important distinction.
Those are two different kinds.

393
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,090
He said you should make
a video where you can see

394
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,010
clearly where you're going to the
pope. And then she goes, thanks Hitler.

395
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
And then I made this video.

396
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,330
You should make a video clearly stating
you're pooping intentions. Yeah.

397
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,840
Why are you going to Scott the tiny
tiny acts need to know now. Ah,

398
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,660
for cause that is a big thing in Germany.
Yeah.

399
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,530
The Germans are love shine,
shine, shine, shine some pot.

400
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,320
So Hitler told her to do
this is what you're saying.
Yeah. He's like, he was like,

401
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,360
Donnie, do you want to want to
suck on these me ups of mine

402
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,770
on your chest, you know, stuff like this.

403
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:37,720
And since I actually love
you a lot, you know, uh,

404
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,110
I just want to tell you that I really
do miss you and I really do love you.

405
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:45,650
And Yeah.
Um,

406
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,610
hopefully if you ever need to,
uh,

407
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,460
I'll uh, be making more
videos. Okay. All right.

408
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,430
Bye.
Cheerio Darling.

409
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,960
You know,
it's really creepy.

410
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,770
Is that she only blinked once all
of the open stare the whole time.

411
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,080
That's hard to do. That is hard
to do. There's one, oh sorry.

412
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,790
I guess I caught her on.
Huh?

413
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,300
Your mouth?
Not Actually,

414
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,040
but there was a while about,

415
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,570
and I probably

416
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,750
it's way off. Sorry. Towards the end
I was like, she hasn't blinked in wow.

417
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,070
And you know on your face
on your chest and you know,

418
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,960
stuff like that.
So since I actually love you a lot and

419
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,150
I like that she thought of the um,

420
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,490
the poop as a gift. Sure. Yeah.

421
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Right. Most people, women. Yeah.

422
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,250
I did want to give me a gift. Does
that what you're saying? Well,

423
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:50,040
it makes me kind of
reevaluate what gifts are.

424
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,250
Maybe I could give you
a poopy gift sometime.

425
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,770
I think you already to be kisses you
Dale. It's at your farts are, yeah,

426
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,870
that's kind of sweet.
But it just kind of sweet.

427
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,290
I like that you said this is probably
the first person with something wrong

428
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,280
mentally that we were making.

429
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,750
I just never occurred to me that a lot
of them probably something's going on.

430
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,500
Yeah, yeah, I think, I think so.

431
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,860
Um, this will be clearly, well,

432
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,530
somebody sent me a video to check
out this dude. His name is crazy.

433
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,010
Lokes mm. And uh, he's putting
it down like a beast and Walmart,

434
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,950
you got to check this guy out.
What's up?

435
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,770
How crazy lopes right here.

436
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,390
How many no saying yeah.
Pharrell's

437
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,590
God is good homie. Shit. Crazy
low Scott to Keith. Thanks.

438
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,530
Fruition.
How army you don't say for real style?

439
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,340
No. Yeah. I don't know if you
think he has mental problems. Um,

440
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,640
I'd say yeah. Right off the
bat you say. Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,220
He seems excited to be at
Walmart making a video.

442
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:06,670
So he's set up his camera on obviously
a merchandise shelf and is kind of

443
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:11,990
swaying back and forth touching his
ponytail. Yeah. Um, and he said, you know,

444
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:13,670
God is real.
You know what I'm saying?

445
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,620
And you can tell that he's ramping up to
something. You know, it's, it's beginning.

446
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,750
The wheels are just starting to turn.

447
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,670
I wonder why the theme of Walmart Wyant
why necessarily putting it down like a

448
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:28,930
beast and wall.
What's the Walmart connection?

449
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,830
There's other customers are walking by
that notice the crazy lugs is putting it

450
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:34,664
down

451
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,520
from now and say the n sound homie.

452
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,020
No salary for reals.
No.

453
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:46,030
How many shall goes out to every body
doing the buying and stuff like that.

454
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,020
So he shouts out,

455
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,680
everybody doing their
thing and stuff like that.

456
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,840
Literally a shout out to everybody
in humanity. The hotels. Yeah,

457
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,140
that's a nice shout out.
Okay.

458
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,700
No, straight up. No shoo. Shoo.

459
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,900
Let me look.

460
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,130
Let me give y'all a little bit of
shadow boxing for crazy loves. Whoa. No.

461
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:16,030
Say for reals though.

462
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,643
Okay.

463
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,750
Putting on a clinic. I mean, he's
giving you upper hands giving you hugs.

464
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,100
Jack, he's giving you this. Oh Shit.
They hit an upper cup too. Damn.

465
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,840
Tend to tolerate his. Tip
it down. Moving all around.

466
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,200
Now you'll notice he has kind of a,

467
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,430
a paraplegic guys gripped.
Yes. It's not normal. It's not.

468
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,320
It's not a normal fist. I mean, I don't
know what you know about what, not a lot,

469
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:54,050
but I do know that when you
make a fist and you punch,

470
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:58,000
it should be like right straight.
They probably not like this.

471
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:02,450
You had never hold your thumb and
not, no. Yeah. Yeah. It's very,

472
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:06,920
it's a peculiar way,
right? Oh, for sure. Yeah.

473
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:08,860
He's really, he's definitely
put it down. We go,

474
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,160
yes. I mean, wow.

475
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,550
It's intense side Walmart begging.
Well,

476
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:21,430
I'm just glad I'm not at that Walmart.
Oh yeah,

477
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,590
I'd get rid of May where the shoulder
row. Oh, go to the side like that.

478
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,210
No deal.

479
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,220
I would say he's not very technically
sound. No, but he has ideas.

480
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,050
Spa Spark

481
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,480
for him to win. I guess.
Mayweather's on May 2nd.

482
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,373
Yeah.

483
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,700
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

484
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,390
He just literally like this.

485
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,450
He did a straight up press,

486
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:59,340
a straight press over his head as one
of his punches. No Punch that exists.

487
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:03,150
Like it's almost like he's like a king
of Improv when it comes to punches.

488
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,510
I was going to say is I've never seen
a punch like that. Has He trained?

489
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,540
It's a good question.
I mean

490
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,330
it looks like the statements together.
School of Kiki punching.

491
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,110
Here's what amazed me.
How do you learn the sound

492
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,760
I was going to give y'all
no more videos but crazy.

493
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:33,750
Laos just live in like a beast.
Oh God.

494
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,710
Yeah,
buddy

495
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,770
shall goes out to everybody doing
their thing, stuff like that.

496
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,930
And his gang and the gang keep
every thank pushing your now,

497
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,210
but reels down from the
training to the rat been,

498
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,670
oh,
you're now,

499
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,190
do you sense mental illness are
not on this one? It's not right.

500
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,130
So one thing I noticed was
how bad his punching was.

501
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,070
And then this motherfucker isn't a
proper gym. He looks great. He's a,

502
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,510
is he a fighter? No, there's no
legitimate. No. Well then why does he,

503
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:17,360
he looks official. He now,
okay, now watch a box.

504
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,520
No.
Oh Geez.

505
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:26,960
Even I know that's not good for him and
I'm not a profession. I feel like what?

506
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,420
I don't know is this guy,

507
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,400
like the guy that walks a retarded
kid at the bus stop. No, God, no.

508
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:38,990
I'm saying like, is this guy being nice to
him? I think it's a mercy. You think so?

509
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,470
Because he's kind of, he's got the
head gear on. He's like, Oh yeah, no,

510
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:49,250
I mean look, this is, this is some
bullshit right here. Bam. It was, yeah.

511
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,300
I mean, what? What? You know, he's,

512
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,500
he's touched,

513
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,690
he's not touched crazy lug spars
with smooth hands coming in angles.

514
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:00,524
What,

515
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,370
what so bizarre.
Well,

516
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,730
okay, there's a lot of him fighting.
Yeah. He likes to fight Vinay.

517
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,190
The name of this video is crazy. Lokes
sparring with homie with a lot of heart,

518
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,050
which made clergy lokes hold back.
So he's saying like,

519
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,680
because this guy had heart, I'm not giving
him the full business right now. Crazy.

520
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:27,740
Loucks but like, this is, you know,

521
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,530
it's technically horrific, right? What was
he just doing right there? We see skip,

522
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:38,160
skip, skip, skipping. He's still,
but he's still, he's still more

523
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,130
active than Steven Seagal.
This is more than he does.

524
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,990
He's definitely more than he does.
Hey, definitely more than I do.

525
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:45,160
And I want to say this though.

526
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,870
I want to challenge crazy lokes
why I want to challenge crazy,

527
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:55,330
crazy lows. You know what I'm saying? If
we're putting it down right now, you know,

528
00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:58,470
shout out to you and everybody all wow.

529
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,700
And stuff like that.

530
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,140
If you want to go into the ring with me,

531
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,110
I don't train. I'm not
a trained fighter. Wow.

532
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:13,150
I would love to challenge
you to a fight for charity.

533
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,550
We can donate it worked though.
Look at that footwork.

534
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,330
That's going to fuck with that for
work or that I will challenge you.

535
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,560
I will donate.

536
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:25,000
We can donate the money to charity
and I bet I will knock your ass out.

537
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,800
So it's up to you homeboy.
You just tell me where you want to meet.

538
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,160
Uh, what ring to go to
and what does that mean?

539
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,480
This is all advanced shit,
shoulder rolls and stuff.

540
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,720
Man. I would love for you. It's
either challenges guy or trains did.

541

maybe he could train you.

542
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,430
I will light your ass up and
I'm challenging you right now.

543
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,510
Just tell me when you want to do it.
Like I said, we can sell tickets,

544
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,170
we can give the money to charity because
I have you probably gracious dude like

I want to, I want you to put it down.

546
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,430
Maybe we can do it at a Walmart.
Maybe that would be like, oh, oh shit.

547
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,450
Here's you at Mickey D's.

548

and deceptively towns. Right, right.

556

You put it on a video, goes today,

the gauntlet to crazy low,

568
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:16,520
cause you know what I'm saying? Yep. We
represent all the homies doing your stuff,

569
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,070
which just goes to show how
empty those phrases are. Yeah.

570
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,690
They don't mean anything.
Shout out and homeys doing your thing.

571
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,030
What the fuck are you talking about?

572
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:28,940
This guy doesn't know what with your
nonsense. Yeah. It's all rambling.

573
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:32,120
Nonsensical motherfucker. This is a
whole new, you know what I'm saying?

574
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,760
I feel like crazy. Lokes
has his own lane. Yes.

575
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,620
The crazy looks.
You know what I'm saying?

576
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,590
Speaking of fighting by the way,
um, last week I played for you.

577
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,430
I'm living or whatever the fuck I want.
Life kind of Mcgregor,

578
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,870
he lost,
he lost over the weekend.

579
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,250
It was a huge upset.
Um,

580
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,920
Nate Diaz took the
fight on 10 days notice.

581
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,340
Beat Conor McGregor for the first loss
and then Holly Holm who knocked out your

582
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:05,090
home girl Ronda Rousey.
She was choked unconscious,

583
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,340
uh, by uh, Misha Tate. So two
huge upsets on the same card.

584
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,610
If you had bet a hundred dollar parlay
that Misha Tate and Nate Diaz would win,

585
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,490
you would have won a little over $1,400
at most last Vegas betting houses.

586
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,280
Pretty good stuff.
No,

587
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,600
you know, I love Rhonda Rousey.
I just think she's wonderful.

588
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:33,090
She's a real nice lady. I really like, uh,

589
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,680
I like to see her when I hope
she challenges that lady again.

590
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,720
Yeah. Well I think what will happen
is I think the UFC, you know,

591
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,890
they don't want to waste time
making money. So I think, right.

592
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,500
I think with Misha being the new
champ and Rhonda still being every,

593
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,850
you know, a lot of people, so
they want to see what's up.

594
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,690
I think they're gonna put
those two together. Good. I
had a big fight coming up.

595
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,070
What,
what just fight was that,

596
00:39:58,071 --> 00:40:01,280
was that one 96 or for out to
forget that it was one 96. Right.

597
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,420
So maybe that like the big 200, something
like that. Maybe. I don't know. Hmm.

598
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,200
I would imagine that
that's what they're gonna

599
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,420
oh, that's exciting. Oh Wow. Crazy.

600
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:18,160
Lokes there we go. Front of new, uh,
you know, saying stuff like that.

601
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,763
Nonsense.

602
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,090
I'll show you this for a while.
Um,

603
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:29,180
okay. Oh, um, oh, is this, well, there's
some other stuff on the right there.

604
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:30,014
We probably can't.

605
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,450
Hi. I'm, Oh yeah.

606
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,430
And I'm here to fail at.

607
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,920
This is such a beautiful villa.

608
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:45,410
We seeding with the first time of my
ever experience in my life with the two

609
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:53,550
young men and they had
big car to offer me.

610
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,530
This villa is really quaint place.

611
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,180
It's very quaint.

612
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,660
So it's important that we
know the quaintness of the
villa where she's getting

613
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:11,450
random by two guys.
Can I tell you what I do love about Kenai?

614
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,390
Yes. Positive. Always
looking on the bright side.

615
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,710
She's not, you know what I
mean? The villas. Beautiful
looker. Yeah, no, I'm smoking.

616
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,020
I looked up some stuff by the way,

617
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,290
because last week we were
talking about what's the story

618
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,010
Ameren and ideal theory.

619
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:32,011
My theory was that she used to be maybe
heavily pursued and that maybe now

620
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,400
she wants a little charge in her life,

621
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,920
a little bit venture because she's
getting older and she's like, well,

622
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,250
I probably still have a few years
left where I'm holding it together.

623
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,570
Might as well just go all out. Um, and
then I found this interview. This is a,

624
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,480
another interview with her. And uh, we,
we learned a little bit about her in this,

625
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:57,050
so I pulled it up to this
moment, her backstory. A
little bit. A little bit. Yeah.

626
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,800
I got to say, look at her
tits. Her body's amazing.

627
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,690
She's 61 years old. It's incredible.
She looks better than her abs.

628
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,740
Crazy. Jesus. These Asian
ladies, I tell you, they hold
together. Well, white ladies,

629
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,560
we fall apart. Yeah. Fuck
white ladies. It's true.

630
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:20,561
We hit the wall 40 the wall fucking
white ladies are sogging wrinkles.

631
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,090
Here we go. Damn. So
what Kim is here. Oh God.

632
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:29,510
I'm pulling all the way from the
Midwest, right? Yes. By the way, the guy,

633
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,830
the guy that does this in every porn, the
interview guy, they're always the worst.

634
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,030
You can imagine what creeps
they are by their voice. Well,

635
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,230
and they're always kind
of shitting on the girls.

636
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:46,160
There's always a tone of like you stupid
bitch instead of being like, no, no, no,

637
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,210
you should be nice to her. She's making
sure you have a fucking Gig. Retard.

638
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,040
Be Nice. Why do you have to demean
them? I know you also try out.

639
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,290
They do like a lot of dad jokes,
like boner jokes

640
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,690
with her husband. She's here with her
husband after how many years? Five years.

641
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,610
Five years. Five years. Your
husband watching you have sex,

642
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,230
is that common?

643
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:13,910
Unusual because it's the first time
it's ever happened or have a hand. Uh,

644
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,920
this is, I feel like it sounds like
Baba booey. Oh, right. The guy.

645
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,330
I got a picture of him.

646
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,590
This is the pre interview shit that
he got nervous and Horny and weird.

647
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,160
And of course it's my first time
that my husband absorb what?

648
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,280
Observed doing what you're doing,
what you're doing,

649
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,890
what you do and gross.

650
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,240
I feel that for him is
really exciting for me.

651
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:46,241
I feel that is maybe I'm
testing my own strength.

652
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,240
Testing your own strength.
What can I do?

653
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,450
Did you enjoy it while you were doing
testing the strength of asshole?

654
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,530
Yeah. Yes. Sorry,

655
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:05,180
I didn't know you guys
and said, okay. Yes,

656
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,190
but um, she's really mad. A Ding
Dong. This chick is smarter. Yeah.

657
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:14,510
She's not your average porno girl. Like,
look how thoughtful her answers are. Well,

658
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:17,180
she's lived a full life to a four rife.
Yeah.

659
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,930
Nine inches. Press.
What is wrong with you?

660
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,530
That's not what she said.
Hear her saying no, no.

661
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,740
I'm going to pull that up in a moment.
Prove that you're wrong. It's so horrible.

662
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:37,020
It's very bright. She's brighter than
the asshole interviewing her. Oh,

663
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,710
without she could fucking
school that guy. Yeah. Yeah,

664
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,710
absolutely.
Okay.

665
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,750
Um,
what are you good at it?

666
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,470
Um, I'm not sure. I think very honest.

667
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,500
She's so thoughtful.
Yeah. I think someone,

668
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,030
other people have to be the
judge of that while I'm doing it.

669
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,690
I feel super good. Yeah. And that's,

670
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,040
that's what everybody's kept on asking me.
How are you doing?

671
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,930
I was an answer up there.

672
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,060
Don't hear yet. Orchard is a sure way
to know if you're doing it right. Okay.

673
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,420
At the end of your scene with the guy,
did he come?

674
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,510
Yes, you did it.
Congratulations. You succeeded.

675
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,780
Wow.
Okay.

676
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,080
At the end and each column I fixed score.

677
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,060
We can tell the guys that you are how old?

678
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm 61 days from now

679
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,530
60. When you look spectacular,
spectacular. Have you always been that

680
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,690
asshole looks nice. Selfie, Suede
or on monster. What happens?

681
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,820
You can tell he has 10th degree dad mouth.

682
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,010
You can hear the sadness
in his voice. I agree. God.

683
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:09,990
A real rock and body and you made
him come real hard. First of all,

684
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:12,630
like making a guy come.
Is that big of a deal

685
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,130
at the end of it?
Stupid.

686
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,320
A few of that.
I always be as such and yeah.

687
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,460
Um, so now to prove to, you know, like
her even more now she's the master.

688
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,970
Wonderful Lady came in. Uh, whoops.

689
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,160
I was truly amazed. This is the, this

690
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:39,280
yeah, it's really, really
comfortable with a lot of articles,

691
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,970
a lot of artifacts.
I feel really,

692
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:48,971
really comfortable of being outside
and especially with the two especially

693
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,130
really treat me very special.
Oh,

694
00:46:55,131 --> 00:47:00,131
she thinks that's like ultimate goal
is to really get them to be really,

695
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:07,001
really hot and feel that me
[inaudible] have a lot to offer.

696
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:09,650
You

697
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,860
do girl, you do. I look at
her positive self esteem.

698
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,130
This girl was like the Aristotle of four.
Now some reasonable video though.

699
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:19,370
I just feel like I'm talking
to my friend's aunt, you know,

700
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,730
like it's not that I feel like,
oh, you're not attractive.

701
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:27,260
It's just that she just feels,
you know, maternal. Yeah, she is.

702
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,980
She's all right grandma.
Like right here. If you go

703
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,030
like, okay, I'm a bit
cheeky and you go, Whoa,

704
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,280
Nice Lady,
you know,

705
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,150
and I feel really satisfied with my whole
body being caressed and you're like,

706
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,010
wait,
will you being um,

707
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,130
chemist and save beautiful words.

708
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,660
Think they did all that to her?
I don't think that a touch. Yeah.

709
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,820
And I feel very,

710
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,530
very excited if we could just really
unexpected, we can't show it on youtube,

711
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:04,580
but I feel like happy if we
could splice in the actual scene.

712
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:08,810
Really us. It's not that what
she's describing because at all

713
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,850
the physical innovate I feel that
they have, we'll really big hawk.

714
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,310
I'm nine and a half inches and pause.
Okay.

715
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,750
Fry's FRY's.

716
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,640
Never expect,

717
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,900
expect to have sent to um,

718
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,160
beautiful experience plus
a beautiful experience.

719
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,310
I was so hot for them,

720
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,370
especially on the scene that they put
their hard cock even to my asshole.

721
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:46,943
Yeah.

722
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,680
It's so amazing.
This is like,

723
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,550
especially like just on the sprayer.

724
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:57,430
Dave put that hard cock into my asshole.

725
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,880
Sure, sure. This pleading. Yeah. Yeah.

726
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:06,650
She's so into it. Yeah. This
lady is just us. She's amazing.

727
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,360
Plus she said right there,

728
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,550
the physical innovator prize.
Really big topic.

729
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,150
Nine and a half inches and plus,

730
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,650
no, she doesn't say it
cause I have to express.

731
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,960
All right. Maybe you need to get these
switched out because I'm hearing press.

732
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:30,370
You're so mean. He a nine. She's so
earnest. Yeah. That's what he is,

733
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:34,120
is earnest. It's, I've never
seen a porn star be earnest.
Well, let's see how sweet.

734
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,700
You're right.
You're

735
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,300
not gentlemen and they're not being nice.
Being Nice.

736
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,790
I hate when they fingered so aggressively
like, but no one's no one's one.

737
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,593
Whoops.

738
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,560
This is just a her,
she was screaming, man,

739
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:02,350
that's going on cheese with animals,
animals,

740
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,450
animals. Is Roy just animals. We're
all animals. You know, I can talk.

741
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:11,110
I think she's really going after her.
Um,

742
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,290
most repressed feelings for 50 years.

743
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,420
If he's 67 years old
and she's taking a car,

744
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:22,180
can shout and get against her as another
guy rails or she's been holding on to

745
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:24,580
sup, man. She's been
making up for lost time.

746
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:28,160
Do you think she was held
as like a slave in a Thai

747
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,070
kingdom? I don't know man.
Maybe she was a slave.

748
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,320
She hasn't been around
gentlemen like that.

749
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,490
Maybe she has been working on at the
time massage place for 20 press years.

750
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,150
Sleeping on a cot in the back,
microwaving her smelly food.

751
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,880
Third where you walk in and you're like,
it doesn't really smell like eucalyptus.

752
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,860
Also smell like yellow curry

753
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,553
all the time.

754
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,570
It's a smell like their lunches and
then maybe it's 20 years of her going

755
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,600
mapquest show and feel the most
pressure and she got sick of it.

756
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah. Maybe man. Maybe
as she realized after

757
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,990
20 plus years,
you know,

758
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,070
20 competitors come out as polyamorous
and now I'm excited to share that I'm

759
00:51:12,071 --> 00:51:12,904
bisexual.

760
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,190
I'm excited to share that makes
I'm Paula and I'm by, yeah,

761
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,610
maybe that's what you said was one
of my favorites and a good moment.

762
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,630
Bye Buddy. Dead Buddy. Hey,

763
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,790
you got to tell you something.
I'm Paula and I'm bi.

764
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,550
I'm poly and I'm by, Oh, I don't
have the part where he goes,

765
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,713
all right.

766
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,640
If I told that to my dad,
he would not ready.

767
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:51,110
No clue what Holly. Yeah, but
he knows. He doesn't know by,

768
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,430
he knows ACDC.

769
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,860
That's how his people his age and
European say ACDC means Pauley and bye,

770
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,360
bye. But he doesn't know. I don't
think he knows by then he would know.

771
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,290
He think he got, oh
yeah. That's interesting.

772
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,370
Okay. Like he wouldn't be like
supportive. Oh yeah. It's fucking weird.

773
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,510
We wrote to Dr. Took out
your head a little new gay.

774
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,770
That's my favorite is the old school
thing of somebody saying something and

775
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:25,360
someone goes, Mary's going to talk to
somebody like that. It couldn't be real.

776
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:29,650
It's gotta be something's wrong
with you. Fixed yourself. Yeah,

777
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,620
that's true. Yeah. They
just see it as wrong.

778
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:35,810
Ah,

779
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,260
so low all I pulled this up because
this guy has the same name as our son.

780
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:45,600
Now
I was sent this,

781
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,540
I liked that the video is called, uh Oh,
this is, no, this is the wrong thing.

782
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,570
Actually.
This is the remix.

783
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,400
Oh Geez. It's going to be a good
one. There's already a remix.

784
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:59,280
So this is Ellis lengths are a few,

785
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,000
I guess there's a few years ago at
a post game press conference and a,

786
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,230
he's tripping out man. That's, I
don't know why that makes me laugh,

787
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:09,780
but I'm just tripping out.
Right?

788
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,200
Quarterback the Rockies drafted
in the seventh round it.

789
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,880
So they're asking
like,

790
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:24,370
like, like, like, like, um,

791
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,140
I was like, um, like
I was on just on like,

792
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,330
I was just reading and writing.

793
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,910
What happened?
What happened there you think?

794
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,770
I think he's nervous. I think it's,
I think he's nervous. You know,

795
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,600
like these guys are not public
speakers. He's it. He's an athlete.

796
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,550
True. And I actually support that
100%. That idea that you, you know,

797
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:51,900
if somebody's,
um,

798
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:57,450
underwhelms you at their communication
skills and their job is something else,

799
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:02,350
it's not your Jack. It's
not getting job, sweetie.

800
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,230
Yeah, it's really not. It's not, but
they should. But that being said,

801
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,640
the other guys on the team know like,
Hey Ellis, not so good on the mic.

802
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,230
So maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't
let this guy talk for the day.

803
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:18,790
Every one of these teams, by
the way, has a PR person. Sure.

804
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,930
They know everybody's strengths,
they know everything.

805
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,390
They know that Ellis on the
mic is going to be a problem.

806
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:32,850
So like if Brah Brah Hey,

807
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,480
you got to put Ellis in front of a Mike,

808
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,340
you want to talk some shit that's
going to go down. Okay. Because

809
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,500
Ellis Ellis man, you like, um, like

810
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,320
if were you like if you would be like,
Oh,

811
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,650
if you put Ellis on the mic,
like I'm just going to go poorly man.

812
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,290
I worked with a guy that had
that same thing like little
tick. He'd be like, like,

813
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,390
like, like let Christina you want me
to like lately like upload a Lego Lego.

814
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,150
Do you think that this is a tick?
Is that what it is?

815
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,120
Yeah. At some kind of nervous tick. Sure.

816
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,150
It's like saying like the
way you say in California,

817
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:16,630
I. Dot. I got a problem with
like, I probably lag tool.
You know what I'm saying?

818
00:55:16,631 --> 00:55:21,190
Shit. I would say that to everybody.
Filming. I have a like problem,

819
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,200
but nothing like has like, I'm
problem Lego. I'm like, um,

820
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,450
like, um, lag, lag, lag. I'm like,

821
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,450
so do you think,
uh,

822
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:38,380
would this constitute us making fun
of somebody with a problem like that?

823
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,990
He's not touched. I don't
think he's special. No. No.

824
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:47,280
I think he's nervous and he doesn't know
what the fuck to say. Yeah. It happens.

825
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,970
Yeah. It's a gluten thing.
You know, Mike's on him. He's,

826
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,740
do you think this guy has a problem?
I'm a Martian.

827
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,890
This does our URL like guys
are, well, here's our mom. Mom.

828
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,570
Yeah.
Now that guy,

829
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,330
but he has something going
on. But then yeah, Ellis like,

830
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,480
oh wow. Like, um, I was like, um,

831
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,640
like I'm, I'm just on my own.
I was just reading it right.

832
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,370
I was on and I'll read it on
my man or whatever. Any hail

833
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,940
camp.
What else on a mic man?

834
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,310
[inaudible] by Amy.
Maybe Ellison speaks into halo and it,

835
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,290
and picked it out there. Okay.
You're driving it. Yes sir.

836
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,620
Maybe he should just do yes or no answers.
Correct. He's nailed that twice, right?

837
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,060
He did. On the partners on the positive
side. Ellis, you can answer yes and no.

838
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,600
Pretty much say yes sir. Knocked
that shit out of the park, man.

839
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,200
Just all the other words aren't
really working. I just remember two,

840
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:57,220
we also found Auntie Fifi
remember her? Yeah. Oh yeah. Um,

841
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,600
an angel's fellatio secrets. Yup.
We brought her to angel's, ours.

842
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,740
A auntie Fifi was, she sings. There's
two, there's Auntie fee, I think,

843
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:08,080
who does the baking.
We're talking about on the fee fee fee.

844
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:12,500
Who's the religious lady from Texas soon?
Things that don't even always add up.

845
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,270
We haven't checked in with her lately
and I've looked on her Facebook.

846
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,540
I didn't see any new video,
so she may have stopped doing the,

847
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:24,310
the music like today. I was
thinking, Oh man, Dan. Oh
yeah. Yeah, a little out there.

848
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:28,190
She's uh, she's great. Um,
but this one we all bleed.

849
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,380
Yeah. Um, let's see if he
can do the second question.

850
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:35,340
Oh, Christ, you got to pick
up ice tripping out. Right.

851
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,820
Trip it out.
That's so funny.

852
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,890
Just dismissing that. Like
was he's bugging out, right?

853
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,140
Moscow like,
uh,

854
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:57,080
like I just didn't work at Holiday Inn
all been praying and stuff and it's um,

855
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,920
and his own coming to you thinking you
were getting it to the end down on.

856
00:58:01,921 --> 00:58:06,400
You didn't want to know. What were
you, I was trying, I was trying to use,

857
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:12,340
yeah, no, he's good. Oh, I
know him. He's our eyes shut.

858
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:16,430
We, since the emergency outside,
try to make it early and,

859
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:21,090
and Jean and that. I was like, Oh shit.

860
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,440
She called the seven round cakes.
I like,

861
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,250
oh, what tripped him up. What do you, what
do you think sends him into the spiral?

862
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,010
Um, it's just wanting to, to, you know,

863
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,430
where is it here? Just wanting to, to

864
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,700
Rena,
right.

865
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,990
People saying, what's the sound
like he knows what he's saying.

866
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,050
Knows that he's in front of people. Yeah.
Just nervous about it. And then his, like,

867
00:58:48,051 --> 00:58:48,920
I'm thinking over here.

868
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,403
Yes.

869
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:22,970
How can I go home?

870
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,310
This is a new thing. Or
from like, I'm recording.

871
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,960
I'll put the house on
that microphone long.

872
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,450
He's got like a western, some
western European. Yeah, he is.

873
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,200
He's probably got Austrian
or Dutch. Yep. I see that.

874
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,500
This reminds me,

875
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,930
this reminds me of Rodman when
he was in North Korea. Oh my God.

876
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:06,390
He was given the press and
while, while watch this, yeah.

877
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,900
And the whole team was like, dude,
could you fucking dial it back?

878
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,080
Yeah.
Don't let Donald

879
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:21,530
that the interview, I'll, I'll,
I'll, I'll watch this bullshit.

880
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,440
Yeah. He, um, that was
definitely not his best day. Um,

881
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:31,670
so speaking of, uh, the king of Improv,

882
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,590
there's a new,

883
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,610
mmm.

884
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,710
Steven Sea Gal.

885
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,380
Where is it? Here? Yes.

886
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,060
Trailer. Yeah. Oh, you're kidding. No.

887
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,250
Didn't we just see it a
new Steven Seagal trailer?

888
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,330
The answer to that would be
yes,

889
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,273
but

890
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,553
I mean

891
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:06,940
I am the king of him province naturally
natural is such a piece of shit that I'm

892
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:10,520
about to show you.

893
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,710
And again, if you're listening to the
show, I encourage you to look it up,

894
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:19,670
but you can also watch it with us.
You can go to our youtube channel.

895
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,380
We are on youtube or watching this on
a monitor that you can see with us.

896
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:25,820
Okay.

897
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:30,110
This trailer is called
the Asian connection. Um,

898
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,160
it's brand new.

899
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:36,950
The Asian isn't there like a, um, it's
a pretty common title. Like the Asian.

900
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:41,930
Can I the European, the [inaudible]
is a very, very famous movie. Okay.

901
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:46,400
So this is, they really went out on a limb
the, to find something else there yet.

902
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:49,760
Well this must be a play on that
film. Yes. That's an exceptional film.

903
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:50,930
If you haven't seen it,
it's real though.

904
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,790
You don't think this is
going to be exceptional time.

905
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:57,200
I've seen this and this is a
fucking dog Turd. Um, I mean,

906
01:01:57,201 --> 01:01:58,030
okay,

907
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,030
so the last one was like the member of
the Iraqi Afghanistan wine that they shot

908
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,430
in Calabasas and this one man.
Well,

909
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:10,490
the premise of that film was just
shoot, shoot, shoot, Bang, Bang.

910
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,750
Steven Seagal kills people. And yes. So
what do you think this one's going to be?

911
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,890
There's a lot,

912
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,280
a lot of emperor that he
holds up to his improv.

913
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,010
I think in the the trailer you go,

914
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,750
he improvised that. Yeah, I think
there's a lot of Improv. Okay. Yeah.

915
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,580
So, so you just went up the first hole,
not down to the other one. You gotta get,

916
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:34,140
you gotta get your ass hole snip.
Ma'Am. I do. Okay. Let's, um,

917
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,540
let's run through this room. I'm
really excited. Okay. Here we go. Oh,

918
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,690
Jesus Christ.

919
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:46,310
Not enough room for the most, some of us.

920
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,480
That means one of us has to die.

921
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,590
So He's standing still. The other
guys doing all the words. It's just,

922
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:02,460
you can tell. Yes, he, he fights.
Yeah, totally. Still. And they also,

923
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,680
they make sure to shoot it where you
don't see how fat he is. Of course. No.

924
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:10,620
And that is very, believe
me, old black dye.

925
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:15,621
Make sure that he's just like shooting
from the ceiling and cut around me.

926
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:20,370
Yeah. That and the fat. The
attorney's guy out. But he's wearing,

927
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,610
what is that called? AG , I dunno.
Well this is very forgiving.

928
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,440
This outfit is basically pajamas thick.
Heavy. It covers the flaws. Yeah. Yeah.

929
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,990
And it's all black. The medallion, I
don't know. He's got, and he's got on his,

930
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,710
his, his range glasses. His gun
range glasses, yellow, 10 sure.

931
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,680
Blacker than black dye for the goatee.

932
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,360
Head wrap covering up the
jet black dark hair on top

933
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,800
would,
that means one of us has to die.

934
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,600
So there's a premise of the film is that
he's going to kill people, right? Yeah.

935
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,670
Not enough room for the most. Some of
us. That means one of us has to die.

936
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,040
Yeah.

937
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,630
Out of practice.
Smile friend.

938
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,810
He's from the crazy Logue
school of fighting me. Oh,

939
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,010
he is from the cause.
You love.

940
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,563
Wow.

941
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:23,803
No,

942
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:29,660
these titles look better
than the other me see out.

943
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,630
He paid for the title.
Now

944
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,900
what else are they said? Michael J. White
is in there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright.

945
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:42,210
Um, and show Jack Budand.
Tanka guy. That guy is this,

946
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,660
is this a pim poo? Bear Poo. Bear.

947
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,700
Do I have the Michael Dry white wine
in there? No. No. That's the one

948
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,890
before Otis. It's a one
right before this day. Okay.

949
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,630
Telling Harry.
Yeah.

950
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,840
I don't know why I can't or
60 press mills there, right?

951
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,360
No. Getting to know Kimmy.
Maybe it's not on here.

952
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:07,940
Hmm.

953
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:12,320
Oh, make a can get on
makeup. Dreaded. Get over it.

954
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:18,160
Okay. All right. Um, all right. Well in
many ways make note of Michael Jai White.

955
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,023
Okay.

956
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,233
Michael Jai

957
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,300
[inaudible]

958
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,460
also for a trailer.

959
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:40,680
Like that pacing on this thing is
so fucking, it's an action trailer.

960
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:45,780
Should be, it's a robbery
cut to Bam. Bam money.

961
01:05:45,781 --> 01:05:49,110
Yeah.
Like let's go walking in.

962
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:52,020
We're going to take everything
now. Shoot, shoot, shoot.

963
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,040
Show them going into the room.
Grabbing the bag rug. No.

964
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,230
Yeah. Look, it's a four and a half,
four minute, 12 second trailer.

965
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,640
Should a trailer B 90 90 seconds,

966
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,010
usually the standard and then long
trailers are considered two minutes,

967
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,770
maybe a little over two minutes.
That's a long trailer.

968
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:16,020
These 32nd trailers.
Sometimes this is cause and you know why?

969
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:19,830
It's because Steven Seagal himself self
indulgent and he's standing behind the

970
01:06:19,831 --> 01:06:23,700
editor at the Edit Bay going, oh
no, you got to put in there longer.

971
01:06:23,701 --> 01:06:28,700
You got to put me in doing this and that.
Whatever the shot of me standing there,

972
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,370
I'm like,
didn't think that would put a fucking in.

973
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,090
Stephen thinks that he's the director. I
guarantee that's why. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

974
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,910
You know what? People like to see what's
happening in the movie. Um, so look,

975
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:43,980
this is just getting started,
man.

976
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,850
Who the fuck are these guys?
Who Cares?

977
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,140
You don't have to work
at the club anymore.

978
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,170
That could have been quick robbery

979
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,510
where
we get it.

980
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,720
See how it shows how it shows
like the Buddha, he's always like,

981
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,800
but it showed them,
why don't you just cut to,

982
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,580
you don't need in the trailer to
establish how you do that in a movie.

983
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:22,850
A movie.
We need to see where are we for context.

984
01:07:22,851 --> 01:07:26,420
But trailer you just cut to his mind
and usually they tell you where you're

985
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:31,140
located. They would say
Vietnam or whatever, where
they're shooting this. Yeah,

986
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,010
your money was wrong.
They get away with about 200,000 voice.

987
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,570
You the motherfucker told me that.

988
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,050
Wow. And the effort and the trailer
to the motherfucker that totally,

989
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:50,300
he put a little hot sauce on it.
He did and he did eyebrow acting,

990
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,070
aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't
you the mother fit and said,

991
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,110
aren't you the motherfucker? Is it,
aren't you the motherfucker? Yeah.

992
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,600
Aren't you the motherfucker that
told me to put the money there?

993
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,540
Aren't you the mother fucker?

994
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:16,810
He's ridiculous.
I just want fucking results

995
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,570
to Fox.
Yeah.

996
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,680
And the sound mixing where you can
barely hear him talking as though that

997
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,770
angelic singing background over this.

998
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,020
So there are three of them
are mixed together. Horrible.

999
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,760
I just want to see fucking results.
This is a new level for him.

1000
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:40,210
This is usually you see actors doing
stuff like this once they're full blown

1001
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:43,860
alcoholics, you know, and they
had a queer like 30 years. Right.

1002
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:48,260
Then they do the straight to DVD thing
and it's, this is his Gerard Depardieu.

1003
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,910
Ah, yeah. He's at the end.

1004
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,440
I just want to see fucking result fucking
results. And they're like, Steve, uh,

1005
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,830
I don't know if we should curse.
Yeah, much shut the fuck up.

1006
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:04,490
I don't want to hear any stories about
how it's going to be. I just want

1007
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:12,470
to give you the names of the banks
in Cambodia. Did you want to run

1008
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,300
my service?
50%

1009
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,840
it makes no sense.

1010
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,800
That's a weird moment to,

1011
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:27,540
I'm going to tell you where to rob banks
and he just went to Steven and me a

1012
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,210
beat before I was like, my
banks are being wrong. Yeah.

1013
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:35,480
And then his fee for telling the guy where
to rob is 50% so he's robbing his own

1014
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:41,940
banks, but the, now he's having Steven
Seagal find out who's robbing the banks.

1015
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,830
I Dunno.

1016
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:46,450
Nice to see. I'd be like this
greedy. I want to buy some heat heat.

1017
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:48,370
That's Michael Jai white guns,
man.

1018
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,660
No,
I'm like check

1019
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,850
another fun.

1020
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,590
The guard was killed.
What are you getting self nearer

1021
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,823
the gardens.

1022
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,290
Ah, ah, ah. Did

1023
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,190
you see that?

1024
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:24,880
There's a little sexy playful time and
I think that's the girl is dating the

1025
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:27,310
bank robber, right? That was the girl.

1026
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:30,490
Now she's dating Steven
Seagal who you know,

1027
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,910
knows a lot of special sexual techniques.
Of course. I think he's a study.

1028
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,870
Uh, all the eastern love
[inaudible] he'd be like,

1029
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:44,980
well you leave your girl [inaudible]
she's going to come out of butthole for

1030
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:48,110
sure.
You will come from your butthole

1031
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,570
can make it come from your bud
off. Fucking real good. Jeez.

1032
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:59,800
JKD yellow sunglasses off. You're going
to paint them brown with all that bucket.

1033
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:05,560
I think he's definitely
going on with you today.

1034
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,300
You know what?
We should do it down for later butthole.

1035
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,250
Oh

1036
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,120
yeah.

1037
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:19,170
I want to talk a little bit about the
white tigers practices because in this DVD

1038
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:21,930
we're using some of the
techniques from that practice.

1039
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,820
I practice as a white tigers for about
a year and one of the premises and

1040
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:29,750
there's a lot to the practice.
A lot. It's a lot too.

1041
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,340
I bet he knows. Oh, on your face. He
knows about white tigress practice.

1042
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:35,263
I bet he does.

1043
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,410
I love that scene.
That's such a,

1044
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:42,411
it's such a typical scene from an action
film where he's training and Gung Fu.

1045
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:44,910
He's training the girl or
the two of them are training.

1046
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:48,330
It's like the Matrix does it.
It's the karate kid moment.

1047
01:11:48,331 --> 01:11:51,750
The Mister Miyagi Roman mentor
moment. Yeah. It's so awful.

1048
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,183
Oh,

1049
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:00,340
this was shot. No sense. This
is how this went. They said,

1050
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,120
we have an idea for a movie and we
want you to be in a Steven. Well,

1051
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,520
tell me about it.
Yeah,

1052
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,330
well you're going to be this bad ass and
you're going to kill the other boss and

1053
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:12,610
you're going to make this girl come
out of her butt and you're going to,

1054
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:17,290
you know, all of this crazy
person. He's a problem is

1055
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,020
all we have right now are iPhones
to shoot it on. And he goes,

1056
01:12:23,021 --> 01:12:27,370
that's not a problem. And they
go, you sure I don't mind. Well,

1057
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,110
the thing is we need to raise
financing to make this movie.

1058
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:35,770
I'll pay for it. No Shit. I'll
give you thousand dollars.

1059
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,020
And then they're like,
okay,

1060
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,190
that's enough to buy chargers for
all the iPhones that made this film.

1061
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,660
And then to edit it and I moved,

1062
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,590
comes with your mind, your will,
your fucking iPhone. Nailed it.

1063
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,890
And then they were like, no, I think we
have enough money to make this movie now.

1064
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,410
He was like, make the
fucking movie. Right.

1065
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,763
What the fuck

1066
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,850
lot of Miss Shabi um, blended. The
bullets are ricocheting off anything.

1067
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:03,770
None of them are hitting glass.

1068
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,510
No, no. It's terrible that guys, that
guys, I don't know who these two are.

1069
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:11,603
I Dunno.

1070
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:16,610
Imagine if they just thought they
played this trailer on the radio.

1071
01:13:16,611 --> 01:13:19,940
Like they play movie trailers. If you've
seen this, you'd be like, what the fuck?

1072
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:23,750
Black Bang, Bang, Bang, remain.
And also when does this ever end?

1073
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,130
Well, it's ever, ever been. This is,

1074
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,940
we're halfway through it and this
is the longest hurler my life.

1075
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,400
And not only that,
usually when there's a motorcycle scene,

1076
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,820
they'll play the audio of the room.
They're not,

1077
01:13:34,821 --> 01:13:37,730
they didn't even bother putting
the audio of the motorcycle.

1078
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,060
No going fast and they used

1079
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:45,350
the same effect for the gun
over and so I'm the gun. That's

1080
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:49,020
when he pulls out a handgun.

1081
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,330
That guy,
who the fuck is this

1082
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:58,170
sky? I don't know athletes like just run
on that building and jump out. Right?

1083
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:00,853
Motorcycle.

1084
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:01,720
Hello.

1085
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,430
It is finally pay for that

1086
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:11,430
by tomorrow.
I'm not going to spend the of my life.

1087
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,860
He said I wanted to fucking

1088
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:18,220
in this tray by tomorrow.
You can actually hear him say that.

1089
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:21,820
I couldn't hear because the audio
was because the mix is really cool.

1090
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,620
Do you look at the IRS?
Look at him,

1091
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:27,490
look at how crazy and his
eyes are so bloated. Shut.

1092
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:30,280
You can barely see the eyes.
Look,

1093
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:34,780
he's such a bloated salty mess
and we're rolling. Where am I?

1094
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:38,350
Yellow sunglasses. Uh, somebody
got Steven's the sunglasses.

1095
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,700
How? How drunk was he the night
before and he's eating up lines.

1096
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,330
A shit is fucked.

1097
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,690
Look how black is so dark.

1098
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,910
Hey,
the Adam is money

1099
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:56,723
tomorrow.

1100
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,890
I'm not going to spend the rest of my
life looking over my shoulder near Neren.

1101
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,280
I don't even want to know
how this ends. Well, why?

1102
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,890
Because there's a fucking
minute and a half to go. Wait,
look how bad that is too.

1103
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,740
It's like splatter paint.
Oh, I gave you 1000 bucks.

1104
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,820
Good catch.
Casual from the crafty tall.

1105
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,500
This is the guy that was
just on the telephone.

1106
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,710
Do the only reason I know
that it's because of the
tattoo. He was on the phone.

1107
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,410
I think that's the guy that was just
saying, I don't want to look over my back.

1108
01:15:24,411 --> 01:15:29,320
Neren look, if you throw some
hot coffee on him, oh, blood.

1109
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,600
It will be a page that's
dead. Fuck. Listen to me.

1110
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:40,220
I've made 55,000 a little bit.
He's a piece of shit. Well, wait,

1111
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:42,950
what's going to happen? I don't even
want to know. It's so upsetting.

1112
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,280
Can we just forward a little, I got
to know, maybe we can put it together.

1113
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,840
Just mystery.
I'm going to jump ahead.

1114
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:55,550
Yeah. We're at two 48 I'm going to jump
all the way. One minute ahead. Okay.

1115
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:59,750
This isn't the subtlety of Downton Abbey.
This full minute ahead.

1116
01:15:59,751 --> 01:16:02,360
What happens a minute later?
Let's see something crazy.

1117
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:07,850
Z Shit's

1118
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:11,300
happening. Exact same shit.
He's wearing black sunglasses.

1119
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:22,840
This is terrible. This is, and why
is he have this Bandana? I email?

1120
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:26,470
No,
I'm the king of wardrobe.

1121
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,570
Same outfit.
Every scene.

1122
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:35,590
Thank all the big bang.
They saved the money for that coming soon.

1123
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,240
Just soonish I dunno. No, we're
done editing on the Mac book.

1124
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,280
Here's what I want to show you.
I don't know

1125
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:51,210
Stephen C Gow on Michael.

1126
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:57,190
There we go. So this is it.
This is what I wanted to show.

1127
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:58,990
So they're in the movie together,
which is what,

1128
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:04,030
cause I remember seeing this a while ago.
Hollywood tough guy. In your opinion,

1129
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,680
you've accepted. Of course.
When you say tough guide,

1130
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,010
you mean martial artists are
just timing. I mean Steven, for

1131
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,940
real. If he was on the street and there
was a situation you wanted this Hollywood

1132
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:16,700
guide by your side because
he could defend himself.

1133
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,490
So do you understand that
the question clearly?

1134
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,530
Just one moment. Yeah. I got to point
it out because I have the same problem.

1135
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:28,400
I bags look at the
bloated mess. Yes. That,

1136
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,850
and I know this cause I fucking
have the same problem. This is diet.

1137
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:35,090
This is all night drinking,
eating sausage,

1138
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:40,280
pork rinds for breakfast and look at
the Chins. Yeah, I know. It's a lot.

1139
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:45,170
It's a lot. It's a lot. This is all diet
is all what you put into your mouth. Yeah.

1140
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,093
Yeah.

1141
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:49,110
So our buddy there,
so he's asking,

1142
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,380
he's asking him which
Hollywood tough guy would you,

1143
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:59,220
if you were in a real situation,
would you want by your side?

1144
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,320
Okay. Okay. And he's like,

1145
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:10,610
it's that hard to think of a legit one.
Can you think of one?

1146
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,243
Michael Jai White.

1147
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,160
Can I laugh in your face? Really? Yes.

1148
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:28,130
Pretty crazy, right? Holy Shit on
him. But he's in the movie. I know.

1149
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,260
Years later. I mean that
was, well, not years,

1150
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:32,370
but that was probably a
couple of years old. And, um,

1151
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:37,240
but I just thought it was interesting
that he was like, do you see his,

1152
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:41,540
his eye roll? He was like,
yeah, John, I think your face.

1153
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:49,150
Oh Wow. Yeah. Wow. I
really put him on blast.

1154
01:18:49,151 --> 01:18:52,030
Like you put them on the Liz asked for

1155
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:55,130
sure. Is there anything
else I wanted to show you?

1156
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,270
Anything else we need to talk about?

1157
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:59,940
Yeah, there's tons. I mean look, I've
got some other topics. First of all,

1158
01:18:59,941 --> 01:19:03,630

saying? Huge News. What's that? Uh,

1159
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:08,090
we got a lot of emails translating
that Juggalos clip from last.

1160
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,130
Ah, yes, yes, yes. Um,

1161
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:17,090
that was um, pretty difficult
to understand. If, uh,

1162
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:22,280
if you missed last week, I'll give you
a little bit of a taste of this. This,

1163
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,550
I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck this guy was saying.

1164
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:31,950
Well we blew up boy here and
you might recognize this shirt.

1165
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:36,180
This is the same shirt monoxide was
wearing in the homeys video. Oh,

1166
01:19:36,181 --> 01:19:40,790
I believe juicy j also born in a three,
six mafia video too. Right, right, right,

1167
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:43,170
right. Anyways, that's not
what the video's about.

1168
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:48,410
This video was about the mighty dark
carnival and how only real juggle is true

1169
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,960
down ass.
Real Juggalos believe in a dark carnival.

1170
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:56,990
Believe that the carnival is God and they
all Juggalos find them mother Faco and

1171
01:19:57,361 --> 01:19:58,200
the hatchet man.

1172
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,600
Alright. Anyways, yeah,

1173
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:05,290
we got some kind emails explaining from
like former Juggalos what this guy is

1174
01:20:05,841 --> 01:20:08,520
talking about and I don't
think you want to know.

1175
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:10,890
Do you want to hear a
little bit? Sure. Okay.

1176
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,060
What he was referring to about the joker
cards was a six major albums that ICP

1177
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:18,840
came out with as a series and he's
sugar card has a deity slash. Entity.

1178
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:22,200
The only one that did it was the first
album called the carnival of carnage.

1179
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,740
Each of the characters perform some.
It's like, no thanks. Like I get,

but no thanks.

1181
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,910

Juggalos talking about no, no, no, no,

1182
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,980
but thank you. I appreciate you guys

01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:37,890
Would you rather needs for a
new song for the introduction?

1200
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,450
We also need it for fill her
up. Um, the filler up is a,

1201
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:46,300
I guess a well known, so I don't, I
didn't know, but it's a well known oh,

1202
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,750
Mexican Mariachi.
Yeah.

1203
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,150
Yeah. So that's really
good. I thought so. Um,

1204
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:59,170
if you guys want your song to

01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:07,080
Send an email to your mom's
podcasts@gmail.com and put
fill her up anthem in the

1207
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:12,460
subject line. Same thing here for
would you rather a, so here's,

1208
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:14,530
here's one that just came in here.
Let's see how it is.

1209
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,740
This would mean that you hear this
and it's would you rather time right?

1210
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,230
Can
Show it's pretty chill.

1211
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:32,223
Nice.

1212
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:49,430
I kinda like it. I like it. It's good.
Um, do you have any other ones? Yeah,

1213
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:53,570
there should be a couple more
in here. Right? Um, okay.

1214
01:22:53,571 --> 01:22:55,700
What'd you rather theme?
Here's another submission

1215
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,430
cause the thing is,
the first one was great,

1216
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,940
but I think we need the energy to be a
little higher because it's kind of a bag

1217
01:23:26,941 --> 01:23:31,860
of chips. Moman bullhorns
it's chips in a bowl.

1218
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,870
One also has feelings.

1219
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:37,983
What's it going to be?

1220
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,980
Tock. Tick Tock, right. That's
good. Which do you choose?

1221
01:23:41,981 --> 01:23:45,220
Right from Ryan.
Patrick.

1222
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,710
The first one was from how the air.
Nice.

1223
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:54,550
And then another one came in here.
Another would you rather submission?

1224
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:59,550
Let's see. Oh, is that an odd? Yeah.

1225
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:01,743
Oh,

1226
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,523
might be

1227
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:07,700
the top layer.

1228
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,490
Oh Shit.
Okay.

1229
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,900
That was obviously not the way I wanted
to play that we had a knock at the door

1230
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:25,760
and we needed to get it. Um, so here it
is again. A check this, this is another,

1231
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:26,870
would you rather submission

1232
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:35,950
the top layer

1233
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:53,700
sex?
Where did your sister give a face?

1234
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:59,700
Grandmother walks him masturbating
and never have another orgasm.

1235
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:05,010
[inaudible]

1236
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:13,360
yeah, that's great. Listen,
they're all stupendous.

1237
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:16,600
This is just a for a segment.
I think it's got the tone.

1238
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:20,480
It's got the upbeatness we're
looking for context too.

1239
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:27,220
Oh, that's our body of course.
Crushing it again. Newman.

1240
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,330
This guy's home runs always maximum.

1241
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:37,800
All of these come on now him Max and make
it your life. You know what I'm saying?

1242
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:43,710
Max Newman.
He did breezy.

1243
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:45,600
Oh.
Oh God.

1244
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,320
He did love seeing an email from him.

1245
01:25:49,321 --> 01:25:54,321
Right now we all know way what jeans he
so I said that I wanted to make a song

1246
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:59,370
called your problems.
Make my Dick's off for a long time.

1247
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:04,970
He submitted something. Oh Man, we
missed. Yeah. He said it like a month ago.

1248
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,033
Hmm.

1249
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,950
Tasks. That should be my dad's
theories. That is his thing.

1250
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:01,660
This is awesome. His theme.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

1251
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,950
Unbelievable backs now. That
really is, that's amazing.

1252
01:27:05,951 --> 01:27:10,140
So good dude. What a talent
this guy is. Well, look,

1253
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:12,660
I think we're settled
on that was you rather,

1254
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:16,210
although I want to thank Javier
and Ryan for their submissions,

1255
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:21,580
those are really good as well. Um,
but let's focus on the fill her up.

1256
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,350
Seal her shut. Yeah. We
need new music for that.

1257
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:31,360
I actually feel like it wouldn't be
bad if we can keep it in that Mariachi

1258
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:34,300
theme. Yeah. I mean why
not stick to the roots?

1259
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,960
I think the roots of
it are good cause some,

1260
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:40,080
some kind of Mexican flavor that
led to Latin flavor. That'd be fun.

1261
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:45,030
Maria Maniaci is a specifically
Mexican. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

1262
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:51,070
I like that box. It's like I'll, yes.

1263
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:56,800
Um, is that it? Jeans? Anything
else? Hold on. I got to see.

1264
01:27:56,801 --> 01:28:00,070
I got, we, we covered the double
pipe. That was a huge deal. We moved,

1265
01:28:00,071 --> 01:28:03,050
we didn't even talk about
that. We didn't move, man.

1266
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:07,810
I have a new blog that's big news.
Big News. It's on my youtube page.

1267
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,810

1268
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,400
let's cover it on the next episode.
It's too big a topic.

1269
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:19,810
I don't want to do it at the
very end. Okay. Uh, but, uh,

1270
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:24,640
what is it? It's about the day. Oh,

1271
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,410
that's okay. Yeah, we'll do
that next time. I also hold on.

1272
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:34,240
Um, no, I'm thinking, wait, no,

1273
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:38,710
I can wait if you wait. Shrimp. Nibblers I
covered that. Okay. Okay. That was great.

1274
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:41,920
I thought that was a great show.
It was. That was really fun.

1275
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,710
It's better the second time around,
you know, back. Come on back.
