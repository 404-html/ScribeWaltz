00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,480
It's already got all the qualifications

46
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,860
Shirtless. Oh, of course. Bad Tattoos.
It's all there. That's how we do it, man.

47
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:40,640
It's how we do this show.
Let's go. All right dude,

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,580
I just have to go off real
quick about racism. Okay. Okay.

49
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,470
Fuck.
Why people

50
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,530
don't bring it in one into this.

51
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,570
Well,
go to your mom's house.

52
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,410
Yeah. Um, first let me, before I forget,

53
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:10,411
mentioned thank you to everybody that
came out to the all new Braya Improv.

54
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,120
Oh, how was, it was beautiful. It's great.

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,910
What's the difference from
between the old one? Well,

56
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,540
it's about 45 yards away from the old one.
Yeah.

57
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,880
And it's bigger.
It's much bigger.

58
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,020
And the old capacity was like
three 75 and this one's five 50.

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,790
[inaudible] that's like a theater. Yeah,
it's a, it's basically a small theater,

60
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,280
but crowds were amazing.
Uh, it's, you know, I've,

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,610
I've said this in a pose that
I've said it before to people.

62
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,800
There's nothing like the,

63
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,390
like the physical space that you're
comfortable with as a comic or performer.

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,320
The Old Breyer is the first club I
ever Mc to weekend at first club I ever

65
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,860
featured a weekend at. And the first
night I ever headlined headline,

66
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,810
all three first night you ever
headlined got road head broadhead? Yeah.

67
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,480
That's cool. I met her. And that's your,
your home. I forgot that I did for,

68
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,620
I forgot that. Yeah, you were,

69
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,830
you were out and bring out a lot in
the early two thousands when and then

70
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,090
started even like,

71
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:14,120
so then I worked a lot of weekends there
and then I had a monthly show for a

72
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:18,400
while. Um, [inaudible] gave
me Tuesday nights and I would
comp the shit out of it.

73
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,730
I mean, it would be like a free show,
but the crowds are always great to me.

74
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,070
Embryo. I just always had
a good time. So I always,

75
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:28,780
I've always loved going to break it to
do those weekends. And it was awesome.

76
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,880
It was really, it was my first time doing
an hour in two months. Is that right?

77
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,320
Oh yeah. I, I know, I'm just writing
mine that went away. And then, um,

78
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,790
yeah, so I haven't understand that
since I filmed the Netflix thing.

79
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,720
I know this is my,
my first set back in,

80
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,500
back in business here on a Thursday at the
store. It's been over two months. Dude.

81
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,020
It's a long time. It's crazy. It is a
longer one. Anytime. So Lazy. Right?

82
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,070
Yeah.
You're fucking crybaby

83
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,830
now. Were there a lot of mommies
in breath? A lot. Yeah. He saw,

84
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,650
he knew their mommy's
cause of their shirts.

85
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,910
They out that I had a Josh powder
came with me, who's great. And uh,

86
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,510
in his introduction he would always say,
you don't from your mom's house pocket.

87
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:20,860
And they go nuts. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, there's definitely a strong,

88
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,930
strong motherhood.

89
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,430
The strong mommy's down there. That's
good. That's fun. That's fantastic. Yeah.

90
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,740
Um, well look, I'm glad you're,
I'm glad to have you home.

91
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,450
I like it when you
sleep in bed next to me,

92
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,630
even though now you're onto a
brand new serial killer show.

93
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,810
I am a killer and I've been talking
telling people about it online.

94
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,030
You have to,
you're also right.

95
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,490
Big Fan. Not at all. Not at all.
Not at all. He did something

96
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,830
never seen you do. If you guys don't know
this is a new Netflix series that um,

97
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,210
what it does is it features
people on death row, uh,

98
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,630
who have murdered or you know,
in this, in the one case, in,

99
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:04,320
in the second episode, it's a guy who was
present with some, you know what I mean?

100
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,330
You know,
a lot of states if they are like,

101
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,800
like if I drive and you kill
someone and then we drive away,

102
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,420
I get charged too. So there's a guy
like that. But in the first episode,

103
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,130
which you were exposed to,

104
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,080
you sat on the bed and stared down and
that was like, can you believe that?

105
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,270
And you were like,
I'm not listening and I'm not looking.

106
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,540
I don't want this to permeate
my mind. I don't know. And I,

107
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,390
and I say this like with like,

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,600
I try to be open minded because I want
us to be able to share things in common,

109
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,880
but it's so depressing.
Just the tone and then hearing like how,

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,820
how clearly they,
these people came from bad,

111
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,390
the first one backgrounds
and the Robertson depressing.

112
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,920
Oh my God, his life is
such a day. And by the way,

113
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,740
happy you are discussing.
I mean look at the smile on your face.

114
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,350
I mean there's the funny parts are funny.
I'll give them that,

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,260
but the parts are definitely very sad.

116
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,270
You were also exposed to how bad he looks.
Holy Shit.

117
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,560
That guy looks like uncle
fester on the poster. He

118
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,560
also looks like in return of the Jedi
when Darth Vader's mass comes off and you

119
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:19,220
see the ground.
Yeah.

120
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,740
And like the dark circles and he's
like Warren and you see like just a sad

121
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,300
broken look like a sick man.

122
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,460
What's weird is it says
in the first episode,

123
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,360
um, you know, they featured him in the,

124
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,450
in the interview and then
the state of Florida let,

125
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,280
let him be interviewed 65 days later.
So they do a followup interview.

126
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,270
He looks so much better.
Like the black circles are gone.

127
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,750
They let them go to club med for a week.
I don't know what happened,

128
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,300
but that guy's life story when you
really, really think about it. Yeah,

129
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,400
it is horrific. Well my
favorite is, I think he goes,

130
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,890
I had a normal and I was like,

131
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,450
I don't think you did just
before he turned 17 I don't
think he was sentenced to

132
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:02,880
10 years in prison. Okay.
So just a normal level

133
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,840
bringing in Florida prison
for more than 37 years.

134
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,850
Jesus. And he's only like fucking like
50 or something, you know, or yeah,

135
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,193
it's pretty bad.

136
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,920
And that, and what part makes you
laugh the hardest? He has a couple,

137
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,310
he has a couple of funny,
funny beats. Like when he goes,

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,510
he talks about he killed his
cellmate and then he's like,

139
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,610
I wish I had access to a soundboard now.
So I could play the psycho.

140
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Like
as we're talking, he goes,

141
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:37,330
I killed the soundboard and the next
studio. Sure, sure. He goes, I killed my,

142
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,580
my cellmate. And then he looks at the
interviewer and he's like, he goes,

143
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,840
I don't feel bad about it. And he goes,
and he lasts like that. He goes, I know.

144
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:48,080
You're like, oh, this guy's
crazy. It's pretty funny.

145
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,120
And then they interviewed
a former former cellmate,

146
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,320
obviously the one that he killed and
the guy goes, he likes sits down.

147
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,570
And you could tell by the way,

148
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,630
by the weight it's set up by the dialog
that the guy who's featured the killer

149
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:10,100
of the death row guy told the producers,
oh, you should interview this guy.

150
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,580
Like it's implied. Right, right. And
he goes, I don't know why he told you,

151
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:18,110
interview me. I'm not as Frat guys.
A piece of shit. That's funny.

152
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:21,680
That was funny. And he talks about
like how big of a piece of shit he is.

153
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:25,010
He's like, okay, I don't
respect him at all. He's like,

154
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,270
he is a fucking pariah. He just,
yeah, he just will go after anybody.

155
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:31,670
He thinks he can get away with it on
and he's like, he's a horrible person.

156
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,010
It's to, it's terrible. And even just the
sounds of the show, cause like you said,

157
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,870
I didn't look at the screen. I just
look down the whole time. Yeah.

158
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,390
The sounds of the show. The
general tone, the Beige Ness,

159
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,120
no js definitely like depressing. And
then comedy, like it goes back and forth.

160
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:50,470
Sure. But sure. There's some
sad parts. I just can't,

161
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,900
I can't watch stuff where I just
know that there's suffering.

162
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,880
There's too much suffering for me. I
don't like white bummer shit. This is,

163
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,900
this is another caveat. There's
like a white bummer tangent. You,

164
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,420
you know what I mean? Yeah. Crime
shows kids with cancer, people falling.

165
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,000
I was hoping, I mean, I'm, I'm not

166
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,280
series yet. I haven't, I'm hoping for, uh,

167
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,610
a little more psycho
detached like crazy person.

168
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah. A little less. Oh my
life. You know, it was real sad.

169
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,200
And this is this a thing I'm
hoping more funny and less.

170
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,230
It's coming up. Yeah. Yeah.
And did you watch this?

171
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:28,500
While I was falling asleep last night
too. I did. I started episode two. Okay.

172
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,710
Which uh,

173
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,470
thank you for doing that so that it leaks
into my unconscious mind as I sleep.

174
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,220
Yeah. That one was, that one was pretty
sad too. I'm hoping it gets funnier,

175
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,810
but it's,
well,

176
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,700
I got to fall asleep to the
sweet sounds of a El Chapo that

177
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm Spanish.
I got to hear a cobbler

178
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,150
where I recognize one of the,
so there's only El Chapo,

179
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,090
a Mexican series that I think there's,

180
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,680
I don't know how many seasons of
it or on Netflix. And I started it.

181
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,200
And here's the thing,
you always roll the dice with these,

182
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:06,270
especially with these Latin
American productions. Why
is that? Well, I mean the,

183
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,900
the shows that we get to see on like,
you know, the soaps and stuff and like,

184
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,030
like Mexican or mango and sat and
land. It's horrible. It's so bad.

185
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,740
And so I go, is this going to
be like a Hokey cheesy show?

186
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,790
Like I didn't know if it's going to be
good or really goofy and shitty and it's

187
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,550
actually really good. You know, it's a,

188
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,920
it's basically the narcos story,

189
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:35,240
but of Chapo and yeah,
the actors are great.

190
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,670
The production values is great.

191
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,060
They have a couple American English
speaking actors in small parts on it,

192
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,160
and I swear one of them,
uh, looks so familiar to me.

193
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,330
I think he was in my [inaudible] class.

194
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,870
I got gotta look it up.
I'll look it up. But uh,

195
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,190
sounded really peaceful and nice too.
It's another fun thing to fall asleep to.

196
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,900
Thank you for that. Um, yeah,
so that's, that show has done,

197
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,470
has done very well.
I guess they're,

198
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,310
they're looking at a possibly
doing a season four right now. Hmm.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,050
It is. It's him. Yeah.
Yeah. I know this dude. Yup.

200
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,820
Wow. Yeah. Holy Shit. I
gotta reach out to him.

201
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,820
So his name is Dave.
Oh, hello. Nice. Yeah.

202
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,290
Good for Dave working. Dave's
doing it, man. Sullen, dude.

203

stuff? That's cool, dude. You should, uh,

204
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:37,540

can speak Mexican fluently. Thank you.

205
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,850
That's all I hear. I mean, she got
wrong. Maybe he moved to align to align.

206
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,610
Maybe he moved. Oh, I don't want
you to move to Mexico to work.

207
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,220
Do a do a line from Chapo. Come on.
Pretend you're in it. I latching Galloway.

208
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,360
Yeah. Gene gunk. All the Mexican
slang makes me, let's Chin gone.

209
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,610
It's just fucking Mexican Mexican slang.

210
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,910
Fuck and fuck it are like, yeah. Yeah.

211
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,010
I like, I like how that sounds.
That's what I grew up listening to.

212
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,800
I as somebody who knows Dave, Holler
at me, man. Dave. Oh, hello. Okay.

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,780
Now we used to hang out all the
time. Yeah. David's cool dude. Well,

214
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:21,870
she took my first headshots. Then
when you're like, you get here,

215
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,620
you have no money. You need like heck

216
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,610

Um, I don't know what I'm
Paul. Me. Yeah. I see. He did.

217
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,830
He did. Loving Pablo and
what's Blanca is, that's it.

218
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,300
It's like another Mexican thing.
Blanca. That's your aunt shit. Blanca.

219
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,730
Anyways, day was a good dude, man.
Good for him. Language, Spanish.

220
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,820
He's doing all Spanish language.
That's a great lane to be in, Huh?

221
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,220
Yup. Tom, you need to be applying
for these jobs. Dave hired

222
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,160
me in Mexico. In Espanol. Yeah.

223
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,490
Say Hablo Espanol bloat a spine.
Yo.

224
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,330
I like when your dad speaks Spanish.
He's really fluent. You know Tami,

225
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,180
when you were a little boy used to say
Cargill make daddy cargomatic courier,

226
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,360
you'd say Gargan May.
I think your dad speaks Spanish.

227
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,350
The worst of anybody.

228
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,990
I knew that if they hired him the
worst in the Spanish speaking,

229
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,410
so it'd be the best. He just walks in
the room. He's like, can I come back?

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,010
And they're like, we're not going
to carry you Sir Kerrick. Me.

231
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,490
That's all he knows.
And now we have the new version of that,

232
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,190
which is our son going, I hold
you and how old you are. So cute.

233
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,690
Can you please,
can we please pull up this Instagram thing

234
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm talking about when a mute it because
I don't want it to get taken down.

235
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,500
Oh right. Yeah. Okay. It's a visual thing.
So if you guys are watching on Youtube,

236
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,620
you're blessed with what we're
about to show you. If you're not,

237
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:52,520
if you're just listening, I will
describe to you what it is we're seeing.

238
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:56,150
Cause it's so ridiculous.
So I follow Elizabeth Gilbert,

239
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,180
she's the writer who did eat, pray love.
Um, basically it's based on, you know,

240
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,270
the book where uh,

241
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,010
she splits with her husband and then
she falls in love with another man there

242
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,390
together for 14 years.

243
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:13,391
And recently in the last few years she
hooked up with her best female friend and

244
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,550
is like, oh, I'm a lesbian now.

245
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,140
Now the horrible part of this is that
the female friend she's been friends with

246
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:24,830
forever has just passed away of cancer.
And so she,

247
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,320
Kendall,

248
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,510
they came together just as this woman
was diagnosed with cancer and so she had

249
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:34,511
to watch her mate essentially die and
be ravaged by this horrible thing.

250
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,190
Now that being said,

251
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I still find a way to make fun of her
and on her Instagram she posted this

252
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:48,290
thing, um, that grief is
a full body experience.

253
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,880
Can you please push play on this?
And I want everyone to watch this.

254
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,160
It's so embarrassing. And so she's doing
like, this is her, this is her friend. No,

255
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,130
this is her and this Elizabeth Gilbert.
No baby. You have to read the caption.

256
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,170
Oh, it looks like her
answers. My beloved friend,

257
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,070
Oh, was rye as ex wife Elizabeth. Yeah.

258
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,191
Anyways,

259
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:17,160
so there's this woman doing this
interpretive dance of grief in her,

260
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,800
in her kitchen and,
oh,

261
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:25,880
it's so embarrassing. Like if you're
watching it, and I keep like, I keep,

262
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,650
I get it that this is like, I have
empathy and this is sympathy and whatever,

263
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:35,270
and this is real for
this person. I like, oh,

264
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,300
so embarrassed when I see it. You should
be embarrassed. It's embarrassing.

265
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,190
So embarrassing. Totally embarrassing.
And she's doing like, ah, it's,

266
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,800
it just looks like,
you know what it looks like.

267
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:50,300
It looks like when a white person
goes to Jamaica. Yeah. Or Ghana

268
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,450
or something. And then they see
locals dance and then they're like,

269
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,840
I learned this and you're like,
please stop doing that.

270
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,280
It's the African anteater
dance. And she, it's so sad.

271
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,310
It's so earnest and sincere and it's only
because I don't have the connection to

272
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:11,010
my emotions to do something like
this. Of course, I'm so disconnected.

273
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,560
I could never do this. I mean,
of course this is probably,

274
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,160
they're probably better people. So much
better. Yeah. Well, I sent this to me,

275
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,530
I'd rather not be a good person.
Then

276
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,320
I sent this to a comedian friend
of mine and she's like, oh my gosh.

277
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:30,120
I was crying and I was like, really?
I was crying laughing at this shit.

278
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,130
This is ridiculous.
I'm like,

279
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,600
I must have no soul
because I mean I get like,

280
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:40,290
I get that you feel this way, but then
isn't there a level of like, don't why?

281
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,210
Why do you have to share it? She says,
we dance because it hurts too much.

282
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,073
Not Too.

283
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,310
We dance because we are
so grateful to this love.

284
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,330
Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed
by it. And then she says,

285
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,150
don't let this out of you cause grief.

286
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,070
It was settled in your bones and make
you sync with pain so you can grieve.

287
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,540
You can grief move through you.
You can help grieve,

288
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,470
move through you with music
and with dance. But do I
have to do this? I hope not.

289
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,180
If you did this over some grief,

290
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,360
I mean I just want you to know
that I would openly mock you. Also,

291
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,970
I do pilates twice a week.

292
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:27,830
Does that count as movement that just
keep it there and don't post it online?

293
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,430
Why do white ladies feel like they
have to share all their feelings? Well,

294
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,220
it's only a certain lane of white
lady who I happened to find the least

295
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:39,300
attractive of all white ladies.
Really?

296
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,750
Like why fucking white ladies have
to share their fucking let me guess.

297
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,840
They went to all women's college.

298
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,090
This kind of shits
encouraged multiple degrees.

299
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,800
I get it. [inaudible] studies
major. I know the worst.

300
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,010
Literally the worst cause my
least favorite person to be.

301
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,930
Of course I'm related to a ton of them.
Well look,

302
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,890
it's not that I don't,

303
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,560
I believe in all that stuff
and I behind it intellectually.

304
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,170
I just don't want to hear about it.
I don't want to like get on.

305
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,150
I just want to be bombarded by all the
time and I'm sorry her friend died or I

306
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:15,840
mean that's sad.

307
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,020
That's what I'm saying that I can't
help but make fun of people who express

308
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,060
their feelings.
But that's your job.

309
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,450
Don't you understand that you
shouldn't feel badly about it.

310
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,890
It's your job to mock people
who are sincere and earnest.

311
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,630
That's the world needs balance.

312
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,650
The world needs balance in the
world needs people like her.

313
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,120
It's who are sincere and
in touch with their suite,

314
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,780
and she will inspire people
to take that sincerely. Yeah.

315
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,340
But because there's
balance in the universe,

316
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,420
the world also has people
like us shitheads. Yeah.

317
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,250
Who will point and laugh
and mock and you know what?

318
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,330
People enjoy us for that. Some people
would get upset and truthfully,

319
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,710
maybe one day, many years down
the line will go, you know,

320
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,480
I used to laugh at that and now I don't,

321
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,380
and that'll be a different time
in our life, but for right now,

322
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,740
our job is to mock this person
for grieving like an asshole.

323
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,530
Other people's sincerity is my hilarity.
That's the fuel that I live on. You.

324
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,010
I'm such a Dick. Yeah. You don't
know that you're a big asphalt. No.

325
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:31,370
I mean, sometimes I, I'm
aware of it. I'm like, God,

326
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:35,180
I love being a professional asshole. It's
great. But then I'm like, how does that,

327
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:37,550
is that the line here?
Or like,

328
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,370
I'm not like that woman's
grieving and she's like,

329
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:44,240
I'm doing an interpretive dance on my
grief. I mean, like the truth is to like,

330
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:46,670
I don't agree with, that's
how you agree. Personally.

331
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,980
I've grieved that I didn't do that
thing alone. Crying hard. Yeah.

332
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,310
Feel kind of sick.
Yeah.

333
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,233
Drink a lot.

334
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,930
Stay in a dark room and kind of sit
in your depression. Yeah, but not,

335
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:06,040
not this Ernest shit, this dance
thing. I'd be like, fuck you,

336
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,030
I want to punch something.
So if I got like this,

337
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:14,020
you don't think you can handle it? No,
absolutely not. Absolutely not. No Way.

338
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,880
If you were doing that for real to grieve,
I would just be like, look, you know,

339
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,550
of course do it. Like I don't
want to be anywhere around it.

340
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,960
Please keep it in another
room. Do it upstairs. Yeah.

341
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,010
I tell you to come in here. I go stay
in the studio. I'll be somewhere else.

342
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,240
And I also think that this lends itself,

343
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:37,460
cause right now we're in an
era of nonstop sharing. Uh,

344
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,900
the earnest shares, you know,
you see them on Facebook,

345
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:43,290
the oversee the medical
over shares. Like, uh,

346
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,910
my mom's a festering wound on her foot's
getting better guys. And you're like,

347
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:50,580
I don't want to know any
of the stuff about you. Um,

348
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,080
but there's definitely now a blurred
line between public and private.

349
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,430
You know,
like there's,

350
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,330
there's very little delineation nowadays
between what's public and what's

351
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:00,960
private.

352
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Like you and I had been seeing people
taking phone calls on speakerphone,

353
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,810
right. Like we were in the, in
a nice restaurant and this guy,

354
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:13,110
this dad has a speaker phone,
he is a speaker.

355
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:15,320
It's on speaker phone and
then he puts it up to his

356
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,570
yeah. And The lady goes
on a, a full, you know,

357
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,650
dynamic tires are, yeah. Yeah.
And then he's like, well,

358
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,760
I gotta I'm going to have a lunch now.
And then you use here as well,

359
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,490
Rah Rah Rah Rah at full volume full.
And he's holding it here. Yeah,

360
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,760
he's holding it up.
I don't think.

361
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,100
Maybe he didn't even know he was on
speaker phone and he's, he was old.

362
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,450
He was old. He was, he, he should
know better. He's gotta be dead now.

363
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,400
That was like five,
six days ago.

364
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,860
And then remember that guy in Starbucks
who did like a health insurance call or

365
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,270
something you said?
He was like,

366
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,070
he was on the phone with,
oh my God. You recorded him.

367
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,080
I did. I know I got to, he was on the
phone, I want to say with Bank of America.

368
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,080
Oh,

369
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,510
and what should be a private call because
you're talking about your finances

370
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,990
deco, obnoxious and
rude fucking shit. Bird.

371
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,620
What is wrong with people? Yeah.
Oh nope, that's not it. Um,

372
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,790
another thing I've been seeing are people
wearing how slippers in public spaces

373
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:24,564
as well.

374
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,570
Like I'm talking like Fuzzy Pink
House slippers to get on an airplane.

375
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,600
I side at Burbank airport. Like, look,
I'm not opposed to seeing people's feet.

376
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,550
That's not the problem.
I don't care.

377
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,230
But you're not supposed to wear
fuzzy slippers to like the mall,

378
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,640
the grocery store airplanes.
It's completely inappropriate.

379
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,930
It's just not footwear that's meant
to be outdoors. Dangerous actually.

380
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
Cause it's too flimsy.
A shoe.

381
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah.
It's silly.

382
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,810
It's not, it's not, it's inappropriate.

383
00:24:56,811 --> 00:25:00,770
I don't know what the fuck is happening
that people think the world is their

384
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:04,880
living room. It's obnoxious.
Yeah. I mean you used to,

385
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:06,890
people used to have shame
about that kind of stuff.

386
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:09,450
He tried to keep your
conversations private or worse.

387
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:12,830
Some people listen to their music or
watch videos at full volume. You're like,

388
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:16,550
dude, nobody wants to hear
your bullshit. No, of course.

389
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,830
And I'm very cognizant of that too,
cause we have a sign in some, you know,

390
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:25,600
if we take him out in public,
like we always like Shh,
quiet, don't yell. You know,

391
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:27,640
via, if we're showing them
video as well. He has, you know,

392
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,480
he's eating so that he focuses in minute.

393
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,700
We make sure that the volumes down so
that we're not disturbing other people.

394
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,660
Right. Of course. Yeah. It's
just so silly. People are
so horrible. Why don't you,

395
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:41,090
why are you trying to find this audio?

396
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,660
Trying to press pause
so you can look for it.

397
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,820
Yeah. One second. Okay. I, I
was able to pull this missy,

398
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,690
if I can make it actually play here.
This is, I found it on my phone.

399
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,700
I was just thinking about that
ladies interpretive dance.

400
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,850
The least comfortable with thinking about
it again. Like it made me like get it,

401
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:05,780
get, it makes me feel icky inside.
Yeah, that's right. It's so weird.

402
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,180
Why do people share that
fucking Shit Dude? Don't shh.

403
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,640
Don't share your feelings like that cause
they're more emotionally balanced in

404
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:16,610
you. I know. Um, it's just so
vulnerable. It's like ugh. Yeah. Gotcha.

405
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,050
So uncomfortable. This is so gross.
So it's like acoustic guitar singing.

406
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:25,180
I videoed this guy or slam
poetry at Starbucks. No, this is,

407
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,390
he's, he's just sitting there
with his phone by the way.

408
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,180
On a table. Yeah. Speaking of his
coffee on speakerphone. Crazy.

409
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,000
Full volume. Crazy person.
And we're all, you know,

410
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,430
trying to enjoy our days. Sure, sure.

411
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,940
Press Four for this,
two for that.

412
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,050
Like fuck everybody. Yeah. You
guys all listen to me beyond.

413
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,220
Yeah.

414
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,660
Like you want like it's bad enough when
you have to be on hold in your personal

415
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,930
life and now you got to hear some
other assholes being put on hold.

416
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,910
I don't think there's anything worse than
someone else's being put on hold that

417
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,920
shit up to your ear,
asshole.

418
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,450
You fucking make everyone else
listened to your hold stone.

419
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:20,020
A fucking scumbag.
What a scumbag.

420
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,000
Such a Dick.

421
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,240
Yeah.
Now you've got an offering.

422
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,230
Listen [inaudible] like you
want to hear any of that?

423
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,150
Do
you want to hear that right?

424
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,560
Someone else's fucking hold.
We're all sitting there just trying to

425
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,580
unwind. Have a coffee and we got to
hear your commercials. Unbelievable.

426
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,550
Such a piece of shit. What
an asshole. Yeah, like what?

427
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:55,330
What goes through people's minds that
that's acceptable behavior to put it on

428
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:58,390
speaker phone so everybody
gets to hear you being on hold.

429
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,280
He's a fucking psycho and he doesn't care.

430
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,910
Do you think it's just
like an unconscious,

431
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:05,560
like I'm claiming the space.

432
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,130
It's like public Whistler's like
people that are whistling. It's a way,

433
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:12,370
it's like what birds do to mark their
territory. Like everybody listened to me.

434
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm here,
I'm here.

435
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:19,230
He's so removed and he's so narcissistic
and so oblivious to the fact that that

436
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:23,920
would be bothersome to somebody else.
That's his personality.

437
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,190
This is my Starbucks. I don't,
I don't even think. Yeah,

438
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:29,260
I mean he doesn't like
if you were like to say,

439
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:32,830
do you think other people want
to hear the speakerphone? Uh,

440
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,700
hold stuff from Bank of America while
they're here? He would be like, what? Huh?

441
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,410
I don't know. I'm not like totally
unaware that he's even doing this. Yeah.

442
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,800
And if you pointed out that like no
one wants to hear that, he'd be like,

443
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:48,070
well yeah. Do you know what we need
right now in society? By the way,

444
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,020
you remember the Guardian Angels of the
80s those nerds that he used to dress up

445
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,970
and like fight crime for free and
like the New York subways and stuff,

446
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:01,750
we need to have the guardian
angels of proper public etiquette.

447
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:05,100
Now people who are designated,
they walk around and like uniforms.

448
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,400
So you can see like,
oh shit,

449
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,630
there's the Guardian Angel and that
person comes over and goes, excuse me,

450
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,920
you're being an asshole.

451
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,720
Nobody wants to hear Your Bank of
America on hold or a, excuse me,

452
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,870
Shit Bird.
You don't wear a fucking slippers.

453
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm thinking a little more aggressive.
Go for it.

454
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,030
Let's take it out of the
Philippines. Uh, I think it's,

455
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,920
I don't know if it's
president or prime minister.

456
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,590
He has a kill onsite policy
for drug dealers. Love it.

457
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,660
So like if he even thinks
you're a drug dealer, like it,

458
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,960
permission to shoot you in the head on
the streets. I think they should do it.

459
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,620
Yeah. For socially. Yeah.
Rude people execute.

460
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,870
Somebody goes right there murders that
guy in Starbucks and it's innocent.

461
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,230
And then everyone's like, what the fuck
are they like speak phone, full blast.

462
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,850
And here's how we do it.
It's a fucking bullet right in the brain.

463
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,410
So you see the splatter, the
blood splatter on the window.
And then like in China,

464
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:03,180
when people are students, China, they
send your family the bill for the bull.

465
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,880
You get a thing in the mail.

466
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,000
It's like you owe us a fucking dollar
28 and you know who else gets a fucking

467
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:10,834
bullet in the head?

468
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,900
Whoever their car breaks down during
rush hour traffic on the four oh five if

469
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,900
you're responsible,

470
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:21,850
your car breaks down at 5:00 PM on a
fucking Friday and it's your fault that

471
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:26,430
everyone else has now even further
fucks right in the fucking head. Yeah,

472
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,310
and we do it in public. We round
people up. Maybe we'll delay that.

473
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,181
You know what I mean?

474
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:34,270
Like at the end of the week we'll do all
the assholes that held up traffic was

475
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,890
Handmaid's tale. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. They all get around.

476
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:42,840
We all grab a rock and everybody gets
a chance to throw 11 person. I love it.

477
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,160
Yeah, I like it too, man.

478
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,420
Let's get through this guy who
hates white people real quick.

479
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,350
Everybody hates wiping.
I know. It's kind of

480
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,280
okay. You guys just have to go
off real quick about racism. Kay.

481
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,610
Kay. Fuck white people. Yeah.

482
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,270
Every culture has something like,
look at the Chinese,

483
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:03,510
they have like honor and Mike. Okay. Like

484
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,090
light, like native native
Americans, like Hispanic people.

485
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:13,890
They have like heritage and shit in
their culture, heritage and their shit.

486
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:19,560
Fucking hamburgers like kicking in the
fucking door on other countries and being

487
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:20,070
like,
hey,

488
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,400
we're better than you because we made
you do everything for us and what a bunch

489
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:25,980
of needy fucking wipe fuck white people.
Okay.

490
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,620
Yeah.
Is this the new professor over at uh,

491
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,200
Harvard sociology guy? Yeah, the
new FTT RTD professor over there.

492
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,963
He's the,

493
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,670
he's the vice admiral FTD.
Our

494
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,570
head of sociology.
Yeah.

495
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,260
Where are all the good white jokes?

496
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,550
There's a million white jokes about every
fucking light culture and they're all

497
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,730
[inaudible]. Why is there no good,
funny white jokes? Black home.

498
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,310
He told me this and I hit
the ground laughing. Yeah.

499
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,700
We are all the white jokes bro.
We are all the white jokes.

500
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,360
This guy's a real self loathing,
self hating.

501
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:14,220
Fucking why come? No. Why
jokes? I mean cool tattoos.

502
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,330
Yeah.
Super Cool.

503
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,980
Do your friend drew these
in your car while you were
driving and put them on you?

504
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,830
We are all the white jokes. Gosh,
that's really thought this through.

505
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:30,000
I like his presentation. He's very,
he's really trying to be deep.

506
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,040
Like he's one of those dudes.
It's like super dumb.

507
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:36,510
But he's making the town not being
Super Dad. Yeah. He's a, he's an FTT.

508
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:40,010
Rtd is an FTT RTD buddy.
So what happened?

509
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:43,820
Was he something like woke him up more?
He heard, he was like, yeah, yeah.

510
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:48,620
How come there are no white people
joke book jokes that's fucked up.

511
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,620
Like really opened his eyes.
Yeah.

512
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,480
And now he thinks he's having
a profound thought. Yeah.

513
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,710
This is the first thought he's had
that's like, oh, that was your share.

514
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,960
This one is big.
I think they need to share is PR.

515
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,280
Is there like a weight that's another
person that gets executed by the way.

516
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,840
The need to share people. Yeah. If
you're oversharing on social media,

517
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,600
bullet in the head. Oh, that'd
be a great one to eliminate.

518
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,340
I would love to kill everybody
that does. Yeah. I think the, uh,

519
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,870
the Elizabeth Gilbert Interpretive
Dancer gets a bullet right quick.

520
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,480
This guy is so stupid. He's so
dumb. Yeah. He's really not right.

521
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,580
I figured that part out.
Why?

522
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,860
Why come people Chinese of honor

523
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,330
and the native Americans have heritage

524
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,380
and his face too. Yeah.
They also have good food.

525
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,600
Yeah, there's Chinese. The Chinese,

526
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,190
what did he say? They have
their honor. Honor. And then
we are all the white jokes,

527
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:59,780
bro. Oh, we are all the wide Joe's by
being alive. We're all white jokes.

528
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,780
Yeah. Okay. I don't get
it. You know who's back?

529
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,390
I'd love to get to this before our guests.
Guests who?

530
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,830
Native American back and
crazier never race yet.

531
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,970
You're going to love it. It's so great.
Here you go. Here you go. Here you go.

532

Got The money. Okay. I got, yeah,

You Support Tom. Yep.
Okay. I was one of the

534
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,460
first endorsers. Public
endorsers. Uh, president Trump.

535
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,750
When not ocean level rises.
Okay. Hold on. I'm so excited.

536
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:39,300
And if you don't know a damn pain, yeah,
he's a, I don't have the drop ready,

537
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:43,710
but he's a, this is why you're
fucking poor. Yeah. He's a,

538
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:48,390
he's fucking be out. Shit. Who
gives a fuck? Yeah. I mean,

539
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,830
you want to know why you're all fucked up.
This guy's a genius.

540
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:56,970
This is the smartest man alive. Yet Dan
Pena should run for president. He's,

541
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,720
he would start our policy
of public execution and I
were discussing some of the

542
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,180
level of some of the things you have here.
Hold on.

543
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,860
This is why you're fucking poor,
right? [inaudible] this is Dan.

544
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,190
You know you won't, we featured
them on our show. Yeah, of course.

545
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,253
What did you put it?

546
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,910
Where is it?
You had a,

547
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,810
you have a fucking template script.

548
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,870
You have a mother fucking script that a
fucking monkey can read that Alex wants

549
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:29,190
a fucking case study because he wants
to know this shit behind it cause he's

550
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:32,740
stupid and that's why he's fucking poor.
Hey,

551
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,080
you don't need any
motherfucking case studies.

552
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,530
How many fucking times do I have
to say you had the fucking script.

553
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,010
There's Dan. I said, don't change
your fucking war on a square.

554
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,080
Not a comma.

555
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,490
If it's got missed the fucking
word sending down misspelled.

556
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,000
The last thing you
fucking need is a fucking

557
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,660
case study.
It's my coach I speech.

558
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,340
This is why your fucking
whore. Okay. There's Dan,

559
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,530

and really a friend of the show.

560
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,870
He and I kept in touch.

561
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,030
We DM on Twitter from time to time and
it just, we've had lunch with him. No,

562
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,530
he's really a treasure.
Got this aggressive persona,

563
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:25,640
but he's actually a very sweet man
to be around. Wonderful Gentleman.

564
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,780
Wonderful Guy. I didn't know about
this. This was just saying in,

565
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:34,781
but so this one was leading up to I think
like Dan Pena who gives a fuck about

566
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,130
the global warming I think.

567
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,110
Thank you for asking that question.

568
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,830
I have the answer for the question.

569
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,313
Okay.

570
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,440
We changing the gas now you're full of
shit. Sit down. I'm going to answer you.

571
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,470
Shut up and sit down.
Sit down.

572
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,310
Let's just take Florida for example,

573
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,660
which is one of the fastest growing
condominium beachfront condominiums on the

574
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:11,600
planet.
In the perspectives when you invest,

575
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,330
there should be in the footnotes.

576
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:18,860
If global warming this for
real and water wise is 10 feet.

577
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,290
This investment you made is fuck all.

578
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,390
Now one single investment
prospectus written since
2008 this century has alluded

579
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:35,500
to global warming.
Now one motherfucker.

580
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,980
So the people that have the money and
I'm jealous of the Vice President Gore,

581
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,520
which shall and I wrote on a plane from
South America with fears of I am jealous.

582
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:51,230
He came up with a scan before I did

583
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,310
because the financial institutions,
the banks of this world,

584
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,270
no,

585
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,360
it's not going to happen otherwise you
couldn't get a goddamn loan in London.

586
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,110
You know those 30 40 year mortgages,
the will be over by then.

587
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,530
Is Barclays bank going to give
you a motherfucking loan? That's

588
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,160
the best.
I love her.

589
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:20,800
I don't know what the hell he's
talking about but um, yeah,

590
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,160
he needs a TV show. Do you know
what I mean? Fuck Anderson Cooper,

591
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,630
pun on damn pain. Yeah. Every night.
If he had a TV show on scene, yeah,

592
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,060
I would watch this guy. Of course,
I don't have to agree with anything.

593
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,770
He's just entertaining

594
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,810
mother fucker,
but he can't be censored.

595
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,680
You have to let him roll like those
gotta be on like Hbo or showtime.

596
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,530
That's too like a fan. That's somebody
that was like, I have questions.

597
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,393
Shut up.

598
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,700
This guy's a trend for sure.
Bought a ticket to ask him. Yeah,

599
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,450
of course. Shut the fuck up. Well, she
also wants to fucking light him up.

600
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,463
Of course.

601
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,670
Like Dan Pena is going
to be an environmentally,

602
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,690
that's not his fucking lane.
Don't think the guy talking about,

603
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,760
she uses hillage guy.
He's a savage course.

604
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,980
I've watched the shit out of that. I would
love to have him on because he's easy.

605
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:28,180
He is a Trump supporter. I know.
He's the only, like, I feel like,

606
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:33,181
I think it's 97% of the scientists that
are experts in the field agree about

607
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,234
global warming,

608
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,860
but he is the only person I've
ever heard contested with.

609
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,310
How come? Financial institutions or real
estate. Yeah. Well how come they're like,

610
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,410
do you think they're going
to loan you something?

611
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,730
They're not going to
get back in a few years.

612
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,080
That it's actually not one that I've ever
heard before. So I would give him that.

613
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,940
Well, it's from his perspective, right?

614
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:58,290
That's what he deals in his money
and real estate and stuff like that.

615
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:01,830
But he is a white guy, so fuck white
people. I don't like them. Now. Um,

616
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,210
our guest should be here momentarily.

617
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:09,190
Should we take a quick break
and we'll be back in a moment?

618
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,630
All right. Here we are. Yeah,
we're back. Where we, uh,

619
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,640
we're back with our guests.
He's tall,

620
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,740
he's white and he's thin and
he's here still weak. Chin

621
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,810
is the great return guests. We've had
them on multiple times. Right. But the,

622
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,420
it's been a while. I spent a long
time. I think maybe I've done it twice.

623
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,760
Third time probably at a
different location every time.
Pretty much. Yeah. I think,

624
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:41,770
uh, the great map. Wronger thank you
for coming. This is a joy. Yeah. Love.

625
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:45,580
You guys know we love you man. It's
been way too long. Yeah. I feel like,

626
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:49,120
I mean talk, we started doing,
stand up. Three of us are in la.

627
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:53,200
Did stand up together like probably 15
years ago. Yeah, something like that.

628
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,580
I remember seeing you guys. I remember
the first time I saw each of you.

629
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,920
I remember the first time I saw you,
you didn't go up.

630
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,370
You were realizing you were visiting
from Chicago, you had a blazer on

631
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,080
and it was at like a maybe like a beige
colored Blazer and it was at Tangier,

632
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,250
I think I, we were like, you're like, oh.
And you were like Super Nice. I was like,

633
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,220
Oh fuck is this guy? Like,
cause he was like, Hey,

634
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:19,870
I'm at like really outgoing and nice.

635
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,140
Which is rare because people
are always stretched bags.

636
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,270
Matt was genuinely a nice
person. Nice person. Thank you.

637
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,850
I remember I used to wear like
blazers and tee shirts. It's a hot,

638
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,020
it's a hot look. But like, but
like I remember sometimes I'd

639
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,710
talk to comics and they'd be like,
oh, what's up man? Good thinking.

640
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,200
I was like an exam or something.
Oh, right, right. Just like,

641
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:41,430
cause they never seen me before and
they're just wondering, you know,

642
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,770
well and here too, I mean, I don't know
if it's nationwide, but la, anybody.

643
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,800
Oh,
under 40 in a jacket.

644
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:52,250
Specially if they're dressed in a suit
or something. Yeah. Oh that's an agent.

645
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,490
Junior age.
It's so weird how they're always in suits.

646
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:59,210
I feel like a j agents almost always
have to wear suits. Like why now,

647
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,900
now that you can, you see them more
out with like, oh, I just had a, like,

648
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:05,110
I just got a tucked in shirt with
what you're learning, you know,

649
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,920
but I don't know why they
have to be dressed like that.

650
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,210
Then they just get told like,

651
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:11,630
you have to look better than anyone
kind of thing you have to represent.

652
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,720
And it's cause because it's like,
fuck, I have friends that work for,

653
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:19,310
for ca and knows been uta in those
giant like ca building, you know,

654
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:22,510
we call it the death star because it's
just, it looks, and it is, you know,

655
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,170
that is some Darth Vader shit, like, yeah.

656
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,990
And so it's this culture
of win at all costs,

657
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:33,560
which I just can't imagine living in.
I mean,

658
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,480
like, like that. And that's
what the Blazer, yeah, I guess,

659
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,050
yeah. You gotta come, you gotta come in
like, uh, like, uh, uh, like agent Smith,

660
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,890
uh, um, I remember a tricks. Oh yeah.

661
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,370
That is kind of thing that is
the uniform of the soul. Succubus

662
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,210
the sales pitch program is always like
the most aggressive. They're like,

663
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:06,140
what are you doing with the, you know,
your mailing list and you're like,

664
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,011
I don't know. They're like, you know,

665
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:09,920
we have this program [inaudible]
it can permeate someone's computer.

666
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,980
You have to read their fucking
emails. Yeah. And we'll
make yours. And you're like,

667
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:15,200
wait, what? Yeah. I mean,
I'm exaggerating obviously,

668
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:18,310
but it's like crazy shit like that.
You know? As you guys know, my,

669
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,660
my wife is my ex manager,
so it's like,

670
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,800
I know stuff I probably shouldn't
know about all this stuff, you know?

671
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,130
And like no manager games,
no games, no games. I know,

672
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,200
I know agent games and it's like,
I will,

673
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:32,450
I will talk with her like when she's like,

674
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:35,960
and she's got a small roster
that's really awesome and stuff.

675
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,940
So she's not generally
looking for new clients,

676
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,920
but like sometimes I'll see somebody
and be like, oh, they're great.

677
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,200
Or there's someone that's got a lot of
heat on them and she'll be like, yeah,

678
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:44,900
I think I'd like to sign them. But
this person, this person, this person,

679
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:48,530
like these big dogs are kind of coming
in and stuff and I will pretend to be

680
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:49,550
them with her and be like,
you know,

681
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:52,780
just like how they talk to the client
or when she's around, you know,

682
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,770
that takes care is great. I love her.
I love her. Here's the thing, my team,

683
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,460
cause they never talk shit
about each other. Not really,

684
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,700
but it's just kind of thing. The of
just like, just like, no, no, no. Yeah,

685
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,390
like that um, teams, Godfrey
thing, he's like, you know,

686
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:12,200
you're screwed when they
say they love you, follow,

687
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,290
followed by,
but they don't want you for this.

688
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:19,900
So that's always [inaudible] I love her.

689
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,090
I love her that we're not
going to pick up the project.

690
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:27,490
But that's always the casting feedback
too. Like what did they say it?

691
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:32,190
They're like, well they said they loved
you. Yeah, here it comes. They love

692
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,340
me and they're giving me this part.
Actually they don't love you that much.

693
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,030
You love your friend. I got fired
from Chelsea lately as a writer.

694
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,140
We executive came down after a taping
was like, you're doing such a great job.

695
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:46,680
We love you. I just wanted to let you
know we love you. And I was like, ah.

696
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,230
And the next morning I got fired.
Yeah.

697
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,460
And that's exactly what I know.
When they told you you didn't know.

698
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:56,010
But I remember I felt really good
about myself. I was like, wow,

699
00:44:56,011 --> 00:45:00,150
I'm nailing this Gig. No Way.
I just don't know how my,

700
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,740
I created a project and sold it with a
cousin of mine a couple of years ago and

701
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:08,640
he writes video games and writes books
and stuff and he's one the smartest guys

702
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:11,220
I've ever met. And us going through
the process together. He was like,

703
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:14,760
I don't know how you guys do this.
I don't know how you live like this.

704
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,260
And if when you tell me stories like that,

705
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:21,261
it's like I'm having like PTSD flashbacks
of times where I've been let go or,

706
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:24,360
or someone's, you know, kind
of, you know, you're like, oh,

707
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:27,030
I think everything is great.
And like that's when the bottom drops out.

708
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,650
How do you maintain cycle?
Horrible. It's a horrible

709
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,660
parent time.
Businesses.

710
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,640
It's like logically traumatizing
its own way, but the,

711
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,810
the TV film is Wally will stand
up is consistently shitty.

712
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,960
Right? Like you just know there's
always going to be a crazy club owner.

713
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:53,490
Sure is not going to be right. It's
fraught with dog shit. It doesn't change.

714
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,870
It's just like, you know like when
they, when Nash, Steve Martin,

715
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:02,250
why he quit stand up and he's
like Friday to Friday. That's why.

716
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,150
And it's got to, you
can feel like, you know,

717
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:07,590
like you think you could be a microcosm
metaphor would be like a Friday night,

718
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:12,300
like the first show law. Great.
Everything went awesome. Crowd was,

719
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,600
was it having a good time,
which they should. They're
little boost up, which great,

720
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,010
but they weren't over the top.

721
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:21,350
And then that second show where people
went to happy hour and stayed out and

722
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:24,240
they went and they missed the first show
and they're in and you feel like you're

723
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:27,190
strapping on like Swat
team equipment backstage.

724
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,040
Oh here we're going through the door.

725
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,860
We're going to the door of this crack
house and the best part of my hands on

726
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:35,300
your shoulders, put your hands
on him, on the host, the host,

727
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,890
he's going to kick in a door is
he's going to get shot in the face.

728
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:41,370
We know he's dead. Yeah, that guy's
going to get mowed. The rookie thing.

729
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,440
Yeah. Look, Caitlin, you're second. Like
I think you'll catch a couple of shots.

730
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,880
You got your, you have your week, you've
got your vest on. At least though,

731
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,560
if you're in a good club, you know, they
know they're like your support team,

732
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:00,890
their headquarters. But there's the clubs
that are like, what man? And you're like,

733
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:05,020
come on. Like what? I don't
kick anybody out there.

734
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:09,920
Like this is what it is. Nobody are like,
yeah, but you can make it better. I love,

735
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,740
I love clubs that have, that had
their security so good that the pier,

736
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:16,320
there's like loud drunk guy and then
all of a sudden there's someone standing

737
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:19,740
behind him like Batman. It just
gives them a little tap. Like,

738
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:22,860
they haven't orchestrated,
but no one notices these people,

739
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:25,950
but they just slide up and get them
out the suit. You know what I mean?

740
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,761
It's just like,
yeah,

741
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,370
the guy that just comes behind and just
splits guys throwing like a, you know,

742
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:33,110
in the movies like a Ninja,
a century with a machine gun.

743
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,460
He just gets pulled her portion.
He's gone. Like that's, I

744
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,000
have one super intimidating looking guy.
Yes.

745
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,750
I don't understand why they dumb like
when they go like this is security and

746
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:49,160
it's a guy like half
my size. I'm like, no,

747
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,210
it's a woman. Yeah, there's a,

748
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,650
I've seen great female bouncers because
a lot of times those guys are not going

749
00:47:56,651 --> 00:48:01,420
to push back on a woman hit her or she
talks some shit. Yeah. And there was a,

750
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:02,320
there was a lady and uh,

751
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,350
I was just in Montreal this past week
and there's a lady at one club that was

752
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:06,100
like roped,

753
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,510
like her arms were very strong and I
like tattoos and she has like her hair

754
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:14,430
pulled back and he's like scary post
apocalyptic white girl dreadlocks.

755
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,630
And you're like, oh, like,
and she was, you know, where
I'm watching her and I said,

756
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,870
she's laughing. I'm like, oh, I feel
really good about myself. Right.

757
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,850
Because she's intimidating. And also like
these guys that want to like, you know,

758
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:25,684
who's gonna throw me out?

759
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,280
Like if she punches you in the face and
you're fighting back tears and getting

760
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:32,200
thrown out, like this is
not good. Look for that.

761
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,060
That guy who thinks he's an Alpha male. So
you can be like, hey, hey, hey, all right,

762
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,930
I'll get out. I'll get out.
You know, psychologically
it works. Big, strong woman.

763
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,100
Yeah. And just not even that big,
just wirey yeah. You know, like,

764
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,160
like strong, you know, built, built,
strong like a security likes you,

765
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,420
it almost feels as good
as black people approval.

766
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,710
It's almost as good black
people where you're like,

767
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,100
I feel really good about myself.
That Cleveland Improv. Yes.

768
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,910
I know that. Not to Brag, you
don't have to feel like I did it.

769
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,150
I had a great set there and walked
outside and there's that little standing

770
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,960
river back there and uh, and uh, uh, tug,

771
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,300
tugboat went by blaring Tupac.
Yeah,

772
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,310
I yelled out tug life tagline.

773
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,240
I got a second laugh outside with people
having cigarettes. That's awesome.

774
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,190
It's so funny that you nailed one of
my, one of my choices. Perfect moment.

775
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:28,743
It felt great.

776
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,690
I also know that room
when it doesn't go course.

777
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,250
I remember the heckles I remember
a woman in the back going a,

778
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:42,760
your mama should have swelled that nut.
Oh my God.

779
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,760
And I remember,
uh,

780
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:50,500
a guy just like third row he's
going through. It's terrible, man.

781
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,023
That's the worst.

782
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,150
I remember I ran in New York and it put
me to sleep in Italian and Italian guy

783
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:01,330
going, oh man. Well you kidding me
here? Like, c'mon, let's get outta here.

784
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,860
Like audibly, during my setup,
that's worse because you know,

785
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:09,400
it's authentic. It's not like, hey,

786
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:12,130
you suck and it's undeniable.
I'm not doing well right now.

787
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,450
I'll read the comment cards. You ever
read those when you were a feature? Nope.

788
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,250
That's a bad idea.
I don't read the Youtube.

789
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,260
Oh,
I know.

790
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,950
I learned that I only didn't read them
because I probably didn't think about it.

791
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,250
If I was when I was still featuring,

792
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,890
I would have read them all, I'm
sure. Right. These validation,

793
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,320
and even if you were at 300 good ones, he
would find the too. Yeah. Oh yeah. Hey,

794
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:40,010
did you do that now? You got to do
that now. Even on Twitter or whatever.

795
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:43,460
The one guy that hates your guts.
Yeah. It's just, it just feels good.

796
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,480
That's the joy of stand up.
You gotta keep yourself feeling.

797
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,090
I don't get as many, you know,
like out and out. I hate you ones,

798
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,730
but like I get backhanded
compliments, which are, to me,

799
00:50:55,731 --> 00:51:00,260
those are kind of fantastic. What's your
favorite one? Yeah. Got to tell us. Uh,

800
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,230
I did a throwback show and Montreal
with Wanda Sykes and Jo Koy unfortunate

801
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,390
Feemster throwback show.
They put clips,

802
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:13,391
old clips of us and everyone has
a mic and everyone can stop it.

803
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,770
You don't know. Do you know what clip
was coming? No, not really. They had,

804
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,850
they had doesn't forward like a
backyard party drunk and it once.

805
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,190
And I remember doing
that show and be like,

806
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:29,140
I remember it being fun and I was like,
oh my low close

807
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,260
Chris Gethard was backstage and I was
telling about it cause he was the,

808
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,500
he was the next show, not not throw back
and he just got quiet and I was like,

809
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:39,080
are you okay? He's like, I, I'm
just having horrible flashbacks.

810
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:43,220
I'm having like charges of terror
going through my body right now.

811
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:47,770
And I'm just like, yeah. And I guess we
were just sweating on stage, which I,

812
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,710
it was, it was, it sounded like,
like probably how skydiving fields.

813
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:56,000
I've never skydive but it felt like that.
Wait, what were you saying? Compliment.

814
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,600
Oh, so someone said like, uh,
these guys are really funny.

815
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,420
No one could have saved that show,
but boy they tried.

816
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,250
Oh show I thought did really well, which
was surprising to me but I don't know.

817
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,420
They're like good try though.
No one.

818
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:14,540
Amen for effort man.
Your show and like you try hard

819
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,800
that. And Tom and I both
hate when people are like,

820
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,490
oh we saw your special on Netflix is
good. It's pretty good. Pretty good,

821
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,440
pretty good, pretty good, pretty fun.

822
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,760
It's just that thing that everyone's
an expert on comedy, everyone.

823
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,540
Because everyone, I pretty
much, everyone's made someone
laugh at some point. Yes.

824
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,590
But a lot of these people are uh,

825
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:39,680
office managers or bosses where the person
has to laugh at this things you say.

826
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,700
And so you like Michael Scott go
like, oh, I'm funny. I'm funny.

827
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,270
And so everyone has an no.
You know,

828
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,690
I was on my couch on my fifth beer.

829
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,250
You were in front of a thousand
people by yourself. Uh, Tom.

830
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,840
And you know what I think
I know I would've done
different things than you and

831
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:04,150
it's like, Nah, you probably would have
shit yourself and ran off stage. Yeah.

832
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,930
Well cause we haven't done 15,
20 years of staff who said it.

833
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:12,530
But I think the more that I thought about
it, I was like, they're right. Every man,

834
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,730
every man thinks they're
hilarious. Yeah. To it. Like,

835
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,620
if you get them at the right time, they're
like, I'm pretty fucking funny. Yeah.

836
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,640
And so, yeah. And you know,
some of them are, yeah.

837
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,280
To be fair with them actually are
really funny. Yeah. But I still,

838
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,020
some of them are not to any of us,
uh,

839
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,760
not flinch a little when we're forced
to say out loud that were funny.

840
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,270
I'll never write professional.
Right. Right. That, but even then,

841
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,510
right then I couldn't say it because
it's just like too, it feels gross.

842
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:42,330
It feels gross. Yeah. A friend of mine
and I were saying we can hang out.

843
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:47,331
It's always hilarious when anyone on
ironically describes themselves as smart,

844
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,070
funny or tough. Oh my God.
Talking about themselves.

845
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,520
So like three guys rushed us and I like
fought him. I'm like the tough one.

846
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:58,140
And Mike, you're the toes. I worked
on this puzzle. I it, I mean I'm,

847
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,090
I'm pretty smart. Yeah.
I mean, good for you.

848
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,953
Smart.

849
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,330
Really smart people you'll find usually
don't lead with how smart they are. No,

850
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,500
because they understand the
all encompassing vastness
of human intelligence.

851
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:17,310
Right. Every, every smart versus met
someone that made them feel like a monk.

852
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,890
Of course. Every one of them.
Yeah. You know, like who?

853
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:24,690
Someone I knew someone who knew someone
who was hired as a, as a Simpsons writer.

854
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,130
And he went,
he wins like,

855
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:28,800
and he was always the smartest person
in the room and he went in that room and

856
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:30,830
he's like,
I've never felt stupid in my whole life.

857
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,990
So it's like you need stuff like that.

858
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,110
Wait, can I, can I, sorry, I just, yeah,

859
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,800
we pull up the Instagram video that we
watched earlier and just see if Matt

860
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:42,940
feels the same thing we do. Okay. Because
that's kind of, it's a long list tangent,

861
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:47,500
tangent of like what's an calf feels?
Grody yeah.

862
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,200
And you're like, does
this feel, does this feel?

863
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,530
What am I feeling like I'm not sure if I'm
sorry I interrupted you. No, no, no. I,

864
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:58,530
that was that, that was my say. It
was okay. Just like, tell me how this,

865
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,570
how does this make you feel?
Just watch this. It's a video.

866
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:05,860
It's grief as a full body experience. So
this is a dance of grief, this person.

867
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:06,694
Okay.

868
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,033
I mean

869
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,040
this is just letting the grief out,
but yeah,

870
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,670
I'm sorry to be,
I mean she's obviously talented.

871
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:24,660
She's got good movement since
it feels like a very white,

872
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,250
it's a white lady thing. You Do, right?

873
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,270
Yeah, I think so. You know what it's
like. The thing is, it's like I grew up,

874
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,690
I grew up in Portland, Oregon where
my parents took me to so many things.

875
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:38,330
Like here's the difference.
Here's the difference.

876
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:42,080
If you're in a theater and you're like,
I'm here to watch experimental dance.

877
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:47,270
They were asking for it. Yes you are
right. And I kind of, I will be honest,

878
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:51,410
I kind of respect the fact that she
went ahead and put this up. Yeah.

879
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:56,120
Cause that's inviting all kinds of
shredding. Right. But at this, by the way,

880
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,530
none of the comments are mean.
We're the only people are going to meet.

881
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,250
All the comments are like beautiful
boy. Hey listen. I'm like Kara.

882
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:07,010
Kara is always just, just punching me
over the head over it. You're always,

883
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,350
you never are. You know, you'd never,

884
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:11,810
I'm never the guy who just like
gives it three beats and goes,

885
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:15,110
oh fuck this chick. You don't like, you're
not that guy. Never. No, not really.

886
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,630
But like, no, you're like
at the same time it's,

887
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,603
it did,

888
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,460
is she putting this up to help
with others? Grief, grief,

889
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,990
to show her dance scale because he is not
a good dancer. It's uh, the, the person.

890
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,600
It doesn't matter.
Does it matter the person who put it up,

891
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:35,200
it's not the person dancing.
As I listen,

892
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:38,780
as I'm giving you the benefit of the
doubt, I'm still laughing. It's still,

893
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,560
I mean I'm still because you're, it's a
little bit cringy yes it is. And like,

894
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,810
yeah, like let's say, let's say
I did this, it's me doing that.

895
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,960
That would be entertained.
Well, but here's the thing.

896
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,670
I respect this more than an
incredibly fit celebrity that's like,

897
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:59,050
like just showing his or her amazing
body and going and going and going.

898
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:04,051
There were times I didn't love myself
or postpartum picks that models and

899
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:08,990
actresses put up like two weeks
postpartum and the flat belly. Yeah.

900
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,890
I'm putting these pictures up to
inspire other women like no you're not.

901
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,720
You're not showing your pockmarked ass.
You know what I mean?

902
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:18,040
Hanging off the edge of a chair,

903
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,860
you know it's to insight jealousy and
envy. Yeah. Like there's that weird thing.

904
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:25,030
She's English but she does,

905
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:30,031
she does a imitations of celebrity like
videos and pictures where she's like was

906
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:35,680
girl a woman in a bikini jump
roping insanely like soul,

907
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:40,000
like soul cut and then she does it.
She's like their bellies jumping.

908
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,210
I went the same hashtags
which is just like perfect

909
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,770
video shut up Schnitzel.

910
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,100
This video makes me so uncomfortable
because it's so earnest cause like I'm not

911
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:58,540
capable,
I'm not that in touch with my feelings.

912
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,190
So when I see other people
doing it I'm like Oh God,

913
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:04,480
God gives me so much anxiety to
be in touch with your feelings.

914
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,550
That's what I was saying
is that it's great.

915
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,290
The balance in the universe is that the
earnest sincere person exists and they

916
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,670
are actually helpful. Good to have. Right.

917
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,920
That non cynical like earnest person
and then the balance is at the universe

918
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:22,921
feels that we're pieces of shit like us
to mock them and some people enjoy that.

919
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,090
But I don't know if it's the pieces of
shit. Well you know, I will say I because,

920
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:30,160
because,
because,

921
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,740
because it's like when this person
does that and puts it out there,

922
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,560
they know what they're doing
and they had got you got it.

923
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,630
If you're going to be an artist,
you better have a thick ass skin.

924
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,420
I think you're right. You know, cause it's
like, and kind of go. Yeah, you're right.

925
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,240
All right, cool. I'll, I'll
take it. I'll tell you,

926
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,570
don't get butthurt because I'll put
it this way. Back to my childhood.

927
00:58:46,571 --> 00:58:49,900
I remember going to these performances
and like look at my dad and he's so

928
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,470
uncomfortable, you know, it
wasn't comfortable because
it's just like, you know,

929
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,940
yeah. Try to take it and you know,
he wants to be like, this is dumb.

930
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,840
Like he wants to so bad, you
know. But he's kind of just,

931
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,430
just trying to keep an open this,

932
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:07,540
your mother forced you guys to watch
this horse shit. I think it's just,

933
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,190
I'm kind of try to map, look like my dad
would take me a little bit, but like, uh,

934
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,350
like he also would be like,
alright, you know, let's,

935
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:18,190
let's go to this thing
and take me to that.

936
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:22,280
Take me to every Schwartzenegger
movie every day. His bond. But because

937
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,710
I had none knowledge and perspective,
I wasn't like,

938
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,170
I feel like right now there's
a movement and you know,

939
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,200
like fucking white pride anti women
dumbos that while we're red hats and blah,

940
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:33,290
blah, blah. And those guys,

941
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:38,470
and I think those guys took those
movies seriously as a commando was real.

942
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,180
They thought Schwartzenegger was
really, and that was a real, you know,

943
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,950
and they like the enemy.
Ah,

944
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:46,700
I just want to stab someone so bad and
they really want a death star to blow up.

945
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,280
But that shit doesn't exist.
Trump's sells smart by the way.

946
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:52,850
It's set up in multiple interviews and so,
you know, it's true. No, it's true. By,

947
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:55,310
by our definition. Yeah.
You know it's true. Yeah.

948
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,160
He probably also says he's
funny and tough. He has said,

949
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,960
he said when that horrible Parkland
shooting took place at that school,

950
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,500
he's like, I would have gone in
there unarmed. Yes, for sure.

951
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:10,520
And like he's like fucking,
yeah, I would have run into easy,

952
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,870
I've heard an assault rifle.
I would have run into that phone bro.

953
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:19,640
For real though. Like you don't know man.
I know I've done some wild shit. Yeah.

954
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,533
For Real.

955
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,930
Why don't we give him a chance next
time there's some somebody hold up in a

956
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:25,910
trader Joe's or something.
Let's just fly in.

957
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,510
Yes. He said stand down.
Stand down. Swat team.

958
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:34,100
Yeah. No, that's smart. Tough.
And what's the other one?

959
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,130
And Fun and funny because
people will sometimes,

960
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:40,280
sometimes people will tell
you after shows, they'll be
like, I'm pretty funny guy.

961
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,570
And you're like, all right. Or I'll
get emails. They'll say, um, you know,

962
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:48,070
I watched your special or I was
at your show and I have, uh,

963
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,770
some material that I think nice
you would be able to, to like,

964
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,580
I'm not gonna use it cause I don't do it.
I'll give it to you and I'll be like,

965
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,660
okay, cool, thanks. And they'll
be like, so do you want it?
If you want it hit me up.

966
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:02,810
And I'm like, no, I'm, I'm good. And
then they'll follow up and they're like,

967
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,450
it's fucking like Primo material
and then I'll not respond and,

968
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:10,250
and they'll write, hey, uh,
I know she didn't respond,

969
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,330
but I'm going to share
it with you anyways.

970
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:15,640
And it'll be like a of a,

971
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,950
of just writing with no punctuation.
Oh God.

972
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,560
You're like, right, that's fine.

973
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,900
Well, and it's all, it's also like
willful ignorance where it's like, look,

974
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,600
I don't want to learn all the, I didn't
want to go through all that stuff.

975
01:01:30,601 --> 01:01:35,190
You've gone through it. Yeah. I just want
to get it. I want you to think the lady,

976
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,860
I hated the thought,

977
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:41,700
the pornography of suffering that like
American idol and all those shows do

978
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:43,260
where they show you the
people that succeed.

979
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,220
You thought you could sing
it killing yourself or shame.

980
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:54,030
But there was one lady who came on and
just couldn't dance and couldn't sing and

981
01:01:54,031 --> 01:01:55,680
then had a meltdown,
which she's like,

982
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,560
I know you can do that thing where you
put people's voices through it like a

983
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:02,490
filter and make someone a star
do it for me. And it's like,

984
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:07,490
why would we do that? I want to be a
star so you can have all this. What is,

985
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,880
what do I gain in breaking my neck to
do that? So it's like that thing of,

986
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:12,840
of someone just being like,

987
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:16,020
well I know you did stand up
and shitty rooms for 20 years,

988
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:17,790
but like I just want to skip ahead.

989
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:22,350
You had a friend who I'm no longer
friends with actually. She was like, yeah,

990
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:25,170
I'd like, I'd love to do what you do,
but I don't want to go through like,

991
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:25,981
you know,

992
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:30,930
learning how to do it and failing and so
I just want to be like successful at it.

993
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,410
I was like, I don't think I can
be friends with you. I mean,

994
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:36,330
I really don't think I can know
a person is horrible. Yeah.

995
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,230
I mean it's like I love being lazy.
It's the best.

996
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:43,870
It doesn't get you anything and you
need to recognize that. So gross.

997
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:48,150
You don't deserve things. You just want
the glory. Speaking is an only child.

998
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:52,050
Right. You know what I mean? I always
thought I was a golden golden boy.

999
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,640
I'm not right.
But it's like

1000
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,250
the amount of people who just
want stuff handed to them.

1001
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:03,690
And it's a stereotype for millennials
and I don't think it's any more or less

1002
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,250
true than our generation or whatever,

1003
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:10,251
but like the amount of people who once
they hit 30 and they're not Drake slash

1004
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:11,470
Zuckerberg,
right.

1005
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,660
I wonder how it's going to shatter
their psyches cause we're like, no, no,

1006
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:17,070
I'm a blow up.
I'm going to blow up.

1007
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:21,330
It's the pressure to be a Zuckerberg by
the time you're 30 because there are so

1008
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:25,350
many fuck heads that are super multi
millionaires and now you feel inadequate

1009
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:28,350
because you're not a multimillionaire
by the time you're 30 and that's just

1010
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:29,090
silly.

1011
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:33,210
And the whole thing really is like if
you actually just get into the work of it

1012
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,610
and like you really love it.
You got, it sounds Cliche,

1013
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:40,560
but the ups and downs come with
that and you will feel like, oh,

1014
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:43,860
I did something meaningful. You don't
want to miss out on all that stuff.

1015
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:47,760
The good and the bad. The bad stuff
helps a lot. Absolutely. It helps.

1016
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:51,240
A couple of things I have to update
on before I do this. Excuse me,

1017
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:54,000
this advertisement. Sure Bud. Um,

1018
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,360
first is that I got the message that

1026
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,910
Just want someone to give that to
their mom. Who Does it? I love bikes,

1027
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,670
not realizing what it is. Just like
something, a convict stream kids.

1028
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,480
Yeah. So there's, there's that. And

1029
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:45,640
have you seen, you said familiar?
Oh my gosh. Cool. It's so good.

1030
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:48,880
And they're so beautiful. The tick,
right? She's gorgeous. And it works.

1031
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,540
That's the music that indicates
it's time to talk about teeth.

1032
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:57,580
So quip is bringing us this dental update.
Do you have a nice smile?

1033
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,010
Even going to the dentist,
taking care of a year.

1034
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:05,980
Twice a year I had a,
a snore guard made.

1035
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:10,510
Okay. And the first one
they made didn't work. Oh,

1036
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:14,740
I took it home. And um, you know, they
take a mold of your mouth. Oh, okay.

1037
01:05:14,741 --> 01:05:18,340
I didn't know that. Yeah.
And then I brought it into
the dentist. Yeah. Try It on.

1038
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:22,540
And he basically like under his
breath was like, fuck. I was like,

1039
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,850
why? He's like, he goes, we'll send
you a new one. And I go, well, yeah,

1040
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,570
I mean it's got to work. Right. So,
so anyways, they sent the new one.

1041
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,180
Do you have any complaints?
Oh, it's saved our lives.

1042
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,090
If you have somebody in your
marriage, your spouse, wherever,

1043
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:38,740
whoever sleeps next to you that snores,

1044
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,370
go to the dentist and get a professional
snore guard word. Does it go?

1045
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:47,260
So it just took your mouth to
mouth and it has bands, uh,

1046
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,810
the, the top deck dish
and the bottom tray. Yeah.

1047
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,690
Have a band that are adjustable.

1048
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:57,310
So what happens is the principle of
the idea is see snoring is caused by

1049
01:05:57,311 --> 01:05:59,390
different things for different people.
Right.

1050
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,330
Most of the time it's that someone's
lower jaw actually drops down.

1051
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,280
Yes. And then obstructs the air passage.
So the mouth guard with those bands,

1052
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:13,150
depending on how tight you make them,
just keeps your lower jaw up.

1053
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:17,680
So you fall asleep and instead of your
mouth dropping, oh, it just stays up.

1054
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,550
Stays forward.

1055
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,280
But what if you sleep like with breathe
through your mouth when you sleep?

1056
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,520
I mean there's, yeah, there's
open and there's, yeah,

1057
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:28,200
there's air can pass through it. Okay.
It's just like, oh, of course. Keeps your,

1058
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,760
and then if you have like
a really strong drop,

1059
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,870
you can make the band super
tight in your mouth. Like just

1060
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,890
looks sexy, right? You want to laugh.

1061
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:43,750
A lot of guys that have their mouth garden
and it also, you feel because you're,

1062
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,970
when you're,
you don't realize when you snore a lot.

1063
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,920
I didn't that your sleep is super fucked
up. [inaudible] always like dragon,

1064
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:54,310
like God. And ever since I
started, I started wearing
them years ago. He's got it.

1065
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,340
This is a new one. Uh, always feel
completely differently. Really. Yeah.

1066
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,780
You sleep deeper. Yeah.
I don't always snore,

1067
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,900
but like my wife will wake me
up and I ordered my first one.

1068
01:07:07,381 --> 01:07:10,690
Like when she recorded it,
she recorded me snoring.

1069
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,710
And this is back when we lived in the
Rampart division. This is like, Oh yeah,

1070
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,860
near Macarthur Park.
Right. I remember that.

1071
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:22,350
Every time I go to the dynasty
typewriter. I think of you guys. Is that,

1072
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,830
that new place? How is it? It's good.
Yeah. It feels real old school. You know,

1073
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,740
a Jamie who used to run
the Improv runs it and he,

1074
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:34,710
he just bunch of different weird shows.
Uh, it's the one thing is parking is,

1075
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:39,730
is just a monster over and your car is
going to get Jack Cooper down there.

1076
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:44,710
Uber. Yeah. There you go. Well,
there's the heads up, just Uber, Uber.

1077
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:48,430
But the shows are good, but it's a
fun, it's a fun room. Yeah. Um, before,

1078
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,490
I don't want to just, I just
want to jump over it. Your,

1079
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:55,630
you started basically a new
version of your podcast.

1080
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,930
What's it called? It's called advice
from a dipshit with Matt Broenger.

1081
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,570
That's perfect. Thank you. I'm
very, very proud of the name I,

1082
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,990
everything I've ever named, it's
just like, doesn't make me laugh.

1083
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:09,220
Like every album, every special. Like
is it, is it a name that makes me laugh?

1084
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:12,700
You know what I mean? I always, I,
I, you know, we both have bits about,

1085
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,980
about tattoos. Oh yeah.
We both hate meaningful

1086
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,900
tattoos. I hate meaningful special titles.
I don't hate him. Oh, there's gotta be,

1087
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,040
I know there's a few that we got to talk
about it at all. So, you know, I mean,

1088
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:29,750
it depends, but, but uh, or, or
album titles are sincere ones.

1089
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:32,720
You mean like if someone
calls, you know, like,

1090
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:37,870
like I'm waiting for the guy to name his
comedy album or a special beast where

1091
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:41,840
it's like, which is a nickname would give
you like a compliment, not a nickname.

1092
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:45,210
We gave each other, but
anyway, that guy's a beast.

1093
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,320
Then the picture is like,

1094
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,820
first thing I had to change
the caution tape. Caution tape.

1095
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:57,230
Caution tape to this comedies. Too
dangerous. It was a crime scene.

1096
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:02,060
There's a crunchy to killed. So hard.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, tape over the mouth.

1097
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,370
Equal opportunity
offender. Uh, the victim,

1098
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,860
but the podcast was called
Ding Dong or with Matt Bronco.

1099
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:15,260
I would still like it, but people who
don't know who I am, there's like, what?

1100
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:19,320
Who is this? Tara? Would you got it like
a rest of, what's the billboard? What do,

1101
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,900
what's the show about? Okay, I get it.

1102
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,360
You don't like what I have
to read it and understand.

1103
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:26,660
I feel like advice from a dip. Shit.
You're like, I get it. Yeah. So people,

1104
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,230
people can call in. Can I read the,
the number? Of course, yes. Of course.

1105
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,660
People call in and just leave a message,

1106
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,250
like whatever you want to ask about
because I feel like, you know,

1107
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:41,510
I got married at at 43, I, I've had a Dui.

1108
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,030
I made a lot of fun in the sky.
It's in my life,

1109
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:47,030
but all of which kind of made me who I am.
They're like,

1110
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:50,510
we're all made of mistakes,
you know? And it's just like,

1111
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,790
it's kind of become this dear dip shit,

1112
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:55,880
Abby for millennials and older
where people are just like,

1113
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:59,420
and I get older people asking me how the,
how I get, how you get over heartbreak.

1114
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,230
I get, um, people, uh,
younger people going, like,

1115
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,950
my parents really want me to be this,
but I want to be this. Yeah. You know,

1116
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:09,230
I get people, like, how do
I tell my family I'm gay?

1117
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:12,160
And it's like I draw from experience,
uh,

1118
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,210
just people that I've known
who've gone through this,

1119
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:18,440
but mostly through my own experience
and I'm actually going to have, um, uh,

1120
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,710
I started having like guests on every
couple of episodes to listen with them

1121
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:24,470
with me because I don't hear him
beforehand. I don't pick the messages.

1122
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:27,890
My producer partner Amanda does.
And so she'll, she'll be like, Ooh,

1123
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,650
I got some in the barrel for you
this time. And she'll play them.

1124
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:34,550
And I'll be like, whoa, like what the
shit? And like I'm doing them live now.

1125
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,390
And so it's fun because the audience
hears him for the first time with me.

1126
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,110
And there's nothing like a packed
room where a guy's like, hey man,

1127
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:47,000
love your comedy. I got a weird
Dick. I'm like, all right. Yeah,

1128
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,870
we'll live with that. We'd be a lot of
fun. It's a lot of fun. And it's like I,

1129
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,650
I treat everything sincerely.
I make it into entertaining,
you know, as a comedian.

1130
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,070
But it's like I'm not here
to make fun of people. Right.

1131
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,890
And so people know that it's kind of like,
I came to use the term safe space,

1132
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:04,460
but it's like you say anything you want,
don't prank me,

1133
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,230
don't do a character cause it ain't gonna
make it. I'm not going to play it. Well,

1134
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:10,310
you're going to be respectful
of them it sounds like. Yeah.

1135
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:15,311
So the number is 323-SEVEN-SIX-3228 if
you want to call it three g three seven

1136
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:21,420
six three zero two two eight and just
leave a message. Love and, and it's fun.

1137
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:24,750
It's only a half hour so it doesn't
take too much time in and out.

1138
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,530
You can throw it on and, and it's, and
it's, it's, it's a blast man. I love it.

1139
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,990
I love doing it. I love it
man. Yeah. Thanks man. Yeah,

1140
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:33,550
I'm very proud of you for doing that.
Are you guys, you guys know here,

1141
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:38,760
I'm so inspired by how big this podcast
is and how awesome. It's so fun doing it.

1142
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:42,960
Yeah. Cause I've always been a fan
of both of your voices as Comedians,

1143
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,350
like your people that I hang out with.
And I always just laugh at a time.

1144
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:49,490
I saw you on the road and you were like
just in a Mcdonald's and I was like, Hey,

1145
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,550
there's water at an airport. And I
always, I was thinking about this,

1146
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,200
I might've said this on the show,

1147
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:59,340
but I remember the first time we did
stand up actually together and it was in,

1148
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:04,341
it was in Venice and you
went up and crushed and then
someone up after I went up

1149
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:09,450
after you and did eh, and I got off
stage and I was like, who is that guy?

1150
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,510
Cause I'd never seen you. Yeah. And this
guy sidled up next to me and was like,

1151
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:15,000
yeah, you know why he didn't do
that? Well, because that guy,

1152
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,470
he's not supposed to kill like that.

1153
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,850
And he didn't know you at all based on
how he thought you looked or something.

1154
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,610
Oh. And I was like, okay, fuck this
guy. Yeah. Yeah. Tom's cool. Yeah.

1155
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:29,920
I like it says name Tom. I like Tom. Yeah.
But it was that thing like Dion, Udacity.

1156
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:34,400
Yeah. Of people to be like, look to
see you. I got same guy. Be like, ah,

1157
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:37,290
it's a chick depravity. Okay.
Of course. You know what I mean?

1158
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,270
It's just that these categories sure.
People put, yeah, I love watching.

1159
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,620
I still love watching standup.

1160
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:46,920
I still love watching comedy and I
love being surprised. That is true.

1161
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:50,070
Any surprises?
The best elements where you're just like,

1162
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:53,480
where did this person come
from? But I never go, oh,

1163
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,740
this person is going to eat it ever.
No,

1164
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:59,550
cause you don't know you. I do
that. No, you don't ever know. Yeah.

1165
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:04,740
Do you do if a guy looks like he's
nervous a little bit or if he immediately

1166
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:09,050
comes out with way too much
cursing right off the bat or hey,

1167
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,970
how are you guys doing tonight?
How's everybody feeling?

1168
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:16,050
Ah, or you can see, you can see
like, like kind of hallway backstage.

1169
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:19,050
A bravado like fake confidence.

1170
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:21,690
If it's someone who's like fucking,

1171
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,390
you should have seen my show Thursday
or something and you're like, oh,

1172
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:26,980
this is going to be bad. [inaudible]
like that. That's that's Oh yeah,

1173
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,580
definitely are talking about another show.
How well they did.

1174
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:31,560
I'm like it treating it
like a locker room. Yeah.

1175
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:36,060
That's a lot of hot chicks there,
man. Have you been bro? Real hot shit.

1176
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:38,360
You're like this guy's going
to eat his own dick. Yeah.

1177
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,530
All right.
You ever see those comics before?

1178
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:44,050
Like when we were starting to
come up to book book shows,

1179
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:47,770
there was always a guy in the alleyway
kind of pacing back and forth.

1180
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:51,910
Nervously listening like heavy metal
music to get himself palms like that guy.

1181
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,690
Yeah. Shadow boxing. Shadow
box. Always a bad sign. Yeah.

1182
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:01,620
Trying to get themselves psyched
to go out at midnight real quick.

1183
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,710
I was about to go out and we let her
bring us out on at midnight and I'm back

1184
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:07,380
there with Hassan Minhaj and I'm like,
my legs are so stiff.

1185
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:10,050
I'm just stretching my thought.
I was just like, he's like,

1186
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,980
you just stretched before you
out. And I'm like, no, I never

1187
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,310
do. And he's just like long as you're
not shadow boxing. He says the same time

1188
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,620
we knew the words he used to
get ripped at the early shows.

1189
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:26,140
That Guy Cameron, it was at
the cat club. He would just,

1190
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:32,350
he'd be like, I'm up, I'm up the class.
And he would just like whiskey whiskey.

1191
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:35,110
Yeah. But then when it
was, it'd be really funny,

1192
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,340
like you're seeing like a seven minute,
oh,

1193
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:41,320
so this your ra next week you'd be like,
I can't wait to see that guy again.

1194
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:42,640
And he would be like,

1195
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,680
he'd just drink like five whiskies and
then he wrote about you fucking bitch.

1196
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:56,110
You,
you'd be laughing at him being a mess.

1197
01:14:56,370 --> 01:15:00,010
Be like, you're not laughing at that
funny anymore. You're like, this is crazy.

1198
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:04,090
Like this is a guy screaming at a bus
stop basically. You know, you're like,

1199
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:08,380
this is bad. Which you Matt,
would you judge this guy?

1200
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,780
Ah, fuck. I can't hear him.

1201
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,610
I like to have some,

1202
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:24,600
I would like to have
to do is your roadmap.

1203
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:29,430
I would like to have some
sex. Oh, Mike, you come

1204
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:37,100
last lady 10 15 times before I even went.
And beau marks.

1205
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,700
So he's just putting it out there.
Yeah,

1206
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:45,370
about that ladies.
I would like to pass her one to have sex.

1207
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,890
So what does he want though?
The nuance. Well, he's saying,

1208
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,430
are you tired of poets, poets? Jesus.
Just say what you life is short.

1209
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,970
We found him last week.
We played this,

1210
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:03,870
those clips and we talked about it for
awhile. It turns out he's got other clips.

1211
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:07,530
No, wait a minute. What did mommy say
last week when he came into our lives?

1212
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:14,040
When we go down this guy's rabbit
hole? Yeah, let me, let me,

1213
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:18,410
let me say, uh, that's, that's awful.
Yeah. And ridiculous and just, uh,

1214
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:23,130
all right buddy. Like, you know,
cut it out. But counterpoint.

1215
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,120
If that guy was like in a bar and it
was like different people going up and

1216
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:29,010
singing little little,
little folk songs,

1217
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:32,730
country songs and it went up and was
like, boom, Dick do like to have some sex.

1218
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:38,040
I like to have some titties. It'd
be like, Hey man, that's fun.

1219
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,700
That's how you send that message. You
don't just go, I like some sex. Yeah,

1220
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:47,550
I'd like some titties in my, in. My last
lady came 15 times where I went. Boom.

1221
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:48,660
All right man.

1222
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:54,520
Women like a little romance compared
to most of the people we played.

1223
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:59,160
This guy is romantic. That's a sad
thing we're on. We're also in Neward.

1224
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:04,520
The fact that he has and why? Why so
close to the camera. Listen, we've,

1225
01:17:04,521 --> 01:17:06,460
we've analyzed the visuals on this

1226
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,520
capsulated that exactly
because what that last week,

1227
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:13,340
that's what we were saying like you
can't just come out like that with women.

1228
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:18,110
Women don't respond. Maybe other dudes
respond well to that, but you're right.

1229
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:22,850
That's what he needed an accessory.
Now women don't like that. No,

1230
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,850
you don't say it's
staring in someone's face.

1231
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,850
You kind of say it off in the distance,
you know what I mean?

1232
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,810
Like you're an old man bartender. And so
it was like, hey, how's it going Sam? Me?

1233
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:36,970
And he's like, yeah,
that's funny. He's not,

1234
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,420
he's saying it to the universe.

1235
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,320
I mean everyone feels
that way from time to time

1236
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,980
labeled the this folder,
the make you cum guy.

1237
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,333
So let's see.

1238
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,580
No, I wish though. That's a bad, bad cold.

1239
01:17:58,581 --> 01:18:02,140
You can just my club to someone
hurting them. Lastly though,

1240
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:07,180
what is he watching Rachel Maddow last
week it was Rachel Maddow their way.

1241
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:11,440
Now it's your way. It's some kind of CSI
type drama. I think so, wait a minute.

1242
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:15,090
The taking the teeth out is
really a bold move. I know.

1243
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,840
Because last week I think that helps his
mouth technique. It probably does, right?

1244
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:24,790
Cause all right. Just say that in the
presence of police. He did this last week.

1245
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:29,610
Look, he ended it. I remember
with a big smile. Yep.

1246
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,490
Hey, I noticed that as Trumpers
were creepy. Yeah, we'll wait.

1247
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:36,540
We'll wait to false looking.
Right when everyone,

1248
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:41,630
when someone looks weathered
but their teeth straight,

1249
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:42,790
like it's weird.

1250
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:50,510
Nothing just straight up
sex or by no hard feelings.

1251
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,630
Hey listen, I want to, I don't
want to have hard feelings.

1252
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,190
Put your teeth in assholes. Yeah,
just put your fucking teeth in Bro.

1253
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:05,170
Claim person will be clean.
Somebody's mail is good down there.

1254
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:06,840
You know I keep my shelf,

1255
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,190
the unmentionable this thing,

1256
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,730
the thing that women are self conscious
about in shouldn't be. He's like,

1257
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:18,120
make sure it smells like who's heat and
make demands on someone's vagina. Yeah.

1258
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:23,030
Well he said it's about myself.
Cleaned up. I will. I will.

1259
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:28,190
I will bet $1,000. He has real smelly
balls. Would you smell them if he asks?

1260
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:31,310
You know, I would pay someone.
I'd pay a Vegas Professional.

1261
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,240
Oh,
it doesn't matter.

1262
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:41,400
They should be somebody out there
and watch to hook up. Check.

1263
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:45,690
I wish I could be a rich woman also
rich. That's harder. Younger or whatever.

1264
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:47,670
Whatever.
Get in with her

1265
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:52,830
gate in with her. You're not only one
sex, he wants to live off a lady. Yeah.

1266
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,990
Was He watching?
It looked like a black and white.

1267
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:58,230
I feel like he checks off all the
boxes for what? The modern woman,

1268
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:02,310
I would not have predicted it, but that,
that first video he is watching MSNBC.

1269
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:08,010
I did not think that was his lane. I
mean, I think it's kind of immaterial what

1270
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:08,491
he's watching.

1271
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:11,190
The fact that if reflecting on his glasses
and he's still looking at the video

1272
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:13,680
and go on, I'm gonna put it off. I
mean, you've been on camera a lot.

1273
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:16,740
He's framed really nicely. He's
framed real close. Yeah. Keep,

1274
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,450
do you remember that movie election?
Yeah,

1275
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:23,630
I remember the cut to when he finds out,
Matthew Broderick finds out his kids, uh,

1276
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,470
kids,
coworker,

1277
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:30,471
his co teacher is having sex with Reese
Witherspoon's high school girl character

1278
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:35,700
and the closeup on his face and he goes,
you can't believe how when, or pussy? Yes.

1279
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,480
Pardon me. Yeah. And it's, it's
close because it's awful. Yeah.

1280
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:42,090
Because when a guy is talking about
that stuff and you're that close,

1281
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:42,980
there's nothing worse.
Yeah.

1282
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,350
It's one of the funniest parts of
the movie and he's just like, ah man,

1283
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:48,230
don't talk like that,
you know? Yeah, that's,

1284
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,790
well that's the thing of phenomenon
on our show is that all the creepers,

1285
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,750
the creeper guys, the framing is always
too close. They're generally shirtless.

1286
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,130
Their lip poorly. The sound is bad.
Like they all check these boxes. Yeah.

1287
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:04,230
Of Psycho. Well behaviors or thing.
He's not done making demands. There's a,

1288
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:07,660
there's another video. There's
demand. No, it seems like, I mean I'm,

1289
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:10,510
I'm just reading kind of the notes
about it, but let's see if he,

1290
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,540
oh, hello up there.
You're doing great today.

1291
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,880
Full volume background. Go T.
Thank you for all the vagina.

1292
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:24,760
Any shots.
I appreciate that very much.

1293
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:30,720
He cleaned up at least now he's in a
nice couch. TV is ground full volume.

1294
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,593
I for his video,

1295
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:34,240
I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say he's doing like a,

1296
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:38,080
like a politician move. A man walked
up to me in Indiana though. Oh right.

1297
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:41,330
And he said, my taxes are too high.
And I said, you know what? They are.

1298
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,660
No one walked up to you.
No one ever has no one.

1299
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,370
Nobody said this guy posted shots.

1300
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:49,000
I'm going to go out and I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say thanks to the hundred.

1301
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,620
I mean
maybe

1302
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:56,910
I would like to encourage our audience
to send him some Pussy Dick Painting.

1303
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,690
See now he's going to get a time.
Yeah,

1304
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,980
I would really hope you just staged
it in a square. I really hope they do.

1305
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:05,260
Yeah. Loud, beautiful warm
Herman on here. No, no.

1306
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,410
They get shit. Got Sports.
Great. Stay with you longer.

1307
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:17,410
Cheat on you with another one and
won't cheat on you with another guy.

1308
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,640
Oh see he's kind of being
self deprecating there.

1309
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:22,730
He saying it's like saying I'm
not the best looking guy and I'll,

1310
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:23,720
I won't cheat on you.

1311
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,870
Yeah. Good looking guy and
I can have anybody he won't
possibly by curious. Right.

1312
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:33,610
You really want you and you weren't
you for that report I got on my arm

1313
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,500
but hold on also.

1314
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:39,390
Do you want everyone looking guy? He
won't. Just like, he'll love you today.

1315
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:40,224
He does.

1316
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:44,640
Think about that ladies and get rid of
these tattoos whenever you're oh going to

1317
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,790
be all lengthy and sag you. They're
not gonna look as good as they are now.

1318
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,940
Don't get that to
Islamic.

1319
01:22:51,941 --> 01:22:55,570
Came up in my throat was telling
you ladies, you can send them pics,

1320
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,433
but not if you have.

1321
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,240
I mean that's it. This is the, this is
the old white guy. Entitlement for sure.

1322
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:03,850
Yeah. Let me, here's what I want.
Here's what I want. Here's what I want.

1323
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:05,880
Here's what you should do. Here's what
you should. Here should. You should do it

1324
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,830
and he gives nothing. Yeah, he put in his
teeth and we're supposed to high five.

1325
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:12,220
Well, he grew up, he grew a stylish,
trimmed goatee. That is pretty nice.

1326
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:16,750
I put in my teeth today for
this video. Wow. Thanks asshole.

1327
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,000
But get rid of these statues.

1328
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:21,880
Get rid of your table ready or should I
put my teeth and get rid of that tattoo

1329
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:26,770
that costs you $200 and send me some
money. Jesus Christ. What an ass hole.

1330
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:31,210
You wear a hat that says f g t r
t d on it. What does that mean?

1331
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,080
What do you think it means? Let's start
there. What are you thinking of me?

1332
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,240
F. G. T. R. D. D.

1333
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:43,843
Uh,

1334
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,750
it can't be fat. Great titties,
right? Cause that's tube.

1335
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:51,550
That's two descriptors before the tea.
No, but I just, I know the show it.

1336
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:56,500
I think the team's gotta be
that our t. D. F. G. T. R. Td.

1337
01:23:56,501 --> 01:24:00,280
What could that mean? Just like
it's a hat, you know? Yeah. Okay.

1338
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:05,020
I mean, can I send you one?
You send me a hat? Yeah. Cheap.

1339
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:08,770
I know that every Lester is just crying,
laughing. I mean, it's something terrible,

1340
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:12,270
isn't it? We haven't actually
said we haven't defined it yet.

1341
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:14,320
We haven't defined it.
We've dropped it a couple times,

1342
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,430
but you know what it means. You just
haven't said to me in, that's right. Okay.

1343
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:19,850
Yeah. That's horrible. Well,

1344
01:24:19,851 --> 01:24:23,020
should I just put it on and walk around
like a mall in Sherman oaks or something

1345
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,410
and just see if I get
punched in the mouth. Well,

1346
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,730
why don't we let the audience try to
come up with what they think that means.

1347
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:31,810
Let's not,
let's not,

1348
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,470
let's give it a week and see if people
can come up with what they think it is on

1349
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:37,570
the message boards and
on the Facebook page.

1350
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:42,460
Let them discuss and we'll see if that
in fact is a shirt or hat we can make 'em

1351
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:47,020
stay on the line. Also, by the way, um,
made an an another video somebody found.

1352
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:51,640
Okay, we got to go soon. Does it stand
for first? Great Tang replaces that Dick.

1353
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,750
That's it. Did I nail it? You
nailed it that first time.

1354
01:24:55,751 --> 01:25:00,420
You get some time and so much
better. Yes. It's just a monster.

1355
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,640
It doesn't move of the lip.
Millennial, lesbian. Oh, okay.

1356
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,600
First Great Tongue replaces that day.

1357
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:10,730
Anti male oppression store
a woman who hasn't been, uh,

1358
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,310
it got enough oral from her lover.
That's true. You know what I mean?

1359
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:17,710
Just put it in. Thank you. Like my wiener.
Yeah. Thank you for naming it by the way.

1360
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:21,610
Sure. So now we can sell it as first.
Great Tongue replaces that Dick.

1361
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,830
First Time. It's got to be
great. Tom's gotta be great.

1362
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:28,300
You gotta be just someone who
knows how to use it that day.

1363
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:30,820
They ain't alive.
Juvenile.

1364
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:31,763
Oh

1365
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:41,060
wait. It was two feet everywhere. This
guy does it everywhere. One, two, three,

1366
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:44,720
four staying alive. And he uses his
lung infection as an instrument.

1367
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,940
And the way they had it your way better.

1368
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,850
That is the United States
because it will be,

1369
01:25:57,851 --> 01:25:59,510
we'll get together with the newer remix.

1370
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,863
Yeah.

1371
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:18,270
Wow. Let's see. What would
you rather have though?

1372
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:23,100
The Mickey Come Guy's teeth
or this guy a hundred times.

1373
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:28,500
Yeah. They need to put him on the
voice, right. Because it's like, oh,

1374
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:33,540
all right. Yeah. You know, it's a talent.
It's hard to guess the person's, uh, sex.

1375
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,020
You're listening to it. Definitely
hard to guess the age. Yeah.

1376
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,140
And I could see someone being like,
man, that's that good rhythmic soul.

1377
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:44,520
I'll take it. And it turns any
smile and the teeth. Oh, have to be,

1378
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:47,740
that's what that show is. If
you don't see him, see him.

1379
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:49,603
Okay.
On

1380
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,680
live outside.

1381
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:02,780
He really has a lung infection.
Uh, no. Yeah. Doctors.

1382
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:07,460
Rusa I mean, I'm just thinking is this
tragic tale? I have a month to live.

1383
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,570
No. Our, our, uh,

1384
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:16,420
our producer labeled this file that I'm
looking at the top of it. Like, oh no, no,

1385
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:19,160
no. We've just always, he, he,
he's a homeless man. I don't know.

1386
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:20,030
I don't know anything about him.

1387
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:24,560
I just know that we've had now
three or four times videos of him.

1388
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:28,550
This particular man in different
settings singing, staying alive. Yeah.

1389
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,980
Before he looked like he could be outside
a restaurant. Yeah. Yeah. Now he's in,

1390
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,530
in the San Andres on the
side of the road. Yeah.

1391
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:40,130
Gotcha. If he's like, pull over
to fixing my tire and this guy

1392
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:44,900
and he's like, I'm, I'm not
going to help you change a tire.

1393
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,980
Okay. Just stay United
day. The line. Yeah.

1394
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:55,950
I think he's, he's really just
had too much sun. Yeah. Jamie.

1395
01:27:55,990 --> 01:28:00,880
Got to go to press, pause the problem.
Um, can we, can you stick around or no?

1396
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,560
Yeah. I have to pick up my son.
Okay. Can, uh, do you have,

1397
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:08,360
do you have time to hang out for like
another 30 40 minutes? Yes. Absolutely.

1398
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,100
Why don't we do that? Let's pause.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's great.

1399
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:13,260
And we're back.

1400
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:18,780
I just took brawny pants to pick up our
son. How was that? Did you enjoy that?

1401
01:28:18,781 --> 01:28:21,460
I enjoyed it. It's cute,
right? Yeah, I liked it. Um,

1402
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,940
it did make me laugh that Tom
made a good point. He's like,

1403
01:28:23,941 --> 01:28:25,980
I don't think you can get it out of the
car. And I'm like, yeah, you're right.

1404
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:27,810
It's a preschool. Yeah, I get it. Yeah.

1405
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:32,520
Cause he was yelling at walk in ahead
of you. Just a grown man. Noah was true.

1406
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:33,420
I didn't think about it.

1407
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:38,421
That's just the visions of a divorced
dads that deserve to get divorced.

1408
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,610
Yeah. Tommy. God Damn it, it's mine. I
don't care what any court says. You know,

1409
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:47,590
they've, I'm sure they had to deal
with that sort of thing. Oh yeah.

1410
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,480
I can't be just standing in the parking
lot and parents like I've never seen him

1411
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:54,750
and I'm sure there's probably not
a teacher. Oh no, not a caretaker.

1412
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,790
There's probably friends that have
tagged along. Sure. Been like,

1413
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:01,710
why can't I come in? Oh No,
no, no. And then, and like
walk in and they're like, yeah,

1414
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:05,850
I, I remember like my, my parents
are both educators now retired,

1415
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:09,390
but my dad used to, he was
in administration the last
like 10, 15 years. And he's,

1416
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,830
he was a principal and a vice principal.

1417
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:14,280
And at one point he was principal at
this place near our house called, uh,

1418
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:18,390
called Holly Rude. That's like,
like maybe k through five.

1419
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:23,010
And I remember walking up and my dad's
was, is, is like taller than me now.

1420
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:24,630
He's kind of shrunk with AIDS,
but like,

1421
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:28,980
he's a big guy and he's just
destroying these kids in foursquare.

1422
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,720
And it was just so fun to watch,

1423
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,160
but it was like I was walking
onto the playground. I'm like, I,

1424
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,380
this is feels so weird. I'm
like, I'm like, Dad, hey.

1425
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:40,950
And all the kids just turning to my dad,
hey, like they all y'all back at me.

1426
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:43,860
But it was like my dad's like, oh, it's
my son. And we were like, okay, okay.

1427
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:47,250
But it's just like, that was
my first exposure to, you know,

1428
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:51,030
you can't just walk in here, you know,
it's just so I'm very conscious of it.

1429
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:55,170
No, of course. And there's a code to get
in and they watch those kids like, Huh?

1430
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,630
You got to, they ain't going
nowhere. You have to, yeah,

1431
01:29:57,631 --> 01:29:59,480
I know he's fucking psychos out.
Right.

1432
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:02,830
My old voting place used to be inside
a grade school that was down the street

1433
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:05,950
from my, Nah. I'd go in there and I'm
like in the hallway alone, I'm like,

1434
01:30:05,951 --> 01:30:09,340
this is not good. Where's the
boating? Why'd you put it here?

1435
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:13,900
And I see the sign and I just run
over to it and get in line like whew.

1436
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:15,640
Thank God.
No,

1437
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:19,510
just a bad. Yeah, no. And I love
is Matt wanting to put our um,

1438
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:24,050
lung infection guy on the voice. So
great. Which I think is such a great idea.

1439
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:27,420
I was laughing at that. Um, especially
cause you're right, that I've done,

1440
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:29,040
I've only said I show
once, like they, they,

1441
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,580
the judges have their backs turned
to the, yeah. Don't, why is that?

1442
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:34,850
Just that you're not biased by,
I think that's the idea. Yeah.

1443
01:30:34,851 --> 01:30:39,440
I've only seen it once, twice,
but we are in the age where,
you know, it's silly. No,

1444
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:44,500
but I'm saying you sell people get
huge careers because they look,

1445
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:45,890
yeah.
Yeah.

1446
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:49,760
Where's your telling me about that white
singer who sounds black and they were

1447
01:30:49,761 --> 01:30:52,110
listening? Oh yeah. And the
other day. Yeah. Oh I've,

1448
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:56,840
I could tell I could go when
Bobby Caldwell's a hit song,

1449
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,940
which you won't do for love. What you
won't do for love came out. It came out,

1450
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:04,790
it came out like 25, 30 years
ago. Yeah. It's like a silhouette.

1451
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:07,130
They wouldn't put him on an album cover.

1452
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:11,180
They would put on purpose and they knew
because it was a hit with black urban

1453
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:13,780
hit and they were like,
do not show it. Scott.

1454
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:15,940
I grew up thinking that guy was
black. No, if you hear the song,

1455
01:31:15,941 --> 01:31:16,910
I thought it was black.
Yeah.

1456
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,600
Also. Uh, um, he did. Um,

1457
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:24,490
so how does the song go? Sing
it cause I forget it. Well, do,

1458
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,590
do pho Lou Bennett,
pepto,

1459
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:33,270
it's an attorney.
James that comes on.

1460
01:31:33,271 --> 01:31:38,130
Everyone feels good and raided
the barbecues. Yeah, it's
a, yeah, it's a white guy.

1461
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:42,900
He's a white guy. He looks like
a real cracker too. You should,

1462
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,720
you should check out the song. Open your
eyes. Common sampled it for that song.

1463
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:51,010
The light. There are time
that Tim too. Thanks guys.

1464
01:31:51,011 --> 01:31:54,970
White guys white. What's Bobby
also? That's why we call. Yeah,

1465
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:59,030
he still tours. He's still, he does
like standards and stuff, but yeah.

1466
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,040
Now Alan Thicke

1467
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:05,020
sounds, yeah. He was kind of like a
modern day. What's that? Blurred lines.

1468
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,940
Yeah. I don't think his, his dad Robin.

1469
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:11,790
It sounds whiter than anyone. Yeah, he is.

1470
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,870
He skipped generations. You know, if you
guys had like a red headed kid, like what?

1471
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:20,770
How'd this happen? Like same thing,
right? Right. Real soulful son. He is,

1472
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:22,030
he's super soulful.

1473
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:28,690
Doug Stanhope had that bit about, remember
that the woman that went on like the,

1474
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:31,070
uh,
Britain's got talent and saying,

1475
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,150
you know the song and killed it and
like, and was like, oh my God, and,

1476
01:32:35,151 --> 01:32:36,070
and stay at home.
It was like,

1477
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,820
have you heard about the
unattractive woman who couldn't say,

1478
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:44,080
has anyone heard of this, this wondrous
creature? And it's like, oh my,

1479
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:46,330
and it hit me. I was like,
oh, that's all that was.

1480
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:50,210
She came out and she was
just Kinda dumpy older lady.

1481
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:54,200
Turns out that she also
had some mental yes.

1482
01:32:56,420 --> 01:33:00,410
But it's like, why was that so
surprising? You know what I mean? Like,

1483
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:05,810
I like the unattractive person that
sings the sacs soulful song, you know,

1484
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:10,150
about being left or whatever. The
English woman, she had mental problems.

1485
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,070
That's what's her name.

1486
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,540
She's English and she won
like the American. Exactly.

1487
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:19,970
What exactly we're talking to them, right?
Yeah. It's different. That's different.

1488
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:24,370
FTT Rtd. Yeah. She looked like
she looked like a bill. Bellacheck

1489
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,600
yeah. Yeah. Kara. Kara for New
England and I got her that tee shirt.

1490
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:34,700
That's like the many moods of Bella
check. Oh yeah. And it's like same face,

1491
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:39,130
static. Furious. I'm relaxed.
Can I have a sip of your coffee?

1492
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:43,030
I've been drinking so much water that
I need something to stop the hydration.

1493
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:47,350
Right, right, right. Um, just,
uh, you know, uh, to voice.

1494
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:50,650
Could you imagine him? Because here's
the thing with the lung infection, dude,

1495
01:33:50,651 --> 01:33:54,540
this is big bill.
Bellacheck just see the one sports person.

1496
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:59,260
I know her name. Everyone's
screaming it right now. Susan. Yes.

1497
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:01,580
Susan Boyle. Go. Yeah.

1498
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,270
But the thing with the lung infection man,
uh,

1499
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:08,060
that we've deduced is that
there's actually some talent

1500
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,570
he had. He's on key. He has
really good rhythm. You know,

1501
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,110
it's a little off putting because he is a,
he is a leathery man.

1502
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:25,510
He's asked about four
teeth evenly spaced apart.

1503
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,250
Yeah. And it's like he took out
certainty. How did that work?

1504
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:34,010
Perfectly spaced. I did other
ones stay, you know, like,

1505
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:38,210
like Spartan warriors while the rest
of the soldiers die. Realize why

1506
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:43,090
is that? He is definitely, you're
like, this guy needs more teeth. Yup.

1507
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,940
But you also realize you can get
by with that many teeth, you know?

1508
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,830
And I never really thought
about that until I saw his name.

1509
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:55,010
There's so many things he can't eat dark.
You can start all,

1510
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:58,690
you can pull that off
a rib short. Yes, yes.

1511
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:03,140
You can eat spare like pork ones are soft.
Bobby Lee has no ballers

1512
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:08,270
chooses steak in the front of his mouth.
Cheery the front teeth.

1513
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,950
Bobby gets some olders he's doesn't have,

1514
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:14,700
he's been without them for so long and
he's just used to not choose steak.

1515
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,090
No good. It's weird. It's weird
that he does something weird, right?

1516
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,240
Such a straight laced normal dude.

1517
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:28,270
Such a square doesn't just take his pants
off and anyone and presence right now,

1518
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:31,110
but you need the front teeth to chew up,

1519
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:34,580
like to take a bite of something real
important and then you need the backs.

1520
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:38,300
The rest are superfluous. But what if he
has? What if that guy has great Maulers?

1521
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,250
That's all you need.
Sparkling Ivers but pulls up.

1522
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:45,050
He pulls all the brushes back.

1523
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:48,980
They're meticulously flosses.
He can get them whitened.

1524
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,400
Who would check that shit out? I will
say that guy has no problem flossing.

1525
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:58,330
Easy peasy jump school.
He might have a nice guy.

1526
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,640
Okay,
what'd you rather pay?

1527
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:06,380
You're going to spend about $25
you're going to go to, okay.

1528
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,020
You're going to watch, you're going
to sit, you're going to watch,

1529
01:36:09,021 --> 01:36:11,490
even if the staying alive guy belong.
Infection guy.

1530
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:17,960
Yeah,
or the grief dancer.

1531
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,040
Oh, say United state United. Yeah. I
like to party. Yeah, that's a funny man.

1532
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:26,090
I don't know. I don't need
this. If I'm a little fucked up,

1533
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,650
I'm losing my mind with that guy.

1534
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,080
He's going to walk on stage and I'm
going to turn to the bar and I'd go,

1535
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:37,040
everyone gets a drink. It's a good
time. You smoke something a little.

1536
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,490
Like if I get a little hit, a shot, I'd
be like say, you know, I'd be like, dude,

1537
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:44,300
I do it again and I just start throwing.
But he's got to close with stay United.

1538
01:36:44,301 --> 01:36:48,530
That's true. Although we don't
know if he does any others.

1539
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:52,100
Maybe he just does that 25
minutes of stay United. So yes,

1540
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:55,430
it might be the same song over and over,

1541
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:58,960
but that's the one that's doing

1542
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,510
this for an hour

1543
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:14,480
because I know this guy's making a good,
like you got hit like a door dealers

1544
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:19,350
and it's going to be a lot of
people just laughing at him.

1545
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,830
What a board.
A Basketball Jersey.

1546
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,600
Just as you start to feel bad for him
and you're like, man, this is fucked up.

1547
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:32,660
He'd be like, I hate your girl's pussy
too. And you'd be like, all right man.

1548
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:34,330
Hey know what shut up.

1549
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,670
Is that your lady like you're a pussy.
You're like, hey, hey, hey man, fuck man.

1550
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,250
Take it easy. I got you
this, I got you a door deal.

1551
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:49,940
He would say the most critical,
oh, these guys are wild cards.

1552
01:37:49,941 --> 01:37:52,400
He's been out in the sun.
He's been drinking his whole life.

1553
01:37:52,401 --> 01:37:53,890
You don't know what's
going to get a guy like,

1554
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,260
like sometimes you see those
comics that like idolized,

1555
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,750
you know those comics that just like,
I just say anything,

1556
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:03,480
you know the political
correctness is my enemy.

1557
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:07,230
And so those people that just say
something absolutely bananas that he's not

1558
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:10,620
funny.
That's is between song filler.

1559
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:18,810
I never laughed. He's like, no, but
I mean, you know she was asleep.

1560
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,913
Like

1561
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:27,510
we're trapped here with him.
Like she's your girlfriend and Nah,

1562
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:31,250
just some girl I found anyways.
Stay United States stay in it.

1563
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:35,940
No one clapping. Yeah. Ruin it so fast.

1564
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:38,520
I was told that this video I haven't seen,

1565
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,210
we're supposed to watch it and decide
who's out of line because there's two

1566
01:38:42,211 --> 01:38:45,450
people. Okay. And I think they're in
a whole foods. That's what I'm told.

1567
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:47,020
I haven't opened it yet,
but okay.

1568
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:52,100
Let's see if we can agree or disagree
that one of the two participants is

1569
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:53,610
Adeline. Okay. Okay.

1570
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:57,330
We go with that.
We have to do the same.

1571
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:04,180
You really shouldn't be blocking the
handicap and crossing you all any of this,

1572
01:39:04,881 --> 01:39:09,050
any of this blue, right? No one is
supposed to be blocking you at anytime.

1573
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:10,810
Thank you.
I'll take that into,

1574
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:17,300
okay. So I think it's, she's one of
the participants, right? And the guy.

1575
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:20,960
So she's saying don't, it seems like a
reasonable start. Yup. She's like, Hey,

1576
01:39:20,961 --> 01:39:22,540
you shouldn't be blocking
this. Yeah, sure.

1577
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:27,330
Picks up. Can you please move
out of the handicap plate?

1578
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,970
Please move the out of
the handicap plates.

1579
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:37,820
I'm here.
You're in the handicap space?

1580
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:42,920
No. The thing is they're only
briefly like they're just crossing.

1581
01:39:42,921 --> 01:39:45,800
I wish I had more visual and I
don't mean to see her. I don't,

1582
01:39:45,801 --> 01:39:46,810
I'm not like [inaudible],

1583
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:52,400
but like I don't see where is the,
let's start.

1584
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:56,660
Okay. Do we know it's at
right? Blue is handicapped.
Yes it is. I didn't know that.

1585
01:39:56,750 --> 01:40:00,390
I didn't know. I've been guilty of
this. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's stamped,

1586
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:05,210
but they're not like, it doesn't seem like
they're really obstructing. No, she can.

1587
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:09,320
She can work around. That middle is
worn down, but that's still handicapped.

1588
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:11,440
You know what I mean? Right.
This whole area. Wait, wait,

1589
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:14,920
so this whole thing is considered
handicap, right? If you,

1590
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:19,060
my understanding is correct. Blue is his
handicap. I think you're correct. Yeah.

1591
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:22,730
Okay, so she looked, she has a boy. She,

1592
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:26,120
she made her point and she said
like, you know, he's like, yeah,

1593
01:40:26,121 --> 01:40:27,290
I'll take that into consideration.

1594
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:31,700
Which she definitely didn't mean
he wasn't like he was he. Oh yeah.

1595
01:40:31,701 --> 01:40:36,380
He was already, he was pissed that there
was no, there was no, excuse me. Right,

1596
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:39,950
right. Which I get it. I mean that's a
natural, if we're having a conversation,

1597
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:43,730
so we're like, you're really like,
okay. Yeah, you do. You know how to,

1598
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:47,330
how to interrupt. Right. Even
unnecessary interruption. So wait, let's,

1599
01:40:47,331 --> 01:40:50,450
I think it's about, this is crazy. I
think it's going to pick up the pace here.

1600
01:40:50,451 --> 01:40:51,280
Is that okay?
Okay.

1601
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:56,280
People are not supposed to force
you to get out of this by law.

1602
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:00,550
You're not supposed to be going to
take it up with management. Okay.

1603
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,320
How about if I call the police?
Okay.

1604
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,280
Oh, he says you're insane. Okay. She said,

1605
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:13,530
I feel like he's getting to butt
hurt by her. And in fairness,

1606
01:41:13,531 --> 01:41:17,700
she does have what sounds like a very
grating voice. Yes. You know what I mean?

1607
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:23,190
Some of us do. Hey, and she's also
a little too on top of it. Right?

1608
01:41:23,191 --> 01:41:26,490
Like she's looking for a fight. I mean
like he's not, it's not like she was like,

1609
01:41:26,491 --> 01:41:29,370
I'm trying to get into this space
and you're blocking it. And My,

1610
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,050
my suspicious mind is like, who turns
on a recording device and in walks up.

1611
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:38,850
Oh God, I don't know. That's
just me being super suspicious.

1612
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,530
That's like, oh, I, I try

1613
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:46,140
just maybe listening as a fight.
Yeah. Someone was like, excuse me.

1614
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,780
They're waiting for a little bit.
Yeah, the scene. The building. Yeah.

1615
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:50,670
And it's what the,

1616
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:55,290
what the things I'm suspicious of is when
it recording starts before usually if

1617
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:59,370
someone's like, and it just, it's starts
and a cop's yelling at this person,

1618
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:03,690
this person probably did escalate. Not
the person recording, but they're like,

1619
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,800
I got, I'm going to record
this. You're, you're, yeah.

1620
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:10,070
She's what's known as a
shit mixer. Yeah. No, I saw,

1621
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:15,090
I saw one too where a guy walked up to
cops that were like on a scene somewhere

1622
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,010
and he walks up and they're
like, can you stay there? Like,

1623
01:42:20,011 --> 01:42:23,100
can you stand back and say, I don't
have to do shit. Ah, fuck you.

1624
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:25,420
And they're like looking
at each other like, yeah.

1625
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,950
And then of course they see the
camera doesn't like it does trying to,

1626
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:34,200
and it's like I'm, I'm as angry at
certain cops as anyone is right now,

1627
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:36,300
but it's just like that. Dot. What?
What the fuck does that solve?

1628
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:38,200
Just one random cops. Yeah. Dude.

1629
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:42,440
There's just come up and try you trying
to get them to do something crazy with

1630
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:47,210
you. Now this bride is looking
for trouble. Oh really? Shit.

1631
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:52,070
Oh really? You're insane.
I'm doing my job. No,

1632
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:53,900
but you're doing it illegally.

1633
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:58,310
It's not illegal and I'm surprised
that you shop yet. Oh, okay.

1634
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,950
Well lets you got the New England accent.
I'm surprised you shop here. Yeah.

1635
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:04,220
Oh boy. Yeah. She's,

1636
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,810
she's upset about something else
and then she started to go away.

1637
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,780
I wish this picked up more where
she's talking to management, I think.

1638
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:11,610
I think she's going to
go walk up and close up.

1639
01:43:11,611 --> 01:43:16,590
Just stab each of those
melons with a knife. I wish.

1640
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:21,120
Yeah, that you're insane.
You're insane. Yeah. Yeah.

1641
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,880
She's just rising to one shop.
Yeah. Yeah. Which is by the way,

1642
01:43:23,881 --> 01:43:25,830
the appropriate response
to people like this.

1643
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:30,060
I think you should just have licensed to
tell people they're crazy. No. Yeah. Well,

1644
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,780
I do feel like that guy could have
handled it better and been like, you know,

1645
01:43:33,781 --> 01:43:38,190
but it's, it's, you know, I can't,
it's always funny. How would you,

1646
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:41,880
you'd be so annoyed now.
Totally. No, no, no, I'm not.

1647
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,130
I'm really not judging him because I
don't know how it would have been that

1648
01:43:44,131 --> 01:43:47,940
situation. I'm sure it would've been
so pissed, you know? But you know,

1649
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:52,860
if this person is driving
thing with a straw and I,

1650
01:43:52,861 --> 01:43:57,860
I'm not, I'm just going to be like, ah,
okay. You, we'll get out of the way.

1651
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:02,740
Sorry, ma'am. Whatever, you
know, pending, she's being
mommy to, you know what I mean?

1652
01:44:02,741 --> 01:44:06,470
Right. Too many people that you need to
be like, I mean, and also the approach,

1653
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:09,080
it's always about, if she
could be, she said, excuse me.

1654
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:11,180
I don't know if you know this, but you're
standing, I don't know if you know what?

1655
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:15,200
I didn't know that I'm in my forties I
never knew blue as handicapped. Yeah.

1656
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,570
Not that I would be like, Hey,
get outta here. Wheelchair guy.

1657
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,200
Excuse me.
Like the fuck Outta here.

1658
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:29,920
So I know nothing makes me laugh harder
than just someone being that immediately

1659
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:35,780
crazy. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm
hoping for with every video I open,

1660
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,120
just not hold back. I didn't. Same
Guy. Yeah. I remember when I was a kid,

1661
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,850
it was at the time it was horrifying,

1662
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:46,940
but I looked back and I laughed
so hard that like me and a buddy,

1663
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:50,110
we couldn't have been more
than eight or nine it,

1664
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:53,720
we're in the park and there's a water
fountain and there's hardly any water

1665
01:44:53,721 --> 01:44:58,430
coming out over like maybe four seconds
pass by. We're like, I don't know. Ah,

1666
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:02,900
this guy behind it. It's like, it's
like what? Holding a baby? A grown man.

1667
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:06,740
You girls going to drink or not?
Both two boys were both two little boys.

1668
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:12,470
It's not coming out very well. Well, like
stuttering, like just shocked. He's like,

1669
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:16,400
well then suck it. And we're like,
we just walked away. And Morris,

1670
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:19,880
who's that insane to a young
boy? Ugly Bagel face? No,

1671
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:26,270
no, I don't think. I think Eglise last
night, last I heard it ugly, went to MIT.

1672
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:31,570
So he's a smart guy. Deep cuts for that.
That's a deep cut. Deep, deep. Yeah.

1673
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:34,900
Prank. A guy named ugly
Bagel face. What we found,

1674
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:37,850
we found this the silliest name in the
phone book and called him like a thousand

1675
01:45:37,851 --> 01:45:41,500
times,
but very childish.

1676
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:43,880
I very great by the way.
We were playing,

1677
01:45:43,881 --> 01:45:47,710
how obnoxious it is earlier
when people have, uh,

1678
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:52,370
conversations on speaker phone in
public, oh, isn't that the worst? Or,

1679
01:45:52,371 --> 01:45:54,980
or people that watch videos
in the airport get your life.

1680
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:59,870
I've had two guys that I've said, uh, hey
man, do you have headphones? Can use them.

1681
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:01,550
And they're like, I don't
have them. And I'm like, okay,

1682
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:04,290
I don't need to hear that thing. You
just turn it down. And I'm like, yeah.

1683
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:08,000
And they look at me like I'm
crazy. Yeah. It's bold. What?

1684
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:12,910
I can't watch my television and public
and they look these, literally, this was,

1685
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:17,690
I recorded this, this is my recording.
That's me. And this is the guy

1686
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:23,480
on Bank of America's hold on
speakerphone is Starbucks.

1687
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,790
Do I want to hear about Bank of
America's offers? And he's on hold.

1688
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:33,320
So he's just playing it. Wow.
That's so rude. Yeah. I mean

1689
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:38,600
that's so brutal. And he's just
leaving it there eating this thing.

1690
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:42,520
Everyone's drinking his coffee
like hey fuck head. Yeah.

1691
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:47,180
But I was telling her like,
this guy's a complete fucking oblivious.

1692
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:49,530
Like it doesn't give a shit, you know?
If you were like, why you doing that?

1693
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,070
He'd be like,
cause

1694
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,770
I'm on hold.

1695
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:54,880
[inaudible] what am I supposed to do?
Yeah. Yeah. I don't have a choice. Yeah.

1696
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:59,260
I got to hold it to my head. I was going
to do that off of speaker phone. No, no.

1697
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,680
Wait. So you've walked up to people and
you've been like, do you have had fun? No,

1698
01:47:02,681 --> 01:47:05,710
I just look old. Like we were
all sitting in the same, uh,

1699
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:09,630
gate waiting for the flight. Yeah. And
I'm like, hey man, do you have headphones?

1700
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,960
Can you put those on?
I was just saying,

1701
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:13,380
I've had phones when you put those
on in the same sentence. Yep.

1702
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:16,390
So they don't say anything. They're
like, I don't have it. It's like the,

1703
01:47:16,391 --> 01:47:19,030
and that's the same thing. They're
like, really? There's nothing I can do.

1704
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:22,570
You're forced to listen. And I'm like,
all right, can you turn the sound off?

1705
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:27,520
And they're like, well, they
can't believe it, of course,

1706
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:31,570
because it's like, listen,
nobody likes confrontation.
And I'm not, no, no. I hate it.

1707
01:47:31,571 --> 01:47:36,340
I hate it so much. I've maybe
shushed people two times in the,

1708
01:47:36,341 --> 01:47:41,260
in the, in the, in the movie
theater maybe. Yeah. Maybe
I will put up with stuff.

1709
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:46,450
I have found out the best
neighbors on our CULDESAC. Yeah,

1710
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:49,000
the craziest on the
other side of the fence,

1711
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:54,360
right beneath lay of like a pool and they
were up 10 30 [inaudible] trying to go

1712
01:47:54,701 --> 01:47:58,960
to bed. They're blaring eighties music and
sing along to it. And I'm just like, ah,

1713
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,960
I just go out in the backyard and I'm
like, hey guys, past 10, can you, uh,

1714
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:06,580
can you turn down? Fuck
you, like right away,

1715
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:10,990
right away. Like, like by another
fucking house. Uh, and he said,

1716
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:14,260
but like to each other, not to
me just being like, oh, fuck man.

1717
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:18,380
Is this your new place, your
current place, place? And
they're, they're, they're,

1718
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:22,720
they're rarely around, but
they already, they have a
neighborhood rep, uh, as these,

1719
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:26,830
as these and it's, and
it's super young. No, no.

1720
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:31,180
They have two kids. They turn it down.
They turned down and they were like,

1721
01:48:31,181 --> 01:48:35,860
welcome to fucking neighborhood. And I
just said thank you. And went inside.

1722
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:39,800
It's like I'm not playing your game. I'm
not going to be the other. You're going,

1723
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:43,810
you're, you're, you're faded. You're not
just drunk, you're on something else.

1724
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:47,700
I they probably were doing
lines or something, but it's
like he hits, yeah. Jesus.

1725
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:48,341
Jesus.

1726
01:48:48,341 --> 01:48:52,120
I mean I feel like I kind of live in the
neighborhood with parents that do coke.

1727
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:56,350
You know what I mean? That's still want
that have like the party a little bit.

1728
01:48:56,351 --> 01:48:59,620
I think maybe Silver Lake more
than Los Felix, but like it's,

1729
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:04,390
there's still that element
and like, uh, yeah. So it's,

1730
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:04,980
well,

1731
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:06,120
cause they are there in your neighborhood.

1732
01:49:06,121 --> 01:49:08,230
You have parents who still
want to be cool. Yes. Yes.

1733
01:49:08,231 --> 01:49:11,010
I like Tom and I have surrendered
to this game. We're like, listen,

1734
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:15,680
we're fucking suburban lanes
are still cool though. Cool.

1735
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:19,530
I go to the mall only confrontation
that I've had with the loud thing,

1736
01:49:19,531 --> 01:49:21,650
cause I didn't say shit to this psycho,
but uh,

1737
01:49:21,651 --> 01:49:26,651
at the airport gate I saw somebody
with a laptop on their lap open.

1738
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:32,300
Yes. Facetime calling with that. So
they were like, yeah, Brazil. Yeah,

1739
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:36,660
I know. And then you hear the person
and I just walked in front and I go,

1740
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,420
how's it going? Like that
Nice. And the guy was like,

1741
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:44,040
like looked at me like the fuck,
how's it going? And he just was like,

1742
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:48,010
anyway, so we're going to get on the
flight. So he just, he, I just was like,

1743
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,560
made it myself, be known to him.
She was, I was like, you know,

1744
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:54,700
you should take your shirt off first.
Everybody there,

1745
01:49:54,701 --> 01:49:58,060
I mean everybody at the gate was
looking at this guy like you're crazy.

1746
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,220
You're crazy guy. Yeah, no,

1747
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:03,010
somebody emailed in a loud car
because we were talking about it.

1748
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:06,760
I'd like to nominate someone for the talk
and openly on the phone in public hall

1749
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:10,000
of fame while waiting in line at
riding a woman, answers her phone,

1750
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:11,320
puts it on speakerphone,

1751
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:14,620
then hands it to her five
year old daughter who is now
walking around the store,

1752
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:18,730
holding the phone while the mom yells
across the store to talk to the person on

1753
01:50:18,731 --> 01:50:23,530
the phone. It was in fucking sane. Uh,
that's for the talking public champs.

1754
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:26,320
Yeah, that's, that's, that is
totally crazy. We got a good one.

1755
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:30,910
We were just in province town, uh, you
know, the way the top of the, of, of the,

1756
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:35,500
uh, the Cape and in New England and
it's, it's the gas town you ever been to,

1757
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:40,530
which means the funnest town and is
like this great little like beach town.

1758
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:43,930
We'd never been, we just wanted to go, we
were already on the east coast for like,

1759
01:50:43,931 --> 01:50:44,920
Oh,
let's take a couple of days ago.

1760
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:48,260
And the guy who picked us
up to get to the airport,

1761
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:53,390
like the Lyft driver picks us up real
thick, west Indian Jamaican accent,

1762
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,130
uh, any. And he's like, the phone's
ringing. And he's like, he's like, Oh,

1763
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:02,480
who's is this? And it turns
it up. Then, uh, Jacob o.

1764
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:06,990
G h A. R. R. Where are you?
You're supposed to be here. No,

1765
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:11,030
you said a it dirty. I did not say
30. I did not say 30 and he's like,

1766
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,600
Jihad, Jihad. Jihad listened to me.
She had, and she keeps screaming.

1767
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:17,600
She's screaming at him, his
employer. And he was like,

1768
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:21,260
how'd you go to the hospital?
And a g g had stopped yelling.

1769
01:51:21,261 --> 01:51:24,470
I have people in the car. Are you
going to the hospital or are you doing,

1770
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,970
are you doing left right now?
Are you doing left? Right.
And we're just like, wow.

1771
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,670
Oh my God.
It was like the most brutal over here.

1772
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:34,240
And it went on way too long and you
finally like shut it down. But it's like,

1773
01:51:34,241 --> 01:51:37,340
that would be my nominee for
worst. That's a horrible, yeah.

1774
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,570
Like you don't know your boss's number
and you just answer it while people are

1775
01:51:40,571 --> 01:51:45,340
in the car. Oh, I got by the way,

1776
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:50,400
probably a thousand messages and tweets
because Russia has appointed Steven

1777
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,620
Seagal. Yes, I saw your
Instagram post. Yeah.

1778
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:58,090
Special Representative of humanitarian
relations, but sure. U S and arm breaking.

1779
01:51:58,150 --> 01:52:00,580
He is, I don't know if
you know this, this is,

1780
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:03,220
you can talk about people talking
about themselves. Oh yeah.

1781
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:04,900
This is him in the interview.

1782
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,370
I mean I am the king and then province.

1783
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:11,900
Does that make sense?
I would believe he's the king of Improv.

1784
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:15,500
Steven Seagal probably. Yes,
yes, yes. Ans you so hard.

1785
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:19,040
Do you know what that actually means?
Because I watched more of an interview.

1786
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,260
I don't go off script.

1787
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:26,650
The other actors do and what I do is
I'll just change it in the moment.

1788
01:52:26,721 --> 01:52:30,610
So like while you learned the lines
of the script for the movie. Oh yeah.

1789
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:35,140
He will just throw stuff out
there and you have to figure out,

1790
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:38,870
he doesn't do improv comedy Improv.
He does.

1791
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:41,300
I'm just going to say the
lines I want to say. Yup.

1792
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:45,740
And scrap the other act or
I'm lazy. Yeah, yeah. Like A,

1793
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,870
here's the lines of scrub. Well, here's
what I'm going to say. Yeah. They're like,

1794
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:49,963
okay.

1795
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:54,380
I mean this is a guy who like God is
career career start by being like,

1796
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:56,840
he was like a studio execs.
Karate trainer. That's right.

1797
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:01,040
And the exact would take 'em in in a
meetings and let, let's, let's spar. Yeah.

1798
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:03,130
Would you put this guy in a
movie? Is that right? Yeah,

1799
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:07,970
and its story and this was the 80s when
it was all cocaine and misogyny know.

1800
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:12,590
And so like you know, he came out of
that era and probably just never changed.

1801
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:16,130
It was just like, no, you come
to my trailer, I want a blowjob.

1802
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,030
Is there anything going on?

1803
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:22,100
Is there any more like a that
I dropped off your lunch order.

1804
01:53:22,101 --> 01:53:25,730
Mr Seagal. That's all I'm doing. I know,
right? It's like, but could any be,

1805
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:29,130
could it be any crazier than they serious?

1806
01:53:29,170 --> 01:53:31,830
Mostly appointed Steven Seagal.
Yeah.

1807
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:37,220
Like a special representative that now
someone on the US side is going to have

1808
01:53:37,531 --> 01:53:40,050
to go. Yeah. All right.

1809
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:44,430
I'm going to talk to Seagal today
about yeah, how we can better.

1810
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:48,430
It's, it's in the, we're in the upside
down. Donald Trump is president.

1811
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:52,850
Steven Seagal is this fucking
thing. Hootin and we're
best friends now with him.

1812
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,170
It's, it's all this is absurdity. Yeah.
World is done. We're all going to die.

1813
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:58,550
Um,
it's all

1814
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:01,560
Hofer. Here's what Maury
over one more email. Uh,

1815
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:04,150
first I wanted to thank you guys for
the weekly free. Funny. Secondly,

1816
01:54:04,151 --> 01:54:09,151
I would like to bring some awareness of
how main mommy buns and his psychopathy

1817
01:54:09,881 --> 01:54:11,950
hay has been buying,
but then official to me.

1818
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:16,630
I used to love watching people
hurt themselves just like Tom,

1819
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:19,200
but ever since I lost a leg,
God dammit.

1820
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:22,900
Oh Shit in Iraq and seeing
some pretty horrific stuff.

1821
01:54:22,901 --> 01:54:24,470
I couldn't sit through it anymore.
Yeah.

1822
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:28,060
It has been over a decade of darkness
for me and something has been missing.

1823
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:31,240
But ever since I started listening
to the podcast, things have changed.

1824
01:54:31,241 --> 01:54:34,780
Listening to the audio of people
getting hurt desensitize me,

1825
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:38,160
and I'm now joining, watching
my favorite content again. Oh,

1826
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:42,250
thanks to Tommy for making life
worthwhile. Keeping them high and tight.

1827
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:45,520
Piss on me and beat me.
Try it out. Sal Gonzales,

1828
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:49,150
p s my wife was expecting our first baby.
Hey,

1829
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:54,360
Tina. Uh, is in the delivery
room. Okay, great. Good luck
to mommy and the tuner. Oh.

1830
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:54,910
So

1831
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:55,743
you know,
I thought,

1832
01:54:56,430 --> 01:55:01,160
but definitely like audio of like serious,
horrible injuries do. Oh, we do. Yeah.

1833
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:02,073
Okay.

1834
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:07,030
And Todd and Tom Laughs and laughs and
laughs like a psychopath. No, he does.

1835
01:55:07,031 --> 01:55:10,380
It's totally, totally crazy.
That's not good at all.

1836
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:16,030
And I have feelings for
people. It's, it's nuts.

1837
01:55:16,031 --> 01:55:18,250
But that is actually, that's really,
that's a really nice message.

1838
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:21,570
Bye.

1839
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:23,820
Helps this guy. So that's
good. I'm glad. Yeah.

1840
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,223
Yeah.

1841
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:30,810
Wow. Okay. Yeah.

1842
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:34,760
I'm not going to ask.
Okay.

1843
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:41,150
Crazily, my husband, he's so
stoic all day around the house.

1844
01:55:41,151 --> 01:55:43,980
Like we have this newborn,
we have these two dark for so

1845
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:45,360
ever.
Life is pretty happy.

1846
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:50,520
The only time I ever see him really joyful
is when he's watching a serial killer

1847
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:54,750
show on Netflix. Oh, mine are laughing
at people getting hurt. It's so funny.

1848
01:55:54,751 --> 01:55:59,250
It's true. Joy. Yeah. Look,
that's nonsense. It's not,

1849
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:03,460
