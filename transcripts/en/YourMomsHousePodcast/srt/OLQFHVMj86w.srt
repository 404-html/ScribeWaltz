[inaudible] [inaudible]

7
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,790
very exciting times. I have a
cold, which is not exciting,

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,190
but nevertheless,

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,220
we're here doing another episode of
your mom's clam and let's see Jean.

10
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,020
Yeah, I've got a couple
things coming up this weekend.

11
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:09,880
I'll be in Fresno and Bakersfield.

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,370
Bakersfield has some single seats
left so you'd have to sit alone,

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,420
but you could get in. There's probably
30 tickets left. Fresno has a few more.

14
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:23,320
That's this weekend, Friday
and Saturday. Then a,

15
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:26,170

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,210

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,580

there's a few tickets left. And Augusta,

19
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:44,320

Then I go to fill her up Delfia and the
only show with some tickets is the late

23
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,560

do small shows before I do big ones.

Kinda how you guys see us make the

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,510
Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright. Alright.

61
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,140
Uh, no matter and I, Tom,

62
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,880
he said your mother and I are
looking forward to this next chapter.

63
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,070
Um, your mother. And so let's
get into this gene, your mother.

64
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,290
Very exciting stuff. Pick show.
Ready. Oh yeah. Here we go. I'm ready,

65
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,060
mother. Here we go. Let's

66
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,980

67
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,640
Uh, pierce rattlesnakes.
Yeah. And drink while

68
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,880
a spit rare of snakes,
peers, Dan. The line.

69
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,130
I sleep out under a new
tree when the moon is full.

70
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,363
Okay.

71
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,330
Yep.
Well,

72
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,970
we'll go to your mom's house.

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,080
Who wrote this in my book says

74
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,750
Focus. Christina, you wrote this.
You're writing, what's the last word?

75
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,360
I can't read that as you're writing kiss.
Let me see.

76
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,750
Did you write me that rescue something
and then that's your writing, isn't it?

77
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,330
Yeah, that is. We like to a little
focus, Christina. Focus. Focus. Yeah.

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,170
You know what?
I like a little known Mott.

79
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,030
We'll let you in on a very intimate
mommy's secret is that Tom and I,

80
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:03,080
since we first started seeing each other,
we always have these comedy notebooks.

81
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,420
You always see me scribbling.
Yeah.

82
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,670
And we would go into the deep
pages and write each other,

83
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,530
messed up masters or draw
pictures of dicks and balls. Um,

84
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,760
our favorite thing to do on airplanes,
those magazines,

85
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:18,350
memories to draw dicks like on every
page of the, the skymall catalog.

86
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,150
Yeah. And then put it back. It's great.
You know, that's a gift to somebody

87
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,603
who's sitting there

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,590
came all magazine.

89
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,610
Defacement is probably one of my
favorite things we've done in the area.

90
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,240
I forgot. We, we should do that again.

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,240
That's another thing you
can do to spice things up.

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,650
Um, how are you doing?
How you feeling right now?

93
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,680
Oh, it's hired. We had a crazy
weekend. Our both our kids are sick.

94
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,370
Everybody's getting sick. You're getting
sick. The baby had a fever yesterday,

95
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:47,810
so I had to run them to the doctor.

96
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,120
And you know what they always
say when you bring your kid in.

97
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,110
Yeah. It's a virus. We find the
worst part of that fleet, honestly,

98
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,770
getting sick during this God
damn challenge. Oh right.

99
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,760
And you know,

100
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:03,930
your body just wants to
rest and I'm falling behind.

101
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:06,090
So the current standings right now,
right.

102
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,680
And sober fart Tobar Sober October
and the bane of my existence,

103
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,430
then there's not that much time left.
There's about a week left. Yeah. And it,

104
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,860
it had been pretty close for a while
and then Joe went nuts a few days.

105
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,140
You knew it was coming.
He's pulled far in a way ahead of us.

106
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,280
Um,

107
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,580
so really it's a competition now between
Bert Ari and I wish we kind of always

108
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:32,580
knew it would be. Yeah,
it's been neck and neck,

109
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,080
but like yesterday I just
couldn't do anything excessive.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,320
You know, my body was just
like, you need to round. Yeah.
But then you're like, fuck,

111
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,710
like you have to get something even
on the low. The whole thing is,

112
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:51,360
I've always gotten points every day
because if you let a day go by, it's just,

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,970
you're,
you're in too deep of a hole.

114
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,160
So even if you walk around and get some
points, you know, going on a long walk,

115
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,880
can you wear this telemetry
strap just all day? Good.

116
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,760
Can we put it on one of the dogs
and the dog ran in the backyard?

117
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,910
I don't think it will register the dog,
but like so,

118
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,670
but it's just one of those
things where like, dude,

119
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,620
our kid runs all day and put it on him.

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,210
I wish it burns calories so it'd
be like you really very active.

121
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,820
Oh, crazy. Yeah, but like I just
fucking, I did great the day before.

122
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:25,140
I've been,
I've been doing it all month,

123
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,250
but then feeling like this doesn't
make you want to run when you're sick.

124
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:32,510
You don't want to live.
You don't want to do shit science,

125
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,390
so it sucks your will to live. I know
y'all are. Hopefully it'll be better soon.

126
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,950
He's got to take drugs. I don't know
what drugs to take. Dayquil all right.

127
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,050
Maybe I'll take some dayquil. Get
yourself jacked. You'll jack me up,

128
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,160
Jack you off. Okay. Speaking
of that opening clip,

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,720
doesn't that feel like your first six
years in standup? Like every open mic? Oh,

130
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:55,980
I thought meant like,
doesn't this feel

131
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,760
like retro? Your mind does.
That's what it feels like for me.

132
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:03,150
Like I got such a big smile
when I saw this. I was like,

133
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,170
this is what this show's all about.
I did an interview with Larry King,

134
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,310
that's right, yesterday, yesterday, and
it'll be out in a few weeks, a week.

135
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,740
The movie comes out and he was like,

136
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,340
who would you love to have on your
mom's house? And I was like, um,

137
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,480
I don't know man. Because I was like, I
dunno. I started talking about it. I go,

138
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,090
we like trash TV like Bravo.
And he was like, what?

139
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,370
But I really wanted to say I
should have said like a CAS ripper.

140
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,320
That's exactly why I was thinking.
Yeah I didn't,

141
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,270
he did say he was like, he was like, so
what do you like on your show? I was like,

142
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,540
you know, we like to play like
viral interact clips of like,

143
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,480
like a guy who's like really high on meth
and he just wants to invite strangers

144
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:48,130
who have sex with him.
And he was like reflects.

145
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,060
I think that's the challenge of writing
this CBS pilot that we're doing right

146
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,080
now.
Like

147
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,800
how's the pilot? And I'm like, you know
what? We're really trying to keep it real.

148
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,700
Your mom's house is, I mean within
the confines of a network show,

149
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,540
the spirit being the same.

150
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,210
We can't have a guy being like I came
in for strokes so much thick cap com

151
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,660
couldn't believe up big his dick was,

152
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,730
but I was going to say that guy cause I
went to do a show at Bar Lubitsch and I

153
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,731
was watching like younger male comics
and the first six years it's just

154
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,070
masturbation. Like all they talk about
is jerky and headaches, which is fine.

155
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm not just saying it's just, it
reminded me of like, Oh yeah, this is,

156
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,630
oh this guy's got some other materials.

157
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,290
If you want to see some of his stuff here,
let's go and do it again.

158
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,180
Piss rattlesnake. Yeah, this is
Matt Kras. Remember this guy?

159
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,860
I spit rattlesnakes.

160
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:50,660
This is Dan and this is an open mind.
I sleep out under a no,

161
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,540
it is kind of like a bowling
alley. Canoga bowl. Sunday night,

162
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,790
fuck under covered darkness.

163
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,000
Black women only cause
the Sun Keynes file.

164
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,180
They like animals, beasts, raccoons,

165
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,590
foxes in sheets. God,
I love this shit. Wow.

166
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,930
Dangers. You know, maybe I do like
spoken word is pretty good stuff.

167
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,660
If it were like this,
yeah I'd watch this all day.

168
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,990
Why are we so attracted to this?
Lights me up inside.

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,250
This guy is a hero.
I like poopy.

170
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,930
You say poopy and my face lights up and
crazy people like I had. I love Gigi.

171
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,640
Allen is fucking guy.

172
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,940
Steve Lives is smooth
and pink times sweet.

173
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,710
I loved tastes that Pussy Pussy.
Me Nick.

174
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,950
Oh Pussy is Reimann quite a
bit. It's good. It's not bad.

175
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,780
Drink the pussy meat or eat to put and
then drink the nectar that it secretes.

176
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,200
We need, this is off the top of
the dome. Pretty good. Pretty good.

177
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:59,650
Somebody needs to lay a beat under
this. Uh Oh. I'm sure they will.

178
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,753
I'm sure they will.

179
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,250
I like how we take black dandelion wine.
Is that right?

180
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,880
All right. Sassafras
water, orange mass spine.

181
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,980
The color of a mud puddle,
which shoots at the water line.

182
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Hey now lack to lick the pedals of
iron roofs and then class and Brian.

183
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,430
Hm.

184
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,310
I mean this stream of
consciousness is pretty aggressive.

185
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:28,360
It's actually really good.
It sounds like he wants to get mudded.

186
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,340
It sounds like he may be under
the influence of something. No,

187
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,600
but that's the whole thing is this drugs
or mental illness is an interesting

188
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:42,220
segment. Yeah. We need a awesome
intro. Music for a mental illness or,

189
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,550
or drugs. Drugs are metal.
Yeah. I'm going to go, uh,

190
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,030
the intensity of the eyes,
the cadence.

191
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,350
I'm going to go mental illness.
Uh, maybe schizophrenia,

192
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,690
the stream of consciousness here.
Uh,

193
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,630
cause math guy tried out that guy's
math, right? We learned that. Yeah. Uh,

194
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,300
that's more aggressive and
a lot of shoulder asks. He,

195
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,800
this guy could be mushrooms, acid,
this, you know, maybe could be,

196
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,010
I'm feeling his intense eye contact.

197
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:15,730
That's mental illness to me
right now. Weird. Crazy. Yeah.

198
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,150
The boat for my lover.

199
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,490
Guilt or in a minute with golden silver.

200
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,870
Starla yeah.
On an Egf.

201
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,000
Shinra I want fashioned
a boat for my lover.

202
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,370
I just also feel like, you know,
it's not high production. Yeah.

203
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,880
But the fact that he knows to have a
microphone and a light and a camera on,

204
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:42,200
Whoa, wait a minute.
It's pretty good. I mean,

205
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:46,550
this is not your typical, your
mom's house. Wait a minute.

206
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,500
It's kind of frame semi correctly. I
like the lighting. The lighting is,

207
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,360
it's deliberate. It's not right, but it's,

208
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,390
it's a choice. And I,
but the biggest thing,

209
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,190
the biggest credit we have
to give them is audio. Wow.

210
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,800
You're right.
And I like his Iggy pop thing.

211
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:11,630
He's kind of shirtless with the
long weird hair. Uh, you're right.

212
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,590
This is kind of a revelation that guy.

213
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:17,090
See now I'm going on for drugs because
mental illness wouldn't have the

214
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:21,320
wherewithal, right. It could be drugs.
Yeah. Drugs. You have the focus.

215
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,570
Let us know sir. Which is, which is it

216
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,020
Mary?

217
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,020
She who wants to leave forever with
me under the leaves twinkling in dark

218
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,813
forest.

219
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,170
[inaudible] blind in gripping tightly
in the hand each and Desti rough chunk a

220
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:42,780
time.

221
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,830
I tell Ya. Asheville, North Carolina,
they've got a lot of talented people. So

222
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,280
yeah, that guy's pretty exact guy
from North Carolina. I have no idea.

223
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,770
But that's what I saw. Can he open
for you? Yeah, he could open for me.

224
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,650
What have you brought to this guy?
That's my new contest.

225
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,840
How insane can I make my
openers? B, that would be so fun.

226
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,200
This guy's are opening your audience.

227
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,860
So if they knew what was going on,
it would be really fun. You know,

228
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,500
if they knew we were like,
it's going to be crazy at my shows,

229
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm going to pay out an
absolute best person.

230
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,680
We could do like a gong show of crazy
people in the eye. But if you just,

231
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,120
if you just surprise them, whether it'd be
a lot of disappointment, you know? Yeah.

232
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,020
They got to be in on it.

233
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:30,140
You gotta be well cause this
truly for more than 30 seconds,

234
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,480
you can't really sit through
this. It's pretty painful. Yeah.

235
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,160
This is like open mic. This is what
you sit through for six years. Yeah.

236
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,190
If that bitch own lane
knew she was get in Madrid.

237
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,230
Oh Damn. Crew. Hey, hey, hey.

238
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,860
Um, I'm just making sure
our guest is on time there.

239
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,900
She's going to be a little
bit late. She says, okay,

240
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,050
if that bitch on Lynn. No. See he was

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,050
Dupan we've been saying
fuck the points lately.

242
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,420
Meaning well yeah,

243
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:11,840
last night a little grilled cheese
we had in and out yesterday.

244
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,820
You got to do it though.
If I had a sick day.

245
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:17,390
You just want to eat and you don't feel
full ever on sick days when you have a

246
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:21,080
cold. I know. It's so weird. Like a
bottomless pit. I don't understand.

247
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,370
I guess because your body's burning so
much just to fight the elements that what

248
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,140
it is.
It's my theory.

249
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,450
I was thinking about how disloyal you
are and somebody sent in this clip.

250
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:37,451
This is from a show in Australia where
they test a guy's wife to see if she's f

251
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:42,710
Gtr, TD. They test the wife.

252
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,310
Oh yeah, we should test the guy. No,
no. See what happened. Yeah. Okay.

253
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,460
What's the number one element
to a successful marriage?

254
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,240
That's what you guys have to yell at
trust. What is trust? Trust to say, Hey,

255
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,200
might to detectives over there.
They're going to be working for me today.

256
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,060
I'm about to make a call to my wife.

257
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,870
It's going to scare the bejesus out of
her and let's see if she's going to trust

258
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:06,660
her. How's it going when the detectives
knock on the door? Let's see how she goes.

259
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,080
So this dude who obviously has
it, has, um, has set up his wife.

260
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,270
So here's what he's doing.
Okay.

261
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,310
He calls her in a panic and basically
tells his wife that detectives are about

262
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:25,400
to arrive at the house about a
date, a certain date, and he's like,

263
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:28,820
lie to them and say, I was home that day
and that's it. And then he just like,

264
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:33,740
he's like, I got and then they knock on
the doors and there's hidden cameras,

265
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,020
but he really fucking throws her.
Yeah.

266
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,230
Honey,
listen to me.

267
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:45,231
You are about to get a knock on
the door by a policeman now babe.

268
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,224
Listen,

269
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,640
do you need to do me a favor and site
team that night that I was down in

270
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:53,690
Adelaide for laneway festival?
Friday fib second baby.

271
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,050
Need to tell him that I was with
you. Okay. It wasn't in Adelaide.

272
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,240
Oh,

273
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,500
always. With you and the family
hearing Sydney Gary thing.

274
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,183
Just do it.

275
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,193
Gotcha.

276
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,090
Torturing her.
Dig Fantastic.

277
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,830
Uh, officers day. Look with your hospital.

278
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm in the moment. Yeah. Okay. Do
you know a money model behind? No.

279
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,823
No.
Okay.

280
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,130
Oh,
she looks so nervous.

281
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,220
We're looking into talking to him about
the incident that happened in Adelaide.

282
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,370
We need to speak to him. I'm
sorry. Okay, we'll have you back.

283
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,590
I think he's just taking
the dog for a walk. Uh,

284
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,620
the incident occurred on February 2nd.
Was he a CV or an Adelaide?

285
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,180
She says, I can't remember. So she,
they asked her specifically that?

286
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,160
No, not when he was home and
Sydney and Adelaide on that day.

287
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,010
I can't remember what
time does he get me back?

288
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,710
He'll be back to that eight
o'clock tonight. OPM? Yeah.

289
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,670
And you can't remember any details from
that night? Friday, February the second.

290
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,250
I mean, she's not telling them what
he said to tell him. Right. So,

291
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,580
but what are, you know what she's doing?
She's, she's kind of hedging our bets.

292
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:18,360
Yeah. She's like, I don't know
what he did. I'm not going
to totally cover for him.

293
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,170
I'm just going to plead the fifth kind
of, this is fair. Like I'm going to be,

294
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,530
she's going want, well, how would you
ever be okay if someone goes, Tom,

295
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,710
where was Christina?
February 5th he fucking recollection.

296
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:33,000
So that's a good answer. Me and
said, I know when they say that,

297
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,710
then I would've been like, oh, what
date? February 2nd. Oh yeah, no, no.

298
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:41,900
She was here for sure. Yeah. We, uh,
we went out to dinner at the, um,

299
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,770
oh,
I forget what's the origin time play?

300
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,790
I would make that up because
you just called me. Well,

301
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,710
let me tell you what she's
doing wrong here. First of all,

302
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,720
when you're lying to the authorities,

303
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,110
you have to act surprised when they get
to the door. She's not a very good actor.

304
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,620
Yeah. No, I know. You need to be like,
wow, she's really truthful. Yeah.

305
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:01,410
She's a good person. Yeah.
That's why. That's why it's
on a piece of shit like us.

306
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,120
Right. She needs to
go, oh my goodness. La,

307
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,720
you guys are here. The law enforcement
here and then, I don't know.

308
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:14,490
Let me check in my calendar. February
what day? Second. Oh, um, let me see.

309
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,350
Yeah, no, we had a babysitter that night.

310
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,190
We went out to a steak
dinner on a date night.

311
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,900
You already,
yeah.

312
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,510
We'll come back and say you, man,
that's the best process moving forward.

313
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,943
Thank you.

314
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,300
Right,
man.

315
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,890
Sorry.
It was,

316
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,580
it was trust exercise to see if you're
trusting God in life where they go,

317
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm the better one here.

318
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,710
That's what you're supposed to trust me.

319
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,900
Come and meet the detectives.

320
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,320
She's just like you. She's a liar.
She's a, she's a disloyal. Yeah.

321
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,420
Have gt I, she's not an Ftt Rda.
Yeah. I Dunno if FTT RTD can be,

322
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:17,840
she's not a girl that rides till
death appropriate here. Yeah. Okay.

323
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,940
That's for girls that ride till death

324
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,200
and we have it in the store by the way.

325
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,000
And I really hope that the only people
wearing them real little checks,

326
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,120
like I'm extremely loyal.
I, okay, here's the deal.

327
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,960
If you gave me that call and I didn't
know what you'd done at that point,

328
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,780
I would lie for you to the police.
Thank you.

329
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,290
So let's just say I'm ride or die on
ignorance and I complete ignorance later

330
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,570
and be like, oh, in my calendar was wrong.

331
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:49,220
I thought you meant w o February
six Oh, I'm sorry. I fucked up.

332
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:54,110
I had it in here differently.
I thought you, I thought you
meant June. Yeah. Huh. I,

333
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,680
I then I take it back once I found out
that you killed the Starbucks Barista.

334
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah. By the way, uh, I had, uh,

335
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,810
a fan of the show asked me if you've
seen forensic files. Yeah, of course.

336
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,020
And they're like, yeah, but they
always get caught on that show.

337
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,370
So the show only profiles the losers.

338
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,290
The losers who get caught is what you're
saying? Yes. All those fucking dummies.

339
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,250
FTT RTDs again, somebody with curly
hair like they're not supposed to like,

340
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,050
like Philippe told us too. So how do
you think you can get away with it?

341
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:30,410
How do you get away with it? Not going
to give away all my secrets on this show.

342
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,360
You have to burn the body with acid.
Right. It's a good way to do it. I mean,

343
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:40,020
I heard, let me know. Okay. Um,

344
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,640
here's an email that
bitch, okay, go ahead.

345
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,760
Hey, Mommy's, I'm a new
listener. Enjoy the show.

346
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:49,120
Really recently in a meeting at work,
one of the dads on my team,

347
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:54,160
I mentioned courtesy, flushing it. Oh,
he believes we don't do this enough. Now,

348
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:56,530
the courtesy flush isn't
something new to me,

349
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:59,380
but I almost never do
it since that meeting.

350
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:03,190
I've been thinking about them nonstop.
Do you do them and do they work?

351
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I would imagine they only work in a
shit iceberg situation where the log or

352
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:13,270
sludge pile sticks out of the water.
If the shit is underwater,

353
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,060
how could it continue to give
off that stash? Personally,

354
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:21,061
I believe the need to courtesy flush
is rather where thoughts t money.

355
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,620
Uh, sorry. T I'm going to have
to disagree with you there.

356
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:26,290
I think courtesy flushes
are definitely a way to go.

357
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,450
You do that here? Oh yeah, you
do that for me. Oh yeah, you do.

358
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:33,320
I hear you flushing multiple times
and I think in public settings it's

359
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:37,190
definitely a thing to do. It's just
blew my mind. You realized for 14 years.

360
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,630
I thought that you were flushing so
frequently because there was so much brown

361
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:46,430
coming out. No. Oh, you're a courtesy.
Courtesy. Yeah, that's babe. You realize,

362
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,380
you know that joke you have. Yeah. We're
like, will you come out and you and I go,

363
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:54,290
do we need to go to the hospital?
Yeah, that was just because I'm like,

364
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,920
why is it fucking flushing so much?
It must be so much Kaka that comes out.

365
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,800
Well there is a lot of cockup
but my thing is that especially,

366
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,480
you know that first, the first release
is usually the biggest release, right?

367
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,820
Not In my case,
my second,

368
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,170
but when that comes out you have
fresh Kaka that just came out of you.

369
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,380
I hit flush immediately. Ah, it
sucks. All the cook it down. Yeah,

370
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,680
so the smell is going to be less than it
would be if it just sat there like soup

371
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,660
and like when you're
cooking a soup and it goes,

372
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,020
the smell goes through the house.
If it sits in the toilet longer,

373
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:31,670
it's going to smell own drum for sure.
No question about it. Here's smells sour.

374
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Your puppies. All I smell sound.
No. Sometimes they smell sweet,

375
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,410
but that's diabetes. Have you
ever smelled me? Courtesy, flush.

376
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,760
Never know. Tea, smell my
browns. No, that's a lie. No,

377
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:47,720
I don't even never smelled my brown. I
haven't. We've shared a bathroom before.

378
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,430
I mean he's still may be some little
after remnant, but no, nothing's wrong.

379
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,680
I always know when you've
just gone because you leave
behind the reminder toilet

380
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,190
paper. It's one square and
there's like a dab of Brown on it.

381
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,890
It's like oh that's his last wife
and let you know that I did it. Yeah.

382
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,060
How come you leave that there?
I wanted you to know that I did it.

383
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Why don't you wash it down?
I don't want you to be proud of me.

384
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,420
I always fleshed that for you so that
no one else sees it in the house.

385
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,280
Some parasailing, I'd do it for you.
You can just tell you my skills.

386
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,780
Look when you read this one,
marriage advice needed.

387
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:29,260
Dear Mommy's Dyrus. No wire
hangers. I know that reference.

388
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,580
I am so blessed to be married for 15
years to some random girl I knocked up.

389
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,500
It has been a great 15 years.

390
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,940
But I've been worried the whole time
because my wife has never given any

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,890
evidence that she shits.

392
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,990
No smells after she goes no
splashes on the bull note.

393
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:50,830
Nothing I'm worried cause either a,
she does shit,

394
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,890
in which case I'm married to some sort
of Austin Powers sex bot that does

395
00:25:56,141 --> 00:26:01,141
laundry or be even after 15 years she
is still not comfortable to shit around

396
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:05,410
me. How can I help her feel comfortable
to visit Brown town when she wants?

397
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,310
We've been together a good while,
but even during labor with both our kids,

398
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,600
she didn't shit the table,

399
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,460
which I was looking forward to almost
as much as meeting my new kiddos.

400
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,030
You've both given great advice and
would love to hear your perspectives.

401
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:21,070
Please email me back
with whatever you have.

402
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:23,190
Thank you so much for your time
and entertainment and advice.

403
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,770
Genes update from that. Yeah, I
would say at first say to David,

404
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,450
just say thank you.
Yeah.

405
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:30,660
I mean you don't need her to
want to shit in front of you.

406
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,620
That's the last line.
So, so she's keeping,

407
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,460
but he's kind of worried because
there's not even evidence. Listen,

408
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,450
she's shitting,

409
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,590
but she's doing it in secret and that's
what bothers him is that she's the need

410
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:46,220
to hide. Yeah. But think
of it as it's something

411
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,340
she's still trying to maintain
some level of sexiness for him.

412
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,160
That's why I would think of
it. Ah, you know what I mean?

413
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:57,440
She's still trying to be like,
you know, we've had kids,

414
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,160
you've seen my pussy blown out.
My God,

415
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,780
we've seen each other and probably our
worst and we've been sick around each

416
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:07,280
other. But I'm just still trying to
make you not think of me as a pooper.

417
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,790
Yeah, that's just a nice thing.
She's just trying to be, keep it nice

418
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,700
guess. But I feel like that's
there. There's that level.

419
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,280
Like I closed the door cause I
don't want you to see me. Boop.

420
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,130
I don't want you to see me poop either.
But I don't,

421
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,350
I don't go out of my way to hide it.

422
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,620
I know and I feel like that's what he's
like, well why doesn't she trust me?

423
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:28,910
And that's the level she's at. She wants
it to be like that. I worry for her.

424
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:33,911
Only that she might have shame surrounding
the brown and I feel like it's not

425
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:39,080
good to have shame around Brown.
That's true. Or sex or anything. Yeah,

426
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:40,970
I worry for her levels of shame.

427
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,260
I mean, the only thing I
could tell you, if, if,

428
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,760
if you're really concerned about that,
as you could tell her, be like, hey,

429
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:52,480
you know, you know I take
big, big dumps. Sure.

430
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:54,210
I know you do too.
Yeah.

431
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,810
And I don't feel like you should
be a take big dumps. Yeah.

432
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:58,980
I don't think you should be ashamed of it.

433
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:01,860
You don't have to run to a
different side of the house to poop.

434
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,340
I don't mind you pooping.
It doesn't bother me at all.

435
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,320
Did she fart in front of you?
Probably not from the family.

436
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,100
Not just tell her you like her farts.

437
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,780
Tell her you want to know
what they smell like.

438
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:17,990
Yeah. Just ask her acts, act Axar acts
or that and see what happens. Okay.

439
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,950
You Know Jean? Yes. As you mentioned,

440
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,960
we've been watching so many bravo
shows. Oh my God, I, it's, but you know,

441
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:30,920
we go through phases of stuff, like we
get into scripted shows and we always,

442
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:35,180
we always go back on that
and to this episode, by the
way. No, but I, I don't know.

443
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,550
We'll see. But, um,

444
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,630
I thought we should discuss the episode
we watched with Hannah and Conrad

445
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,780
[inaudible]. Uh, so this is
below deck med. There's two.

446
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:47,150
There's below deck and below deck med.
Yes.

447
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,210
And so Hannah's the chiefs to Stuart s
and she's banging the Boson who's like 23

448
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:58,290
years old. She's 30. She's 30
yet and so years. Yeah. I said,

449
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,060
but, and I only just seven years. It's
like those are the quantum leap years.

450
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:05,300
Like your early twenties or so different
from your thirties. That's true.

451
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:09,870
I'm just establishing yourself. You're
still not really an adult. Yeah, I dunno.

452
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,610
What do you,

453
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,900
we've been kind of going back and forth
on the Soak Conrad in this check or

454
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:17,600
banging then dating for what,
a couple weeks?

455
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,130
Yeah, on a boat. You know, they're living
in this kind of isolated world, right.

456
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,510
Cause you're right.
Floating around,

457
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:28,310
just working together with
the personalities that
you work with and guests.

458
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:31,670
So it's kind of like study abroad.
You're like,

459
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,350
I think the love happens.

460
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,800
Yeah. And it's in this
isolated world, basically.

461
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,460
Everything's kind of heightened
and stuff. Yeah. So, um,

462
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,530
I guess he bought her a
carton of cigarettes when
they were in port and at the

463
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,630
end of a night of drinking or whatever,
or you're about to go out. Oh,

464
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,320
they're about to go out,
like getting ready, right.

465
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,630
Yeah. The, when he bought it, but then
they're getting ready to go out on a,

466
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,080
on a night out on,
all right.

467
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,330
So she's getting ready and it's
kind of quick and, and he's like,

468
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,280
they have their cabins.
Next week,

469
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,420
the crew does all down stairs on the
boat and he leans over and he's like, oh,

470
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:11,380
hey, don't forget you owe
me 50 bucks for a, yeah.

471
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:16,360
You want me to follow for that?
Right. He says it real casually. Like,

472
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:20,920
Hey, heads up. Do you want me
to that 50 bucks? Yeah. And,

473
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:25,810
um, she immediately was like,
okay, uh, hold on, let me
get that for it. He's like,

474
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:28,990
no, no, I'm not like right now. I'm
just saying like, it just, yeah,

475
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,920
I just remembered that. So I'm telling
you, she's like, no, no, no, no.

476
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,760
And you could tell that she's kind
of rolls her eyes. She's not into it.

477
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,470
And she goes into her wallet, she gets
to 50. She goes, here you go. He's like,

478
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:45,580
I didn't mean like right now. And then
you kind of think that, I don't know,

479
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,090
is this,
how serious is this exchange right now?

480
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,570
Then they get into a van and they drive
off and you can tell it's really eating

481
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:59,770
at her. So she starts to be like, oh, uh,

482
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,510
you got your 50 back, right? Like
you all settled now. And he's like,

483
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,160
I wasn't making a big deal about it.

484
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,630
Then she starts to do kind of juvenile
stuff cause she starts to bring it up.

485
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,560
Um,
like gifts that she's been

486
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,633
well,
and then she's like,

487
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,670
I had a BMW when I was 16 my grandma
gave it to me and whatever it is,

488
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,740
my favorite car, Hannah Fry, she
sat, they frickin this shit. I don't,

489
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,040
I can't remember. They all
sound Australian. Cool.

490
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,140
She's just really better
accents and hours.

491
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,620
And then they Americans go on the boat
and I, we don't want no vegetables,

492
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:39,020
no fruit. Uh, you gotta have a lot of
ranch dressing, otherwise I don't hate it.

493
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,330
I won't check strips ranch.
So anyways,

494
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:44,730
so she gets really bent
out of shape about this $50

495
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,810
Yo and then it really escalates.
Then she pulls him aside and she goes,

496
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,140
I don't know if I'm like
the right girl for you.

497
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,470
And he takes that as you have to
be someone that would spend money,

498
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,010
but she's saying, this is what I
interpreted it. He takes offense to it,

499
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,010
like extreme offense to it that,

500
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,400
that maybe she's looking for a guy with
a lot of money to buy her things. Right.

501
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,750
And then her defense of that is like,
no,

502
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:18,751
I'm just saying that if your making
sure you get your 50 back as a priority,

503
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,960
that's not really, it does get
complicated because it actually,

504
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,680
there's a lot of nuance to the
conversation and she's like, no,

505
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:30,100
I'm just saying like a 50 if you've got
to get your 50 like you're not willing

506
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:34,780
to, you know, buy me something for 50
bucks without running to get it back.

507
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,010
I might not be like that to me is not a
relationship. And then he keeps going,

508
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
look I am [inaudible] I am of the belief
that everything is 50 50 like down the

509
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:46,544
middle.

510
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,090
And of course they were like yeah this
is also where the age comes into it

511
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,270
because then he's saying or the reality
is that he's 23 he doesn't have a lot of

512
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:59,870
money so is it,
you almost kind of go like,

513
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:01,820
well the east should have been a
little more understanding of the other.

514
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,960
She should have been more cognizant of
the fact that when you're 23 years old,

515
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,180
$50 can make or break you.

516
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,840
And so like when a guy buys you
something that expensive and you're in a

517
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:15,250
position that you're a little older and
when you've been earning learning, yeah.

518
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,280
Like you should kind of volunteer to pay
him back and they've only been dating

519
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,660
for two weeks now.

520
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:24,860
This conversation is really not about
money when you think about it, right?

521
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,650
It's like a, it's an
exchange. It's like, er,

522
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,480
from a woman's perspective it's like
ill, right? I'm giving you my heart,

523
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:35,930
my poon,
my tits and all that stuff.

524
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,160
And you're doing like tit for tat. Like
it's kind of gross. It is kinda gross.

525
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,610
Not realize though that money and how
you view it and how you spend it and your

526
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:51,221
whole view on it has so much to do with
your upbringing thousand times hardwired

527
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,660
into you a thousand times.

528
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,320
I would ask for the 50 back from my
friend, but not the chicken, the chick,

529
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:04,700
that girlfriend. I know for sure.
But then see what the thing is too.

530
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:08,240
Like when you're first dating and when
I dated people and even when we were

531
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,620
first dating in our twenties like
we both were broke. So I was like,

532
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,570
I would pay for something and then you
would pay for something that's true,

533
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,310
but kind of by covered you on something.
I would not bring it back up. Oh, okay.

534
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,680
Remember when I bought that thing? You've
got to give me that back. I'd be like,

535
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,920
uh, cause to me that says like
that's your friend. Yeah, that's,

536
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:32,830
but that's my, I'm aware enough to know
that that's how my mind operates. Yeah.

537
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,020
And I also am aware enough to know that
I wouldn't want a girl to think that 50

538
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,540
meant that much to me.
Even if it did,

539
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,640
I would rather just eat that because I
wouldn't want her to think like is 50

540
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:52,340
fucking really affect you? Even if it
did, I would still be like, no, it's fine.

541
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,650
It's cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's,
that's true. But I mean again that's,

542
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,830
that's looking back on God who I was and
how I was raised and well that's how I

543
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:07,850
was trying to pay for dates.
But you were chivalrous and like,

544
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,650
but I think also the reason you and I
worked so well is that you always offering

545
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,990
to pay back in the day
when you didn't have it.

546
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,470
And I wasn't the kind of girl that
would take advantage of that. Very nice.

547
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,700
I looked out and he also did not
have expensive tastes. You were not,

548
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,450
it was like you've gotta be fancier.
In fact,

549
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:29,660
I our first date,
remember you, I was like,

550
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:33,460
let's go to this bar and Pasadena
that you can still smoke at. Yeah.

551
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,580
That was my big night
out you. That's true. Uh,

552
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,190
but you're about that family stuff man.
About money. Yeah. Like my parents,

553
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:45,900
I had to really unlearn a lot of poverty
thinking and a lot of scarcity thinking

554
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:49,860
and like, it's like in your
DNA, it's horrible and it's,

555
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,640
and it actually makes you more
anxious and it makes you reject.

556
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,640
It actually prevents you from earning
more money. Makes you kind of understand.

557
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,410
It's crazy. Yeah. Cause he talks about it.

558
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,450
He comes from a family where the dad had,
what was it he was,

559
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,990
he's found out that he didn't
see his dad for a long time.

560
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,210
And then when his dad did visit,

561
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,500
it was like his dad visited him to
verify something so that he didn't,

562
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,410
he had to make sure he didn't have to pay
any more child support. And then he, oh,

563
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,780
cool. Views with money. Yeah.
Negative. That's very negative.

564
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,920
And he views,
um,

565
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,970
anybody who wants even like you to give
them a dollar as somebody who's trying

566
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:33,110
to take something from somebody with
ulterior motives, you know? Interesting.

567
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,600
So in a child's mind, he
could have been like, Oh,

568
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:38,970
the reason my dad isn't
around us because of money.

569
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,360
I don't know what that even like people
listening right now all have different

570
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:46,530
relationships with money. Oh my
God. Some people, it's natural.

571
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:50,730
So people would naturally side
with the, with Conrad, the boy,

572
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:53,820
and some would be like, what? Just
fucking, cause she's not that.

573
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:57,390
Whether they make her out
to be materialistic, Hannah
on this episode, like, Oh,

574
00:36:57,391 --> 00:37:00,480
she's materialistic. She's
just this bet shoe. Where is
he sound? Lauren. It's like,

575
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:00,931
well,
no,

576
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:05,330
she actually worked really hard to buy
those things that she enjoys wearing.

577
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,920
He and of course gives a shit, but
I want to throw out there, cause I,

578
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,780
I struggled with money for
many years. Not, I mean,

579
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,400
I think philosophically and
the poverty mentality and like,

580
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,960
I don't deserve nice things or, um,
because money's not, it's an exchange.

581
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:26,700
It's not about, anyways,
there's this great lady named
Louise Hay. She's dead now.

582
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:31,530
She just died. Louise l hey, and she
gave, there's a talk about money.

583
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,240
Uh, it's, you can download it on
iTunes. I recommend listening to that.

584
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:38,040
That really changed my perspective on,

585
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,000
on money and deserving more
in life in general. Right. Um,

586
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,850
you get stuck in a fucking poor mentality,
dude. That's a fucker. Did you know,

587
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,660
by the way,

588
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,520
did you know that Rosie O'donnell
played a special person in a movie?

589
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,380
No. Stop. I swear to you. How did I
miss this? It was just sent to us.

590
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,390
Jojo is beautiful and successful.

591
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,640
Beth has a stall or they
have nothing in common.

592
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,100
She's retarded
now.

593
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:15,250
They're going to be more than family.
They're going to be

594
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,660
a film by Angelica Houston

595
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,890
and was that famous actress.
She's with two Andie Mcdowell.

596
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,283
Rosie O'donnell,

597
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,570
Andie MacDowell hiding the bus
with my sister Tuesday at one watch

598
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,810
this whole film.
Do like a streaming Rosie.

599
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,810
Can we watch this full movie and
do an episode where we watch it?

600
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,590
We got to get ahold of riding the
bus with my sister only on BBC fall.

601
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,993
She's retired.

602
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,293
Oh,

603
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,520
can I watch that again?
You want to see that again?

604
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,520
Is Beautiful and successful.

605
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,053
She's retarded.

606
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,370
He's done.
This is unreal.

607
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,200
Gelica Houston did this film.
Famous lady too.

608
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,250
So can you imagine Rosie O'Donnell
like practicing being retarded.

609
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,110
Oh wait, wait. How do I run like is her
run is a little ridiculous. Yeah, it was.

610
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,090
It was kind of silly.

611
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,920
Rosie O'donnell, Andy Mcdowell, you

612
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,520
get into that mental place
that that's what I'm saying to,

613
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,100
to play one of these roles. That's what
I'm saying. Cause it's like you're,

614
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,390
you want to portray it
sympathetically and accurately. Yeah.

615
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,460
But it's also kind of funny kind of.

616
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,670
I like how she has a stack or cookie.
She's like,

617
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:04,020
this is what we're talking to people do.
Right. They get a whole stack. L'Oreal,

618
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,030
I dunno.
It's really something.

619
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,570
What year was this?
How did I miss this?

620
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:17,290
I was in five. No. Yeah, that's an
old, I mean, you know, relatively,

621
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,780
and this one kind of flew under the
radar a little bit. A little bit.

622
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,690
We should hide it
and this reminds me,

623
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,850
62 up is coming out in 2019 the up series.
We've got to go see that.

624
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:33,610
They usually play it at a small
theater here in la. If you're in,

625
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:37,000
if you're in the UK, you probably
know about the seven up series.

626
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,500
It started in the 60s where they follow
a group of English kids from the time

627
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:45,310
they're seven years old and every seven
years they revisit them to see the

628
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,390
premise of Erasmus.

629
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:50,500
You give me the the child from the age
of seven I'll show you the man to fall

630
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,160
percent. So fascinating to see if
you can transcend your socioeconomic,

631
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:58,450
if you really want to binge on levels.
Yeah, it's great. Binge on something cool.

632
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,810
Watch the seven up series. Yeah,
it's called the number seven,

633
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,230
you p series seven up every meeting,
every seven years.

634
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:09,160
You have revisited the same
kids every seven years.

635
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:12,630
And it is the fascinating thing
is because the premise of the,

636
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:15,790
of the whole series that goes,
show me, uh, I know, I know,

637
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:18,370
but she'll make it at seven
and I'll show you the man.

638
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,720
So when you see a kid until he's seven,
and I'll show you the man,

639
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,643
how you raised them,

640
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,820
how many of these kids that
you see on that first one,

641
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,720
and it's black and white, you know, it's,
it's whatever shifts or six days ago. Um,

642
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,640
and you see the kid who's like,
oh, I'm going to go to Cambridge,

643
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,500
I'm reading maths at Cambridge.

644
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,940
And that kid grows up and he goes to
Cambridge and he becomes a lawyer.

645
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:48,670
And then you see like the kid
who's a on the monkey bars, what,

646
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,460
why his teeth is hanging
off. And then he's, uh,

647
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,150
he's running around pulling his pants
up because they keep falling down.

648
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:59,510
He hasn't bought a belt. And
he's like, yeah, they really,

649
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,020
they show you the full run of it. It's
fascinating. It's really fascinating,

650
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,701
especially in the UK.

651
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,940
What's interesting is this idea
that you can kind of transcend your,

652
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,460
your socioeconomic status.
I think back,

653
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,530
you know the idea like if
you're born in a certain class,

654
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,860
are you going to be able to get out
of it and the rich get richer? Yup.

655
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,120
It's pretty exciting.
Pretty. Is it 62 of no,

656
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,010
is it 69 now at 62 right, because the
next one, don't forget to read that.

657
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,550
Here we go.
Stop love shaming.

658
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,800
Giulia to tad and crispy.

659
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,220
I seek your attention based
on the recent broadcasting.

660
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,730
Have a video made by a man.
You know what does that go away?

661
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,910
I don't know that the
two of you and flipper,

662
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:45,740
Sparta openly love shamed. I don't
know what that means. Giulia.

663
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,380
Oh, for first four hosts
our guests, Felipe Esparza.

664
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,510
Giulia sharing this video is essentially
revenge porn and today's climate.

665
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:58,400
Simply greeting a woman politely is
grounds for an indecency accusation and a

666
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:01,310
guilty verdict and the court
of public opinion. Granted,

667
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:05,600
the gentleman who sent the video would
be able to Texas Julia aged daughter with

668
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,810
the same efficiency.
If I cut off nine of his fingers,

669
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,220
IVL vehemently reiterate that he is
stepping into the unknown in order to

670
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:15,530
utilize his iPhone technology
and the name of love.

671
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,690
I formally request you cease love shaming
a man who took a huge leap in the name

672
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,000
of his world, Juliet. She deserves
to feel like a real woman.

673
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,720
She's gorgeous. She's precious.
Let's go full throttle forever.

674
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,310
Not Too dumb to come,
Patrick. Wow. Lesson it.

675
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,840
Don't fucking blame this
me too. Stuff on Julia.

676
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,990
Julia, don't blame the me too
movement on not being able to hit.

677
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,710
All of you guys know the
fucking difference. Come on.

678
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,160
He's something that could you imagine
waking up next to that every day.

679
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:56,060
I'll go morning talk.
Let's go full throttle.

680
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,110
Go full throttle.
I love you so much.

681
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:02,570
Oh my God.

682
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:08,080
The level of no one would ever love
you the way that I do so fucking weird.

683
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,100
Let's go full throttle.

684
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,890
Full throttle, full throttle.
God, that guy's really scary.

685
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,140
It's so scary.

686
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,160
He's a really terrifying man.
Yeah.

687
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,700
I mean before social media you would
just get creepy letters from guys.

688
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,880
I once had a guy in high
school notes on my windshields

689
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,010
experienced me. You won't even know
who your ex boyfriend is. Yeah.

690
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,640
Like I would follow me to Taco
Bell with my friends after school.

691
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,680
I had that feel terrible. What age?
This is high school. Like senior year.

692
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,360
He would just follow you.
He didn't go to him.

693
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,110
I went to an all girls high school and
this guy would somehow like break into

694
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:53,880
campus,
put a note on my car,

695
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,660
follow Shauna and me to talk
about and like show up there,

696
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,660
show up at my house. Like
really? Really Cray cray.

697
00:45:01,661 --> 00:45:03,950
It's really crazy to Julia Google.

698
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,060
Oh Man, I will love you. Like
you've never been loved before.

699
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,320
That's insane to say to somebody
the day after you met them. Yeah.

700
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,610
That's the part where you go like,

701
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,010
cause there can be parts of this that
are charming, you know, could be. Yeah.

702
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,660
And then you go somewhere there and
you're like, no, we'll travel. Eh?

703
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,100
Yeah.
He's a little obsessive,

704
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,890
but it's been sitting in my
mind when you said to me,

705
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:31,500
you want to go back with
your ex boyfriend? Boy,

706
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,830
he's too old for this type of behavior
too. Of course he is. Yeah, of course.

707
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:42,180
He's old. He's like, what? 30
something at least at least.

708
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,300
Maybe there's forties. Let's go full
throttle and let's go full throttle.

709
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,740
That's cool. Full throttle. So
we get a cool guys. Uh, my man,

710
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Gee,
I a new social media posts.

711
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,910
I saw it the other day and I
immediately vomited into my mouth. Um,

712
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,210
there couldn't be anyone weirder.

713
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,890
He's the coolest poster on social media.
He is the weirdest guy.

714
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,720
Weird. He has no cool. How does he have
like no cool to be that big of a star?

715
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,530
Yeah, he's zero. Cool. I don't
know if people understand too.

716
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,450
I think people are like, oh
yeah, he's popular amongst, um,

717
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,020
you know, country music.
Do you know something?

718
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,040
Did you know that the number
one act in the world above,

719
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:36,780
beyond say Bruno Mars?
All of them. Everyone.

720
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,370
Are you fucking serious? Yup. Yup. And uh,

721
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,570
and what he's about to do,

722
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:46,980
what he's about to embark on when he's
announcing here will be the biggest tour

723
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,570
of all time, man. It's our
agent's Rep. This guy. Yes,

724
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,470
go flow and telling you.
I love it all about it,

725
00:46:56,471 --> 00:47:00,590
but it does let him be Julia Beard. It
was weird. Or Julia or this guy, right?

726
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:03,880
This guy, the full trial guys
guys. This guy of all time. Yeah.

727
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,230
Everybody. Garth here
in Nashville, Tennessee.

728
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:09,050
Right here in the place where we've
got inducted into the hall of fame.

729
00:47:09,051 --> 00:47:12,270
Great Room right here and the
country music hall of fame. God else,

730
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,920
the world tour today, the stadium
tour. This is going to be fun.

731
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,960
I want to call it the
big ass stadium tour.

732
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,660
It's just stadium tour above
is all the information on it.

733
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,080
But what we talked about today is we're
going to introduce five cities before

734
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:27,080
Christmas to go on sale because
on insights to you, gee,

735
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:28,940
you guys asked for a longer planning date.

736
00:47:28,941 --> 00:47:31,930
So can plan to be at as many of
these as you can. Here it comes,

737
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:35,020
the first two cities, St Louis
where we're kicking it off of man.

738
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:36,880
You talk about a love fest.
Last time we were there,

739
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,120
Phoenix specifically doing Dale Arizona,
uh,

740
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,510
where the cardinals play there at
State Farm, uh, stadium as well.

741
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,390
So those are the first two. The other
three will be announced here shortly.

742
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,350
And again, they'll all be on sale
before Christmas. And remember,

743
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,190
this is all about game day. Every show
is going to be game day or Garth Day.

744
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,470
However you want to look at it.
Come dressed in your full color,

745
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:00,310
support your team. Let's go have some
fun and let's get physical playing music.

746
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,173
I like that thought,

747
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,510
Huh? What the fuck is wrong with
you man? What is wrong with you?

748
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,710
Can I tell you what's really,
he doesn't know how to connect no beings,

749
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:20,060
which is odd that yourself
such a huge music star, right?

750
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,040
That's the,
see,

751
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:25,540
this is the conundrum is he's trying to
be this friendly social media guy and

752
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:29,140
he's not this guy. Let's get physical
playing music. I don't understand.

753
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,530
So Game Day, he means that. So
he's doing a stadium tour, right?

754
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:37,120
So all these shows will be weird.
Normally football teams. Ah,

755
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,051
he's like,

756
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:43,051
it's game day where your team's favorite
colors show up at the Glendale game

757
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:48,460
wearing Arizona cardinals gear.
And then because it's game day,

758
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,940
let's get physical playing
music. I like that, but I'm,

759
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm not so taken.
Yeah,

760
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,830
let's go have some fun and
let's get physical playing
music. I like that thought.

761
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,940
Oh my God.

762
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,550
And then the crazy chimp smile.
Oh Man, I think I'm okay.

763
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:05,770
Yeah,

764
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,440
it's that he,
he must not like this process.

765
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:13,390
So much of like talking to the camera and
trying to be relatable. Yeah, it's true.

766
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:14,540
Because you know what happened?
Oh,

767
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,150
he probably or definitely got in late
on social media because we remember when

768
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:21,920
he was introduced to it and the
weirdest things like, hey guys, I'm on,

769
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm on my space now.

770
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,120
Well, I guess it's official.
We're now on Facebook.

771
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,400
I really wasn't sure about this to start,

772
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,850
but then a friend of mine said something
that just made all kinds of sense.

773
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,320
She said think of it more as
a conversation. I like that.

774
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:40,090
I mean, that's like the weirdest
thing that anyone's ever said. I know.

775
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,050
So I think what happens is this is a
guy that comes from the age of like,

776
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:47,910
just do your act to do radio interviews,
maybe, you know, do that kind of thing.

777
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,800
So all this stuff is so foreign
to him that he's never adapted.

778
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:55,850
Like how to be natural doing it. Well,
and also, and I'll tell you an also,

779
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,020
he might be a monster in real
life. No, I do. I do. So he,

780
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,840
this is him like pretending to
be, I think he's a monster. Okay.

781
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,820
When somebody really smiles,
you see his smile. Yeah.

782
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,260
The eyes don't match the smile
when, when you really smile, look,

783
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,500
and it's genuine that you get wrinkles
in your eyes and the eyes kind of narrow.

784
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,120
Right. So his eyes are just normal,
wide open and then like this,

785
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,080
yeah,
that's a sociopath.

786
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,380
Like a chimp smile that his, his face
doesn't light up to match it. Yeah.

787
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,390
I think there's that.
I think that he's so forcing,

788
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:37,520
he's forcing this relate-ability and
it's not relatable. Now he's forcing,

789
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,450
I think he's a monster.
I think he is.

790
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,890
He's so afraid that people are going
to see that he might be a little shitty

791
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,920
because you watch somebody
like Dolly Parton. Okay.

792
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,430
Watch her talk to anybody and
you can tell a Dolly Parton is,

793
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,410
Dolly Parton has Dolly Parton no matter
what she's so she speaks from the heart.

794
00:50:57,411 --> 00:51:02,120
You can tell she's warm, but
this, this guy is dark city,

795
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:05,960
darkness, darkness,
darkness, darkness. Yeah,

796
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,320
but he doesn't embrace the darkness.
He keeps pushing it and pushing it away.

797
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,650
And that's what that looks like
when you're like, hi, I'm nice.

798
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,760
I promise some nights it love me
and everybody likes me. Daddy.

799
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,810
Hey, okay, well how did
I do here? How did I do?

800
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,040
Hey Tom here inside your mom's house
studio where we fill every episode is

801
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,880
pretty cool, man. I just
want to nail down tour.

802
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:34,500
I wanted to call it the, tag it down
your throat out. You're assholes who are,

803
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:36,860
but it's just take it down. Uh, uh,

804
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,480
I wanted announced some days
because you guys asked me, you said,

805
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,640
can you let us know way ahead of times.

806
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,060
We can be able to go to as many
of these as we want to. Yeah,

807
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:49,950
so here's the first two men.
Oh, we're going to do the
May sonic in San Francisco,

808
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,010
January 4th Oh,
such a love fest there last time.

809
00:51:55,590 --> 00:52:00,590
And then we just added a Oklahoma
City on Tuesday actually goes,

810
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,880
see commonly on Tuesday,

811
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,660
we're going to be Tuesday the city at
the tower theater and that's gonna be

812
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:10,500
January 22nd we're going to
have so much fun. Hey dressed.

813
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,290
Where are your favorite things?
And this,

814
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,050
this whole thing is going to be like
sports fun. It's like, hey comedy,

815
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,690
while we're getting physical.
I like that.

816
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,790
Yeah, you're super relatable and you're
connecting a normal, right? You're like,

817
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:27,010
this is a normal guy. You did
a great job. Thank [inaudible].

818
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,710
I was laughing as I was filming
you. Okay. Here's another,

819
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,340
and another really presumptuous thing
he says during the stadium tour plug,

820
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,760
it's like you guys wanted to know all
the dates so you can land your lives

821
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,510
around my fucking concert.
Not only that plan to go as many as these,

822
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:46,930
as many of these, I know you
want to come to like 10 of these

823
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:54,060
actually that's the one thing he is
actually not lying about. Oh my God.

824
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,520
He put a show on sale at Notre Dame
stadium where the football gamers play

825
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,120
fighting Irish play. And it was
like, I mean it was a minute,

826
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,200
two minutes. So he's like the grateful
dead cause people just follow.

827
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,810
And here's the thing, I was talking
to a friend about that. I was like,

828
00:53:13,811 --> 00:53:18,811
the fascinating thing is like you
telling me that Beyonce or Bruno Mars or

829
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:23,500
somebody like that is a huge act or
the stones. I'm like, yeah, of course.

830
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,340
And I hear people talk
about them all the time.

831
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,270
He's the only guy who I've never heard.
I never hear anybody talk about,

832
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,280
and I know you go like,
well you're not, you know,

833
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,200
or you're not in a place where
countries big. That's true. But okay,

834
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:42,140
that's true to a degree. But
to sell the way he sells, it's,

835
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:47,370
it's in every major city to La.
I'm sure he will. I'm sure he will.

836
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,300
He'll probably do like the fucking
rose bowl or you know the Colosseum or

837
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:54,390
something. People in La with deff. Fuck
yeah. They love him and he's doing,

838
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:58,440

Stop it. Hey, leave her alone.

853

00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,490
It's a 21 minute.

857
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,823
That'd be great.

858
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,320
I'm just a nice guy backstage
and rehearsals to listen to that.

859
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,660
This isn't studio g. This is
a stage. Cool. Cool, cool.

860
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,040
I should do studio tours like this,

861
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:42,070
like my soundcheck come also Sirius
XM channel 55 is Gardner Facebook.

862
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,090
Hello Buddy. Welcome. There
is double dad wave. Yeah.

863
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,870
You can hear the opening
number in the back.

864
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:51,710
I'm going to get Dan to kind
of take it down a bit. Hey Dan,

865
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,680
I'll fucking fire you.
That's trying to be nice to Dan,

866
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:58,980
but it has to carry the
fucking thing down down.

867
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,280
I said turn the fuck down Dan.
You like your job.

868
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:07,500
You started touring. It's so
funny, Huh? What was so funny?

869
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,430
This is a big day inside
and out all day long.

870
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,610
So full of fucking Shit, man. Sure.

871
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:18,160
This guy is such, I just don't
buy beer. I really don't believe.

872
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:23,030
I don't believe him either. He's not
this affable. You know what Dolly Parton.

873
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,010
That bitch is nice.

874
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,060
Do you know she lets people like sleep
on our lawn and shit. Yeah. Dollywood,

875
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:33,560
she really, she's nice. Dolly
Parton is nice for real. No,

876
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,050
it's going to air. The Notre Dame show
is going to air on CBS on December 2nd.

877
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,890
Okay. That will to CBS with this guy
says this show was different. Uh,

878
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:46,420
Garth is one of the very few artists from
the planet worthy of staging the first

879
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:50,490
ever concert at the venerable venue.
Um,

880
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,770
oh and he played through horrible, uh,
what's it called? Weather conditions.

881
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,700
Okay. He's this great performer. Oh,

882
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:05,020
it talks about relate-ability of
Garth to the heartland. Sorry,

883
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:09,670
our guest is here. Oh really? Okay.
Why don't we take a quick break. Okay.

884
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,200
All right. And we're back. Uh, the break,
you never know about it just happened.

885
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,370
And we are joined by somebody who we've
been trying to get on this show for a

886
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:22,430
while and she's finally
here. Please. Uh, hold Europe

887
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:28,050
for David Letterman. Hi, it's Andy. David.

888
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,900
Any better man? I'm so bummed because she
usually wears her Adidas three stripes.

889
00:57:31,901 --> 00:57:33,790
I was really excited to see
you and that's why I wore it.

890
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,170
I've worn it the same night as

891
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,200
well cause you look like you could be
my tribe in eastern bloc or vibe to you.

892
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,140
Well I feel like I started a posting my
pictures and thing and people were like

893
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:48,490
what about Chris?
Like they were like,

894
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,670
they were trying to start a
beef between us. No such thing.

895
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:55,140
I love and respect you too much. There's
no way. You're like one of the girls,

896
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,200
the comedy store I always liked
cause you come, you come with jokes.

897
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,360
You know what I'm saying? Like I
like I always respect a female comic.

898
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,880
Any comic that comes and tries to like
take a swing, do, don't just push the owl.

899
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,480
It's a wild thing to not do comedy
while you're on stage. Right.

900
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,430
It's just so like what? Why would
you put the audience through this?

901
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,090
What are you doing and all the like,
it's so lecturer in shooting now two,

902
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,000
it's like what you're not,
you're going to not only not do jokes,

903
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:25,630
which is what they paid for,
but then also like condemned their law,

904
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,780
their lifestyles. Right. What are
you doing? Cause you can make fun.

905
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,870
Like it's fun to make fun of people you
don't agree with because that's the best.

906
00:58:31,871 --> 00:58:34,210
It's like when you write a joke that's
good enough that you're both laughing at

907
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:37,030
them. That's like the ultimate,
I don't know why people,

908
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,540
yeah,

909
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,010
we're in this place now to where it's
actually the reason that there is people

910
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:44,620
lecturing all of that is
because comedy is so popular,

911
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,830
so it's actually great that we're
in a business that is so popular.

912
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,520
It's so big that people who
suck at it can still do it.

913
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,870
Yeah.
People accept that.

914
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:56,260
Like they're one of the people they it
to like the boom I'm or the night. Yeah.

915
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,590
It's fantastic. If you're
actually good, not in a boom.

916
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,590
Only the really good people get to do it.
It does feel good.

917
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:04,860
And by keep complaining
ladies keep coming. Yeah,

918
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,030
I'm just going to keep doing the spots.
I love it.

919
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,400
And that's why I love Annie Letterman
because you're fucking ride or die.

920
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,760
She's the real deal.
She grinds that whole bullshit to that.

921
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,940
I've heard they're like,
there's no women at the store.

922
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,400
I've been at the store with a bunch
of women. They never mentioned

923
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,540
me and those arguments,

924
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:28,190
because I don't fit the narrative because
I'm not like a famous draw a really,

925
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:28,371
you know,

926
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:30,500
like some people will come out to see
me but I'm not going to like fill the

927
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:33,770
seats. Like I'm not the one like
making the main room a or whatever.

928
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:37,100
So they don't bring me
up because you know,

929
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,780
like I just showed that you can like,

930
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:43,790
like work hard and do the job
and not like what like, you know,

931
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:46,400
when you guys are counting lineups,
like when I was at your stage in comedy,

932
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:50,780
I was like, uh, doing like I
was like on stage, you know,

933
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:52,010
it's not like I had all these people.

934
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:53,740
I remember when I started
doing Mike's and uh,

935
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,020
New York and these girls would get
mad at me. It wasn't just girls,

936
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:57,651
but it was like,
you know,

937
00:59:57,651 --> 01:00:00,920
this certain like class of comedians
that I like I guess started with,

938
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,060
they would get so mad.

939
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,840
Like I had one girl who like blocked me
on all these social media things and I

940
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:08,270
was like, wait, what's happening? I
see you every day. And she was like,

941
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:13,130
I'm mad because you, you always leave
the mix before I go on, I'm like, bitch,

942
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:16,640
you aren't on my radar. I've never
met you. I'm not friends with you.

943
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:20,510
Like oh this is my job. Like
I wasn't getting paid at it
but I was like, you know,

944
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:23,600
I quit drinking to do this. I moved
to new, like I, I sacrificed a lot.

945
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,640
I didn't have friends. Like I was
like wanting to do it. So I was like,

946
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,890
I had a day job working as a
waitress and I would immediately,

947
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:33,290
I had my hustle down where I had like
friends that would sign me up from right

948
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:36,230
there. I would sign them up
and I was doing like five
Mike's a night. So I'm like,

949
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:40,160
what's a, what's up bitches? I'm like
crying blood at the end of the week.

950
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:44,330
What are you doing? Wow, you don't
five mics. And then I had a, yeah,

951
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:48,440
it was a Mike Lawrence when I
first started doing open mics.

952
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,480
I've been doing comedy 10, almost 10 now,
so I still feel very young in it. But,

953
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,360
um, I had moved, I had lived in
Santa Fe and I was drinking a bunch.

954
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,120
I quit drinking,
moved to New York or move to Santa Fe.

955
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,680
I lived in Santa Fe for seven years.

956
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:05,360
I went to college there to the College
of Santa Fe, which went out of business.

957
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,730
My College fucking Trump feud.
They went out of business. Um,

958
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:13,230
I got an email from my, I
had moved to New York. Um,

959
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:18,330
I had all these incompletes and I just
figured like I would graduate college at

960
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:22,850
some point before I died and
left Santa Fe, moved to New York,

961
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,340
had just quit drinking and
started doing open mikes.

962
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:30,430
And I get a message on my Facebook from
one of my old art professors and she's

963
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,470
like, um, I just,

964
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,380
the is going out of business and we've
got a record of all the people that have

965
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:37,990
been completed to do a foreign completes,

966
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,450
but you have two weeks to finish
them if you want to graduate. Yeah.

967
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,380
And this was a bitch that would like,

968
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:44,120
I would skip her class and she
would call me and I'm like,

969
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,760
get away from me bitch. Like, what
do you my mom click? I'm like,

970
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:49,370
I'm in college now. I don't have
to go to class. I'm like, no clue.

971
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,450
So what did you end up doing?
Um,

972
01:01:51,451 --> 01:01:56,451
I ended up getting an
Adderall prescription and
charging on my credit card,

973
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,920
a bunch of flights and shit.

974
01:01:57,921 --> 01:02:01,640
I had to fly to Santa Fe twice in two
weeks because I had a statistics class

975
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:04,340
that's so hard and if I like statistics,

976
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,550
but it's like memorizing
all these numbers and shit.

977
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,870
And it had been years since
I had gotten my incomplete,

978
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:11,540
where I just like didn't do a midterm or
something, like something where I just,

979
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,970
I used to send it to my teachers. I'm
like, I thought it was called my terms.

980
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:15,710
I do them when I want.
Like I just was,

981
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,160
I was such a small school and I just use
my gift of Gab to get through things.

982
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:24,270
Um, but the, the guy that
wouldn't, the guy that was my
statistics teacher was, uh,

983
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:27,600
it was, the school was founded
by the Christian brothers,

984
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,590
so he was like this Christian brother
who brother Brian who was like,

985
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,860
he looked like the salary on Veggie Tales.
Like he just had like the craziest,

986
01:02:35,861 --> 01:02:37,590
like shaped head and shit.

987
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:41,970
But he would wear like this cloak with
like the rabbit teeth things and they

988
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:45,480
were just so weird and it was like,
they looked like ghosts from another time,

989
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:49,590
but he was very strict and like what,

990
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,270
just give me like,
my other teachers are like,

991
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,640
just write something and we'll
just, you know, give you a grade.

992
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,940
He made me fucking, he gave
me, first of all, he gave me
a d. I flew with her twice,

993
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:01,620
but I had to learn, relearn
statistics of all. Let's try my lease.

994
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,610
I paid a girl in beer to do my
statistics labs and call it.

995
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:09,570
That's how much I couldn't do it.
I was so stupid with math and it's like,

996
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,471
yeah you can't,

997
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:13,020
well you have to pay attention so much
and you have to completely get the

998
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:17,370
concept of it to yeah. I'm not
interested. He said about 10 years ago.

999
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:20,760
So this is like 2008 yeah,

1000
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:24,540
2008 you start doing Mike's in New York.
It's something you always wanted to do.

1001
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,240
I wanted to do it. I moved to, I was
drinking so much and I crashed in my,

1002
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,170
I had a motor scooter that I crashed in
Santa Fe. So how much were you drinking?

1003
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,850
A lot. I was like Jaeger for
breakfast. You're hardcore. Yeah,

1004
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,310
well I was like dealing with a
lot of like self hate and shit,

1005
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:41,610
so I would just sort
of like squash it down.

1006
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:45,960
So you had to start early in the
morning for that. I drank all the time.

1007
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,230
I drank all day and I had a motor
scooter and I was also a waitress and a

1008
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:49,741
bartender.

1009
01:03:49,741 --> 01:03:52,740
So it's like that sort of culture where
everyone's drinking in Santa Fe is a

1010
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:56,820
very small town of like a lot of people
are retired. And then she was like this,

1011
01:03:56,850 --> 01:04:01,530
this younger, there were like two
colleges but there were small. Um,

1012
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,870
but you know, it was just like a weird,
like, what are you going to do? You know,

1013
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,060
always nice. Yeah, it's
beautiful. It's beautiful. Um,

1014
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,770
so do you stopped drinking there
before you go to New York? I go hard.

1015
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,370
And Santa Fe and Santa Fe go hard.
And then in New York I'm going hard,

1016
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:20,610
but it's like nobody else's, like
it's, I'm just on a different,

1017
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,100
I'm on like a desert level of drunk.
Like I'm like,

1018
01:04:23,101 --> 01:04:25,850
I was like an Indian casinos with
Indians and you know what I mean?

1019
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,820
Or am drinking, um, am drinking all
day dreams. Tell me, tell me that.

1020
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,960
Like when you wake up, is it like
you'd go to your cabinet? Well,

1021
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:37,410
it depends on like it was, it
would depend. No, not cabinet.

1022
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,550
It would be like I would wake up late
and just probably go to bars. But I had,

1023
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:46,260
I remember I had a boyfriend once in
college who was so gay. It was like,

1024
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,680
I mean he's married to a
woman now. I don't share it
as a kid. I think he's like,

1025
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:53,900
I want to have to fuck her stinky
Plessy. She's already got a kid. Um, but

1026
01:04:55,410 --> 01:05:00,150
she's so grouse or tuna
anyway. But um, she, he, um,

1027
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,210
we would drink a lot to
think he was drinking. Like,

1028
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,980
cause he was like going try to like, but
it was always like, he was always like,

1029
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,010
let's have this dude, fuck us.
I'm like, all right. I'm like,

1030
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:12,330
why are you looking at him? But it's so
weird. I thought it was just get so drunk.

1031
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:14,850
Everything was like,
so like partyish or whatever.

1032
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,030
And I remember we would invite
threesomes. Is that you're saying? Yeah,

1033
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,310
well there was way we were always part.

1034
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:24,190
There was always a party where it was
never like how he was a guy into this.

1035
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,540
Never had, there was never a girl.
Straight guys aren't into that.

1036
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,010
Another dude and the party.

1037
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:33,450
I used to always an college and make my
boyfriend's make out with other boys and

1038
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:37,460
be like, to assert my dominance over
their own sexuality. Whoa. Yeah.

1039
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,840
And they would always accept and they
always broke up with me as soon as

1040
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,320
I have a deep voice and a mustache.
So I think I like attract,

1041
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:50,680
I'm like the guys like
last dude like, but he but,

1042
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,860
but that guy we used to,

1043
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,490
we called the Jack Daniels Oj. So
in the morning we'd be like, Yo,

1044
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:01,210
pass the Oj damn.
Like then you're going hard.

1045
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:05,800
You're not drinking wine or beer and
you're like, Yeager, Jack Daniels.

1046
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:10,540
I wanted to get fucking blackout.
Take a break from this bitch.

1047
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,590
Have you been in therapy or have you gone
to any kind of program or counseling?

1048
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,920
I went to therapy a couple
times and then I was like,

1049
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:20,170
they keep making me mad at my parents.
It's so annoying.

1050
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:23,500
And now I'm like in a rage and my parents
like I should probably go to therapy.

1051
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,830
Yeah. I was like, why do they keep
bringing my parents up? It's like, I,

1052
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,990
I've dealt with that. Um, but I went to,

1053
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:35,530
I did go to Aa for a year or not for your,
sorry for three months,

1054
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,310
but it seems like I'm a chip. And then
I was like, oh no bitches. I'm fine.

1055
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,070
It seems like you have a good, I mean,
listen, I follow you on Instagram.

1056
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,710
I see that you visit your family,

1057
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,850
you seem to have a good
relationship with them now.

1058
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:49,840
They did some terrible things
though. Like I'm like, wow, I'm like,

1059
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:54,070
you motherfucker, you still like them.
I love them. It's Stockholm Syndrome.

1060
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:55,380
I don't know. I love
them. I'm just like, well,

1061
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,980
I just started playing
hard to get with them.

1062
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:59,890
Like I realized I was holding a
boom box up to my mom's window,

1063
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,770
like playing on your eyes. I'm like,
why am I trying to fuck my parents?

1064
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,790
It literally feels like I'm like
strangling a puppy with them and like,

1065
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:10,390
I love you so much. Why don't you
love me back. And so I'm like,

1066
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:13,960
I'm not calling them. And I'm like talking
to them not that often. I'm like, Yo,

1067
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:16,480
you guys remember when we used to talk
every day that was literally just me

1068
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:21,420
annoying you. So whatever.
We'll see. Oh I'm,

1069
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:25,180
yeah, I'm, I'm not yeah, I love them.
I forgive them. But um, so they,

1070
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:28,930
I want them to feel a little guilt that
they don't feel that what you're saying,

1071
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:32,080
if you feel like they don't love
you, they don't show you. No,

1072
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,770
I know they lack a paralegal. You know,
they love me. I totally know they love me.

1073
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:38,350
I think that maybe,
um,

1074
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:42,010
my ability to love is a little
bit stronger than theirs and,

1075
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:46,870
but it's probably be a product
of the neglect as a child.

1076
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,630
It's just my mom like,
didn't I keep thinking about it?

1077
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:53,640
Cause I was talking to my boyfriend
about it and they didn't teach me to like

1078
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,500
read and stuff. Like they didn't, I
didn't, I just am learning about history.

1079
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:59,620
Like they sent me to a juvenile delinquent
school and I had Kinda wasn't like

1080
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,650
everyone got kicked out of their schools.
I didn't, they just like were like,

1081
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:05,770
there's an art program. Like they
just put me in a school with like,

1082
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:11,050
like young criminals, criminals.
I was like, no. And I was like,

1083
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:14,200
smoking a cigarette here and there.
I was like, I wasn't like a good kid,

1084
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:17,900
but they were literally
not paying attention to me
that that was like an Annie

1085
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:20,270
door instead of a job to get it over,
just like send me out. And they're like,

1086
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,880
she'll come back,
which it's like when I'm hungry,

1087
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:25,540
but it's like I was like a cute
little kid. Like I was kind of like a,

1088
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,740
a pretty little girl.
And so they just,

1089
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:31,430
they didn't realize like what did they
know they were sending you to a juvenile

1090
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:33,860
delinquent school? Yeah. I
don't know what they do that

1091
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,310
well.

1092
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:40,090
Are they immigrant? And by the way, are
not my mom was adopted. It's like, wow.

1093
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,720
Well why would they
send you to that school?

1094
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,130
I mean, okay. So they
didn't teach me anything.

1095
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:48,160
I was never taught manners
or how to act or anything.

1096
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:53,161
And then I'll kind of get in trouble
just like for just like existing the way

1097
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,910
you would like, I pretty much was
like the jungle book. Sure. And um,

1098
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,070
I'm like jungle, I'm just wanting
topless just in a loin cloth.

1099
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:06,140
Everyone's mad at me. Um, but they uh,
Brown skinned at that time too. Oh boy.

1100
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:11,230
But they, they sent me to, so they would
just like send me this, I don't know.

1101
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,820
I was like hanging out
with adults all the time.

1102
01:09:12,821 --> 01:09:15,400
I may just like always had like grown
up friends who wanted to hang out with

1103
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,890
like a seven year old. Do you know
how fucking weird that is? Yes.

1104
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,620
I just was getting dead left and right.
I mean they were literally just like,

1105
01:09:20,621 --> 01:09:23,710
do you want, they're like, oh, do you
think our daughter's beautiful? However,

1106
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,350
it just was like very,
my mom was mad.

1107
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:28,330
I'm a twin and she don't
only want to have two kids.

1108
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:32,680
And I think she like kind of like was
like overwhelmed and I was terrified and

1109
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:35,980
she didn't. My mom had a pituitary,
I had no idea when she was little,

1110
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:39,880
which was like a, a growth in her
arra tumor on her pituitary gland.

1111
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:42,170
So she didn't like it or period
till she was 19 or anything.

1112
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:45,940
So she has like a really
weird relationship with
femininity and she was adopted

1113
01:09:45,941 --> 01:09:48,940
so she's like pissed her birth mom. Yeah,
these are all things I'm just making up,

1114
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,420
but I think I'm ready. I think
I'm correct. Like she's never,

1115
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,790
I mean she will confirm,
I guess she's always like,

1116
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,670
you always call me out on
stuff. I'm like, well dude,

1117
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:59,020
one of my friends never call me

1118
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:00,660
as a kid was super artsy,

1119
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:04,410
just like [inaudible]
creative kid and his parents.

1120
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,820
One day we were in the same school
and then he started going to school.

1121
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:11,520
He was like, my buddy, you know? Yeah.
And so I was like, where is he in there?

1122
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:12,660
Like a sound to another school.

1123
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,460
And they arranged for me to visit him
one day in that school and I visited him

1124
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,310
and it was a,
an extra,

1125
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:23,460
like a school for extreme
developmentally disabled.

1126
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:30,270
I walked into his class and it was, what
was it called? Landmark. But I was like,

1127
01:10:30,271 --> 01:10:34,020
the fuck are you doing here? And he was
like, yeah, this is where I go to school.

1128
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:36,000
Like I'm retarded. I mean,
yeah. Can I say that?

1129
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:41,850
I can talk as I can say retargeting
and bags. I don't want to out you,

1130
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:46,170
but they said you have to say retarded
or are we delete the episode?

1131
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,110
They banned from the stuff.

1132
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,040
So yeah, it was um, it was at I,

1133
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:56,880
I mean there were kids like bouncing off
the walls. There was super violent kids,

1134
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:01,560
people, this was like my school and I was
like, why are you, and then years later,

1135
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:06,090
you know, he's a totally just
regular guy, sweet, sweet guy.

1136
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,840
And I go, what? Like what was that
all about? And they're like, yeah,

1137
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:13,590
my parents just thought my like
artistic inclinations weird.

1138
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,670
So they just sent me to this
school and it was completely,

1139
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:23,510
I'm sure traumatizing actually to him
to be there to see your surroundings.

1140
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:27,930
And they're like, this is where you
belong. You belong amongst these kids.

1141
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:31,680
Which he did not. Well, it is weird when
you, when you're put in a group like that,

1142
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:36,060
you're like, wait, is this
what you think I am? Is this,

1143
01:11:36,061 --> 01:11:39,270
what year was that? Did that really play
or was that just in my head? I'm like,

1144
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:44,420
I hear that all the time and that
exact boy every time I'm about to talk.

1145
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:49,290
Um, but no, it really is
like a weird thing because,

1146
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,630
you know,
they just wouldn't brother.

1147
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:55,170
And we were held back in kindergarten
because of my brother had learning

1148
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:59,730
disabilities. And then, um, in
second grade when I couldn't read,

1149
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,970
um, they were like, well,
my mom would always tell me,

1150
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:05,310
well then we found out about your
learning disabilities in second grade,

1151
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:06,720
which is like never
needed to tell me that.

1152
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,830
I could have just told me the
part where it was Max. But, um,

1153
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,190
so then I'm thinking back on
it. I'm looking at, I'm like,

1154
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,550
I don't think I had reading problems.
They told me I had a tracking problem.

1155
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,440
My mom likes sent me to this like whole
institute and so all this stuff where

1156
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:22,770
it's like, mom, you never
sat down and told me to read.

1157
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,650
Why are you acting like I was
supposed to just know how to read?

1158
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:29,810
Like she literally never,
I said that I got she, um,
school home to me. She's like,

1159
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,750
I thought she just sent me to school
to do all the home things and yeah,

1160
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,100
she was like, they'll do
it, but I'm like, you know,

1161
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:37,110
all the parents are like also
sitting down with their kids.

1162
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,360
It's not like they're just sending them
and like the teachers have like all

1163
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:40,194
these other students.

1164
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,440
So then I would stay after with my
regular teacher and she would give me,

1165
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:47,310
and then I learned to read really easily.
It just sounds like, you know, I mean,

1166
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:51,220
I think my mom wanted to
have a fucking nar, Nar, Nar,

1167
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:55,650
Nar, Nar. What do you mean? He was just
another word for retired, those evil.

1168
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:00,330
I also was a special ed teacher, so I
should be better about this. But now,

1169
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:00,750
you know,

1170
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,560
I'm learning about this in therapy because
I fucking hate my parents too. And um,

1171
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:07,890
it doesn't go away. When you have
your own, it actually gets amplified.

1172
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,400
What happens is when you start to
raise your own children, you go like,

1173
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:15,060
what the fuck?
Wait a minute.

1174
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:18,710
And you start to go back
into your own things and you,
you know, you have to free,

1175
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,290
I forgive, obviously I'm not like
actively angry anymore anymore,

1176
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,490
but you start to realize like they're
just incapable of seeing your needs,

1177
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,910
which is so devastating cause you're like,
why did nobody see that?

1178
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:34,530
Why didn't nobody realize that like
little Annie needed help reading or it's

1179
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:38,940
just so wild. It's like, why? It's like my
mom in front of my boyfriend, I was like,

1180
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,760
mom, I don't remember you like teaching
in or did you teach me to read?

1181
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:45,240
And she starts laughing. She's like, of
course not. Like she thinks it's so funny.

1182
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:47,910
She's a fuck up. I'm like, you
could just try to be better.

1183
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:52,850
What about your other eye? Did
they learn to read? Um, Ma, no.

1184
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:58,140
Ever. They, they gave us both. They
give us all like disabled, like things,

1185
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,780
you know? Oh God. It's just like, wow,
how did they get my number? It's just,

1186
01:14:02,781 --> 01:14:06,930
I get calls all day and it's all like
some robot bitch or horse or political,

1187
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:09,300
remember your taxes. And I'm like
trying to forget them. Stop doing that.

1188
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,910
Are you kidding me? I do this
at in the morning. Not now.

1189
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,940
Yeah, but it's infuriating
when your parents don't see
you or don't care to know

1190
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,720
just how the,
when I'm like,

1191
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:22,340
I'm telling you the exact truth and I'm
giving you even the words you could say

1192
01:14:22,341 --> 01:14:24,470
back. Right. And you
can't do it. It's like,

1193
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,950
but I think there's so many like secrets
that people grow and I think that

1194
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:28,701
generation too,

1195
01:14:28,701 --> 01:14:33,680
like we're much more like we talked
to like telling everyone all our shit,

1196
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,290
but it's like, um, you know,

1197
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:39,200
like there's so many secrets and there's
so many things that you have to tell

1198
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:42,980
yourself and lighters of about to
not like let the dominoes fall.

1199
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:46,430
So I do understand that, but
it's like, I'm just like,

1200
01:14:46,431 --> 01:14:50,360
you guys are in the evening of life.
Do you not want to like settle the beef?

1201
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:54,710
Like this is it, right? Like I'm here
being like, come on, let's do this.

1202
01:14:54,711 --> 01:14:58,880
And it's just, my dad said he would go to
therapy with me and then I was like, oh,

1203
01:14:58,881 --> 01:15:02,570
he would. Yeah, my dad would be my dad's.
My Dad's cool about it. It's just like,

1204
01:15:02,571 --> 01:15:05,570
I don't know what I realized the
things that I need from them,

1205
01:15:05,571 --> 01:15:07,730
I just need to give to
myself and there's just no,

1206
01:15:07,731 --> 01:15:11,710
and I just need to get your a narcissist,
she sounds like.

1207
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,410
Yeah, it's hard. It's really hard to
have a parent that's like, they can't,

1208
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:16,244
they don't,

1209
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,430
do you want to hear about my
last show in Philly? Yeah. Okay.

1210
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,790
So my parents do the landmark forum,
um,

1211
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,150
which I know that's amazing that they
even did that. No, they didn't do it once.

1212
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,680
They've been doing it for 12 years.
You know what I do,

1213
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,730
you know when you do a thing and it's
supposed to teach you how to like go into

1214
01:15:31,731 --> 01:15:34,500
the rest of your life and we'll
explain to people what landmark is.

1215
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,190
Self Development. Um,
it's called [inaudible].

1216
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,920
It's like, it depends on how you use it.
It's, but it's a self development thing.

1217
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,130
It's a derivative from s and
you go on to like a seminar,

1218
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:51,130
you go into a seminar and it's
so you'd pay like, I don't know,

1219
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:54,850
it's like 800 bucks or something.
Which little pricey. Um,

1220
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,460
you go into a seminar and there's
like one leader, there's no,

1221
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:01,930
all the walls are white, you know, all
the chairs are uniform. You sit there,

1222
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:06,310
it's like really, you know, they force
you to pay attention and it's all about,

1223
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,890
it's kind of like, it's
a lot of different, um,

1224
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:09,500
yeah,

1225
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,290
theories of, uh, psychology
put in one, but it's, you know,

1226
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:15,980
essentially like you're getting to the
point of like where your life is empty

1227
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:18,140
and meaningless so you can fill it in.
You're creating these stories,

1228
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:21,410
but there's all of these like specific
words they use, which I, you know,

1229
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,200
I did it when I was 19. My parents
want me to do, and I did it and it was,

1230
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:24,831
you know,

1231
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:28,070
it's that feeling that a weird feeling
you get in at the end of it where you're

1232
01:16:28,071 --> 01:16:31,270
kind of surrendering
and it feels very cold.

1233
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:34,660
It feels just very like a religion
almost. People always. Yeah.

1234
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,180
I mean,
I didn't go through it,

1235
01:16:36,181 --> 01:16:40,220
but you hear a lot of times
people describe or liking
it to some version of like

1236
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,740
Scientology. Right? So it's just very,
yeah, when I saw the Scientology thing,

1237
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:46,800
I was like, Ooh, the shades
Atlanta, it's like therapy.

1238
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:49,920
But in front of other people.
From what I understand, like you,

1239
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:54,060
you give speeches to hundreds of other
people and you share all these very

1240
01:16:54,061 --> 01:16:56,280
personal things with groups,
right? So it's not like,

1241
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:59,370
personally I never said white people
didn't take all that money and just go see

1242
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:00,204
a therapy

1243
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,100
one for a decade. Also, they
pull, they pull you. I know.
It's like a cowardly, the,

1244
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:07,500
I don't know. Like for me, I do
anything but that like, I'm like,

1245
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:10,790
I guess I believe in psychics.
Like I guess we get my Tarot cards read.

1246
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,090
There's something like, so confronting
about therapy I think for people,

1247
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:16,550
for me at least. And of course,
yeah, it's just a lie. And I'm like,

1248
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:21,050
I'm paying you this much fucking
money. But, um, all right. So, uh,

1249
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:25,160
with the thing, the problem that I had
with landmark was at the end of it,

1250
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:27,440
they then go, you should
reconnect with all these people.

1251
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:31,010
And I've had a lot of people do me dirty
and I always accepted responsibility.

1252
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:35,570
My parents included, where it
was so hard for me to, like,

1253
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:36,770
I didn't want to blame anyone else.

1254
01:17:36,771 --> 01:17:40,130
It just seemed easier to blame myself and
to just believe I was like born rotten

1255
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:42,710
and I was just like this
bad seed or whatever.

1256
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:46,850
Then to admit that literally every
fucking grown up in my life, let me down,

1257
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,200
did not do their job.

1258
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,330
And that to me was like a scarier
world and just being like,

1259
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:52,640
I'm a piece of shit living in this course.
Right?

1260
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:55,460
So then I'm in landmark and
then at the end they want,

1261
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:58,130
it's all about like reconnecting
with anyone you have

1262
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:02,210
any sort of like ill will with
or anything. And it's not,

1263
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,970
that's probably not the message of the
landmark. They probably don't say anyone.

1264
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:09,740
But to me it's like I'm nice and I
want people to like me and, and uh,

1265
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:12,800
with, you know, with my, at that stage,
especially with my parents and stuff.

1266
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,320
So it was like, I'm like looking
for this like approval all the time.

1267
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,600
So I wanted to connect with everyone.

1268
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:19,910
Now I'm at the age where I want to
disconnect with so many people. I'm like,

1269
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:23,570
get the f like, yeah Yo, if I
haven't talked to in four years,

1270
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:25,770
don't you dare ask me for free tickets.
Right.

1271
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,940
Get the fuck like I don't know you are
but whatever. Maybe not four years.

1272
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:31,850
But it's just like, you know, I was
like collecting people all the time.

1273
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:35,360
So then when landmarks sort of at the
end of the weekend when they're like

1274
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:36,200
reconnect with people,

1275
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:39,560
I'm reconnecting with people that really
fucked me over like not fucked me over

1276
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:40,630
in a little way,
but like that are not,

1277
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,150
are dangerous people for me to be around
and then I'm having to call them and

1278
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:46,880
tell them what I did wrong.
Boy, like I'm what's called,

1279
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:50,550
I had to take a teacher to, to court for
sexually assaulting me and he was like,

1280
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,390
God,
I broke this whole ring of his.

1281
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:56,990
Like it was like I was sexually assaulted
by a teacher for real and I actually

1282
01:18:56,991 --> 01:19:00,230
went to court and no one believed me.
And you don't need people to believe you.

1283
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:03,050
You need the judge to believe you anyway.
You don't need your friend.

1284
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:05,930
It's like a popularity thing to be like,
I don't fucking need that.

1285
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:10,130
Like that's like a, you
took him to court. I go to,

1286
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,940
but um, he got three years probation,
so I'm like, I couldn't put, yeah,

1287
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:17,790
he pled guilty high school or now
he's, um, I think he wasn't allowed,

1288
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:21,800
I can't remember what the thing the deal
was, but middle school, high school,

1289
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:24,110
I was in high school,
I was 15 or 16,

1290
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,550
and then I'm no help from anyone.
I mean it was like really it was,

1291
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:33,030
it was and your parents, my parents
did, but it's their fault. It happened.

1292
01:19:33,031 --> 01:19:36,110
So it's like, uh, you know,
looking back I'm like, oh,

1293
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:40,390
of course they wanted to like settle
and stuff because my parents just, um,

1294
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,720
I was just not, I was given no rules.
I was given no discipline at all.

1295
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,870
So I was always in these crazy,
dangerous situations.

1296
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:51,440
And I also wasn't taught that I
was good, you know, like, so I was,

1297
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,540
my mom is very competitive
with me and she would do that.

1298
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:56,510
She was so antifeminist
femininity because of, I believe,

1299
01:19:56,511 --> 01:20:00,890
because she didn't have her period and
shit until she was older that it was,

1300
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:04,490
you know, she, her way to like relate to
dudes was to like, Bro, you know, like,

1301
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,590
which I do too, but
it's like sh, you know,

1302
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:08,010
she was always like the only woman on the,

1303
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,760
she would play like men's racquetball
rather than, you know, I'm just like,

1304
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:16,410
she always had to be like the
only girl. So, um, so then,

1305
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,430
um, she, it just was very
like, uh, yeah. I don't,

1306
01:20:21,431 --> 01:20:26,350
I don't know, but just so they had earlier
before that happened when I was 15 or,

1307
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:29,250
I'm sorry, this is what I
was saying. My mom would, um,

1308
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,640
she never would let people say
I was pretty or anything. Like,

1309
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:35,820
it was always be like, she's
smart, but it was like, I didn't,

1310
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:39,840
I literally got the message that I wasn't
pretty, which like I'm not, I don't,

1311
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,060
I think that it's gross for girls
to run around and being like,

1312
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:44,910
I'm hot shit or whatever. But I
think there was a level of awareness.

1313
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:48,810
I was a level of attractive that that was,
it was dangerous to send me out.

1314
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:52,050
Like it was like, um, like
I was just, I was a girl,

1315
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:54,090
she was treating me like a boy in
a way, you know, I was just not,

1316
01:20:54,091 --> 01:20:57,800
the boys don't get molested all the
time, but it was like, I just, um,

1317
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,230
I just had no clue what I looked
like until like this year.

1318
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,890
So I was always like confused. I'm
like, I'm flashing my tits. Why?

1319
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:07,710
He's never mad at me. I look like a
boy. Like what? You know, like, oh,

1320
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:09,750
I don't look like a boy.
Um,

1321
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:12,540
and so there was just like this
kind of like nagging of my,

1322
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:17,490
of my looks all the time to the point
where I wasn't sure what I looked like.

1323
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:20,280
Right, right. Cause I can
be, it's bad on the others.

1324
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:23,680
I can understand why she
probably overcorrected because
on the one hand to tell

1325
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:26,140
the little girl she didn't want
to be lying. Yeah. All the time.

1326
01:21:26,141 --> 01:21:30,160
Then you turn them into a dumb role with
no identity. Right. But to go the, Oh,

1327
01:21:30,161 --> 01:21:33,670
the overcorrection is to not acknowledge
that you are an attractive little girl

1328
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:38,410
and that people might want to prey upon
you. It was just like very, you know,

1329
01:21:38,411 --> 01:21:41,950
we were brought up Quaker, my mom, which
we weren't what we were brought up.

1330
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:46,060
Quaker just not our mentioned now. And
that's how many layers are there. Jesus.

1331
01:21:46,061 --> 01:21:50,940
A lot of layers. When does the
book come out? This fucking crazy.

1332
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,230
Wait, what happened last time
you were a, did a show in Philly,

1333
01:21:53,231 --> 01:21:54,680
you were going to say? Oh yeah. Okay. So

1334
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:59,250
I'm in Philly and, um, my mom, uh,

1335
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,241
she was landmark.

1336
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:04,580
So all of her landmark for shooting bites
all over laminates and all today it's

1337
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:09,540
at, um, punchline. So she
invites all of her, you know,

1338
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,630
which it's like, all right,
that's cute that you're, you know,

1339
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:16,800
cause I'm looking at it like she's proud
of me or whatever, but that's how it is.

1340
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:22,080
Okay. That's not what it is. You're
an extension of her. Right. I'm, I'm,

1341
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:25,980
uh, I'm someone who's getting
a platform that she can take.

1342
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,360
I don't even wouldn't even say
an extension of her. Um, I,

1343
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,740
I wouldn't even say I would
love to be cleaned like that.

1344
01:22:31,741 --> 01:22:35,790
I wouldn't want you to be like,
that sounds so awesome. So she, um,

1345
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:38,640
all of our friends come and,
um,

1346
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:44,540
and it's Christmas and my mom owns an
Ebay dropoff storm and I might eat my

1347
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:50,640
mom's Ebay drop of sore.
She gets a bunch of weird shit and so,

1348
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:54,390
and she thinks it's funny to give us these
gifts and none of us think it's funny.

1349
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,240
It's always annoying. It's always like
some, it's smells like someone's basement.

1350
01:22:57,241 --> 01:22:59,880
It's like, oh, can you get this away from
the children? Like my nieces and nephews,

1351
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:02,940
just like, everyone's like, please stop
bringing this trash into our house. But,

1352
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:06,390
so that's like her big bet is that
she brings us like weird shit from,

1353
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:10,960
so I'm onstage, I'm just starting, I'm,

1354
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:13,600
I get really nervous in Philly because
I had all this stuff happened in high

1355
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:16,090
school, so I, I really get nervous.
People are going to, I don't,

1356
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:19,000
I don't like anyone from like my friends.
Like I'm like,

1357
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,250
I don't want anyone from my
high school to show I'm scared.

1358
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:24,010
I have a lot of predators
there. So I'm like, um,

1359
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,780
I got real nervous and may feel
he shows and um, I was trying to,

1360
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:31,060
like I was working on, I wanted
to get a tapes. He had a special,

1361
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:34,930
and I was like telling my mom that
day I was like, I really need to,

1362
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,230
I'm just nervous because I
really want to make sure I,

1363
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,390
I have a good order for my jokes and I
just want to make sure I stay on track.

1364
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:44,530
I have so much anxiety. Okay. So the week,

1365
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,930
I'll tell you about the year before
when I did Thanksgiving there.

1366
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:51,970
All right after this. So she, so for
some dumb reason I forgot my mom's,

1367
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:56,120
my mom and I think me telling her this
will let her know to really not interrupt

1368
01:23:56,121 --> 01:24:00,100
and not be difficult.
She drives me into the,

1369
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:04,150
I go with her and to the, to the club.
Okay. So I'm with her the whole time.

1370
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,810
So I don't see her bringing anything in
or anything because I'm just not paying

1371
01:24:07,811 --> 01:24:11,500
attention. I'm just like a
little bit nervous trying
to stay on track, get there.

1372
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,480
She's trying to it. I'm like,
I don't want to be your friend.

1373
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:16,840
Like I don't have time for this. I
have to like, you know, kept pumped.

1374
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,170
So I get on stage and I'm,
I'm, I'm a little nervous.

1375
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,900
I have a like a rougher
start than usual and uh,

1376
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,880
and maybe five minutes in when I'm just
getting my, starting to get my bearings,

1377
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:31,930
she throws a present onstage.

1378
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,980
Okay.
She snuck a fucking president.

1379
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:40,420
She snuck a fucking present in through
it and threw it onto the stage. She goes,

1380
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:43,750
Hey, I got you a present and throws like
while I'm in the middle of the joke.

1381
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,630
So then, okay, so her friends are
there, but they're not, it's, it's like,

1382
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:50,470
I don't think I was sold out,

1383
01:24:50,471 --> 01:24:52,870
but I was like a few seats
shy being sold out this month.

1384
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,190
I don't know how those
motherfuckers do that.

1385
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,310
We're all of a sudden I'm not getting a
bonus. I'm like, oh, that was, I'm like,

1386
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:58,870
how did,
how did my people just not,

1387
01:24:58,871 --> 01:25:01,780
there couldn't have been like five more
people. But anyway, it was very close.

1388
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:05,290
It was like two 55 yet to 51.
It was just like,

1389
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:06,940
but it was like they were
telling the truth. I'm like,

1390
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,730
it was like when they see it, I
was like, oh, I'm so almost a draw.

1391
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:11,260
But then so okay,
so then,

1392
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:14,920
but so she makes up like there's
maybe like 12 of her friends,

1393
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:19,270
so she's not making up that much of the
audience, but it's enough where I'm like,

1394
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:24,580
Ma, you know, like, so she, so she throws
the present on stage and now I'm like,

1395
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:30,550
I gotta I just barely gotten the
audience on my side. So now I'm,

1396
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:36,130
um, I have to take a present,
open it, like in retrospect,

1397
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,920
I should've thrown at her.
He's like totally took,

1398
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:42,880
taken her down as if she was a regular
person and not my mom embarrassed her in

1399
01:25:42,881 --> 01:25:47,290
front of her friends and possibly had her
kicked out, but I was still being like,

1400
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,880
I don't wanna hurt my mom's feelings.
Right.

1401
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,250
I don't wanna embarrass her in front
of her friends. So I'm trying to like,

1402
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,740
make it work in both ways.
So now I have to,

1403
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:58,420
I have to get away from the
microphone to open this present.

1404
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:00,970
My hands aren't on the mic.
My hands are now doing another thing.

1405
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,380
I have to look down at a thing.

1406
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:05,150
I have no control over the
audience at this point. Right now.

1407
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,580
People are looking at her.
I have to now,

1408
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:11,960
now and then what it is is it's a
fucking like an arm, not like a,

1409
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,540
not like a sexist but like uh,

1410
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:19,990
like an arm that nurses would use to
try like their ivs on or whatever.

1411
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:24,210
So she throws his arms like,

1412
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,980
so now I have to explain
who my fucking mom is,

1413
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:31,840
what her job is, why should we give
me this present all this stuff.

1414
01:26:31,841 --> 01:26:32,601
And it was just like,

1415
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:37,601
so I was so mad and I had a really bad
set cause I was so like of course and

1416
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:41,020
like it was like I got like bad
review. Like I never got bad. Like,

1417
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,760
I mean we all get bad reviews here and
there, but like I never get in Philly.

1418
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:47,670
I usually get like really good reviews
and it was like, I got like bad,

1419
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,660
like I got like people were writing
about it like she saw like all this,

1420
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:55,010
I'm like, mom, you fucking bitch. Like
yeah, that's my money. Like that's my job.

1421
01:26:55,011 --> 01:26:59,420
Like, and I remember like talking and
she was like, what? I'm just like,

1422
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:02,780
well how did you go? Sorry, can't you just
like get over it? Like I didn't mean to.

1423
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:05,870
And it's like, let's play this out.
Let's say that had killed what?

1424
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,720
Where would the audience be looking
at you bitch, not at me like that.

1425
01:27:09,721 --> 01:27:14,270
It wouldn't like you just completely took,
so then you didn't like the gift. Yeah,

1426
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:17,720
she was like, come on, I got you
an arm thing. Maybe I did lie.

1427
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:19,560
I do actually have

1428
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,940
of Jada Pinkett Smith about this.

1429
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:27,450
I've been sitting here and just thinking
about forgiveness and it's been a deep

1430
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:32,451
journey for me because I've had to look
into the shadows of my own heart and

1431
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:37,700
understand how I've heard other people
and forgive myself for any wrong

1432
01:27:39,841 --> 01:27:42,770
accident. My, for what you're
doing to me now you're, yes,

1433
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:47,010
you're not my people.
I had to clear myself with my own shame,

1434
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:51,000
my own guilt, and have compassion
for myself and forgiveness.

1435
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,690
What is selfish apology,
right?

1436
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,230
Why does everyone think everyone gives
a fucking shit? It's so unbelievable.

1437
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,840
What is this new thing where
it's like everyone's like,

1438
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,490
vulnerability is strength.
And now my, like, I'm bipolar
in her like, Yo, I wouldn't,

1439
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:08,400
maybe not like,
well,

1440
01:28:08,401 --> 01:28:11,610
and there's a time and a forum where you
could all say your shit, but it's like,

1441
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:12,031
I'm just saying,

1442
01:28:12,031 --> 01:28:16,140
everyone's like not on social media
is my thing where it's like the, the,

1443
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:19,050
like the where it's like we're at
this place where it's now like,

1444
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:22,380
like naked chicks showing their cellulite
and they're like, look, I'm Bree,

1445
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,770
or brave or whatever. I'm like, getting
attention for your body is not bravery.

1446
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:26,640
Like that's not,
they were like,

1447
01:28:26,641 --> 01:28:29,630
now I can also do this thing that
was also kind of gross appropriate.

1448
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:35,250
My favorite are chicks that were, or
their ugly mud masks. They're like,

1449
01:28:35,251 --> 01:28:38,760
look how ugly I am right now.
It's just,

1450
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:44,320
yeah, it's silly. Uh, but by the way, we
have to watch red table talk on Facebook.

1451
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,250
Oh my God.

1452
01:28:45,251 --> 01:28:50,050
I've never been more excited for anything
as if the gift that Jadah provides

1453
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:54,690
isn't big enough. She is coming
out with a new show with will. Yes.

1454
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,200
We're going to explain everything.

1455
01:28:56,230 --> 01:29:00,380
Yes. On Facebook. People crying and
breaking down. Do not bring me today.

1456
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,220
I've broken you enough.

1457
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:07,120
All right, so hold on, let's clear
something swinger. Just historical room.

1458
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:14,060
Jadah Jayda deep down inside
I was insecure little boy.

1459
01:29:16,381 --> 01:29:20,640
That one jaded is say I was great.
You know why I never got divorced?

1460
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,660
It's cheaper to keep me,

1461
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,290
it's so interesting to me that they're
willing to put like they are doing the

1462
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:33,140
social thing. They're movie stars.
You know? It's like, but what is,

1463
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:36,770
what is driving the necessity like that
guys says he wants to do any movie.

1464
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:40,010
It's just like greenlight. We'll make
it any anytime. What do you think it is?

1465
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:44,300
She wants to humiliate him.
You think so this whole thing,

1466
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:48,470
am I broken you enough? No, no, no.
She wants to. Why would he agree to it?

1467
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:51,890
To distill the gay rumors. Yeah,
they're going to just still those,

1468
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:53,960
they're going to just steal
the open marriage rumors.

1469
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:58,190
They're going to discipline. She also,
part of her wants the acknowledgment,

1470
01:29:58,191 --> 01:30:02,720
the recognition for being jade
Pinkett kid into it though.

1471
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:06,770
It's like they bring the kids in
that willow, she's good on it.

1472
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:10,280
Cause I had been watching red table talk
on Facebook and she's probably the most,

1473
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:14,310
my most favorite part of it all because
her face is funny. And she's like, Damn.

1474
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:18,340
Like she makes these cute
little faces. She's a gift.
She's very, she's very, yeah,

1475
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,810
she's a total again,
but she's very likable.

1476
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:25,010
The kids or the kids sweet now Jadah you,
she gets very vulnerable.

1477
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:29,450
She talks about why she's been wearing
her head wraps lately. I'm fascinated.

1478
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:33,800
I was hair loss. She's had
hair loss. That's fun. Yeah.

1479
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:36,640
And then she talks about sex with her
grandma and her daughter and went up to

1480
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:43,850
the that vulnerability. I do
appreciate it. Amaze. It's on.

1481
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:46,040
It's on Facebook watch and
we have to start watching it.

1482
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,890
Talking about sponsored by them.
Um,

1483
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:52,610
do you guys know that it's a
full time job to be a good dad?

1484
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,660
He got so much more stuff than I had.
It's the lyrics to

1485
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,350
that song. I was like, it's a
full time job to be a good dad.

1486
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:08,990
That's right.
I forgot that horse more of an option.

1487
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:12,800
I be like part time two of us.
Right?

1488
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:19,390
I think you were cheaper when I met
you when I started most definitely in

1489
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,500
personality or moneywise.
Um,

1490
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:26,890
now are you a frugal person
or how do you approach no,

1491
01:31:26,891 --> 01:31:30,200
I just make money and then I spend it
all and then I'm broke and then I freak

1492
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:33,440
out. And that's your pattern. Well,

1493
01:31:33,441 --> 01:31:38,180
these are people who are
the extreme of cheap.

1494
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:43,210
I think they'll, you'll appreciate
them if this is what I think it is.

1495
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:47,050
It is about them. And I was
like, that's so crazy that sheep.

1496
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:50,820
I was like, well smiths afraid
he's going to run out. No Way.

1497
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:56,560
Is this a TLC show? Yes. I already know.
You already know. I fucking love this. Um,

1498
01:31:56,990 --> 01:32:01,720
but go ahead. Just some of it's
just going to fuck this shit.

1499
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,650
I live for this. So this is my bathtub.
Look at it's brand new and shiny.

1500
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:09,400
I don't even have to clean it. There's no
mildew. All my crowd, which is amazing.

1501
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:13,510
I has never cleaned it
because I've never used it.

1502
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,750
I have a gym membership and
that's where I take my shower.

1503
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,890
I like to work out and kind of a gym rat.
I'm there every day anyway.

1504
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:24,010
Well first of all, it's not. I mean,
what do those traps? She's like,

1505
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:29,140
this is on the rat. My urine.
In an effort to save money,

1506
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:34,330
I started peeing in a jar.
Just uh, maybe to save energy.

1507
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:39,220
I like to be in your bed, but don't go
into the bathroom. Wait, why did she say,

1508
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:43,960
she's reminding me she's going to save
on the water bill water bill. Yeah,

1509
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:47,890
just what she does. We're going to get to
that. Somebody's got to planet fitness.

1510
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:52,900
A $10 a month. Here you go. Big
Time, money savings, quite pungent.

1511
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:56,680
And the longer it sits,
the stronger it an apple juice.

1512
01:32:56,681 --> 01:33:00,970
One line that you can put your
urine into your compost pile.

1513
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,710
And I thought, Wow, I can pee
in a jar. Build my compost.

1514
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:09,130
Oh God, no. He used to shoot
from Philly, right. That acts,

1515
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:13,900
haste and that one when it's on
one over easy exit over there.

1516
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:19,090
It's a gross accident.
How much can you save pissing into,

1517
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:23,830
we're about to find out why would
you do $30 a month to $20 a month?

1518
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:28,480
So there's $10 right there. So I pee
in a bottle, but don't get me wrong, I,

1519
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:31,450
you know, I pooped like everybody
else and I put that in the toilet.

1520
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:35,850
What did in the toilet flush,
there's a middle man. The process,

1521
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:41,140
I put the with the toilet,
I poop over here and then I put it in the,

1522
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:43,030
and she sells over handmade jewelry,

1523
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:49,240
but she also has some Nice Ted's.
It's like, come on girl, get a Webcam.

1524
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,730
She has a, she says she flushed
twice a day with the browns. Yeah.

1525
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:56,350
So she's got healthy movements.

1526
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:01,470
So she saved $10 a month doing
way bigger psycho like that.

1527
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:05,140
This lady, this lady makes that.
Is this how you guys stay in love?

1528
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:08,580
You just look at people that are
way worse than you? Of course. Yes.

1529
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:11,710
I don't do laundry.
You have to pay quite a bit in quarters,

1530
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:14,920
so whenever I have dirty clothes,
I tried to watch them while I'm showering.

1531
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,230
I'm using a free sample of detergent.

1532
01:34:17,231 --> 01:34:20,710
I got detergent and reach my clothes,

1533
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:26,620
put them in the shower.
I love this. I love it.

1534
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:28,480
I get it.
Whenever did this in college,

1535
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:34,450
make it on camera again.

1536
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:38,610
If you're willing to get naked on camera,
you can make some money. Exactly. She's,

1537
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:41,980
she's halfway there.
She says the last time that I did laundry,

1538
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,060
it was three years ago,
three years ago,

1539
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,920
and they start ringing out in
these clothes. It gets better.

1540
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:51,910
She's a yes.

1541
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:56,800
Just want to do all that expensive
laundry and don't use the dryer.

1542
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,040
I only does it ride

1543
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,090
around waste money,

1544
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:02,390
but it's a shrink's clothes and
their wears clothes out faster. Yeah.

1545
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,250
You can keep your clothes looking new
order for longer if you don't dry them.

1546
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:07,540
No,
the Jewish Asians,

1547
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:12,550
well, normally I wouldn't want to maybe
a load of laundry every other week.

1548
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:17,680
It's cost like $3 to wash and dry clothes.
Say maybe $6 a month.

1549
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,790
$6 she's not destitute. I mean,
look at her bathroom. It's nice.

1550
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,380
I mean that's six bucks in your pocket.
That's actually her whole apartment.

1551
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:29,500
You didn't know that she lived in
the bathroom. This is like an Indian.

1552
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:32,130
She pays us $50 a month
to live in that battle.

1553
01:35:32,131 --> 01:35:36,280
Now I will admit that in college I may
have hand washed underwear a few times.

1554
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,900
Yeah, that's not that crazy. Come
on. You guys wash your underwear.

1555
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:45,680
You guys were underwear. How old
are you? He doesn't wear underwear.

1556
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:46,540
It freaks me out.

1557
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:51,320
How do you have your deck rubbing against
denim jeans and so it doesn't burn.

1558
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:55,210
I know. Told us. He's just
like, he's got stuff to do, man.

1559
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:58,120
He's doesn't that time to put
fucking underwear all the time.

1560
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:02,020
How's he gotten rid of that
eyelash? I can't. No, it's so,

1561
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:06,070
it's truly upsetting. I know. It's like,
it may as well be like an ass hair.

1562
01:36:06,071 --> 01:36:09,870
Like there's just, it's like so decided
for a decade now since we've wait,

1563
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,780
you mean it's never,

1564
01:36:10,781 --> 01:36:13,210
he's never gotten rid of it now
he's had it since we've known her.

1565
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:15,860
And imagine how many times that
comes into your just I, yeah.

1566
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:20,010
How does he get out when you, when you
see one kind of like an eyebrow here.

1567
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:23,590
Oh Shit. Took a point. I don't
know how many deals with that

1568
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,910
toilet paper. I just use water
and soap to clean myself off.

1569
01:36:27,911 --> 01:36:28,960
After going to the bathroom,

1570
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:32,980
I'd take his water bottle that I have
and like rinse myself off if I just

1571
01:36:32,981 --> 01:36:34,630
urinated, it's, I'm done with that.

1572
01:36:34,631 --> 01:36:38,680
And then I dry myself off with one of
the paper towels I have if I took a dump.

1573
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:42,990
And then I also ran a salt
wipe myself down with soap.

1574
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:45,500
Do you see how little that soapland chalk

1575
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,080
and rinse off the soap fights?

1576
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:50,450
I don't believe in spending money on
something that you're just going to throw

1577
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:52,570
away such as toilet paper or paper towel.

1578
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:57,810
Yeah, I think the day bitch cause
I do. Yeah. She's a little proud.

1579
01:36:58,010 --> 01:37:01,130
A little proud of it. This is
mental illness. Proud of this.

1580
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:04,070
You think she has a boyfriend?
No. Or do you think she's proud?

1581
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:08,270
Do you think she's like, do
you think she's like, like,

1582
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,380
look how, look how awesome I've,
I've figured this out. Yes.

1583
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:16,010
She's telling you I've got a system here
it is. If I took a dumb yes, the best,

1584
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:19,490
breaking it down, I just felt
like she wouldn't say dumb. Yeah.

1585
01:37:19,491 --> 01:37:23,820
I don't think that that like pretty clean.
Her bow pose.

1586
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,490
A pretty clean clean for sure. She's a
soap on on her. After you had the baby,

1587
01:37:28,491 --> 01:37:31,760
they tell you to squirt your vagina in
the same way it did look like a baby

1588
01:37:31,761 --> 01:37:33,210
thing. Yeah. If you're done yet,

1589
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,770
there's a square bottle and you have to
wrench or virgin off that way we just,

1590
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:39,970
Tom not know about that. Did you know
that? Did I hit the squirt bottle?

1591
01:37:39,971 --> 01:37:42,350
Are you able to stay separate from
the stuff? No, I knew about that.

1592
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:45,890
He's sought a square bottle side by
the potatoes or the little Filipino.

1593
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,540
Listen if I was a kid,

1594
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:50,390
I'm going to make my dude fucking
know everything and be like,

1595
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:51,880
you have to watch it fucking heat.

1596
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:55,070
I have to stand next to me cause
I use that to like know how much.

1597
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,570
Like you have to listen to me complain
while I'm doing it. Yeah, he did.

1598
01:37:57,571 --> 01:38:01,400
Don't worry is how I would even saw
it come out. Both babies. Right.

1599
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:04,560
You catch it and my badge blast, but
I was right there. I was right there.

1600
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:06,870
I mean I could've caught it.
Yeah,

1601
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:11,760
I could have caught it and I did the
little umbilical cut and so sweet. Yeah,

1602
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:14,710
it's fun. You want to see the
video? Yeah. Yeah. I can't
wait. Is it on Youtube? Yeah.

1603
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,030
All you do is you tag your kids. There's
all these like birth videos on youtube.

1604
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:20,110
I'm like,
why don't you,

1605
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:23,070
those kids are going to like
the youtube generation batch.

1606
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:26,460
Like they're going to fuck him. Yeah.
Find them. I want to see your mom's purse.

1607
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,170
You want to see your own head
coming out of Pittsburgh? Yes.

1608
01:38:29,171 --> 01:38:33,290
So it's too intimate to share. That's
crazy. It's a wild thing to share.

1609
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,750
I don't like the oversharing and I don't
like so proud of it. It's like, yeah,

1610
01:38:36,751 --> 01:38:41,670
but it's like it's a unique experience
to yourself. Right? Like in your family,

1611
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:46,320
you and your husband. I don't like the
sharing of a, everything the kid does too.

1612
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:50,850
Once it's, you know, it's weird. It's
just not, the kid can't consent to that.

1613
01:38:50,851 --> 01:38:53,840
Especially if you have like any
type of fan base. It's funny. Yeah.

1614
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:58,400
You don't want them talking to
you too much about your know. Um,

1615
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:02,340
you have a boyfriend,
but in case you ever are single again,

1616
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,570
Kinda always have them. Here's
some good advice. Somebody. Yeah.

1617
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:09,520
Hey everybody and welcome to today's
episode of the wanderlust thinker,

1618
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:13,360
part one and dating for
Gen x and those over 40.

1619
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,500
So as it generation mail,
where do we go to meet single women?

1620
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:19,990
That is a big,
big question.

1621
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:24,060
It's, it's, I always think it's
interesting that he's at a playground

1622
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,160
and right. And when you're a
self appointed authority on this,

1623
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:32,980
who is not hitting it out of the park.
Yeah. I mean like when you're not,

1624
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:37,330
it's like, it's like are you asking you a
question? Are you telling him? Yeah. Yeah.

1625
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:40,050
Facial hair. A town. Yeah. Slim pickings.

1626
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:43,090
Pretty much the interesting you
brought up slim most everybody goes

1627
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:48,080
well, very good. I'll do one set up
and then maybe we can talk about it.

1628
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:50,400
He's got a good point and I'll
tell you what Annie, you're right.

1629
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
The fatness is only accentuated by
this cut his prison pussy and it also,

1630
01:39:57,751 --> 01:40:01,310
it does kind of look like
as an extended asshole.

1631
01:40:01,311 --> 01:40:04,770
So what is it like a gaping
asshole? Yeah. Yeah. Not a good look

1632
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:10,830
are crazy beat up women or women that
are addicted to pills or ranking or other

1633
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:16,400
were just to have some
men issues all together.

1634
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:21,960
Maybe he's scarred a little bit from
some past experiences because there was a

1635
01:40:21,961 --> 01:40:25,790
lot of restrained emotion behind
it. Yeah. And it's always the, well,

1636
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:30,850
let's say the portly or unsightly men
that tend to have really high standards

1637
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:33,780
for the, excuse me, excuse me,

1638
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,300
don't regurgitate people from high school.

1639
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,450
There's a reason they're in your passion.
Remember you're a generation x, are you?

1640
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:45,270
But at a high school longer than you
were in high school and it's been a long,

1641
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:46,080
long time.

1642
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,770
Most of us graduated in the eighties and
nineties most of them go back and try

1643
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:53,220
to grab that girl that you had
a crush on me. Do not. I repeat,

1644
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:56,740
not do online dating.
I don't care how many friends you have.

1645
01:40:56,741 --> 01:40:57,500
Where are we supposed to go?

1646
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:00,850
Know somebody that knows somebody
that met their wife on online dating.

1647
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,940
It is a waste of,
trust me on this guys,

1648
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:06,640
if you ever want to feel like
a leper in your basement,

1649
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:11,200
spend some time on online dating and
also if you're from a small town like me,

1650
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,500
nobody picks up a woman that
you're interested in a local bar.

1651
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:17,820
There's probably 20 other guys are
all trying to get with her secretly.

1652
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,420
I remember we tried to shark your shit.

1653
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:25,010
Okay. This guy's a real expert, Huh?
I mean, so far he's also not, he's a,

1654
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:28,670
he's like that critic that tells you
everything that's wrong. Yeah. You know,

1655
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:31,490
here's everything that's bad
about everything, but no solution.

1656
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,040
They took all of the options
out. Yeah. Some will. How,

1657
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:36,710
how's it going to go back to high school?
Get out of this small town.

1658
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:41,480
Don't go online. Don't go here. I guess
the park is the leading option right now.

1659
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:46,230
Come to this park. You got to meet a
nice young man on fortnight. I mean, uh,

1660
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,630
I work out four or five times
a week. Oh, okay. And I'm,

1661
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:53,780
I'm not the best work out of my
basement. You know, make an effort,

1662
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:56,620
make it better for his looks are fleeting.

1663
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,180
Now that doesn't mean go out
with like a 400 pound woman.

1664
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:00,871
Yeah.

1665
01:42:00,871 --> 01:42:05,340
You can't be the one that
mentioned the way a honey bold.

1666
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:11,720
It's the expectations,
right? You guys got it.

1667
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:15,120
You can not put demands on
bitches like this. Also don't,

1668
01:42:15,121 --> 01:42:19,530
the high school thing makes no sense
because you can easily reconnect with

1669
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:22,440
someone. Like don't maybe think it's
going to be the same person. Yeah,

1670
01:42:22,441 --> 01:42:25,340
no question. I know he's watching this
guy has been, he's been burned with fire.

1671
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:26,100
He's very,

1672
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,370
I feel like Emirates and I mean never
stand for being in the friend zone.

1673
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,940
The girl says to you, I look at you as
a brother, or I look at you as a friend.

1674
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:37,260
I look, he goes, my fat brother
don't stand for arrogant women.

1675
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:39,000
If she's stuck up,
she isn't worth it.

1676
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:42,720
A lot of women get big heads because they
get a lot of guys flirt with them and

1677
01:42:42,721 --> 01:42:47,010
I'll tell you what, they're not worth your
time. They're not that great. Remember,

1678
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,230
they got to bring something
to the table. Okay? Remember,

1679
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,780
you're the highly caloric to find somebody
that you want to spend your life with.

1680
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,710
What's going on?
I know is I areas not good here.

1681
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,610
Oh, this is sad. This poor guy.

1682
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:05,660
You don't need the drama.
You don't need to build anybody.

1683
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,640
I mean, his advice is
depressing. It's just,

1684
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,010
it's really sad and it's all knows.
It's like,

1685
01:43:12,011 --> 01:43:15,370
here's a million things you shouldn't
do. Goodbye. Also, here's the thing,

1686
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:20,320
I've dated some pretty big guys. Yeah,
I don't have any problem with that,

1687
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:25,570
but you can't be like no fat,
no fat checks. What the fuck?

1688
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:29,050
The fattest guy I know has a
no fat check policy. Seriously.

1689
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,940
I mean like he's dead broke at
a divorce. It's really, I mean,

1690
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,100
like I know a guy who
seriously like three 50,

1691
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:41,600
he's very unsightly and, and it's
fine. Right. But then he, his law,

1692
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:45,730
his list of demands for
women is kind of like this.

1693
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:50,410
They just have to buy a bitch from
overseas. That's what that exist for.

1694
01:43:50,411 --> 01:43:52,070
Like the brides and

1695
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:56,590
the Asian ladies, right? Yeah,
the commands of the world.
Yeah. This is a Fucking,

1696
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,690
I got to pee. You guys
work it out. Oh Geez. Yeah.

1697
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:04,190
Your apple get your apple juice
bottle. Oh my God. Anyway, so,

1698
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:08,690
uh, I don't, I ask you, how old
are you? You're on 30. 40. Wow.

1699
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:09,470
He looks so young.

1700
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,820
So you grew up in the dating
era of like Tinder and shit?

1701
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:18,700
No, I never, I, I really like
my job. I don't, I don't like,

1702
01:44:18,701 --> 01:44:22,060
so I never really was like trying to,
um,

1703
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,460
like have boyfriends that
much. I was just like, oh,

1704
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:26,320
they're going to like keep
me from my job or whatever.

1705
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:30,430
So I never was like actively trying to
date. It would just like happened to me.

1706
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:34,390
Like, I honestly feel like
they all tricked me and Oh
man, apology. Except now,

1707
01:44:34,391 --> 01:44:35,224
now I'm happy.
But

1708
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:39,360
all right, so you've been with the
same dude for how long now? A year. Oh,

1709
01:44:39,361 --> 01:44:42,300
that's super new. Yeah. But we
were friends for like seven years.

1710
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,850
That's the way to go.
I think that's the way to go.

1711
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:48,980
Yeah. He's my best friend. It's so fun.
It's like great. That's awesome. I never,

1712
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:50,930
I always thought you like,
they came separately,

1713
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:54,860
like love and intimacy and
then friendship, you know?
I was like, oh you fuck.

1714
01:44:54,861 --> 01:44:55,694
And then,
yeah,

1715
01:44:56,180 --> 01:45:00,020
so I would be like hanging out with him
and then we'd be having like the best

1716
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:03,140
time ever. Just like literally
like writing jokes, laughing,

1717
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:06,350
just like till our stomachs
hurt. And then I'd be like, oh,

1718
01:45:06,351 --> 01:45:10,750
I gotta go back in this guy that parked
my car the other day who I really like

1719
01:45:10,751 --> 01:45:14,090
looking at this man, this fucking guy,
you know? I go like Fox, I'm like roller.

1720
01:45:14,091 --> 01:45:15,200
I'm like this guy.
Rollerblades

1721
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:18,300
so how did it,
so then did he like bring that up to you?

1722
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,370
Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. He was like,

1723
01:45:21,371 --> 01:45:23,500
you've kind of already been my
girlfriend for a while and it was like,

1724
01:45:23,770 --> 01:45:26,050
he like Jedi mind trick males
like I guess, but I was like,

1725
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:29,140
I was not thrilled about
it. At first. I was like,

1726
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:33,220
how dare he had promised he
would never. Thank you. Um,

1727
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:38,050
women helping women. He, um,

1728
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:42,490
yeah, he had promised to a number hit on
me, so awesome. Cool. Then when he did,

1729
01:45:42,491 --> 01:45:43,480
I was pissed.
But yes.

1730
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:45,930
Is he your first serious boyfriend
or how have you done boy,

1731
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:49,710
um, I mean I'd had long term
boyfriends, but they weren't serious.

1732
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:54,060
I was always like, this is terrible.
How do I get out of this? I dated a guy,

1733
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:58,470
I dated a guy for three years
who I just, I mean, it was,

1734
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:00,500
it was rough

1735
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,910
for three years,
like on and off.

1736
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:07,090
No, lived with him. Oh, I
was homeless when I met him.
I was living in my car and,

1737
01:46:07,091 --> 01:46:10,960
uh, this was the rollerblader and
then, um, he's like a nice guy.

1738
01:46:10,961 --> 01:46:14,980
He's a nice guy from jersey, like
reminded me of home who's younger than me.

1739
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:19,950
Um, and he was like, you know, he wasn't
gonna make me like stay in my car. I mean,

1740
01:46:19,951 --> 01:46:21,530
I wasn't living in my car car,
but I'm,

1741
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:24,130
and I was like sort of sleep like I
would crash and I'd never hear here and

1742
01:46:24,131 --> 01:46:27,970
there. And so, uh, he was like,
stay with me. And then I was like,

1743
01:46:27,971 --> 01:46:30,790
already I was into him in the beginning
and then so I was like living with him,

1744
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:33,400
but then it was just like three years
went by and I was like, I'm going to die.

1745
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:35,410
Jesus.
I'm going to fucking die.

1746
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,200
Wait, so you never got to do online
dating and stuff. I went on to, Ooh,

1747
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,330
I want on, oh, this idea of a good story.
I want them to, I went on to things,

1748
01:46:43,331 --> 01:46:45,430
but I thought it was just
too bad. Like I was like, oh,

1749
01:46:45,431 --> 01:46:50,100
I went through a breakup or something.
I want to like fuck someone once or so

1750
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:54,690
I went on, I did Riaa Joe
Riaz. It's like the celebrity,

1751
01:46:55,230 --> 01:47:00,000
the celebrity one, they
exclusive like, sounds cool.
It's worse. It's like, oh, hey,

1752
01:47:00,001 --> 01:47:03,660
do you want to go on a date that, um,
we'll also potentially hurt your career?

1753
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:06,480
Well, awesome. Well, it's
just like we, it's like,

1754
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:10,610
just want to go on a date with a
producer, like only somebody in, yeah.

1755
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:16,620
So it's like, it's just, it's Ryan,

1756
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:20,220
my friend Karen Says Ryan stands
for rich asshole young asshole.

1757
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:24,300
But it's like very, it's like exclusive
and it's just like, it's a weird,

1758
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:27,990
I don't know, to me it's, it's just weird.
It's like you're like, Hey, Matthew Perry,

1759
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,440
uh, or whatever. Do you know what I mean?
It's like you're just like, it's like a,

1760
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:34,580
we, it's like weird,
you know, like, oh, um,

1761
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:39,000
but I never like cared about that shit.
I never was like, I want to date a celeb.

1762
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,090
Like I never super weird.
I know you're married to one,

1763
01:47:42,091 --> 01:47:46,620
but you guys are selecting. No, I was
thinking cause uh, cause uh, Steve Simone,

1764
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:48,390
then there was like, we need a
celebrity. It was like being,

1765
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:52,500
so Steve just came at you with such, like,
we've known him a long time, right? Yeah,

1766
01:47:52,501 --> 01:47:54,930
of course. So it's like he's had to
transition the way he talks, like,

1767
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:56,910
do you know what I mean?
Not that he hasn't always been that way,

1768
01:47:56,911 --> 01:48:01,230
but like now he's like, he's
like, um, you're, and it's
like it was cause you are,

1769
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:03,600
but it was, it was just like the
way he said it was like very,

1770
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:09,180
it was just very cute. He's
so sweet. He's opening for me.

1771
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:13,320
November 24th in man, Diego,
California. At the House of Blues.

1772
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:17,520
We plan with the school thing. We planned
this whole blog. Yeah. That was seamless.

1773
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,800
I know, right? He's so funny. Can I
tell you what I love about Steve Smith?

1774
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:24,210
A positive energy. The guy always, he's,

1775
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:27,300
he's not talking like dark shit
like we do. Like he's like,

1776
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:32,130
remember when you had pizza? It's
like ice cream, but he's genuine.

1777
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:36,870
He really loves that stuff and he
brings the whole room up. Like, Gosh,

1778
01:48:36,871 --> 01:48:41,340
she's such a such a diamond. I really
love that. And he's a good human.

1779
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:45,420
He does charity work for
true TV. Never. Not, never,

1780
01:48:45,421 --> 01:48:48,390
not farting guy on Twitter.
His handle is never not funny.

1781
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:51,500
He was a fan of our show.
He's Brad

1782
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:56,820
had to get him in the other pilot.
One more psycho cheap person.

1783
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,570
Oh I love this. I could do this
all day. It's so fun to watch.

1784
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:03,450
Fucking misers are my favorite.

1785
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,900
I'm cutting toilet paper
squares for background. Sure.

1786
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:10,180
Wash and use instead of paper products.

1787
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,490
We have a little band
underneath the basket,

1788
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:16,000
the little toilet wipes or we picked
him so we can wash them later.

1789
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:20,210
It's time to wash and just for a minute
I ever have to touch them with my hand

1790
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:23,320
paper to anything.

1791
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:26,680
For me as a middle class family
that makes a good income,

1792
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:30,420
I should and we'd have to go into
debt to buy toilet paper and you

1793
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:34,080
don't, that's the other
thing. Here's the thing,

1794
01:49:34,081 --> 01:49:39,060
they always think they're saving but the
energy and time spent cutting up strips

1795
01:49:39,061 --> 01:49:42,310
of cloth and then nuts
like the dollar store,

1796
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:47,140
say 99 cents store way.

1797
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:51,400
That time I want to do is I spend
19 hours a week cutting and washing.

1798
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:54,730
And did you guys do like organic
diapers and stuff? Did you try to do?

1799
01:49:55,750 --> 01:50:00,310
My friend is pregnant and she's like,
and I'm like, I'm just the high.

1800
01:50:00,311 --> 01:50:04,330
I'm like, she's already like talking about
Oregon. I'm like, wait, organic diapers.

1801
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:08,080
I'm like, wait, or like
cloth type cloth diapers? No.

1802
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,270
Why don't you just not do this to
yourself? Like why are you already like,

1803
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:17,340
I have heard such nightmare
stories about cloth diapers.

1804
01:50:17,341 --> 01:50:18,250
I just feel like you're going to,

1805
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:21,210
it's going to blow out once
and you're not going to gross.

1806
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:24,310
Just ruin the environment for three years.

1807
01:50:25,590 --> 01:50:30,590
None of our cloth wipes that we've been
using them for more than five years of

1808
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:34,780
the marketing nuance saves
us $20 a month over a year.

1809
01:50:34,781 --> 01:50:36,910
Then that is 245

1810
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:38,070
Ooh,

1811
01:50:40,190 --> 01:50:43,630
she's on the sped 10 hours
a day. Cutting strips. No,

1812
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:47,730
I spend that on Amazon everyday.
Like on like toothpicks. I'm like,

1813
01:50:47,731 --> 01:50:49,170
what should I get today?

1814
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:53,920
I had one person say she couldn't
continue her washing machine.

1815
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:57,700
I just had to laugh because of you know,
anything about and bacteria.

1816
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:01,810
There's no eight can survive those harsh
conditions and so what your own asshole

1817
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:02,883
issue at all.

1818
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,230
She's mocking her friend who said,

1819
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:09,040
do you want to wash your shit paper in
the Washer? She's like, that's silly.

1820
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:11,020
Bitch doesn't know what she's
talking about. She's like,

1821
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,530
I'm wearing one of my shit.
Rags as a,

1822
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:21,310
the kid had a blow out the baby
and his pajamas or whenever,

1823
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:25,540
and nanny goes to put it in our washing
machine. I go, don't you fucking do that?

1824
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:30,630
I got this from old navy for four 99
I can afford another form if fuck you

1825
01:51:30,671 --> 01:51:32,660
don't,
don't put it in my washing machine here.

1826
01:51:32,661 --> 01:51:35,980
Has the kid has better intuition
about mom's nonsense here.

1827
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:39,900
First came up with like the kids,

1828
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:44,940
a little skeptical and once I got used
to it and to me it's something solid on

1829
01:51:45,521 --> 01:51:46,354
your hand.

1830
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:47,463
The paper stuff,

1831
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:52,710
the shit that's on your hand,
that solid chest. He had good.

1832
01:51:54,830 --> 01:51:56,820
He goes, this is kind of dirty, right?

1833
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,180
It's clean.
It's

1834
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:06,650
okay, so she's trying to clean. He's
like, this is staying with Kaka Mommy,

1835
01:52:06,651 --> 01:52:09,980
and she was like, no, no,
no. This is clean. Oh my God,

1836
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:15,770
you use that? Mommy said it's okay. This
is my favorite one. For some reason.

1837
01:52:15,771 --> 01:52:19,100
I really liked that lady. Oh,
you know what's another one?

1838
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:24,101
I really don't understand the extreme
couponers they spend 10 15 hours a day

1839
01:52:25,671 --> 01:52:28,910
cutting the coupon,
putting the coupon into folder binders,

1840
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:32,590
and then taking it to the store. It's
like for that, that's a part time jobs.

1841
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:33,500
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

1842
01:52:33,501 --> 01:52:37,730
Just figure out a job that you can earn
more money instead of trying to find a

1843
01:52:37,731 --> 01:52:41,720
way to not spend money. You know what
I mean? It's sort of course. Yes.

1844
01:52:42,530 --> 01:52:45,470
You know they don't have a job.
You're doing a job like the guy,

1845
01:52:45,471 --> 01:52:49,130
like there's this guy that is outside the
rite aid near my house and he's always

1846
01:52:49,131 --> 01:52:51,110
like, he's always asking for it. He's a,

1847
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:54,470
he's like a like a like kind of
handsome black dude, you know?

1848
01:52:54,471 --> 01:52:59,100
He's like maybe 25 or something.
Who knows? It could be 65
your number now. But um,

1849
01:52:59,410 --> 01:53:04,220
he's like holding a cup out. I didn't go
or just, or just not cup. He goes, hey,

1850
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,840
it's like hard times. Can
you give him? I'm like,

1851
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:07,280
do you want me to give you an application?

1852
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:09,270
Because me handing your money
is exactly the same job.

1853
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:11,960
Like no offense to people that work
at write it, but it was like, dude,

1854
01:53:11,961 --> 01:53:15,020
I think you can probably get a
job here probably. Yeah. Yeah.

1855
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:20,290
Like I could get you like what do you
want if you're standing out there all that

1856
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:23,990
time and it's hard. It's
weird. And everyone, the woman
that worked there was like,

1857
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:25,400
yeah, what the fuck dude. I yeah.

1858
01:53:25,401 --> 01:53:28,490
Also it's hard for me to make
money course back in the day.

1859
01:53:28,491 --> 01:53:32,990
You mentioned you are always forcing
your boyfriends to kiss boys. Yes. Boys.

1860
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:37,370
Did you ever get into other kinky
like in a kink stuff or no? Um,

1861
01:53:37,371 --> 01:53:41,930
I like to be jerked off in
front of just getting a diver.

1862
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,840
You kink of the air?
Um,

1863
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,920
oh.

1864
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:49,820
I think I was just like kind
of down for whatever. Okay.

1865
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:51,140
Or were you down for this?

1866
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:57,060
Imagine if the easiest
way to delight your wife.

1867
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,780
She just drove all across room
relationships. Wouldn't tell me

1868
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:08,580
I'm feeling that tails getting fucked.

1869
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:13,260
I feel physically ill with the pup play.
Yeah.

1870
01:54:13,261 --> 01:54:17,910
It makes me very uncomfortable inside.
I liked the original kiwi pup play,

1871
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,300
the deceitful one. They're
like, this is not sexual,

1872
01:54:21,301 --> 01:54:23,770
just a bunch of men
wearing leather and math.

1873
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:28,800
And then we found his other channels
where he was like inserting mass down

1874
01:54:28,801 --> 01:54:32,430
there. Yeah. Is that a butt plug
tail? This one probably wasn't as,

1875
01:54:32,431 --> 01:54:36,780
so when it's all dudes, it definitely is
what it's dudes. They're like leather.

1876
01:54:36,781 --> 01:54:40,910
Like get on the table that the vet needs
to inspect you and then yeah, there's,

1877
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:45,540
I went to a leather vest and silver
lake, um, maybe 10 years ago. Yeah.

1878
01:54:45,541 --> 01:54:49,540
Leather daddies. And they were
the, they have assless chaps. Yeah.

1879
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:52,470
And um, which I've never seen
asphalt chops to be honest,

1880
01:54:52,471 --> 01:54:55,290
but with butt plugs that look like towels.

1881
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:58,290
And then there was a guy that was,

1882
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:02,730
had a booth that people could come up to
and they would zip you up in a body bag

1883
01:55:02,731 --> 01:55:05,340
and just your balls about it and he would
whip your balls and people were like,

1884
01:55:05,341 --> 01:55:08,580
there was a line around the fucking
bottom line. Can I tell you what that is?

1885
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:13,260
That was San Francisco in the late night
and that was, so that was the weekend.

1886
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:17,060
That was a good time back in that city.
You were there for like the real,

1887
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,990
the height of Gay Shit,
man.

1888
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:23,220
There were dudes just butt fucking in
the streets back then. It was awesome.

1889
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:27,390
I think if this women's movement knew
a little bit more about like dom shit,

1890
01:55:27,391 --> 01:55:29,640
like they'd be happier. Like
yeah, you can like whip.

1891
01:55:29,641 --> 01:55:32,940
There's dude you can find that will let
you whip their balls will actually ask

1892
01:55:32,941 --> 01:55:36,180
you to, maybe they don't
want to do it. I can do that.

1893
01:55:36,181 --> 01:55:40,930
I would do that for money if
I weren't married. It was,
I guess I love no, if you,

1894
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:44,190
if I loved it. No, I think
here's what I would do.

1895
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,310
Anyone tolerates that level of pain.
It's gotta be,

1896
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:50,700
there's gotta be such a more inward
pain they're trying to hide. Oh,

1897
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:55,350
that's an interesting, I mean, I'm
like, that's interesting. Like shit,

1898
01:55:55,351 --> 01:55:59,570
trying to mask the inner pain inside.
That's how much worse the pain is on that.

1899
01:55:59,571 --> 01:56:02,370
It's interesting that your balls whipped,
but I mean,

1900
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:06,750
I'm saying there's a physical pain. It
changes obviously from person to person,

1901
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,190
but for a lot of guys,

1902
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,470
wear anything aggressive there
will physically make you collapse,

1903
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:16,620
like nauseous. Right? Absolutely.
I know, and when people say to me,

1904
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:20,580
don't you feel resentful that you have
to carry the baby for nine months and

1905
01:56:20,581 --> 01:56:23,640
then pushed the baby out and then
breastfeed the baby? And I go, no,

1906
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:27,210
because then two and a half years when
that little boy is running around,

1907
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:30,980
he's going to kick daddy right in the
nuts and it's called payback because I

1908
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:35,180
loud every time was actually trained
them to do it. We have lessons.

1909
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:37,470
He's homeschooled and
kicking down the balls. Oh,

1910
01:56:37,471 --> 01:56:40,710
you've won all these ribbons at dog shows,
but they rarely ask.

1911
01:56:40,711 --> 01:56:43,440
If I'm the oh boy.

1912
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:48,150
Quite a few that's rude to go into it
to try to win as a human. It's not fair.

1913
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:52,680
It's like Oscar Pistorius with a fake
legs. A little bit of an advantage.

1914
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:58,470
Don't name is Tony and I'm a human pup.
I'm Tony's husband and trainer.

1915
01:56:58,650 --> 01:56:59,970
Oh,
that's a twist.

1916
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:06,270
That's quite a twist and they have
real dogs are not neuter involved.

1917
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:10,080
Even though it was balls with my entire
life. A lot of kids like to play.

1918
01:57:10,081 --> 01:57:13,410
Pretend they like to pretend to be, but
I really fuck them. They enjoy doing it.

1919
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,680
I just never grew out of
that pet play through Tony.

1920
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:21,900
Once we start dating or is it common?
Who's Tony? Tony's on the left.

1921
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:26,700
She is glad to do it. I say
when the student is ready,
the master appears. Oh boy.

1922
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:32,280
These two are a match made in heaven.
Doggy heaven. All dogs go to heaven.

1923
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,870
They're dogs are super cute. I feel
bad for them now. What's Your Pronoun?

1924
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:41,130
They're like, they go to Costco to get
peanut butter. I bought Tony. Definitely.

1925
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:46,131
He she's observes aspects of to mind
that relate to BDSM or kink or leather?

1926
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,310
No, it involves gear that is
restrictive or restraining. For example,

1927
01:57:53,311 --> 01:57:57,630
leashes, harnesses, myths on your
hands. You know what I don't like?

1928
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:59,580
I don't like how put together they are.

1929
01:57:59,850 --> 01:58:04,850
I like having my pup play psychos
to really be out on the edge.

1930
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:10,260
I don't like, I don't like an articulate
explanation actually don't like that.

1931
01:58:10,261 --> 01:58:13,290
It's like half shaved head.
Like I want you to look proper.

1932
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:17,220
Like I want this to be more of a twist.
I want you to be like,

1933
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:22,140
like Harvard educated. Yeah. I
like to be caught off guard more.

1934
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:27,420
Or just, I like when they're like the
fakeness of like, this is just fun.

1935
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:31,150
Kiwis and out with the guys and
then there's just like fucking,

1936
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,870
do you want to like the
Obamas to be doing that?

1937
01:58:33,871 --> 01:58:35,820
To try to have like a broader audience?

1938
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:38,790
Like they're pretending like they were
like, we want the Christians like as too,

1939
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:42,060
they just want, they don't want
to come off as weird. Right. It's

1940
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:45,610
legitimizing it. Right.
Oh, we have these harnesses

1941
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:50,240
slowly is similar to the
responsibility with a regular dog.

1942
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:54,110
I have to groom the dogs and my wife's
hair, that's pretty, I have regular dog.

1943
01:58:54,111 --> 01:58:56,510
I'm just different. Okay. Okay. He's like,

1944
01:58:56,511 --> 01:59:01,350
we have bio dogs and I do train
them barking, but you know,

1945
01:59:01,370 --> 01:59:05,030
if you want to make a big stink
that's you're an adult human,

1946
01:59:05,031 --> 01:59:05,890
you could do you want it?

1947
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,080
Okay.

1948
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:09,190
So that there was pretty,
cause she,

1949
01:59:09,191 --> 01:59:12,280
she took offense to the fact that he was
like, you know, we have like real dog.

1950
01:59:12,281 --> 01:59:15,360
She's like, I am a funny, can I hear that
again please? Yeah, that was pretty great.

1951
01:59:15,361 --> 01:59:15,830
That was perfect.

1952
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:16,663
Great.
Hi.

1953
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:21,590
Responsibility is similar to the
responsibility with a regular dog.

1954
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:22,820
The first expert.

1955
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,740
I'm a regular dog. Just different. Okay.

1956
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,200
She is rough

1957
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:34,900
bio dog.
Have you been a horse trainer?

1958
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:40,120
A harsh chair since 2009 we can I just
say, can you pause it for a second? Sure.

1959
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:44,620
Because before we even get into
this bitch, um, she's a cha. Okay.

1960
01:59:44,621 --> 01:59:48,130
So what annoys me about that is like if
you want to be like a weird dog badge,

1961
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:53,080
be a dog badge, but don't, don't be
precious about how your dog bitch.

1962
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:55,500
Yeah, you are weird. That is weird. Okay.

1963
01:59:56,140 --> 02:00:00,160
And tout that you're weird and you found
a fucking husband who's like totally

1964
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:03,730
down. I fucking do your gratitude
list in the morning, bitch. All right.

1965
02:00:03,731 --> 02:00:07,690
You can write it with a little pause and
don't, but don't like correct. I'm like,

1966
02:00:07,691 --> 02:00:08,850
he's offended you like,

1967
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:12,390
it's not like he has to accommodate
you more than he already has. He has.

1968
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,280
You're eating out of a fucking
dog ball batch, like a, come on.

1969
02:00:15,470 --> 02:00:20,140
He said regular dog and you're supposed
to say buy a real dogs. Don't do that.

1970
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:24,500
Real dogs don't go like far. Far fewer
like disrespecting my pronouns. No,

1971
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:25,960
she's out of

1972
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,100
Annie. Do some role play. Be like
you're my bio dog. Tell Tom you're,

1973
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:37,210
I mean you're my regular dog.
You're just a regular dog. It's bio.

1974
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:40,930
Wow,

1975
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:47,350
I love this and that's the
day I love this safe space.

1976
02:00:47,351 --> 02:00:52,260
Do you remember that guy? Please explore
please. We need to hear this Mumbo jumbo.

1977
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:57,330
This is this and critter
club is to provide a safe
space for people to explore.

1978
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,840
We engage in pet play.

1979
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:09,370
People don't realize that safe spaces
inside yourself that is the same.

1980
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:12,640
It's really like you have to just
accept herself and not worry about other

1981
02:01:12,641 --> 02:01:15,480
people because you have no control
over how their people treat you.

1982
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:16,900
You'll literally have no,

1983
02:01:16,901 --> 02:01:19,900
all you can do is set up boundaries and
people either cross number don't and

1984
02:01:19,901 --> 02:01:21,610
then you have them in your
life or you don't like,

1985
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:26,090
it's what is happening right
now. Yeah, it's all victim
culture. It's a, yeah, it's,

1986
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:31,060
I have to change the external world.
You have no, it's like people have not,

1987
02:01:31,061 --> 02:01:32,650
I've used that real shit happens.
So it's like,

1988
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:35,290
think it goes up around your
house broken into or whatever.

1989
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:38,560
I feel like being like fucking raped
or having like your house broken into.

1990
02:01:38,561 --> 02:01:40,220
It's like these things that
happen where you're like,

1991
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:43,200
you realize like your
walls are not their fault.

1992
02:01:43,201 --> 02:01:47,090
It's like this barrier is like not
real. Right? So you just have to be,

1993
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,130
you have to be your walls.

1994
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:52,520
Like you have to try your best to like
protect yourself and you can't just like,

1995
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:57,500
it's just, it's just, it makes
me crazy, crazy, real wisdom.

1996
02:01:57,501 --> 02:01:59,990
It's fucking the, I just can't
believe this shit. It's like,

1997
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:03,730
I don't give a fuck about your dog shit,
but I'm allowed to make fun of you.

1998
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,590
I'm sorry. Yeah, of course.
We're going to be weird.

1999
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:08,510
If you're going to put it out
there like you're saying. Yeah,

2000
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:11,180
and you can make fun of me, mother fucker.
I'm not saying you came in front of me.

2001
02:02:11,181 --> 02:02:14,120
It's like who wasn't made fun of. It's
so important to me. Made Fun of like,

2002
02:02:14,121 --> 02:02:18,170
especially as comics, like I
mean, come on, we all got dragged,

2003
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,700
dragged and it's like you learn how
to get through it worse. But no,

2004
02:02:22,701 --> 02:02:25,760
you have to go to a safe
space and do your pony play.

2005
02:02:25,761 --> 02:02:28,520
But I'm going through something. It's
like, yeah, so it was Roseanne Bitch.

2006
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:31,700
Like what the fuck? Like and you can't
everyone so hypocritical. Oh yeah.

2007
02:02:31,701 --> 02:02:36,410
If you want. Okay, fine. Then we have to
be like, feel bad for everyone. Everybody.

2008
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:38,420
Everybody's a front.
If they voted for Trump,

2009
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:42,450
don't feel bad for them.
Quintessential head play gear,

2010
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:47,130
his tail and hood. Everything else
is extra. Okay, so let's do tail. Oh,

2011
02:02:47,131 --> 02:02:50,070
that's not extra. Okay. The
tells that extra for me.

2012
02:02:50,071 --> 02:02:54,300
The reason that I like to be a dog,
his dog is man's best friend.

2013
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:57,230
Dogs experience the world
through a lens of pure joy.

2014
02:02:57,231 --> 02:03:00,000
I ever seen someone that cynical
as am more maybe dolphins,

2015
02:03:00,001 --> 02:03:02,460
but I feel like that pet
play would be much harder.

2016
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,870
It's all I trained off late pony
and critter club is kind of Ooh,

2017
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:11,580
head play dress up like that style.
There's no sex involved.

2018
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:13,350
I don't think sexually sexual.

2019
02:03:13,351 --> 02:03:16,830
I do think that to an extent is is
for Roddick because it is intimate.

2020
02:03:17,910 --> 02:03:19,100
I'm sorry it's not sexual.

2021
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:22,010
He's wearing fucking pleather
from head to toe of course.

2022
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:26,460
And it's all harnessed and
belts all snug on drafts. No,

2023
02:03:26,620 --> 02:03:30,680
it's totally something. I put a fake
tail in my asshole, but it's not sexual.

2024
02:03:30,681 --> 02:03:33,500
It's like you guys pretending that you
weren't going to fucking put that bottle

2025
02:03:33,501 --> 02:03:38,270
right up. Tom's that what bothers me too.

2026
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:43,310
Along what you were saying. Uh, the safe
space and then the need to, you know,

2027
02:03:43,311 --> 02:03:46,850
everybody's different and we have to
honor what they're doing. It's like,

2028
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,300
no you don't. You can talk shit
about like, this is ridiculous.

2029
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:54,440
It's remember when you could just
call crazy shit crazy. Yeah. Now it's,

2030
02:03:54,441 --> 02:03:56,060
you're considered crazy shaming.

2031
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:01,730
Craziest like the most fun thing to
point and laugh at because what keeps you

2032
02:04:01,731 --> 02:04:05,150
feeling like when you're
making fun of someone,

2033
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,580
you're fucking including the thing.

2034
02:04:07,581 --> 02:04:10,670
It's like I'm trying to get on a level
where I can relate to you because what

2035
02:04:10,671 --> 02:04:13,100
you're doing is fucking crazy.
If I wasn't making fun of you,

2036
02:04:13,101 --> 02:04:15,100
I would be judging you.
Right. Do you understand?

2037
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,390
If I was just silently sitting
there and going like this,

2038
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:22,320
I would be repressing every thought I
had about how fucking nuts it is. Yeah.

2039
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:26,720
Or I can try to make the rim left. Bust
your balls and then map it out. Yeah.

2040
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:31,830
I consider myself, I thought you died. I
got excited. That being said, wait, wait,

2041
02:04:31,831 --> 02:04:34,410
wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't
hear it. What is she saying? Yeah.

2042
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:38,370
I consider myself out. I'm
very open. That being said,

2043
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:43,490
I do compartmentalize my pet play because
not everyone wants or needs to see

2044
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:46,950
that families. First thing she said, yeah,

2045
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:51,020
I think they have a general
idea that I'm to deposit,

2046
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:54,680
but you don't talk about it.
They know.

2047
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:59,790
She talked about it like
she was considering going
to thanksgiving dressed up

2048
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:02,640
like that, so I like, yeah,

2049
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:06,310
I mean I guess this is one of our big
points on these people all the time.

2050
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:11,520
A lot of times the people insist on
everybody knowing what makes them come and

2051
02:05:11,951 --> 02:05:15,370
it's like you don't have to
tell everybody and she actually,

2052
02:05:15,371 --> 02:05:19,570
I'll give her credit,
keeps it to herself that like this is her.

2053
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:24,060
I mean keeps she's off, but at least
she's not. She's like saying like,

2054
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:28,560
I don't tell dad and does it a joggy
mentoring guys. I'm a comedian.

2055
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,740
It is a documentary,

2056
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:33,370
which that I applaud like just keep it
to yourself if you're going to be weird,

2057
02:05:33,371 --> 02:05:34,990
just do it behind closed doors.

2058
02:05:34,991 --> 02:05:37,600
Why does everybody have to celebrate
everything you're fucking doing?

2059
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:41,260
How annoying is that as someone with a
narcissistic mother, how annoying is that?

2060
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:45,670
If your owner is like taking the toy,
you're like, Yo, can I get the toy?

2061
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:49,960
You went to pet smart and came back
with nothing for me. Just for yourself.

2062
02:05:50,860 --> 02:05:54,430
This is a nasty or stealing your dogs.
Then I will say,

2063
02:05:54,730 --> 02:05:59,060
if anybody is meant to be a dog,
it's that broad. Right? Yeah.

2064
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,870
She fucking looks like a human dog.
She does.

2065
02:06:01,871 --> 02:06:06,760
She cut her hair like a dog
and she's very ruthless. Um,

2066
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:11,380
she's a doll. She's
fantastic. I almost want to,

2067
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:15,580
we got to watch those again because I
feel like I didn't fully get the essence,

2068
02:06:15,581 --> 02:06:20,340
like I need to soak it in. You haven't
gotten, I need to take a second pass.

2069
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:23,730
I was like, I've got to soak, if you know
what I mean. I didn't get wet enough.

2070
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,380
Right. I'm really, and I haven't
come yet. We have to watch it again.

2071
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:31,240
But there are some videos on this show
that you take one pass and you're like,

2072
02:06:31,241 --> 02:06:34,360
that was weird. And then I think about
them for a week and then I'm like,

2073
02:06:34,361 --> 02:06:37,410
we got this. We got to do guys ever. Are
you ever like, we've got to try that? No,

2074
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:43,630
just mock them endlessly.
Any where can people see you coming up?

2075
02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:46,330
Um, oh, I just have my
date up and I forgot

2076
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:52,720
and he's a great comic. You need to go see
her live. She's Ah, often at the store,

2077
02:06:52,721 --> 02:06:56,680
one of the few ladies that's allowed to
perform that very funny lady. It's hard.

2078
02:06:56,681 --> 02:06:59,780
I had to, you know, complained.

2079
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:03,200
I complained a lot online and
then they finally passed me. Yeah.

2080
02:07:03,210 --> 02:07:07,560
That's the way to do it. I did
not go into the line and, no, no,

2081
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:12,790
you just have to complain
about stuff. Right. You have
to be a victim. It's crazy.

2082
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:17,220
Um, let me look up the
state. Go see comedienne. Uh,

2083
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:21,700
and can I tell you my finish my
Brian's story? Yeah. Oh yeah.

2084
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:26,170
So I go on a date with, and you know,
like everyone's a liar and everything,

2085
02:07:26,171 --> 02:07:30,670
but I thought they lie about like height
and stuff. This guy, um, cropped out,

2086
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:35,530
he had a like a lobster claw hand
cause like a deformed hand and like,

2087
02:07:35,531 --> 02:07:36,190
I don't care.

2088
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:40,270
I was a special ed teacher.
I'm cool. But like it was um,

2089
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:43,510
it was just so surprising
and we never talked about it.

2090
02:07:43,511 --> 02:07:46,990
And then he took me into a lobster
restaurant he did with his lobster. Yeah.

2091
02:07:46,991 --> 02:07:50,070
That's nice that we didn't talk about it.
No,

2092
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:52,180
it was totally random and I was like,
cause I was like,

2093
02:07:52,181 --> 02:07:54,460
I don't want to do a bit about it.
I talked about it on stage but it's like,

2094
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:58,160
but I, I didn't want to, I was like, I'm
not going to talk about this on stage.

2095
02:07:58,570 --> 02:07:59,920
Do they tend to labs?
The restaurant.

2096
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:02,920
But then once he took him to
the labs restaurant, I was
like done deal. Sorry Bro.

2097
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,750
But it was wild.
I'm like just hope like,

2098
02:08:04,751 --> 02:08:06,910
cause I would always make sure he
could tell it in a big boobs and stuff.

2099
02:08:06,911 --> 02:08:09,310
Like I never wanted to have
the moment of like discipline.

2100
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:12,220
I just never like if I'm not your type,
you're not mine.

2101
02:08:12,221 --> 02:08:14,500
So it's like I'm not going to like go
on a date with someone and then show up

2102
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:16,450
and you're like look different
than your picture. Yeah. Wait,

2103
02:08:16,451 --> 02:08:20,210
but this is a famous person with a
lobster, you know, he was like, I don't,

2104
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,880
he like had a picture of one direction.

2105
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:26,170
I'm trying to think of famous people with
lobster claw. No, no, no, no, he's not.

2106
02:08:26,490 --> 02:08:28,390
He's just, he was a nice
guy. It was just like,

2107
02:08:28,391 --> 02:08:30,970
and I wouldn't have it just once I saw
that, I was like, yeah, that's weird man.

2108
02:08:30,971 --> 02:08:34,840
Just show your thing. We are, what's
your website? Where can people find?
