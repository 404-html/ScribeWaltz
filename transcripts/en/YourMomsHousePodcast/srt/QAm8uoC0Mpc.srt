1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,693

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,823
Wow.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,100
Seven. Wow. Yes.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,593
Come on.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,560
Yep.
Hello?

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,813
No.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,533
Wow.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,053
Yeah.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,533
Wow.

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,180
Maybe half man.
His Mama.

16
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,493
Wow.

17
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,083
Yep.

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,113
Yep.

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,410
Nope. My mouth.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,210
You guys mind?

21
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,110
I told the Jeff kind of the all
time great drops from the show

22
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,060
cause my pussy ladies this was this the
original wells Fargo commercial from

23
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,550
Wells Fargo? Yeah, she was there.

24
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,050
She saw original spokeswoman share the
half a million and they didn't give it to

25
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:30,884
her and

26
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,180
the Bank of America and you
Chinese mother fuckers, um,

27
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,540
Joe Murphy made this. It's
really good. Thanks Joe. My

28
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,180
mom would get mad and she would say
things like that to not kiss my butt.

29
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,880
She would say it gives my
buzzy was the kind of thing,

30
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,310
if you're the person that
you're like, um, yeah.

31
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,640
Your mom probably didn't know how that
came across everybody in the room, right?

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,710
No, yeah, no. It was just part of
the fun and being with her. Yeah.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,240
It's part of the fun of having a cool mom.
Cool.

34
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,050
Having a eccentric, her
mom. Just kind of weird.

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,540
Can I hear myself more? You can.
I think you were this one right?

36
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,980
It's good. Yeah. I like your
voice. It's very masculine.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,960
Thank you. I've been told that. I've been
told, yeah, you've a real man's voice.

38
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,350
Solar fans met a fan this morning.

39
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,420
You did in the hotel. We, we celebrated
our Banis Murphy Ernie last night.

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,860
These best wherever any of,

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,140
not just being married but also a
raw dog in it does. Right. And uh,

42
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,900
we're hoping to get more raw dog.
We got some raw dog tweets. We did.

43
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,320
I didn't get any, you must
have just gotten really
telling me the raw dog stuff.

44
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,080
Yeah. Yeah. Go guys. Generally don't
tweet me about their raw dog. Joy's,

45
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,680
that's just for you.
But we,

46
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,030
we went back to the same hotel that
we ride dogged in. That's right. A,

47
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,920
how many years ago was that? 12
years ago? Yes. Around yesterday.

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,650
And we got a couple's massage,
which you're not a fan of.

49
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:09,940
So I was really surprised
that you, I booked it. Right.

50
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:14,020
But remember last time I asked you a while
back, do you want a couple's massage?

51
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,120
And you went what?

52
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,210
No, no I didn't ask you. The woman did
that worked at the SPA. She goes do you,

53
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,810
would you like a couple's massage and
your level of disdain for the very id.

54
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,760
And I tell you something though,

55
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,620
I tell you something about that was a
huge upcharge yesterday and really it was

56
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,960
really just to have two
and two in the same room.

57
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,140
But I mean like I think it's because
the illusion of that being a thing like

58
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:43,330
the,

59
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,330
the marketing of it is something
that's not compatible with the reality.

60
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,730
Like we just in the same room. Yeah,
nothing happens, nothing special.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,060
I can hear your lady going like,
is that comfortable?

62
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,090
And you can hear my lady going is
that temperature right on the bay?

63
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,970
There was nothing happening now.
So how did you feel about it?

64
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,820
Cause I didn't ask you,
did you like the couples experience?

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Would you do it again or you just seem
like it seemed like the only thing that

66
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:17,131
stood out about it was that I'm
hearing a conversation going on.

67
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:21,970
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
I mean literally we walked
in the room, they leave.

68
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,750
We both get our tables and then I get
to hear your ladies and then this is his

69
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,770
pressure is good. And
then do you want, uh,

70
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,620
as you want the music louder and then
when I heard that you don't like loud

71
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,860
music, you asked her to turn it down.
Now I prefer lab and use it. Yeah.

72
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,260
I like to space out.
I like to get weird,

73
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:41,770
which is another argument for separate
room. I agree. Well that's when we,

74
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,600
when we went into the massage spa and
she goes to for a couple's massage,

75
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,940
I literally looked at
her, I went, fuck you. No,

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,120
I booked it and you book it that way.
And then she goes, wait, I'm confused.

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,480
And I go, all right, I guess we're doing
it. Yeah. Well I felt like, you know,

78
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,010
it's our band, a SMURF,
Fernie, you do that to try it.

79
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,300
But I'm saying in retrospect to
pay more for that, it's foolish.

80
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,850
It seems silly to me. Foolish.
They didn't do anything special.

81
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,560
Like there's those champagne in the
room. Nobody masturbated. No Bra,

82
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,050
strawberries, you to come.
A lot of people by the way,

83
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,860
on board with the Shark Shark Bites,
um, analysis and they're like, yeah,

84
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,770
movies stupid. There's no
masturbation saying, by the way,

85
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,910
to everybody that always talks about um,
pre show.

86
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,590
There's commercials. This is pre
show right now, right? Yeah. We're,

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
we're doing pre show and you're already
your borough. You're breaking my balls.

88
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,080
You're breaking my balls right now.

89
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,510
Pre show there's content and you're
saying there's no content and you're lying

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,810
and you're mom's a liar too. Yeah. So

91
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,291
fill her up.

92
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:50,291
Delphia has been a promoted date of mine
for a long time and it's finally here.

93
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,710
I'm really excited to go jeans.

94

95

Um,

96
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,770
I'm real excited about it. I want to
thank everybody. So we got tickets.

97
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,500

Shows the Great Josh Potter is joining me.
She'd be a good time Josh.

99
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,600
Yeah, he's great. He's great. Um,

100
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,490
after that we have thanksgiving.
We'll bill you.

101
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,180

Uh,

105

106
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,960

108
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,980
And then I start a crazy tour throughout

133
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,940
don't get on a plane with
gifts and cray cray Kwanzaa.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,660
Christ mass

135
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,420
Chaunika forgotten. Nobody
celebrates cons on America. I don't,

136
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:46,590
I've never,
never known one person.

137
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,550
I've known a couple of brothers
here and the other do it. Oh yeah.

138
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,980
Couple a fist in the air guys. Yeah. That
white rapper from last week, Jay love.

139
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,940
You know what I'm saying? Cornball
mode. Fuck his nose. He was ridiculous.

140
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:04,380
So retired colon bowl.
That's a, is that a new word?

141
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,720
A cornball I'd been a not a lot.
I mean it's not a new movie.

142
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,990
It's saying maybe there's
a resurgence of it,

143
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,890
but I feel like coming back
we'll focus McCone man,

144
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,580
I feel like that's,
he looked just like him when you said it.

145
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,330
If I had trimmed his beard the way
mind, the way his is, I could probably,

146
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,110
I could be Jay love for, uh,
for, for hollow jeans next year.

147
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,170
I really wish you shave it. I it looks
good. I know, man. It looks so real. Talk.

148
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,780
Don't get on an airplane with packages.

149
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,810
You know you're going to travel for
Christmas and all that sauce. Stupid.

150
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,250
Don't do it.
Cause that TSA,

151
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:40,800
they're going to go through it and they're
going to unwrap everything and you're

152
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,460
really going to regret it. Just have
it sent directly to where you're going.

153
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,790
Have it sends an advance then you
don't have to pack a Goddamn thing.

154
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,270
And the other thing is don't you even
consider not checking out our store?

155
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,900
We have a new store. There's
a lot of stuff on there. Um,

156
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,100
well mainly the, the one
stuff that matters is the
water. A lot of championship,

157
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,880
which I in the water champ,
this is my flask. I found it.

158
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:12,920
You'd be hit it last week.
Water champion shirt, um,

159
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,430
is a hot seller. It's a great
Christmas gift. Christmas,

160
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,820
especially if my friends or dating or
married to someone who's at your mom's

161
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,370
house fan.
So also the Dj Dad mouth thing,

162
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:28,371
which I have a hilarious comment
from one of the youtube videos.

163
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,280
Okay. Let's get into it.
Okay. I was going to say,

164
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:36,900
you were saying that if you are in a
couple of yourself listening and you guys

165
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,160
are debating who's the water champ,

166
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,480
it's a great shirt to get to prove
that you really are. Yeah, absolutely.

167
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,020
Is that my favorite Dan Pena?
Yup. We got all kinds of things.

168
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,160
I was so excited for this interview. I
was sweating out of anticipation. Yeah.

169
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,070
I don't care. I mean, like I said,

170
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,780
we've interviewed major celebrities like
brace from Juggalos. Yeah. Uh, Gloria.

171
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:03,320
Stefan has been on the show jewels Venter,
Aka Jules drools.

172
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,410
And by far Dan Pena has been the most
super exciting, amazing interview.

173
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,220
I'm just so thrilled.
Let's start the show. No.

174
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,600
Well, why aren't my favorite sayings
is that got your fucking patty goes,

175
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,430
you're trying.

176
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,650
Yeah. Did you start to use current
more as you when you moved to the UK?

177
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,660
Because I love it. Oh No, no, no, no.

178
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,990
Transition from cock vagina.
I'm standing soaking enough now.

179
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,800
Don't bring in one love to this. Well, no,

180
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,770
no.
Go to your mom's house,

181
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,140
Christina visits.

182
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,473
Okay.

183
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,850
Yeah.

184
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,730
Yeah. Concen vaginas. So many
guns. He switched to vagina.

185
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:37,170
He said cause con wasn't crazy enough.
Yeah. Oh No, you turned my ears down.

186
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,330
That's when your ears down.
Yeah. Out. Okay. Yeah.

187
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,000
What a treat. What end. Look,
he's even wearing his suit.

188
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,480
He's wearing a suit with his little
pocket square and now adorable.

189
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,010
He's in full panic mode, man. Full pain.
Yeah. So why don't you talk about how did,

190
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:55,490
uh, exactly you line this up. Okay.

191
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,110
So as it happened,

192
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,330
I subscribe to Dan Pena's Qla um,

193
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,440
like newsletter.
Okay.

194
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,270
So I get emails from his
center or whatever once a week.

195
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,740
And we had just done Joe Rogan's
podcast where we briefly mentioned Dan,

196
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:17,690
but we couldn't get into it because
Joe didn't want to, you know,

197
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,790
get into any kind of trouble
playing the guy's clips, right.

198
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,470
Head off and shit down their neck.
Yes.

199
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,680
So I get this random thing and it
just says, Hey, Dan Pena focus, uh,

200
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,910
featured on the Joe Rogan podcast with
Thompson [inaudible] and Christina

201
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,830
fidgets ski. And I, I look, I'm
like, oh my God, that's me. Like,

202
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:37,530
it was one of those spam emails. It
wasn't directed at me. They don't,

203
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,450
I've never made communication
with them before.

204
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,620
So I immediately just right back to
this like spammy email and I go, hey,

205
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,860
I'm Christina [inaudible] ski,
huge fan of Dan's.

206
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,470
We would love to have
him on your mom's house.

207
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,920
And not a few later I get a
direct message from Dan Pena.

208
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,200
Like, Hey, I heard you want
to get in touch with me.

209
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,930
And then Dan and I started
dming on Twitter. And we,

210
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,130
I got in touch with his assistant on
email and we arrange this interview.

211
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,080
But what a wonderful world we live in
that he just ran like he hears us on

212
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,914
Rogan.

213
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,790
No, just follow the
trajectory of the whole thing.

214
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,480
So like we were,
what was the story I told you?

215
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,450
I brought up something a few
weeks ago and you go, no,

216
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,480
it's not that weird because the internet
like the Internet, the Internet,

217
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,020
cause you brought it up. I bring it up.
Bikes kid or the bikes could write. Right.

218
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,050
And he ends up having his
ex girlfriend and for this,

219
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,050
what stood out to me was I
was just on Instagram. Yeah.

220
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,020
And happened to click a video with him
doing the like your foot while you're

221
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,520
fucking poor thing. Yeah. And that's how
you found him. That's how I found him.

222
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,660
That's how I found him.
Pena.

223
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,170
I sent that to blue band and I go put
this in the show breakdown next week.

224
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,940
Then like when I saw his name I go, I'm
going to look him up on Youtube. Yeah.

225
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,030
And that's when I found, remember I
go the first episode, I was like, oh,

226
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,390
I can't wait to play it for
you because I knew how much.

227
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,770
And that's the one where he was like a,
show me your friends, all your friends,

228
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,220
you know why you're fucking losers
because you have the fucking bumps,

229
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:18,590
you're hanging around.
So, and you were laughing.

230
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,570
Like those are things I just typed
in and I go, these are great clips.

231
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,040
I know this will be great for our show.

232
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,940
Then we talk about him on Rogan.

233
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,590
That reach is so massive that it
gets, uh, it gets back to him.

234
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,521
Ben,

235
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:39,510
and you see your name in a
piece of spam mail newsletter.

236
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,330
Yeah.
Cause he obviously he blasts out stuff.

237
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,740
Then we'll reach out and now he's on
our show. It's amazing. Yeah. It's just,

238
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
it isn't, it isn't. Right. Like I said,

239
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,990
like because the world now has shrank
so much because of the inner webs.

240
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,130
It's pretty, it's pretty Rad. And we
could Skype with shrunk and shrunk.

241
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:02,900
And is that the right way? I
don't know. Actually. I just
saw there, um, this is rad.

242
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,400
And we could Skype with this guy in
England who is eight hours I think. Fine,

243
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,230
right? Yeah. Yeah. So first
he tried to set up a Skype
session at 6:00 AM our time.

244
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,910
We we're like, um, no thanks.
Not Happening. Um, but yeah,

245
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,580
but first of all, sorry,
sorry. Okay, go ahead.

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,770
I just wanted to add an addendum to
the massage story and we didn't really

247
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:29,690
finish. Yeah, what happened,
right. So on the pre show, on,

248
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,530
on the pre show,
you may have skipped it,

249
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,800
but there's already the
origins of a story, right?

250
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,510
So we have a couple's massage,
which Tom's vehemently opposed to,

251
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,230
that's an exaggeration past.
And we do, I want to set it up.

252
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,470
You set it up and we tried it and
you fell asleep and started snoring,

253
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,350
which was so typical and I started kind
of giggling to myself and as you're

254
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:56,220
snowing I thought,

255
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,290
wouldn't it be funny when Tom Wakes up
to tell him that while he was asleep,

256
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,100
he farted so loudly that everybody
started laughing? [inaudible] exactly.

257
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:09,780
What causes that counterpart. So we
both were done with a mom. Sij and I,

258
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,210
I sit up and I go,
oh my God,

259
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,250
you farted so big and you're
like, what? I did? I'm like,

260
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,430
oh my God. It was so embarrassing. We
all started laughing. You didn't hear it,

261
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:25,320
you didn't hear it. Well then
I go like, no, I got you,

262
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,670
but you sold it so hard and you're
like, you fell asleep. And I go, yeah.

263
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,650
And you're like, I heard you
snoring. And I go, yeah. And you go,

264
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,570
you farted. And I laughed so hard
and then I was like, oh shit.

265
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,700
Did I really?
And,

266
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,110
and you actually convinced me only because
I remembered when it started. Yeah.

267
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,960
I go, oh, I got to Fart in
here. Oh, so the seeds were
planted and what I'm saying,

268
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:54,900
like I felt too far, but you know,
when you, you clamp down and you go,

269
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm not going to part. Yeah. And then
sometimes it will just go away. Yeah.

270
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,250
But I was like, I must've fallen
asleep. Where does the Fargo, and then,

271
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,160
and I've asked therapists
before and they're like, oh,
farts happen all the time.

272
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,310
Yeah. And I go, what are you doing
there? That could be personal use to,

273
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,160
it just led the biscuits fly. Yeah.
They go, you know, it just happens.

274
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,220
Yeah. Because people relax. It's exactly
in that, in the scenario of describing,

275
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,640
there's someone's pushing on you and you
just relax. Rippling. Yeah. He grew up at,

276
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:23,790
but I can't, I got you. Good. And
I was getting ready to apologize.

277
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,860
I was getting ready to
mention it and not apologize,

278
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,780
but I was really getting ready to go.
Like, oh, I heard about what happened.

279
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,390
I couldn't let you do that. So then I
told you what happened. You got me good.

280
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,780
You really sold it. Good. Yeah.
I really didn't think. And then,

281
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,510
and then we fell off our primal wagons.
Oh my God. Pretty fucking hard. Well,

282
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:44,730
it wasn't Banis Murphy might
convince me to go for it. Go for it.

283
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:48,880
It's one night had
alcohol, fried food. Uh,

284
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,260
just that Mac and cheese.
We did it. We did desserts.

285
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:55,450
We back on the horse because I got
a beat Burt and the fat challenge.

286
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:59,580
That got a lot of work to do. Yeah.
Um, but it wasn't worth it. Honestly.

287
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,510
Like that's the funny thing.
You think you're,

288
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:07,020
you're being bad and having fun and
you're just like, I feel sick. Yeah.

289
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,530
It felt sick all night. I feel
terrible. And then there wasn't good.

290
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,590
But the good part about it was that I
had some really productive farts in the

291
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,370
hotel with you.
Yeah.

292
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,600
And that made the Ana this banished
merch for ne more special or you're very

293
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:24,870
gassy, more specialists. You are
a very gassy, I will say that.

294
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,710
And you did give me credit,
so I appreciate it. It was
really, really enticing.

295
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Nothing makes me angrier or sad or
rather when I fart and then you don't

296
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,240
acknowledge it, you don't give me
credit for the fart. Yeah. I hate that.

297
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,800
It's like,
why do I live?

298
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,140
And yet a lot of thoughts to yourself
last night that you really enjoyed.

299
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,950
You were like right now,
like you're enjoying us.

300
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,260
Thinking about whether I enjoyed
them last night. You did.

301
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,290
There was a few thoughts you
had that you enjoyed a dinner.

302
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
Were you zoned out and you were like,

303
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,853
yeah.

304
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,450
And you let her know if
they know that enough.

305
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,390
The audience that we've talked
about this before with you,

306
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:08,930
that sometimes you think thought
like, great, now see kelp.

307
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,570
Caffeine. Okay, you, you think
thoughts? I've reset this thing.

308
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,300
I have no idea what to do.
I'm not kidding you.

309
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,270
This fucking thing I've downloaded it,

310
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,680
I've used is anti sleep system.
It's on.

311
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,870
All right, well I'm gonna fucking
know. Well, can I go ahead.

312
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,260
You have thoughts that you don't share
and you'll fully talk to yourself.

313
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:38,250
Like we'll be like this
and then you'll go,

314
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,550
that's a kind of exaggerated.
As soon as you go, well,

315
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,090
I have to do with sound so that the
audience just listening can hear it.

316
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,953
You'll be like,
okay,

317
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,343
yeah,

318
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,220
yeah,
and you'll,

319
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,490
you'll laugh to yourself like a
crazy person and then I'll be like,

320
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:58,940
did you just have a thought that you
didn't share it? Sure. Yeah. I know.

321
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:01,220
I don't deny it. It's true, but why?

322
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:04,370
But share the fun thought because
I'm aligned with you want to,

323
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,380
I know if it's just keep telling you I
don't want to, but it's just you and me.

324
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,520
At dinner,
it's not fair.

325
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,390
Or today this morning we are having coffee
in the lobby and then you are on your,

326
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:18,300
I didn't have my phone and you were
reading fun tweets and you were like,

327
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,170
okay, good one. And I'm like,

328
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:25,640
can you share the fun thing but you
wouldn't share that one is a little

329
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:30,520
different than what you're comparing it
to though is that's reading something

330
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,430
and and enjoying it.

331
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,600
But when I have thoughts and you
go tell me what you just thought.

332
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,150
I don't want to,
I don't need to know all your thoughts,

333
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,940
but the ones that give
you laughter when you lab,

334
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:45,580
when you lol basically like how come you
have to share if you're going to lool

335
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,120
like no, then share the fun.
Never. No, it's never gonna change.

336
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,510
Well you know what,
what?

337
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,340
I just had a fun thought.
I know. How's it good one.

338
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:05,150
Yeah. All right. That's good. Dan Pena.

339
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,970
I am so excited. We talked
to Dan Penn. Yep. Blue Band.

340
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,300
Really turn these around quickly.
Thank you. Blue Band. And here you go.

341
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:16,301
Here's some of our conversation with Pena
will also upload it as its own longer

342
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:20,210
form. Just making you're recording.
I was like, are we not recording? No,

343
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:24,470
we are the red lights on.
Okay. I can't wait. I can't
wait. I can't wait. Here we go.

344
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,030
I just love him to
pieces. Uh, Dan, this is a

345
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,880
use is so exciting to us.
You have no idea. I mean,

346
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,890
I know you've seen the footage of us.

347
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,920
I'm talking about you were
huge fans and this is just,

348
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,360
uh, it's just a thrill for us. So, and you
look amazing today. Do you love, so dap,

349
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:46,490
you look like you're about one,
two 25

350
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,440
and you can kill a bear
without a fucking knife.

351
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,890
Yeah.
Well I can't actually,

352
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,490
no, no, no. That's what he said
in his video. His retort to Joe.

353
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,610
Yeah. He got really upset that
Joe called him old. He did.

354
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:05,390
He didn't learn it like that at all.
It's really interesting. He got real mad.

355
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,330
What, what is the back story
of you being the fifth,

356
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,390
the billion dollar man?
What? Well basically,

357
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,910
I'll just summarize that one cause
I don't think it's, you know,

358
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,450
I don't need to play the clip. Right.
Basically. So I was curious about it.

359
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:19,790
I know a lot of people were
wearing you the $50 billion man,

360
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,000
you're not worth $50 billion. The
number comes in, number comes from.

361
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:28,001
That's how much men teas have earned
collectively over his time as a business

362
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,530
and life coach for people.
Gotcha. So in other words,

363
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,520
if you add up all the value of,

364
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,580
of the people who have studied under
him what they've earned for over $50

365
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,980
billion, that's why he calls himself
that. So it's pretty, it's interesting.

366
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,150
And that's why he's called that.

367
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,370
I didn't tell people then.
It was harder for me.

368
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,800
To me, uh, the money I did because it was,

369
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:59,130
and I find it quite easy because one of
the questions I'm often asked me, dad,

370
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,890
why didn't you just continue to make
a lot of fucking money for yourself?

371
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,990
And I in quite frankly,

372
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:07,320
and I told the kids at Oxford University
and two months ago I found a pretty

373
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:10,080
fucking easy. So it wasn't
any fun anymore. Right.

374
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:14,520
But I thought if I could go cause
like you across the goal line. Yeah.

375
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,730
Yeah.
I mean that would be some fun.

376
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,820
But what I grossly underestimated
guys is how fucking hard it would be.

377
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,700
Get people who are low self esteem,
right. No balls. No. Right. Uh,

378
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,650
no, no. Self competence. It
had been raised by gifts.
Your parents across the door.

379
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,710
Loving part. No. Yes,

380
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,920
yes. Um, that was one of
the more fun parts of it.

381
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,490
Talk with them. That was great.
And um, I don't know if what the,

382
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:46,510
what you're going to play next,

383
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:51,511
but Dan and I had a discussion about how
you kind of do have to unlearn a lot of

384
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:53,470
the stuff that you were raised with.

385
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:55,870
There's a lot of stuff that your parents
had just may have passed down to you.

386
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:57,810
That's what therapist teach you to like,
yeah,

387
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,170
I'm learning the shit that doesn't
really work in the real world. Yeah.

388
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
And unlearning,
you know,

389
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,040
the essentially brainwashing
you're programming. Yeah.

390
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,470
Well there's a lot of dumb things.
Like in the case we,

391
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,250
you and I grew up in the Catholic faith.
Yeah.

392
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:16,300
There's a lot of stuff like turn the
other cheek. If somebody hits you,

393
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,810
give them the other cheek to hit
right. Not the, Jesus would give them,

394
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,210
offer them the other side to him as well.

395
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:26,050
Which to me is the dumbest thing to
tell somebody. No. If somebody hits you,

396
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,930
you fucking hit back.
You don't let somebody do that.

397
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,070
Are you fucking Steve Spurrier stay a
bed and the meek don't inherit the earth.

398
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,610
Uh,

399
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,090
they certainly don't know
if that's something you tell
them me so that they feel

400
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:40,510
good. Exactly right. There's a lot
of dumb shit. You grow up one anyway.

401
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,620
The only thing I do is if you want
to be mentored, me personally, uh,

402
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,150
you come to the castle and
you pay. But uh, 99.99,

403
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:54,300
9% of everybody that had benefit
of them cure late. I never met.

404
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,490
I never skyped up Facebook or tweet funds.

405
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,120
Wow.
That's a lot of fucking

406
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,180
fucked with us. Fuck, fuck to the DM.

407
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,630
Fucked and email fucked.
I'm dying to know. Dan,

408
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,590
why are people so fucking poor?
Good question, Jean. Thank you.

409
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,543
Wow.
Okay.

410
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,830
I want to try and do my best imitation
or Polish father telling his daughter

411
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,850
my dad retarded. You nailed it.
He did his research. He did.

412
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:33,050
He listened to us. Yeah, that
was great. That is great. Uh,

413
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,010
hang out with,
oh man,

414
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,810
hotels.
I didn't know that's what you did and how,

415
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,680
but somehow I bet I managed to stay.
I stay productive.

416
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:56,600
Then I stay productive. You
know, it fuels my business.

417
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,390
It feels my material.
But see that's a very,

418
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,820
it's a very smart approach
to a conversation.

419
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,980
I let the conversation began.

420
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:10,060
Lithic is knowing a little bit
about the people you're talking to.

421
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,910
After you introduced me
to the world of Dan Pena,

422
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,250
I immediately got on his website.
I read all the material I listened to,

423
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,100
you know a lot about, he's got a
podcast called ask the $50 billion man.

424
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:26,330
And it's hilarious because
he reads people. He's like,
check out my fucking site.

425
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,250
He'll be like, fucking shit. It's all on
the fucking website. Okay. Like he gets,

426
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,400
it gets upset, which is fine.
Agitated. They tell you stuff, he'll,

427
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,690
he'll tell he gives away stuff for
free. So it's great. Fucking hilarious.

428
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,500
He's such a wonderful treasure.
Dan Pena.

429
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,660
Well he was so, yeah, his dad was
a cop so he grew up really hard,

430
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:54,970
knocks plenty.

431
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,253
Uh,

432
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,720
I had a broken a kid.
Yeah.

433
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,980
I smashed the guy,
the glass window.

434
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,570
The eye glass dries.

435
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,380
Fortunately it was this site
and the coup de Gras, uh, was,

436
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:17,381
I dropped an aquarium from the second
floor on my teacher and if he hadn't moved

437
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,880
six inches, they woulda killed me.
But it only broke his collarbone. Oof.

438
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,940
Now my mother knew I was
just getting started.

439
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,130
I'm sure like grammar school, God only
knows what I do by the time I got out.

440
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:34,310
So she, she pressured my dad
and we moved to the battle.

441
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,640
No, you go. That's, that's my
story to that is your story.

442
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,350
I grew up in a hard streets and then
we went to the valley. Do you do it?

443
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,210
You also grew up partially in the
rough streets of Windsor, Ontario.

444
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,130
Yeah. Did you start to use more
as you when you moved to the UK?

445
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:56,970
Because I love it.

446
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,233
Okay.

447
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,670
Yeah,
he's too funny dude.

448
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,850
I don't even know what it's like now.

449
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:16,570
You can't even dress your boy up in
blue because that's considered a form of

450
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:19,960
child abuse cause he hasn't
decided his gender preference yet

451
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,670
and
it's,

452
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,810
I fear how he's going
to turn out under this

453
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,730
funny but ironic.
It's your daddy wanted to give him

454
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,780
right. The key though is that
we fired her, we fired her,

455
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:40,350
fired her immediately got the boot.

456
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,343
I know.

457
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:55,310
I think we almost did. I really did
almost blow a gasket on that. Yeah.

458
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,130
It was funny too by the way.
This is a total separate from this.

459
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,360
I just realized that I reacted the same
way now that I did in this video at the

460
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,194
same moment.

461
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,300
And I also saw you react the same way
like in the moment to like exactly the

462
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:14,060
same moment.
Wow.

463
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,210
That's cause they're genuine.
I know.

464
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:18,720
I always think about that when we play
that go. Great to see you make him laugh.

465
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,450
That was great. He was like
Ha. And you could tell.

466
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,310
Can you imagine if you worked
for him and you were like,

467
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:28,590
I'm going to do Reiki on your baby. But
he would do, he would fire me. He hit me.

468
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:33,810
He just said he would like to
make an exception to it. Lastly,

469
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:38,400
cause I know we don't have as much
time as always, you look incredible.

470
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,690
We wanted to know what's your
position on jeans? First of all,

471
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,630
the kids that probably gets a
write me an email me about that.

472
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,580
You know, they say big, big
airs or James at the bidding.

473
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:02,581
I guy that I don't know what happened
either seven or eight guys that I know.

474
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:07,360
I can say that I know and uh,
they don't wear jeans.

475
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,110
There you go.
Dan Pena does not wear jeans.

476
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:14,930
I don't do it for all
the success I've had. Uh,

477
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,430
the,
I have the least amount of followers,

478
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,070
right? Twitter kills me. It's weird.

479
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,770
You should have linkedin and
there's a reason. What's that?

480
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,570
Cause you're a fucking punk.

481
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,630
What his answer was,

482
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,850
most people call people a person
to cry if they're a obnoxious,

483
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,450
et cetera. Right? See when I call your
parents for your fucking cow. Okay. Okay.

484
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,970
All right. All right. Your
brain to do what's right.

485
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,780
Do you want to be liked by some other
cons? Yeah, right. Absolutely. Okay.

486
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,670
There you go.

487
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,790
Yeah, he owes and just so you guys, if
you do wanna know the answer, I think he,

488
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,930
he said the reason he's not as popular
in social media is because he calls

489
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,050
people constantly. I mean, he
basically, he calls you out,
I'm being a pussy. Right.

490
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,400
And, and fuck yourself. He doesn't tell
you it's okay to be weak and shitty. Yeah.

491
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,680
Which is really necessary,

492
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,540
by the way. I know it's been a week. Um,

493
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,800
we have a new president of
the United States coming to,

494
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,860
and this isn't a political
show by any means,

495
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,780
but I do feel like it's necessary
to say something. Uh, and it's,

496
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,630
it's a pretty simple and we'll,
and we'll move on.

497
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,360
Everybody gets so fired up and hot
headed and you came and talked to people.

498
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,220
Very personal thing. Politics
and religion, you know,

499
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,480
and people get too fired up and you
can't have, you can't have conversations.

500
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:44,530
What I was going to say though was
that, um, you know, uh, I don't,

501
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:49,240
I don't know if it's not really a mystery.
I didn't, I was not a fan, not a fan of,

502
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,760
of Trump.
Okay.

503
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,320
Never didn't ever wanted him to be
president and a never thought it'd be

504
00:33:56,321 --> 00:34:00,160
possible. But I will say that
I think it's important, um,

505
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,920
to now that he's won, you know,
the, uh, the rig system, uh,

506
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,190
came together, kind of worked
in his favor. He won, you know,

507
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,760
I feel like you have to give your,
for the benefit of your country,

508
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:17,300
give them a shot. And, um, just
I, you know, like I'm sending,

509
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,110
you can be disappointed, but you got to
give him a shot and see what happens. So,

510
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,840
yeah, I mean, I agree. It's
not, it's not the end. It's
not the end of the world yet.

511
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,690
Let's see.
Let's not panic.

512
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,490
And everybody's in their initial
reaction is some of us are horror panic.

513
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:38,270
A lot of people are really depressed
and anxious, but let's, so, let's see.

514
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,160
Absolutely.

515
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,460
So, um, we'll move. I do have, I
did think I'll give him credit.

516
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:47,360
I thought he gave a very
nice, uh, victory speech, uh,

517
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,460
when he came out. I have a small clip
from that and then we'll move on. This,

518
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:54,400
this is him, uh, moments, you know,

519
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,940
after accepting that he is the
president elect of the United States

520
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,143
Chile

521
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,250
sheet.
I know she's bad,

522
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,240
but audit starving dog shit and the dust
storms have you run it out of prince

523
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,680
frozen burrito covers.
Got a solution.

524
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,000
That's what you said last time.
Did I got a solution here?

525
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,690
There you go. So that was um, a
beautiful moment from that speech and um,

526
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,120
let's hope that America

527
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,310
America is great again.
That sounded like we're,

528
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:46,980
we've returned to greatness or we're
all great. Thank you. We're back. Um,

529
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,651
when do you,

530
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:52,030
how long before he does start shooting
rifles in the air during speeches you

531
00:35:52,031 --> 00:35:56,650
think could, I don't know, it could be the
most entertaining for years ever, right?

532
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,950
We're about to embark on, it's
definitely going to be great for comedy.

533
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,300
I think it's going to be great for a
Saturday night live the great for the arts

534
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:08,230
in general. Yeah. I think we're going to
have another, a renascence if you will,

535
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:10,330
with the artists I do freaking out.

536
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,620
Cause God knows the comedy world is
losing their mind right now. Yeah,

537
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:16,300
they're fired up.
Um,

538
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,600
so do you remember a while back?
Jeans. We had a, I love you.

539
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,020
You love me. Can I just say that? I
love you. Thank you. I do. I love you.

540
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:29,560
I think you're a wonderful man.
I'm glad we've been married so long.

541
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,540
Let's just hit you right now.
It just hit me because look,

542
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:35,800
if the world is going to fall to
pieces because of President Camacho,

543
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,750
then I just want you to know I
love you and we've got a compound,

544
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,210
um,
built underground.

545
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,440
We can survive the nuclear holocaust
and we can love each other. Oh yeah.

546
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:52,030
There's no problems. And our two dogs
were all should be fine. Our bunker is,

547
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:58,110
um, we got our water supply, we got
our backup generator. Um, when the, um,

548
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,970
the nuclear bombs hit, it'll,
it'll be fine. Be Great.

549
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,330
You guys have our podcast to listen to.

550
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,040
I love you too. Jeans. I love you
too. Yeah. Um, the end of the world.

551
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,160
So here's what I wanted it to play.

552
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,800
So do you remember a while
ago we played this, um,

553
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,770
this British hooligan fan who
was like saying blood and Fam?

554
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,460
Yeah, that's a good
one. He's back. Oh good.

555
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,950
There's an interesting I think
note about this guy. Okay. Okay.

556
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,250
Uh, fam blood fam fam. Yes.

557
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,240
That one stuck to me for
a while. This time. Uh,

558
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:39,200
we were talking to after he
lost lost, uh, Tottenham,

559
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,310
which used to be a shitty team,
but is now much better.

560
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,840
Tottenham I think I said it
is tall, tall, tall. Although,

561
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,470
um,
the author is it top told him.

562
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,820
How do you spells t o
t t t t n h. A. M. Huh.

563
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,410
Tall,
Tall Gloucester.

564
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,530
This guy. Anyways, he, he,
he has a pretty great accent,

565
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:08,610
but he also has the slang
that you don't get to hear.

566
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,850
I mean I've, I mentioned fam, I've heard,

567
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,630
but I've never heard it like you used
a hundred times and write two minutes

568
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,470
blood.
I don't hear a lot about it

569
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,770
before, but isn't there like an old
jive Chang lose blood? I was like,

570
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,570
oh seven and he's black and
the name. Okay, well, okay,

571
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,370
he's a black man with your medicines back.

572
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,420
Why was a bit disappointed in the end
from awesome Kay was it was just dead

573
00:38:31,421 --> 00:38:36,000
money. It was dead, right? They was dead.
There was no passion. There was no Dody.

574
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,390
Masha and passion was cooking in blood.

575
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,270
This is a north London
Darby family and us.

576
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,500
That was the biggest game
of the season so far. Blog.

577
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,750
I look where they go and do your blood.
Look when they go and do even up blood,

578
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,130
I'm a bigger, what we found are you
missing them? Opportunities. Blood.

579
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,060
You free one on one blood.

580
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,510
You aren't so much time like to pick your
corner blood and you hit Australia to

581
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:57,000
keep her blood. Even Mustafi
he was getting Rick blood,
you know, I love my staff.

582
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,834
He blood,

583
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,360
this guy's out of blah, blah, blah.

584
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,110
First there was no shape.
Bloody Mama all over the Gulf farm.

585
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:11,570
There was nothing there. Blood Bellarine
but Rick, you understand what gay replied

586
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,130
[inaudible] or didn't do his thing.

587
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,260
Alexis was was was writing man down,

588
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:20,360
but there was nothing really
to the game blood. It was dead.

589
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,520
Talk like this. Yeah, really
all the time. I don't know.

590
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:26,630
I'd never heard blood.

591
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,520
I've heard that this might be a clip
here from this guy for the master of

592
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:36,280
accidents. So just let me, let me just,
sorry, master. Put your headphones on.

593
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,120
Get My, all right. And let's see.

594
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,280
I don't give a shit about it
and he cut blood. Let me rule.

595
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,640
Obviously we wouldn't it. Yeah. Cool.
But I don't really care for that.

596
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,460
I handled my idol, not blood. I
don't look at it. You to think. Oh,

597
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:50,570
we'll we playing talking him into Leacock.

598
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,050
I think when we played them in
the lead blood, come on blood,

599
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,320
which we will be games. A tough
game. Star becomes a tight game.

600
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,180
Why do they always turn up and we don't
recently blood. Why is that funny?

601
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,230
Why do you play it not for this fucking
game. Blood. Even the fans blood.

602
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,190
I'm a big fan. I'm a big supporter.
I, but today was shit. I'm walking up.

603
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,290
It ain't no fucking songs. There's
no bank that was, she was dead

604
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,800
good. That wasn't hard to,
I understood all that. Yeah.

605
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,880
I feel like mad about the team.
Yes. They said that this clip here,

606
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,060
the interviewer tries to suggest that
the team that they lost who was good and

607
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:24,890
that, oh, maybe upsets this guy. Okay.

608
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,530
We got to get him a lot of credit

609
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,590
and beat them. We have to give them
listen whether we like them or not,

610
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,530
we have to give them respect
that they are not a shit team.

611
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,390
They are a couple of older, second
day our goods team. There's,

612
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,410
it's a simple as that.
We don't want to have me

613
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,000
sports do sports or like politics too.

614
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,530
It's so much like that seems bullshit man.
And they get so,

615
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,180
so fired up. I know. It is. Here's the
blood family. Super Cool. Excellent.

616
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,620
It was just dead man,

617
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,770
Blah Blah Blah Blah and blah blah blah
to blah blah blah blah and blah blah blah

618
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,330
blah blah blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

619
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,540
So many, it's so many. Yeah.
It's, it's such a weird drop.

620
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,220
I know. And I always love is when, um,

621
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,890
somebody like that is being interviewed
and he has to really treat that person

622
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,150
like somebody of intelligence that has,
I think he that I know.

623
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:33,550
I know what you're saying
in a general sense. I think
he knows who that guy is. A,

624
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,920
he's at home. Yeah. He knows that
this guy was a good interview.

625
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,280
Good in the sense that he's entertaining,
you know? Yeah. And he has to be like,

626
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:45,070
how do you feel? Yeah. Like
blood for blood, blood time, Bam,

627
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:51,320
Bam, Bam. Black. That black fab time.
Nothing like the soccer hooligans.

628
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:56,270
They really love their side.
Do speaking of accents.

629
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,740
Yeah.
And the UK,

630
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,940
we have a full tour of UK accents.
Right. Oh, I love it. Let's do it.

631
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,550
Yeah. This is something as a master,
right. People have asked me, you know,

632
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,580
can you do this one came through that one.
The answer is always yes.

633
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,290
But now to educate us further.
We're going to take this tour of an,

634
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,770
and I lived in England
for a year in the 90s.

635
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:22,190
So I feel like I can contribute to this
discussion. I mean I'm, I'm no master.

636
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,810
Yeah, and right. Yeah. Am I
in a Prentice? Oh, for sure.

637
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,070
Yeah,
of course.

638
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,430
Perceived pronunciation
is the great communicator.

639
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,600
As soon as you deviate from that and
you're going to London speech for example,

640
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,880
then you lose a little
bit of the communication.

641
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:43,010
Courtney is based on East Anglian sofic.
Norfolk came richer.

642
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,340
This is often by actors confused with
the West country where the hour has come

643
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:51,910
in and then you get Dorset and
Somerset get into Cornwall.

644
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,460
Devon slightly definitely goes
in the nose a bit more like that.

645
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,840
Then you go up north to Yakutia.
It's nice if you get the word that Scott,

646
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:00,674
one of the predominant.

647
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,570
That sounds very Downton Abbey,
Downton Abbey. Where was down? Well,

648
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,150
the way he said I'm a good Yorkshire Lass.
Yeah.

649
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,190
You said Yorkshire Shoah.
They, the aristocracy.

650
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,890
The aristocracy lived.
I just,

651
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,560
they would always take the
train into London to write.

652
00:43:19,561 --> 00:43:23,520
They were country people Downton,
so maybe that is your,

653
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,480
I do know that the,
the royal to the ton to talk.

654
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,750
This is true with the chin out and a
bit of a more nasal [inaudible] and then

655
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,920
you know, again the cognate people,
they get it. It's like Boston Bro. Yeah.

656
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:38,740
Yeah.

657
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,490
It's nice if you get a word that's got
one of the predominant sounds in it like

658
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,820
yard, then you cross the
[inaudible] into action. Which Mall?

659
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,090
That sounds like the way
he just said that. Yeah.

660
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,240
That your sounds like the um,
the farmers on Downton Abbey.

661
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,390
Yeah.
The people that work at the actual,

662
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,900
so it didn't sound like the down the
farmers. Yeah. Yeah. The people, the,

663
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:05,300
the actual working class sounds like the
downstairs people, if you will. Yeah,

664
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,820
but that's exactly how they would
say things. You know, I wonder,

665
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,250
I wonder where land kiss
shy or directionally or
not. Does that take place?

666
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,600
We can look it up on this thing called
the inner webs to the Google machine.

667
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,953
Um,

668
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,840
where does Downton Abbey take place?
Where,

669
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,190
where did the porno take place? Remember
the season finale was so crazy. I mean,

670
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:30,150
the series finale,

671
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,810
when they all had sex with each
other and stairs and downstairs,

672
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,390
it's in Hampshire.

673
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,620
Help share about five
miles south of Newbury,

674
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,070
Berkshire back chart. That doesn't
really help me. And they're like,

675
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,110
where the fuck is that now are you,

676
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,960
are you googling where the actual
building Downton Abbey. Yeah. Um,

677
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,000
she see where the show takes
place. It can be, let's see.

678
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,920
God Damn [inaudible]
come a hell lot of comm.

679
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,630
And then Birmingham, Bam,
Bam. Okay. Let's see.

680
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,200
Where does Downton Abbey, I love it
when our Internet's never work. We've,

681
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,450
we've installed about four
different lines in this house.

682
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,880
It's in the Fictional Yorkshire
County. I just read that. Yeah.

683
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,410
Fuck your mother for Yorkshire Country
Estate. Okay, so it's Yorkshire.

684
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,560
So that's exactly where in Yorkshire?
Yeah, North Yorkshire. Right there.

685
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,880
You'll see how the master picked it
up though. So good. You did? Yeah.

686
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,320
How did I get Yorkshire Lad

687
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,070
word that Scott, one of the predominant
sounds in it, like yard shear.

688
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,420
Then you've crossed the pen eyes into
lanky share where it gets much more

689
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:39,730
flexible and fluid in the mouth
live. The tool is there to, you know,

690
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,100
it's scouse to mixture
of all kinds of sounds.

691
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,570
One of those keys, Northern Irish
with the raising and fluxions,

692
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,950
but you don't get the rising inflection
stone on Joplin where it has that poetic

693
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,813
quality,

694
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,670
which is sometimes sort of as being
not different from Highland speech,

695
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,580
which is uh, uh, also, uh,

696
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,810
quite poetic and almost Scandinavian.

697
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,300
And then you come down to Glasgow and
into the lowlands of school and where are

698
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,380
you get clause stalks
and things like that.

699
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,310
And then you come down the west coast
and you're in wheels north Wales where

700
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,880
it's breathy like that and
down into South Wales. Well,

701
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:21,380
you've got too much heavier and Welsh
people sometimes even sound a bit drunk.

702
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:26,450
Yeah. This guy is so good. So
good. Did I feel like he could be,

703
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,800
he could sign up for my,

704
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,560
my master's program where he comes
and stays in the house castle and uh,

705
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,220
we just practice accents. Yeah. You know,
you should invite him to your layer.

706
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,970
Boy, he's got to pay. But I'm saying
he's really, he's getting ready.

707
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,740
I feel like to take the course. Can I tell
you the Welsh accent is, in my opinion,

708
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:50,330
the hardest to understand of these people.
That shit is bananas hard.

709
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,250
And then you have a few
pints of beer and you,

710
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,080
you can understand what the fuck
these people are saying to you. Yeah.

711
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:59,010
And by the way, uh, trainspotting
two is coming out. Yeah.

712
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,960
We talk about some accents.
I'm super stoked. There's
whole chunks of that movie.

713
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:06,970
I don't understand a fucking word.
Francis Begbie says, oh no film. And I'm,

714
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,910
I'm Gareth Jamison.

715
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:12,500
I'm an actor and a voice coach from
www.londonvoicelessons.com. Cool.

716
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,240
Harrison, do you, um, do you, can
you believe it 20 years later though?

717
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,240
It's so fun. It went by
so fast. Yeah. I mean,

718
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:23,960
I was in college when that movie came
out and I was like my favorite movie

719
00:47:23,961 --> 00:47:27,080
episodes. You remember like beat the
first time or you're like, wait, what?

720
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,110
What'd he just say?
Beats like beats in the movie moment.

721
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,410
Frances Frances Beg me that, that the
sociopathic guy that throws the beer.

722
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,680
I don't want to, I didn't understand
most of what he says in that film.

723
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,780
There's an entire scene where he's talking
to like he's telling a story to spud

724
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:45,890
or something and understand
a fucking word. I know,

725
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:49,140
I know was a bit out of that bed and he
throws the pint of beer and someone's

726
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,140
screens and the only real lunatics and
then whatever. It's such, I can't wait.

727
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,670
Yeah.

728
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,790
Tips for working on
your voice and I'll the,

729
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,320
I like those. Really cool. Real cool.

730
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,820
The key to any accent. Okay. Isolate the
sounds that are specific to that accent.

731
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,550
So in the Welsh shacks,

732
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:17,240
and quite often you'll hear people saying
that it's a very sing songs sort of

733
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,230
sounding accent.

734
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,740
The reason for this is that in Welsh acts
and what tends to happen is that vowel

735
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:28,550
sounds are stretch out and stressed and
there's a huge glide from high pitch to

736
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:29,384
low pitch.

737
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,240
The accident I'm talking about is the
South Wales Act and there's actually quite

738
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:35,510
a huge difference between south and north.
We're focused on the south Wales.

739
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,180
So listen to this sentence,
John,

740
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,030
what do you do when John,

741
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,390
what do you do when no discharge?

742
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,060
You do and that's good.
Do it again. A huge John,

743
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,620
what do you do and can I get John,
what do you do?

744
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,110
And John,
what do you do when

745
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,900
John,
what are you doing

746
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,090
there?
Notice that huge glide on John.

747
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,140
She's much more common in males than it
is in other parts of being of the United

748
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,840
Kingdom,
but it's not exclusive to Wales.

749
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,790
Keon what do you do when John?

750
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,840
Notice that at the end as well to
run than it sound in doing too.

751
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:20,930
When we we're getting pit
and when it hit and pick,

752
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,390
it becomes more like an air,

753
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:27,320
so that's and bet they have a
better that please. Is He doing

754
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,850
American accent? That'd be great if
this guy did American of this guy.

755
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,370
He does how to do a Scott. He
does American Dad, let's hear it.

756
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,750
He's all California.
Browse talk like this bro.

757
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,770
He's like Sally girl.
Once you want to do is sound old.

758
00:49:45,771 --> 00:49:49,790
Fucking stupid like this. Hey, hey man.

759
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,050
Hey Man.

760
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,060
Drove your eye color that 80 Jamison.
I'm an actor and the volume,

761
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,650
you want to go to Mcdonald's and you might
want to do an American accent because

762
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:07,400
you're in a play or a film or maybe you
want to impress your friends want to be

763
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:11,120
done. Maybe you want to try and fit in
better in the USA. Whatever the reason,

764
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,660
weird thing to do to try to
fit in better on the US side.

765
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,440
Adapt a an accident on a vacation.

766
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,150
Playing with accidents is a great way
to stretch your voice and exercise your

767
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:25,340
speech.
Oh,

768
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,080
now the key to doing any accent is to
isolate the specific sounds that occur in

769
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:30,914
that accent.

770
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,770
But today I can only give you a brief
overview of some of these sounds.

771
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:36,740
Of course, the USA is huge and
there are many different accents,

772
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,270
so we're going to go for one that's called
general American and start again with

773
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:45,500
the sound Americans use for the letter
arc. Okay. Now listen to this sentence.

774
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,640
Are there more birds?
Totally. Are there more birds

775
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,930
there? More birds? Are there more birds?

776
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,330
Are there more birds?
He's really,

777
00:50:57,331 --> 00:51:02,250
like I said it more American by listening
to him. Yeah. Are there more birds?

778
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,790
Clear? He cleaned it up for
you and did he really did

779
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,910
are now listen to this sentence.
It's right. Are there more birds?

780
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,060
Are there more birds? Are there
more burden? Can you adjust it?

781
00:51:12,061 --> 00:51:15,060
Every time there's a letter
R it's pronounced and that's
a good general rule for

782
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:20,040
American. Every letter are in the word
gets pronounced. Are there more birds?

783
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,370
Also? It's a very dark sound.
Might help you to think about this.

784
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:28,371
A sound coming from right at the back of
the throat that here are there more for

785
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,440
terrible there nick.

786
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,130
The only sound terrible compared
to the beautiful UK. It sounds.

787
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,490
Do we sound fucking retarded? Look, I
have to work on what I've been working on.

788
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,620
You can be here for it,
but

789
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,940
that's your front line. Shanti. Oh.

790
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,770
Shantay that's be asked to be on.

791
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:59,290
That's terrible. Do that
again. Be on Sir. No, no.

792
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,530
Do you need to practice
beyond sir? Beyonce? Beyonce.

793
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,980
Pardot please.

794
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:12,980
Macy BUCO MERCI book. I'm
so much better. No, no,

795
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,190
no, I did really well. So you're learning
French now and the airplanes? Yeah,

796
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:21,800
I do it to occupy my time. When do you
have time in between the Strip clubs?

797
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,850
I don't, well, what happens is I'll go
into a strip club with headphones on

798
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,830
and you'll then sometimes they'll go like,
yeah, man, don't want to take those out.

799
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,360
And I'll be like, I'm working on
my friend. I'll say, no, I don't

800
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:41,160
see beaucoup. MERCI.
MERCI beaucoup. Beyonce.

801
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,810
Here's what can I tell you why I did this?
So people know.

802
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,580
So I finished Spanish in
high school as a sophomore.

803
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:54,350
I took the AP. Well, yeah,
there's a little advantage.
I had a little advantage,

804
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,980
right? And I passed. I had to like A's
or with everything. So they go, yeah,

805
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,390
you just take a second language.

806
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:05,020
So what I did was I signed up for French
and I got a d and I was always really

807
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:11,620
disappointed in it. Then
a few years later, I,

808
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,910
I forget online or something,

809
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,590
I found a French tutor and I go,
I'm going to try to do this again.

810
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,030
And I met with her a couple times.
She gave me tapes.

811
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,560
This was when there was cassette tapes.
Listen to these tapes of practice.

812
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,910
I gave up in, I don't know,
a week or two. Oh, I bet.

813
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Then I signed up for this online course
about somewhere between 15 and 18 months

814
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:41,571
ago and I did it for a
couple days and then I,

815
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,930
the reason I never mentioned it was
I was like, cause you, I quit again.

816
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,520
And the reason I mentioned to you at
this time is that I've gone further get

817
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,670
free. So you don't, when you're like,
it's like a diet where you're like,

818
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:57,950
I'm not going to say anything until
I know I'm doing it. So far you,

819
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,600
I'm in the beginner stages, but I've
done four or five beginner things.

820
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,890
It's hard when you're not immersed,
I think in the language.

821
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:08,610
You're not forced to show up
to a class or live, you know,

822
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:13,170
live in France and France land. Yeah.
For Awhile. But uh, that's good.

823
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:14,110
Good for you.
Yeah.

824
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:19,130
I studied German in college and I almost
failed by the time I got to German

825
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:22,440
three almost failed out.
I think I got like a d,

826
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,490
I think I'm going to try to do a
few of these, you know, with the,

827
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:28,740
with the languages that
come more naturally,

828
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,480
you can incorporate it and you're
deejaying. He can yell out.

829
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,650
You can be like that European Dj, dad
mouth, you know, there's, there's that,

830
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:41,570
there's also, you gave me this great
idea to try to be a retarded comedian.

831
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,180
And I was thinking, what if I did
that? But in multiple languages, I,

832
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,910
that's a duck.

833
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:52,860
They're not going to hold me to this
same vocabulary that enable minded person

834
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:57,510
would have. Right? So what if I did?
I'm retarded, but I do this in French,

835
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,490
Spanish,
Portuguese and Italian.

836
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:04,020
Then you can appeal to all
retarded people in all cultures.

837
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,270
It's such a beautiful idea on your part.

838
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:09,360
And I saw one of their credit
you with that. Thank you.

839
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,750
It's the retarded people of the world.
It's a global act.

840
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:17,290
Now you can go ahead and your agent
can thank me for that idea. Well,

841
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,070
you know, you can give him
a call. Tell him I'll, I'll,

842
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:24,660
I mean I'll definitely give you
credit. Um, also don't forget,

843
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,110
um, by the way, today I was,

844
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,860
we share a booking agent and
we were talking about for
Eit said Fort Lauderdale.

845
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:36,390
He corrected me and said, Oh,
you mean fart louder now. Wow.

846
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:39,390
And I go, and he just turned your
commission on the was a good one.

847
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,750
Are you going to go to Fort
Lauderdale? We'll see. We'll see.

848
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,170
We'll see if there was to work out the
deal, Tom. Okay. It's all about the deal.

849
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,570
Um, don't forget. Uh,

850
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,780
I'm standing there and I smell what
smells like somebody just dumped an entire

851
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,440
container of coffee in the shower like
somebody took, I don't know what that is.

852
00:55:58,441 --> 00:55:59,350
When the RAF and just,

853
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,470
you drink water today, dad. First of all,

854
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,270
always been a big water drinker.

855
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:16,200
He is like Brown. We should measure
who drink some more water a day.

856
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,400
Why don't we do a water challenge?
I'm fucking you right now, bro. Okay,

857
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,840
let's do this.
It's so ridiculous.

858
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,873
Accurate,

859
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,780
so much water or more
songs during the show.

860
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,360
So many great,
but this one is of course about the water.

861
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:48,361
She knows her shit about me being the
water flowing and they can see the

862
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,580
manipulation.
He could never drink as much water.

863
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,720
There's online support with Tom
is the best done a big fat liar.

864
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,530
Here's the evidence. Remember? Wow.

865
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,520
It's so great.
So again,

866
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,860
that's the Watergate
Emami Distrac or gain.

867
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,860
God,
that felt good too.

868
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,000
We had that Teresa mom let this
morning and I really liked it.

869
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,720
I forgot how much I enjoyed Theresa.
Actually. You got me to enjoy soyrizo.

870
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:29,580
Yeah, that's a good alternative to
the nastiness of, of real Theresa. Um,

871
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,500
so then we were sent a,

872
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,060
a comment,
it's on one of our youtube videos.

873
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,200
Youtube comments are that
usually most flattering.

874
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:46,190
That's where people really let you know
how much they like this is actually has

875
00:57:46,191 --> 00:57:50,900
made me, this made me laugh so hard.
This is from a Dj dad mouth video. Okay.

876
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,370
So there's two Trone wrote
this Nigga gay as shit.

877
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,580
He could say he's non numeric or whatever,
but if you suck in Dick,

878
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:06,581
you gay as fuck the fuck kind of a
name is DJ dad now DJ dad mouth Bro.

879
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,980
The fuck. Also. He's mad corny,

880
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:14,210
but really thinks he's really fly with
that dead squirrel around his rusty ass.

881
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:17,270
Nick.
This is what hip hop has turned into.

882
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:21,110
We've let too many white people in and
now they've brought that weird shit.

883
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,670
There you go. That's the best thing
that I've read all day. Donald Trump,

884
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:27,740
the hip hop world.
You've ruined it.

885
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,600
The fact that this dude thinks that
this is a real Dj. It's really,

886
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:35,380
really fantastic. That's
it. Yeah. It's just, it's

887
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,040
like he can't pick up on the irony of
bad jewelry or for all the crazy stuff

888
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:45,280
you're saying. Or the fact that you're a
standup comic who was really well known.

889
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:49,490
Well, I just think it's great that
he's like, just is ruin in hip hop

890
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,880
Tony Mann and agree with them though.
I think Dj dad mouth is ruining hip hop.

891
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,230
Here's an email that came in.

892
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:01,580
I've been listening to the classic
jeans and much to my dismay I found out

893
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:06,260
during a, would you rather it turns out,
mommy, Tina is the water champ. The,

894
00:59:06,261 --> 00:59:10,310
would you rather consistent of eating a
week's worth of your bathroom trash? Um,

895
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,720
or being or only being able to bathe
once a month and then having a drink.

896
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:16,520
The bath water. Mommy, Tommy,

897
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:20,810
much like a true Barry chose to eat the
trash you floss and all but mommy, Tommy,

898
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,640
mommy, Tina, like the true water champ.

899
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:26,900
She is took drinking the dirty ass
bath water like a true champion.

900
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,830
Love you all. Please come back to
go bananas and do a live podcasts.

901
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,580
Keeping them high and tight.
My big words Dan.

902
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,650
Thank you Dan.
Sounds like you are not smart.

903
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,660
So let's move it along.
Damn.

904
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,510
Thank you for being a real champion fan.
Thank you. Jeans. Do you remember this?

905
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,590
This is in our breakdown. Oh
my God. Christina p fan site.

906
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,320
That's like one of the
first websites ever made.

907
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:59,350
It's got that real html kind of build
this website someone made back in my road

908
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,550
rules. It's 20 years old and they
still put, they keep it up. Sweet.

909
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:09,550
Uh, this is the only the one and
only true dedicated Christina piece.

910
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:14,030
I can Christina piece,
thankful for being rescued.

911
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:20,600
This nice person put together this site.
They took photographs of the television.

912
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:23,540
That's how old it says, and
they, uh, they put it up.

913
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,150
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention again,

914
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:29,450
after joining us in the
breakdown. I didn't know I
couldn't do that. Now you can.

915
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:33,740
It's silly. It's, it's really sweet
at that person kept it up this long.

916
01:00:33,741 --> 01:00:36,950
I'm really,
it's an angel fire website to hard core,

917
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,550
hard fucking card fucking core.

918
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,200
That was a very fat are flattering and
there's a guest book there where people

919
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:49,130
would write things is before comments.
Yeah.

920
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,130
Really great old school guys.

921
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:55,580
You know what's really crazy
is that there's generations,

922
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:59,900
there's like people that were children
watching me on road rules now who they

923
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:03,290
came out to my shows and I'll be like,
I've been watching you since I was a kid.

924
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,520
Like, oh no. I don't know if I
like that. I mean I'm thankful,

925
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:11,420
but we're thankful that you did it.
No,

926
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:14,180
I'm thankful that they've
followed me for so many years,

927
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:17,680
but it makes me feel really old.
How fucking old am I?

928
01:01:17,681 --> 01:01:22,350
I'm only 40 how are you a child? When
you started watching me, I'll know

929
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,940
somebody wrote about Lion Tina.
He said, how long do we have?

930
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Do we give it until Tina says she saw
Cuba Gooding jr break up a fight in New

931
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,020
York City. Chris, I saw that.
That's so funny. That is funny.

932
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,170
I saw it in San Francisco.
So fucking fun.

933
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,240
It's funny for you time waiting on
the Tom versus burr psycho debate.

934
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,180
He says, Tom is hundred 50% more
psycho than bill. Thank you.

935
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,400
First, let's be clear. Tom Is definitely
the water champ and stuff like that,

936
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,780
but laughing your buns off to a guy's
reaction to getting his legs crushed by a

937
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:06,920
car is Ted Bundy level craziness.
So Christina,

938
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,730
I'm with you on this phone.

939
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,700
Tom Has that blood loss boiling up inside
and needs to go hunting with powerful

940
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:18,701
Joe Rogan to release all that before the
body starts piling up bigger than the

941
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:20,180
poop

942
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,360
pile. Thanks for being awesome and
helping me when I'm feeling bad.

943
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:28,770
You guys are a fun couple of peace
and love. Daniel Daniel, finally.

944
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,070
Thank you. I appreciate that.
You're absolutely right.

945
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,450
My husband is a murderous lunatic
who needs to get that side out

946
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,270
just for a little, uh,
balance here. Another email.

947
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:41,490
I've listened to burrs
podcasts for a while.

948
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,040
It's actually how I got
turned onto your mom's house.

949
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:48,060
It takes about five minutes of
listening to that show to realize what a

950
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,350
psychopath bill really is.
Tom is not even close to that level.

951
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:57,270
J fizzle. Jay, you seem like a
really, really sharp guy and uh,

952
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,440
I'm 100% in agreement with you.
He is out of his fucking mind.

953
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,850
So, um, somebody wrote, uh,

954
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,913
what did they say here?

955
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:12,750
Couldn't help but notice
the Mousse spotting noise
that hunter made and a great

956
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:13,260
idea.

957
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,120
Could this sound be in the rotation of
chips in a bowl and the cat cat eating

958
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:18,970
which sound

959
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:23,890
sorry. When he goes to us and I think
right before the glass, you know?

960
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,340
Yeah. Like he's, he's like, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

961
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,630
Can we get so excited? What was the
other one we talked about this morning?

962
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,520
The guy was super stoked. Oh, ego's
so big bite. Oh really big, bad.

963
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:42,000
Not a bad buy. Got a bad boy. You
got a bad back about. Bye Bye.

964
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:47,270
Bye. [inaudible]. Just
glad that must've been.

965
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:52,210
It was amazing.
Just because it's such a dad boner,

966
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,340
she's going to go down right there.
No way

967
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:07,660
ever seen him lose come down.
I quick. Oh No. Oh my God.

968
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,590
I was raised.
That is awesome.

969
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:14,900
Oh my God. So much joy. I just love
that guy's an enthusiasm. Yeah.

970
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,430
Uh,
I think this is right.

971
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:22,490
Yeah,
good suggestion.

972
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:26,923
I love it.

973
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:34,000
Great idea. It just
glass, which is classic.

974
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,360
Just glassing look,
go to bad boy.

975
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,990
I go to bed slipping along here,

976
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:47,020

977
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,760
yeah,

978
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,670
What should I call it? Sound
sure. Whatever. Yo you remember,

979
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:02,230

Good for him with a life

985
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,380
It's a ball. I'm like, no,
it's a cow. A cow. Right there.

986
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,830
That is just a really good idea.
Yeah, it's fine. We sent that in.

987
01:05:36,831 --> 01:05:41,830
I got to give him credit. Good
suggestion bro. Nice. Nice set man. Um,

988
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:46,820
let's see. The idea
came from mommy. Austin.

989
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:50,510
Thank you mommy. Austin.
Yeah. Really good man. Oh,

990
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:56,170
Mommy's is a watch. Patrion number
seven. It looks to me like mommy.

991
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:59,300
Tina is sabotaging Tommy's hydration.

992
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:04,250
She sits there with an open lacroix,
the choir next to her,

993
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:09,110
yet she was drinking Tom's Perrier,
I call fuckery. If you see something,

994
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:11,580
say something Sean.
Well that,

995
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:15,890
that brings to our attention that Patriot
has been off the fucking chain lately

996
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,930
and it's been really fun.
It really has been. So, um,

997
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,960
first of all,
thank you Shawn.

998
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:26,450
And she does pull a lot of bull show
said when it comes to hydration,

999
01:06:26,451 --> 01:06:30,860
whenever dudes, um, I have my
things I can flash is not cool.

1000
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:35,180
She doesn't share and she's
selfish and that's just, you know,

1001
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,660
that's just kind of what I have
to deal with. So there you go.

1002
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:44,210
Happy anniversary, Tom. Happy
Anniversary. Now, you know,

1003
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,830
look,
I gave you the guys,

1004
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:52,530
sometimes you give me the eye
roll, which we learned. Oh,

1005
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:56,510
contempt is content and we saw
a documentary or a therapist,

1006
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:59,840
a marriage therapist said if,
if that's a sign of contempt,

1007
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:01,600
if you see that and contented,

1008
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:04,640
that song of bad content means
you're going to divorce. I said,

1009
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:07,940
that's a huge indicator of divorce.
It's contempt. Yeah. And you went

1010
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:12,220
and sometimes you give me a triple I roll.

1011
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,660
I don't give you triple,
quadruple.

1012
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,300
You do eye rolls on it like you
don't do I rolls. Yeah. Oh my God.

1013
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:24,650
You have so much contact
or I wrote so much. Really?

1014
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:30,690
Yeah. I had this clip from your, um,
show that you were at last week. Okay.

1015
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:37,280
I can videos post videos on Facebook,
but this is for you because the last time,

1016
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,970
but the video was posted. You was
meant open up my place. No such thing.

1017
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:43,280
I'll wait if you twice
and I was Eric in today.

1018
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:47,440
Were you asked to meet me and were
arguing? I do show my niche. You and I,

1019
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:50,120
lesbian crew is not here.
No one's here.

1020
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,320
There you go. Okay. I love that
it's actually that the gypsy, um,

1021
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:59,450
calling out videos for fights has
expanded to women. I didn't really,

1022
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:04,400
that's what this was. I didn't know
that there is a bunch of Gypsies,

1023
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:07,190
which you openly are racist against.
Oh,

1024
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,190
that Roma Keith [inaudible]. Yeah. Yeah.

1025
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,390
Everybody hates the Gypsies.
We know that.

1026
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:19,140
And so that's what she's
squatters. They're squatters. Yeah.

1027
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,250
They are squatting or Gypsies.

1028
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,350
I didn't know that's what she's calling
out the bitch for not being there again.

1029
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,660
She's like a bitch. Just like
the dude's dude. You know,
the dudes are like, bye. Oh,

1030
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:33,230
phobia. But now there's a woman. The
woman makes it way more exciting.

1031
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,160
Why more a woman fighting is
more excited only in that you go,

1032
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:41,540
this is such a departure from
the norm. Yes, of course.

1033
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:44,150
It's bizarre when a woman
fights physically. Uh,

1034
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,650
but why works or that's from the Gypsy
show. That is right. I think she just,

1035
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:53,330
she's got way worse. Uh, so
very interesting. So this is a,

1036
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,380
an English gypsy. It's, it looks,

1037
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,203
yeah.

1038
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,560
Yeah. They're kind of, they're good,
but her outfits good. I like her.

1039
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,230
I think she's dressed in a little
too nicely for a, for a fight.

1040
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,310
I wouldn't wear white to a fight.
It's going to get red. Yeah.

1041
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:22,680
Whether you win or lose. And it's
also, it's kind of tracksuit, isn't it?

1042
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:27,160
This is zip up her cruise.
All right though, man. There.
Okay. Good looking moms.

1043
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:32,100
Yeah. I don't know about that.
Women fighting is bizarro.

1044
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:36,350
I guess we're not, I'm not
even like everyone else. Yeah.

1045
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:40,530
When it was really slow in the MMA

1046
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,170
and Mama, it was my low ascension
and then they got a superstar to her,

1047
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,100
which she helped the business of female
fighting really grow, you know? Yes.

1048
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,610
But I remember when it first
started, people were like, no,

1049
01:09:53,611 --> 01:09:55,620
I don't want to fucking see
the appointment fight now.

1050
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:59,280
Now it's become a thing where people are
just as excited to see people want to

1051
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:03,000
see stars. They want to see high level.
If you can get some higher level fighters,

1052
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:08,550
female tennis players on the streets.
When two women fight, it's like,

1053
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:13,260
yeah, but can I tell? Yes.
Having grown up here, um,

1054
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,420
I actually saw more girl fights and I did.

1055
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:18,840
Dude fights between gang
bangers and public school.

1056
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:23,100
Like the Cholos would get real like Cholos
get 100 and fucking and fighting each

1057
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:27,870
other way. Way More. Wymore all you had
to dudes I saw. Oh yeah the girls. Yeah.

1058
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,690
Oh Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. She's going to
get why works or why? Why bars her?

1059
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,690
Cause she's calling them out just like
the dude's do on this. Oh here's the pub.

1060
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,790
I'm going to fucking
fuck. Fuck you up. Yeah.

1061
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:41,123
Oh

1062
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,320
cause she was there last night

1063
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:53,550
cause she just low lights and you can't
get shit cause you have rich millionaire

1064
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,920
mum. Dad Won't give you
bread. As a matter of fact,

1065
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:57,990
he makes you get peaks
or on Christmas Day.

1066
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,900
Yeah.
First of all,

1067
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:07,170
this first bitch that came up a lot.
She was intense.

1068
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:16,020
Gypsy look though, that's how they
rock it. You know the hair. Yeah.

1069
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,600
I just thought that other lady was
like a soccer mom but she's a real,

1070
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,990
she's a real ne Romany shale.
I'm a Romney jail.

1071
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,370
She's got to yeah, totally perfect smile.
Perfect. Perfect smiles in right there.

1072
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:33,330
See She, she put it in right.
But I'm making the video.

1073
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,980
How long [inaudible]
miles out and put them up.

1074
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:38,814
There we go.

1075
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:46,840
There you go. Perfect smile. Um Man,

Worry took our money out.

1083

1084
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:21,920
Her voice is like pills,

Acio lifestyle. Yeah.

1086
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:28,670
A lot of hard booze and hard
liberal party all fucking day. Yeah,

1087
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:33,340
I do a fuck about shit. Shit. Shit. Sorry.

1088
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,180
Jeez man.
These broads got a lot of time.

1089
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,750
Who's got that kind of time to
call out fights with people?

1090
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:42,960
I mean you really got to
have no life and Jesus,

1091
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,170
you know what I was going to fuck her
is that we're doing right now furniture

1092
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:50,790
shopping. You really are, is it
is right. It stressing me out.

1093
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,460
Well, it's just one of
those things where you don't

1094
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:57,520
think about it, that you're, when you
move, sometimes you go like, oh yeah,

1095
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,730
if I don't get something this room,
we'll just stay on.

1096
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:04,830
I know. And you know what, we, we really
don't have a lot of furniture. Oh yeah.

1097
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,960
We've lived on anything
really small apartments. Yeah.

1098
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:13,560
So when you move into a house,
you're like, oh, there's
nothing for this house. No.

1099
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,860
And we also buy like frat boy
furniture. We have, um, electric.

1100
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,960
Uh, what are those called
to the recliner chairs.

1101
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,150
Like here's how bad we were
with the folders. Crusher

1102
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,030
told us that it was a

1103
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,730
frat boy chair. Well, you have Burt
going like, Hey, uh, some of your chair.

1104
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,910
Yeah. Frat. That's,
you know, you're, well,

1105
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:41,120
the problem with you and I is that
we like comfort over fashion. I know.

1106
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:44,340
Pricers fat. I know. So, you know,

1107
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,150
I can't fucking say I can't buy something
that I can't use. It makes me crazy.

1108
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:52,560
It's true. It's such a bummer.
Yeah, it is. It's such a bummer.

1109
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:57,570
I like the perfect smile. I just want
it to be set up. I know jeans, it's all,

1110
01:13:57,571 --> 01:14:01,920
you know. I know you get, you want
everything to be done and I know that,

1111
01:14:01,921 --> 01:14:05,250
but it takes a little time. I got to
call this fucking asshole now too.

1112
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:09,920
I just remind you, you fucking asshole.
The baby's safety gate people. I know.

1113
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,220

sucks. Dude is moving. Listen,

1114

moving point blank period.

1115
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,760
Point blank period is get your life and
you suck it up and it just sucks for

1116
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:27,370
like a month, dude. I'm saying. You know
what I'm saying? No, what you're saying.
