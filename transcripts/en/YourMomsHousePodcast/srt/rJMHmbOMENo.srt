Oh, okay. Here we go.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,640
Welcome to another episode
of Your Mom's house.

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,090
I am the water god Tom Cigarette

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,120

I'll tell you what I think
is going on with our tower.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,250
Tell me the pool guys are in the
breakers because they need to fix.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,920
I strike and I think they're hitting the
breakers. You're probably right. Yeah,

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,100
that's what happened last time.
Jeans. You had a big one coming up.

16
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:20,240
Why don't you tell everybody
this weekend I'm in Washington.

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,280
Dick come December 9th December
10th I'm only there for two days.

18
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:29,780
I'm only doing four shows Saturday
I the early I think is already gone.

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,340
I don't know. So get your darn tickets
now to those man is how it goes.

20
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,950
[inaudible] moves quick.
Yeah,

21
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:41,660
I've got some stuff lined up for 2017 but
I'm not announcing just yet, but okay.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,920
Shortly listen to that deep bro.
And that's it.

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,873
What about email?

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,620
Uh, December 13th, I'm at the Ice
House. It's a, it's almost sold out.

25
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,770
So if you're in the area in
Pasadena, you can get, get that.

26
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,890
I'm doing New Year's Eve.
I'm doing a whole bunch of shows,

27
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:01,570
Jr's niece in Orlando,
Orlando.

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,600
Uh, the new year's show. Just, I,

29
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:07,150
I feel like we have to say this every
year is more expensive because it's a

30
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:07,990
special event,

31
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,190
but I'm also there the day before
that and the day before that.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,200
So if you just want to come out to a
show in Orlando, come out. Otherwise,

33
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:21,970
a big fun night. We'll have on New
Year's Eve, Kansas City is on sale,

34
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,710
Oxnard, California. I'm doing levity
live there. That's in January.

35
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:30,850
And then the big tours starts with a,
a new horror liens,

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,680

clear Farder and Talla hustling.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,560
Clear fighter is probably
my favorite new names.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,010
We added shows in Portland,
Oregon.

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,920
We added a show in Chicago.

41
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,130
Yeah.
We added a third show in Miami.

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,990
Apolis well, I'll tell you all those
three cities, you name it, our mommy hubs.

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,700
Uh,

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,270

jamming. You would really love it.

55
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,950

I can't, there's a lot to do.

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,320
There's a very important
business. F a. R. T. Okay.

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,540
Oh, bus. Now with that fucking thing.

61
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,200
I said come here to call
you a pussy. Huh? Oh boy.

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,910
Don't bring anyone. Love it. Well,

63
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,320
go to your mom's house.
We're talking for

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,513
Christina.

65
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,763
Okay,

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,520
that's good guy. He

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,140
just walked away from the switch.

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,890
I just see the guy walking when I seen
him right now while we're waiting.

69
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,920
What is he doing?
He's the circuit breaker is there.

70
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:16,150
They're fixing the pool right now and
they need to turn off the power to get the

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,650
electrical. Believe me, I had the
same fucking shit happened last week.

72
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,540
We're doing this right now.
So it's kind of more, I mean,

73
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,300
can we tell him to not do that?
I have to stop everything.

74
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,210
Like we're in the middle of doing this.
All right. Do you want to tell him man?

75
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,750
Well, yeah, I mean go.
Tom Goes home. Alright,

76
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,490
so you just farted and then you
judged me for farting two seconds ago.

77
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,470
Here we are. Week two.
Okay. Of I'm fucking,

78
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,860
I can't believe you're calling the
kettle brown like that. You love,

79
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,070
I farted and you chastise me
fucking thing. What's wrong baby?

80
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,780
Let's talk about it. I
don't, it's just annoying.

81
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,300
That's all the constant stream of workers,

82
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,280
the interrupt our lives on a daily basis.

83
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,230
No fuck up our audio for
Venice to collegium plus
getting our work done. Those,

84
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
I don't like this guy at all.

85
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,590
What? What's that? I don't know.

86
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,740
Is he still fucking with that
breaker? No, no he's not.

87
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,710
That's what I'm telling you. It's not that
big. It's not that. Okay. There's just a,

88
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,620
there's new shit every time. So we have
a new monitor, uh, as you can tell,

89
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:22,000
it's a much bigger, much baker. My
way bigger. We were more excited.

90
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,400
We were excited that
it would, um, you know,

91
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,370
it could serve us as a great, um,
there you go. Dipped out again.

92
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,570
Pop back in again. It should be
fun. Can be a fun thing to do.

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,610
It's not that bad. It's not
that. Okay, so here it is.

94
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,440
Um,
now we,

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,800
we feed our video and audio via htmi
into this television and then the,

96
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,770
the television shoots back the audio
into this board. That's how it's working.

97
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,280
Um, I'm already preparing
for it not to work out.

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,150
That's about as exciting as the microphone
guy, the way you described. I know.

99
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,850
Hi,
I'm the Evie,

100
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:07,730
my guy that I almost blacked out.
You did right.

101
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:12,730
And you explain all that. God Damn
you're Schnitzel. I hear. Yeah.

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,300
Yup. I tickle it this way.
Oh look, I don't like it.

103
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,720
Oh, come on man. Yeah, he's
on. He's a pussy bitch.

104
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,930
Stupid idiot.
Cut out again.

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,660
Diamonds into the crevice stage per se.

106
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,790
I like the guy. I don't like
that. Our feed just keeps
cutting out. I don't either.

107
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,790
Yeah, so that's cool.
Does it affect audio?

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,010
Does it make a yeah, you hear
it? Of course. When you hear it,

109
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:46,320
when you hear a pop here or they hear
it pop there and sound studio. Yeah,

110
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,720
of course.
Cheese should be fun.

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,160
So I feel like just setting this
room on fire right now. Should we,

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,020
should we have blue band and come back
and fix the horse before we continue

113
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:00,420
recording this? I don't think
you can fix this. No, no, no, no.

114
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:03,580
He can't fix it like that.
Who can fix this? Um,

115
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,350
I'm probably gonna have to
get an entirely new monitor.

116
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,910
And I'm going to have to
use that for something else.

117
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,130
Well then should we just do audio
clips today so that we don't have to go

118
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:20,790
through the aggravation of the visual
being fucked up? I Dunno. We'll see.

119
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,900
We'll see.
Let's see if you can

120
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,460
goals. I said bring your
ass. Come come here, bitch.

121
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,770
Come when you're a bitch. You're
on his finger. Yeah. I don't know.

122
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,030
But it's like a ring,

123
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,820
right? It has to like bands.
Right. And then it, it's pointed.

124
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,450
It was like a coke nail,
but it's supposed to tickler.

125
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,460
It's not because if you take old mine.
Yeah. At that point he metal thing.

126
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,070
It would scrape and hurt my,

127
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,950
how do you know it might be you've
never had them do it. That guy.

128
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:54,240
It could be good at it, you know? I
don't think so. I took it this way. No,

129
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,800
thank you. Oh, what was wrong with him?

130
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,590
Who does this turn on exam?
You Pussy Bitch.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,590
He's really selling it.
Yeah. Oh, the crab a stage.

132
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,160
I liked the end. That's,
that's really great.

133
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,520
Damn ins in the crevice of your books.
Say

134
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,540
I said, bring your ass.
Come, come here, bitch.

135
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,070
Bitchy tickling.

136
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,660
Yeah. Yeah. That guy is not into,

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,150
because that is,
I feel like a somebody that's just,

138
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,370
it's more relaxed. No. Well,
the glass is a dad. Yeah.

139
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,470
This guy is deaf,
but you might have multiple children,

140
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,990
but daddy,
he's not a dad.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,970
He's not the kind of guy that
starts off his day with lunch.

142
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,350
Oh my God. What a crazy
week it's been. Huh? I know.

143
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:02,440
Oh my God. Oh, but before we forget,

144
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,950
if you're going to do your Christmas

155
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,920
Sincere Phallic. Oh, I'm going to throw up

156
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
at least he really likes it. He does it.

157
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,650
He's not that bad. I think the Vegan
Vagina guys, way worser this guys.

158
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,080
He's actually cute. He's attractive. This
guy going to vagina. Dude is is gnarly,

159
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:23,550
gnarly, gnarly, gross fucking
guy. Yeah, he ain't got no teeth.

160
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,040
He bobs his fucking teeth out as nasty.
It's so nasty. He needs a perfect smile.

161
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,240
And then maybe I would get on board this
guy or that guy? No, Vegan Vagina. Vagina.

162
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,810
Yeah, he's just, he's gross. See,

163
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,520
but what's the difference between Vegan
Vagina and like this guy? It's the same.

164
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,430
Well, here's the thing. This guy is
all about sex. He's just a sex maniac,

165
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,890
right?
He bought a ring just to tickle post.

166
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:49,950
He's with a ticket plus Vegan Vagina.

167
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:53,980
Guy Is using like he's using sex for

168
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,200
his real cause, which
is Vegan Ism. How boy.

169
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,670
And he's a gross dude.
Like aesthetically,

170
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,960
he's much grosser, you
know. Facially, you know,

171
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:09,280
Shit like this guy is just more visually
appealing. He's got his shit together.

172
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:13,190
Like he's got to look. Yeah. This guy
like he has, he's put together, he's,

173
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,790
he wishes he was Tupac. You
know, he's got even the,

174
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,810
the Bandanna on nice teeth

175
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,510
and he can sing.
He can sing

176
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,540
diamonds in the crevice stage.

177
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,163
I saw

178
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,120
the crevice of your posts. Say he
said, what? Was it weird though?

179
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:44,080
He said like diamonds in the crevassed.
Did you say d? That's what I keep hearing.

180
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,590
They're crevassed right.

181
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,710
Diamonds in the crab stage.

182
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,930
Correct. In the crevice.
Maybe he meant to say crest

183
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,750
crevassed
put

184
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,350
into the ad and the em on your purse.

185
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,840
I was in, um, breastbone beach,

186
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,200
West Harry Paul was Harry bomb
for shows electric. So fun.

187
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,910
A lot of mommies, lot
of mommies, big crowds.

188
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,860
Fun Crowds out.
First of all,

189
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,530
how has your eating since you're on
this diet to lose weight? Didn't really,

190
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,010
well I did. I had a, I
didn't have any food, um,

191
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,980
fall offs the whole weekend. It's very
hard on the road. It's hard on the road,

192
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:40,230
but I was, I stuck to it. Um,

193
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,850
I did have two vodka sodas.
It's nothing.

194
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,140
And, um, it's not, it's not good if
you're trying to stay in Ketosis,

195
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,150
but you know, whatever it happened. I'm
sure it's many less than Bertrand had.

196
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,760
That's why he had for breakfast today.
Oh yeah. I don't want to give away any,

197
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:03,840
I only get what? I lost a couple more
pounds. I would say more than a couple.

198
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:08,180
You're looking, well, I'm saying her
last week, I'm down a couple more. Yeah.

199
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,030
I don't know. I, I love these
team, Burt losers that like,

200
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,600
they believe in that bloated
carcass and the, and they're like,

201
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,630
boots going to do it. It's just,
I use it as motivation. Yeah.

202
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,580
Haters gonna hate. Oh yeah. And
they're all like, all his fans,

203
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,200

Burt are such fucking Zeros. You know,

204
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,450
like you look at their
profiles, you're like, oh,

205
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:33,950
I guess they're just kind of drawn
to their own type, you know? Wow.

206
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,950
Such fucking Zilch is put them on
blast like that. Well, you know,

207
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,520
I think they know who they are. They're,
they're attracted to their kind, you know,

208
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,950
and then like mine, like the people on
team Tom, they're like, oh, you know, I,

different. Show me your
friends. I'll show your future.

211
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,630
Yeah. You want to know you're a fucking
loser. Fucking losers. Fucking bums.

212
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,890
You're hanging around all
day, right? Yeah. Your,

213
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,870
your followers don't hang out with
bumps. Answers. No. Good for you.

214
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,360

you switch glass glue. Yeah. Oh, here.

218
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,850
I know you play the whole
thing. This whole thing. Yeah.

219
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,290
It's the best key row here.

220
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,090
Expecting to see the mousses.
Gotcha.

221
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,620
Awesome.
Right?

222
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,260

223
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,500

You want to like see his whole thing was
like, wait, okay, hold on. That's so fun.

225
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,210
He makes me so happy. That was
good. It's just time. Time.

226
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,570
Hmm. That's not what I
meant the way. I love that.

227
00:15:57,571 --> 00:16:01,240
That was on deck though.
Yeah. Well that's uh, no.

228
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,470
The having this cord like
replace the other one is,

229
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:09,090
is what's changing everything.
That's what it is. That's a problem.

230
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,860
That's what we're going to have to
change this eventually. Just glass glass.

231
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,750
Glassing I look how thin I wasn't in this
photo and I thought I was a fat load.

232
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:23,520
Their God. Damn. And then I had a
kid. It stretches all your shit out,

were a fat load there. Yeah.

235
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:33,540
Look how flat my belly flab
minus how many years ago is that?

236
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,970

moved to ride know. Yeah,

239
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:46,530
I remember that girl did it and touring.
No Way.

240
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,750

his cool down that quick. Oh,

241
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,420
oh. Which I was raised. Just awesome.

242
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,050
Do you think Joe Rogan would hang out
with that guy? Definitely 100% yeah.

243
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,050
He would love to.
Yeah.

244
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,380
We got out here are really,
and look at the truck at the metal.

245
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,160
This is why this is what came up here.

246
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,260
We've been slipping along this thing.
Huge battle, big, long, tall meadow.

247
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,880
We'd been slipping along here,
just glass and just glass and glass.

248
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,140
All of a sudden you put my
head down. I'm like, oh,

249
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:34,070
we're just glad to be with him.
That's so fucking stupid.

250
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,080
It is fun. He is like, it makes me happy.
It makes me happy. Let's just keep going.

251
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,810
Let's glass. Let's class. Let's
glass glass. I'm like, holy smokes.

252
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,950
And I'm like, Oh man, it's a ball. It's
a bull that I'm like, no, it's a cow. A

253
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,290
cow right there. She sees so
stoked. I know. He's really stoked.

254
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,680
I've never been asked or
talked about anything.

255
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,330
I don't even think when I told
you I was pregnant, you're like,

256
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,130
I was pretty excited last
we'd been slipping along here.

257
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,950
Just glass and just glass and glass.
We're just glassing. It looks glass.

258
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,360
Let's glass glass. I bless
it. I'm like, that's amazing.

259
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,440
I've been loving the
hashtags. Just glassine. Yeah,

260
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,910
that hashtags glass and look at it.
Oh, you see how it's safe? Yeah,

261
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,660
there's a file for it. She
called Dad Boehner. Moose hunts.

262
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,270
That's a good name for
it to dad. Huh? Huh.

263
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,650
That's neat.
Well good.

264
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,210
So your weight loss has been
really kicking in high gear.

265
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:39,980
He's been great in glasses.
Yeah. Ben Glass and hard.
And I'm hot in those mousses.

266
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,920
Yeah, yeah. Thank you. See
any moose. But then you did,

267
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,090
I didn't think I did and I then I was
like, is that a bull and was a cow?

268
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,430
And I was like, Oh shit.
Oh I lost my mind. Yeah.

269
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,130
You know what's great about you and I
really admire the most is that you're so

270
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:57,450
dedicated to this diet. Yeah.
And I went to whole farts.

271
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,770
So this was so mean to you.
Cause I know you're dedicated.

272
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:06,150
You haven't had a sweet treat. I had
like Thanksgiving, we all had, I had,

273
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,510
I had a couple of pieces of Pumpkin
Pie. Right. But that's not, you know,

274
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,560
that's not going to break it.

275
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,290
That's the only time you've been
bad this whole fucking time.

276
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,370
You've been so good. And so I thought,
I buy you a whole farts chocolate.

277
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:18,750
I got one on the primal diet,

278
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:24,050
it's primal friendly and it's no sugar
and it's only has a coconut oil in it.

279
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,890
What it tastes like.

280
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,630
No you're not, you're not
getting into it. So you go, oh,

281
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:32,350
you got to try this chocolate.
And I go, I can't, I can't
have it. And you go, no, no,

282
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:36,400
no. I, I um, it's, is
Paleo and Keto friendly.

283
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,320
I checked and I go, you sure? So I was
like really trying to be good. Yeah. Go.

284
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:44,110
Yeah. Yeah. You go look,
just, just try a little bite.

285
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,330
Okay.

286
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
And I put it in my mouth and I actually
thought you put a piece of dog food in

287
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:54,820
my mouth. It was the most fucking
disgusting thing I've ever had.

288
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,140
And you were thrilled. Well,
cause I actually shoot and then I,

289
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,730
I not only did I spit it out,
I spent time just,

290
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,670
yeah.

291
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,210
Spitting and washing out my mouth for
a couple of minutes because it was so

292
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:10,630
disgusting.
It tasted like something you would

293
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,170
bake with. Yeah. It's like
baking chocolate or something,
you know, in the Ra.

294
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,230
It's like when they said no sugar,
they met no fucking sugar.

295
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,500
It just tasted like a hunk of dirt
out of the earth. Yeah. It was really,

296
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,910
shit was so damn nasty and I was so
excited to have a treat on my fucking diet

297
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:27,080
too.
And that primal thing.

298
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,280
Did she tell you about this or you
just happened to stumble bum? No,

299
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,780
it's on the list of things I can
have. Yeah, and so I thought, oh,

300
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,300
this will be exciting.
I'm a primal chocolate or whatever,

301
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:39,350
and it just tasted like such shit. Yeah.
That's the thing. When you're on a diet,

302
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,740
it's like not even worth it. You're
like, yeah, fuck it. I want to,

303
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,860
I just don't eat because I'm so miserable.
But the idea of eating,

304
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,890
eating so depressing now that I'm like,

305
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,240
once you get really, really into
your diet, then what happens is,

306
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,560
I dunno, you're almost, don't you? You
look forward to saying no to things.

307
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,910
You know what I mean? You look forward
to not indulging in things. You're like,

308
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,500
well, it'll be exciting
to not enjoy things today.

309
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,800
That's how it feels when
you break the rules.

310
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,740
You just know that you're fucking
yourself setting yourself back. Yeah.

311
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,730
So you're like, oh man, it's going to be
so good to not enjoy stuff today. Yeah,

312
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,510
yeah, yeah. I hear. Yeah, true man. Um,

313
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,370
I'm glad you liked that chocolate.
I'm going to get more for you.

314
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,040
So obviously you remember
the biggest nerd ever.

315
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,190
I got to show you this glass
and guy. Uh, no, this is fine.

316
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,820
Point of order. Yeah, Dude.

317
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:29,510
Fuck her for a signature golf Europe,

318
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,190
my friend and her speech.

319
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,730
But I heard her to say a word that I
know is distinctly on parliamentary and I

320
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:40,190
think she may want to withdraw it.
The word was f a r t

321
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,280
nerd. Yeah. Big fucking nerd down nerd.

322
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,230
So her name,

323
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,350
her name is Elizabeth
May and I guess, and, uh,

324
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,320
some of the Canadian circles and you know,
politics. She's, she's known up there.

325
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,420
Apparently she did this, um,
speech, um, at some event,

326
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,770
maybe a year or two ago,
and she got drunk.

327
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,870
So the ladies who's against
saying F A R queries.

328
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,320
Okay.

329
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,490
Is now God damn it. I'm really
going to lose my mind. I know.

330
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,870
Why don't you just not play the visual
for this episode? These are visual.

331
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,490
They're visual drops.
Okay.

332
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,803
Okay.

333
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,560
So this is, um, let me see,

334
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,710
I got to write that down.
32 goddammit.

335
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,290
F A R. T. S. A. R. T.

336
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,360
I like how she had to spell
it out like a fucking yeah,

337
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,760
Todd and says Perry Belgard is here.

338
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,820
I want to mention we stand on
his traditional territory too.

339
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,240
And I want to say like
what the fuck was wrong?

340
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,520
That's a view you didn't notice where
standing on traditional territory.

341
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,050
Like what doesn't scream out
first nations about this stage.

342
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,430
Oh she said F U C K

343
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,970
pose the f a r. T. That is the
worst word in the English language.

344
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,700
You can and you noticed that there
wasn't like big laughs or anything.

345
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:08,200
She didn't even realize
they weren't having,

346
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,820
cause this is obviously like some type
of gala, so kind of nerd event. Yeah.

347
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:16,050
But I mean, she's wearing pearls and
know people are, it's black times saying,

348
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:17,280
you know, oh, she got her gown.

349
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,810
Maybe just like be with humans.

350
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,150
But the thing is now we know
that's not true. He can do funny.

351
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,340
He can do music and he still
doesn't show up. I don't get it.

352
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:33,840
I really don't. I mean he should be
here. That's what prime ministers do.

353
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:37,410
They show up to be humiliated
like the rest of us schmucks.

354
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,680
Wow. Yeah, so she's kind of Loosey Goosey.
She had a couple enter. That's a problem.

355
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,230
She needs to get drunk before
she goes to parliament. Oh Shit.

356
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,020
Should could be like f a

357
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,780
r. T I want you to suck on this.
T. I. T. S. Yeah, that's right.

358
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm the oldest one.
I think you know this,

359
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:56,870
but I'm also the only leader with
artificial parts. You do know this?

360
00:23:56,871 --> 00:24:01,250
I don't mean my boobs. I mean my hips.
Oh my God. My hips are both artificial.

361
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,410
Right side has a consumer
malfunction park.

362
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,800
The security guards [inaudible]
you can tell them I squeak.

363
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,720
I walked through the floors to parliament
and the guards have told me it matter

364
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:20,170
may you can not sneak up on anyone because
this is a part they don't use anymore

365
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,080
because it squeaks.

366
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,480
I thought she was about to say your
pussy squeaks. Oh, I like that.

367
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,020
It goes some days like a
chirping grasp popper. God,

368
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,090
the grass plays like a really
bad squeaky screen door.

369
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm not kidding you.
Some of you know this is true.

370
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,543
I love it,

371
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,280
but the thing is I'm the only woman party
leader and I know what men immediately

372
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,370
sank because the poor boys,

373
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,210
they really bought into fried that whole
sexual maturation thing on the Friday

374
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:04,300
and scale and we go from the oral.

375
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:08,850
I'm not going to eat the mic into my God,
the anal got it.

376
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,690
I want to think about it or the genital.

377
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,170
Wow.
I can't believe this is her know.

378
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,450
Isn't it interesting like we were just
talking about this yesterday when you

379
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,170
have a couple Enya who you become.

380
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:27,310
It's really telling about how much
we're holding back when you're not lit.

381
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,470
And so if you're, if you're like this
when you drink, she's repressing soul,

382
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,140
right? Honorable member for us.
If offended by Fart, you're rough.

383
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,690
My friend in her speech,

384
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,200
but I heard her to say a word that I
know is distinctly on parliamentary and I

385
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:46,760
think she may want to withdraw it.

386
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,800
The word was f a r t thing is
I'm the only woman party leader.

387
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,200
And I know what men immediately
think because the poor boys,

388
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,510
they really bought into Freud.

389
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,340
That whole sexual maturation thing on
the guys get stuck on this Friday and

390
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:08,340
stuff.

391
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,340
So they immediately soon that I'm envious
of the things that boys have that I

392
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,270
don't have.

393
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,710
They assumed that I suffer from
classical Friday and dip bait envy.

394
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,640
But I know logger praise
the Lord free at last.

395
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,820
And she's like, they're not giving
her big lab. No, she's bombing.

396
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,170
This is called bombing in our business.
She's eating a fucking Dick Sandwich.

397
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,500
But isn't it interesting that
this is who she wants to be?

398
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,280
The woman that says crazy things.

399
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,700
And so when someone else does an
in parliament maybe that upset her.

400
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,080
I want to say f a r t and then she,
you know chastises the other does not.

401
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,560
Interesting.
T F a r t

402
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,690
lately deranged and not,
there is no sequitur.

403
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,060
This is a non sequitur.

404
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Ever wake up with old theme songs from
former black and white TV shows that you

405
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:13,150
never thought your kids would ever see
and they're running through your head

406
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,930
like every now and then I wake
up, they got hydrate. Lisa.

407
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:21,190
I don't thinking about horses.
A horse of course. Of course.

408
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,980
This morning I wake up thinking this,

409
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,260
oh my God,
what do you,

410
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,830
what would you describe her eyes as?
She ripped.

411
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,220
No, but look at her eyes.
They're what? They're kind of,

412
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,480
they are kind of glass,
right?

413
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah man.

414
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,740
Hang on, hang on. Wait, no. What

415
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,130
they're trying to walk her off. Dan
is embarrassing. Yeah. Wow. Well,

416
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:01,070
well isn't this interesting?
The one who's a tattle tale,

417
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,040
a little tattletale has the most shit
going on. That's always how it is. Shit.

418
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:10,960
Face it ladies. There's also, if
she was cool, like if may was like,

419
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,790
oh,
people like her and cool,

420
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,060
this lady would come on and be
laughing with her instead. She's like,

421
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,530
get off the fuck off.
Yeah.

422
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,440
Just like Ted Haggard and all of these
people that were here, the gaze. Yup.

423
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,600
They've always got some secret
thing going on. Of course.

424
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,740
So repressed this poor woman.
Wow.

425
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,820
Welcome back Kotter.
Which spells k h a d welcome.

426
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,610
They're drag.
She's being okay if you're not watching,

427
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:46,530
this lady is forcibly
removing her from the stage.

428
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,970
Like it's, you know, when like someone's
done something it cringeworthy.

429
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,220
That's the way it's being.
It's embarrassing. I wish
I knew more about her.

430
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,810
If I was more into Canadian politics,
I would know exactly Katie.

431
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,380
I mean we have good politicians,
interesting ones, interesting ones,

432
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,140
interesting ones. But the Canadians,
I think I'm much more interesting.

433
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,040
Remember the mayor of Toronto? What
was his name? Oh, Rob Ford. Is he dead?

434
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:15,540
He's dead. He was interesting.
Interesting is a spin on maybe rob Ford.

435
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,420
I don't know. I wasn't
with May. Interesting

436
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,730
prime minister too though.
I think he's a cool dude.

437
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,500
I mean he looks like you might
want to start training with him.

438
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,500
Have you seen that bod? He's
regular bodied. No, he's not.

439
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,490
What is e Trudeau? Let's look at him.
Oh, hey. You can look at them all night.

440
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:40,920
You're going to probably put them on your
phone and look at them when you're in

441
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:41,754
the,

442
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,270
he's got more class in my whole
fucking cabinet. Thank you. Wow.

443
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,920
An effing again, I think again. And
look how unamused this lady is here.

444
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:57,660
Let me pull them up for you. Don't look
on your phone. I'll pull it up. Please do.

445
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,720
I'm trying to tell you, man. Wow. This
is like the Canadian Kennedy of course.

446
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,920
I super cute. I thought you
knew this. Like the Ryan
Gosling of a prime ministers.

447
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:09,460
This one. You didn't know this
about him. I listened to MPR.

448
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,860
So I hear about Trudeau, but I don't
see judo. Let's see if there's a,

449
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,950
Americans are very self obsessed. We
don't actually show anyone else's leaders.

450
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,150
Well, here's him. Here's
him, just glass and

451
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,900
look. He's doing. Yeah,
look at this yoga pose.

452
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:33,790
Here he is. Just glassing.

453
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,050
Yeah. Holy Moly. Look at him.
Jesus. He's doing like a,

454
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,761
what'd you call it?

455
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:43,420
Like you suspending himself in the air
with like an underneath. So Yoga pose.

456
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:47,120
I guess they're calling it, but like a
Cobra. That's raised fun. It was like,

457
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,180
Yo man, this guy's like staying.
Yeah. Let's see. I typed in,

458
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,830
let's see if you can see. Want to see
this bod? Look at this bod. Geez. Huh?

459
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,920
He's got an, Obama has
got a bad like that. Oh,

460
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,620
I would say Trudeau's got one up on
the more reps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Damn.

461
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,470
Look at his family. They're all
fucking cute and a good looking family

462
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,220
man. I'd like to see him
make another baby with her.

463
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,720
I'd like to watch right from the,
from the corner

464
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,620
and then just go. We leave VVV. Alright.

465
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,930
Say Madam.
There's diamonds on the Kravis Tub.

466
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,773
You Pussy.

467
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,580
Look how look have said this lady is

468
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,280
the lady that escorted Elizabeth May
offstage did it the way did it like if you

469
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:46,810
were at a wedding and somebody gave a an
insulting drunk toast and you were just

470
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:49,960
like, I'm so sorry. So that's my aunt.

471
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,740
Did this happen before or after
the f a r t incident? I wonder.

472
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,120
That's a great question. Cause I mean
then you, she's really casting stones.

473
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,250
Fart stones fart hard fart stones.
Unreal man.

474
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,740
Unreal. Unbelievable care.

475
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,830
Do you care? These new
ergonomic chairs? Yeah,

476
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,550
I tried years when I was
recording this deep bro.

477
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,770
And this one feels much better. At the
same, I must have been sitting wrong.

478
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,100
And now I'm one I did share,
I'm changing the lift on mine.

479
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,130
You can change the words if you want to
lift how high and low it goes online to

480
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:33,340
go lower. Okay. It's a little
too high up. Oh, interesting.

481
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,573
Um,

482
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,320
yeah, there's uh, there's all
kinds of good stuff to show you. A,

483
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,070
you liked the pussy tickling and did
not really like it were a fan of that.

484
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,370
And now I have a lady who is very upset.

485
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,790
Oh, I should tell you this
first. This was great about, um,

486
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,900
about breastbone beach this week.
So one of my good friends,

487
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:05,450
Steve came and he's
one of my best friends.

488
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,610
We were best friends in
high school and you know,

489
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,880
we've remained friends all these years.
It's crazy to think about. Right.

490
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:15,560
I've been friends with this guy since
I was 14 years old. 14 years old. Yeah.

491
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,470
So that's a long time.

492
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,890
And that's when he knew you when you
were at a compulsive masturbator yeah.

493
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,060
20 plus yards balance. I know. It's
nuts to think about that now. Yeah.

494
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,030
So whenever I'm close,
he tries to come to a show.

495
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,210
So he comes to this show and you know,

496
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,960
you're old friends or really give
it to you real. So like, you know,

497
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,750
I remember like a few years ago, he would
come to a show and be like, that's why,

498
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,470
you know, it was pretty funny. Um,
are you going to do a sitcom or what?

499
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,110
I don't know, man. He was like, man,
whatever. I'm still a fan I guess.

500
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,670
But you know, you're still impressed
by you. Yeah. Yeah. And then you know,

501
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,520
every little achievement
you have, he's like, well,

502
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,590
like kind of check off a box for himself
to you. Yeah. So this time he's like, wow,

503
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:07,470
man, there's a lot of people
here to see you. And I go,
yeah. He goes, I mean, is it,

504
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,650
this is different, right? And
I go, what's good? You know,

505
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:12,770
there's a couple things going, it's good.
People are at the show. And he's like,

506
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,780
yeah, all right, that's good. And
then he loves the VIP treatment.

507
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:21,170
So he's like tests like free alcohol.
Oh my God. It's his favorite thing.

508
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:24,140
It's so funny. Like he's just like,
hey man, tell him I'm here and uh,

509
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,160
tell him to keep the drinks come. And
I go, okay. So I tell the staff, hey,

510
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:31,950
take care of them and I'll take care
of you. And, and then, you know,

511
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,830
he just kind of like indulges and
he's like, let me get two steaks,

512
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,800
like shit like that. So that's really
exciting to get free French fries.

513
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:44,060
Yeah. Yeah. It is free. Is Free is
just amazing. Mozzarella sticks,

514
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,830
like my parents entered with me
and I think they're most like,

515
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,890
the part they were impressed with the
most when they came to a show was they

516
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,230
were like, we got escorted in.
They were like, they were like,

517
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:56,060
that was cooler than the show.
And by the way,

518
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,290
being a comedian and those are
the only parks free green room,

519
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,180
free food in the green room,
which is like everything fried free booze,

520
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,840
free booze. If you're a bird,
that's like a lot of money.

521
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,490
Thousands of dollars.
It really is. Uh, but,

522
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,550
but those are the only parks. And then
the, they let you in on the back end,

523
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,990
which is usually in the alleyway next
to the dumpster, always next to garbage.

524
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,820
So you smell it, you smell garbage as you
walk into the club. I mean, I don't know.

525
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,654
People do that.

526
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,500
They pull you up in like a nice
town car if you're lucky that week.

527
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,980
And then they let you out right
by the dumpster showbiz guys.

528
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,180
And it'll be like, they're like,
oh, this is actually where we just,

529
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:38,430
we'd collect garbage here.
This isn't even actually to throw away.

530
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,800
We just keep it here.
It smells so bad.

531
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,710
So I walked by the, yeah,
the vomit pile with them.

532
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,210
They watch the show, they hung out, they
left. So Steve comes in and he's like,

533
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:55,890
you know, we're just hanging out in the
green room. Glassine just hanging. And uh,

534
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,670
then it's time. It's like, what do
you want to do? And I, you know,

535
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,900
he came down to see me. I go, well,

536
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,200
next door is a bar that the club owns so
they have more pull there because they

537
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,650
own it, right? It's called
copper blues. So they go,

538
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:16,230
we have a table for you next door if you,

539
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,530
if you want to go and just blown what VIP

540
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,120
you have a table. But they also send
security with, so nobody harasses you.

541
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,970
And he's like, are you feeling, are
you feeling, are you fucking crazy?

542
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,700
It's just fucking for real.
And I go, yeah, but you know,
it's just like, it's there,

543
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,990
it's their place.

544
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,190
So it's not like they're not sending
security with me to another venue.

545
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,080
It's the same. Yeah. It's like
a security guard at the club,

546
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,990
which is what they do when you have
meet and greets or something like that.

547
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,570
So anyways, we go next door and he's like,
he's like, this is fucking cool. Like,

548
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:58,500
this is fucking cool,
man. You got security,

549
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,070
you know people are at your show like
this is cool man. You, you're doing it,

550
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:06,540
you're doing it. Who? Okay, thanks man.
And then I pull up my phone and he's like,

551
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
how many people are following you on
social media? And I go, well, you know,

552
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:15,360
there's different ones on different
platforms. Instagram, Facebook. He goes,

553
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,730
you don't like Facebook? I got,
I, I'm not really into Facebook.

554
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,960
I prefer Instagram and Twitter.
And he's like, I like Facebook.

555
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,240
And he goes, oh, oh, I got it.

556
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,860
Put a picture of me on
Facebook and tag me. Ah, Shit,

557
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,170
you want me to do that? And he goes,
yeah, I go here, I'll do this for you.

558
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,570
So I pull up, let me pull it up
for you. I, um, I go, yeah man,

559
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,930
this is going to be really cool.
I'll show you what is it.

560
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,810
If you really want to have a good day,

561
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,860
post a picture of yourself on social
media, especially on the Comedians,

562
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,540
if you're any sort of,
if you're in entertainment or whatever,

563
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,250
you want to feel validated by strangers.
Definitely post a pic of yourself.

564
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,150
I pick,
I take a picture of us and I said Yo,

565
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:06,360
and I tagged him cause he asked me to tag
them. If you want to feel, I just wrote,

566
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,410
if you want to feel good about yourself,

567
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,110
check out the comments
in those picture of us.

568
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,760
It has been commented
on how many times here?

569
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,420
144 so it's reached 36,000 people.

570
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,820
Um,
how's he doing?

571
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:27,870
Is he getting a lot of love is just one
of those porns where you fuck your ugly

572
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:31,350
real estate agent because
you have shitty credit. Um,

573
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,650
it sounds about right. It says that he's
a real estate agent, so it's, and it says,

574
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,980
uh, I hope you're better at
selling houses in your choosing.

575
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:42,940
Barber Barber is you fucking slobs.
Um,

576
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,960
it looks like a mediocre real estate
agent with a crack addiction. One.

577
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:50,870
I slightly art. Uh, let me
see. It's all positive, right?

578
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,190
I don't know what's going on here.
It looks like some guy went to Tom show,

579
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:58,180
they took a selfie and Tom posted the
photo. He remember the dude's name.

580
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,810
What is going on? Um,
Tom, you're not that fat.

581
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:06,730
I hope that guy dies in front
of his family. Jesus. Relax.

582
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,210
Let's see the two of you together.
Probably way less than one fart.

583
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:13,480
Chrysler does truth. That's true. Uh,

584
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,120
I just had a bunch of gay guys react to
this picture. We ran out of lube. Um,

585
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,480
God, that's the one compliment
so far. Yeah. Somebody said,

586
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:25,690
I just saw you at the Improv. Apparently
the camera doesn't add 10 pounds. Jesus,

587
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:30,400
you're fat. Oh, nice. Anyways, it is.

588
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,750
Um, it's a lot of that, you know, so
it's, and it's, it's, they're all,

589
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:39,340
there's not a nice one in
here. They're all, you know,
no, you look Tom to discuss,

590
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,790
screw you over.
And some real estate will amaze whatever.

591
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,300
So he texts me,
please take that photo down.

592
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,270
I cannot handle the comments.
And I was like, nope.

593
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,210
I said exactly what you asked for.
Welcome in the spotlight. Yeah.

594
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,420
So you asked for this. So I'm
giving it to you. It's neat.

595
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,820
Um, anyways, pretty cool. Just
wanted to tell you about that.

596
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:05,530
And another cool thing that happened.
Jeans.

597
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,960
You know how I meet
black celebrities a lot.

598
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,510
I met method man.
I know I dated him in the 90s.

599
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,790
You did not. And he had a show called
method and red pets. Right, right,

600
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,010
right. Yeah. Absolutely.

601
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,630
100% is

602
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,900
what then is dangerous your neck.

603
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,340
There you go.
Um,

604
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:38,341
my mom's a big fan so I'm
in Fort Lauderdale airport
cause that's where I flew

605
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:43,690
it cause it's direct on this six something
flight. I mean it's fucking early.

606
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,051
Right.

607
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:49,051
And I had two late shows Saturday and
walking through security and who do I see

608
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,620
to cow Johnny blaze,
you know, the iron lung.

609
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,960
So I look and I just, I, I've tried
to figure out what am I going to do,

610
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,330
what am I going to do? We're insecurity.
I just kind of leaned forward.

611
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:05,750
I see him and I stick out my hand, my
fist like that. And he just gives me,

612
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,710
he was like, oh yeah, yeah. And he
leans forward and knots and I was like,

613
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:12,760
that's perfect. Yeah. It was like,
it was like, it was a, I, you know,

614
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,250
I'm a big fan of respect to you,
but I didn't even say anything.

615
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,870
Just a little fist bump and it's
like, feels good. We get on,

616
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,880
I get on my flight and uh, he's
in my row, but across the aisle,

617
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:30,040
so I'm aisle, he's across the aisle but
window. Right. But same row. So I'm like,

618
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,750
shit man, it was fucking method man. Dude.

619
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,800
Some girl boarded the flight and
ask them for a photograph. Oh No.

620
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,980
As they're boarding
Paul, big foe, the, uh,

621
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,020
the fucking lady

622
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,020
sitting next to him has to get up so
this girl can go sit down. Anyways,

623
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:53,000
the flight's a long ass shitty flight,
right? It's Lauderdale, la. When we land,

624
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,010
I get out of my seat, he leans in and
whispers something to me and I'm like,

625
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,560
I'm like, wait, what? And I,

626
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,930
and I really want to know what
the fuck he just whispered to me.

627
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,510
So he gets off and on the jet bridge he
waits a second so that I can walk off

628
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,710
and I'm like, wait, what'd you say man?

629
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,720
And he goes to that motherfucking
never shut up and he goes,

630
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,990
dude in front of you, man, I felt
bad for you guys. Shut the fuck up.

631
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,980
The whole flight. He talked to whole
flight, he talked to the whole flight.

632
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,300
And you know when someone like that says
something like when somebody does that,

633
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:30,070
who you think is cool. So what you do,
even if you don't know what's going on,

634
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,180
you just agree with it like I did.

635
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,560
That's exactly what I did when he goes,
he goes, you know what I mean? He's like,

636
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:39,170
he's talking to him. I go, dude,
some people never shut the fuck up.

637
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,100
Like I made it my problem even
though I had zero problem with it,

638
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,210
cause I never heard the guy.

639
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:48,170
And then when I said that he was
like word and I was like, yeah man,

640
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:52,880
you guys would have shut the fuck up.
Like I totally exaggerated that.

641
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:55,500
It bothered me and I felt like such,
you know,

642
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,260
like disingenuousness because I
was doing it to make the bond,

643
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,180
to bond more with them.
Anyways,

644
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,640
I ran it and then we walked
to the luggage together.

645
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,030
I'm fucking friends with mathematics,
his phone number and stuff. No,

646
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:12,380
I asked what he was doing shows and he
said he's shooting some show TV show with

647
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:16,430
John Singleton. Um, but
yeah, man, it's, it's nuts.

648
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,490
I have been a fan of his legitimately
since 1993 he's pretty big.

649
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,460
I've known him as long as I've been.
I've been a fan of his,

650
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:29,840
as long as I've been friends with
Steve. Wow. So anyways, that's cool.

651
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,750
That's very cool. I wish I had more
of an interaction with them, you know,

652
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,680
but I took what I get. I'll
tell you though, I've, I've
seen rappers and airports,

653
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,880
fist bump. Yeah, perfect exchange.

654
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,780
It is with a rapper or an athlete. Just
the fist bump because it's like, oh,

655
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:49,320
I get it. You get it. And I
was texting friends, obviously
I was touching, you know,

656
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,070
my, my, my good buddies from
college and they're like,

657
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,290
you're getting a picture
right. And I was like, no dude,

658
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,240
you can't ask this guy for like, can
I take a picture with you? I mean,

659
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:02,390
I could have,
but just his vibe was like,

660
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,750
not like let's, you know, like,
hey man, put it on selfie mode.

661
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,360
It wasn't like he wasn't in that. And
plus when you're traveling, if it's early,

662
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:14,930
you don't want that stuff,
but you now you have a memory.

663
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:16,970
You don't need a picture,
you know? Exactly. Exactly.

664
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,320
Kind of know by the way he looks like
exactly the way he looked 20 years ago.

665
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,340
Wow. Like method man hasn't
changed his physique, his
face. Isn't it amazing? Yeah.

666
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,290
I hope I get like that. Probably
not. I mean, I wonder if we like,

667
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,830
let's just see a comparison method,
man.

668
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:40,470
You think he works out a
lot? Uh, yeah, I think so.

669
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,440
I think actually he takes care of himself.
That dude is like,

670
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,140
that's the secret to their lien. Or when
I see older people now and I'm like, Oh,

671
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:50,930
you just don't take care of
yourself brown. Like it's a fucking,

672
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,250
it's voluntary to look like
shit mostly. Right. I mean,

673
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:57,620
unless you have some
sickness or something. Geez.

674
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,090
Yeah. I mean, I'm trying
to think if he, uh,

675
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,940
this looks like, this looks like probably
what, what I saw him as right here,

676
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,610
you know? Yeah. I mean,
good looking dude. Yeah.

677
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,560
The dude doesn't look his age.
You know, this is 93 I remember.

678
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,280
No, but I mean it doesn't look that
different men, it looks better now. Yeah,

679
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,720
pretty wild. It looks much
better. Well, I think get I shit,

680
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,110
I wish I had an edible on me. That would
have been the move. Like, oh Yo man,

681
00:45:30,111 --> 00:45:34,460
you weren't like, it's like
you and me. That's how we
hang out. He'd been like, Tom,

682
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,350
you don't know me and you don't
know my style, man. Yeah, man.

683
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:44,420
I'll get all three stars to cow.
I'm not very cool.

684
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,470
In the radio station that
I managed in college,

685
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,090
so that was like the heyday, especially
a breakout years of Wu Tang stuff.

686
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,200
You know,
it was late nineties.

687
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,630
So he has so many Aka haze that we wrote
in permanent marker on the wall every

688
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,090
time an Aka of his came up.

689
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,390
So it said method man and
there was like a poster.

690
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,680
And then in permanent marker on
the wall it would say, you know,

691
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:14,540
to cow Johnny blaze hot nick,
whatever, iron lung. And it was like,

692
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:18,050
it ended up being like fucking 20
long watch comedians did more of that

693
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,550
nicknames. Yeah. Yeah man, that's neat.

694
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,530
That's really neat. Jeans.
That was pretty cool.

695
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,450
[inaudible] posted a photograph of
myself on Instagram this morning.

696
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,313
Yeah.

697
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,800
Uh, meet Sean and the studio here
with the two dogs. Yeah, a week ago.

698
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,980
And it's really nice to
read the compliments.

699
00:46:37,981 --> 00:46:42,210
Like it look like a total mom and yeah.
Nice mom shoes nerd.

700
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:47,350
What kind of fucking shoes are
those? Sweat pants loser. Like it's,

701
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,110
it is nice to hear that kind of stuff,

702
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:51,450
but I'll show you these slippers or
actually the fucking coolest thing. Yeah.

703
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,590
You talk about these constantly.
So I was,

704
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,440
I was in the airport,

705
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:58,900
I don't know,

706
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,730
two months ago and I saw this like 50
year old lady on the tram that takes you

707
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:07,630
and she was wearing these just
glassine and I'm like, Bro,

708
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,070
those look like the coolest shoes,
most comfortable shits I've ever seen.

709
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,283
Yeah.

710
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,610
And she goes, oh, they're
called. Mohave us,

711
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:18,640
this is an English thing and I looked
it up and I ordered it immediately.

712
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,600
Scores and this is the dope
as part of these are house.

713
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:23,950
You can wear these out
and about in the world,

714
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:27,140
but I wear them around the house
cause we don't have carpet and I,

715
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,110
my arches are fucked since I had a kid.

716
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,970
But on the inside it's soft and then you
can take off the soul, which is cool.

717
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:37,420
It's plastic and you can wash this part.
That's the best fucking part.

718
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,360
Wash the insides.

719
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,970
Cause I hate slippers and they get all
sweaty and smelly and then you know what

720
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:44,620
I'm saying? You know what I'm
saying? If I'm on a time out,

721
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,930
I know exactly what it is. Yeah, I know
exactly what you're saying. Anyway,

722
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,640
they're all sponsor the show or anything.

723
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:53,641
But it's great to have like I'm always
looking for ultimate comfort shoes.

724
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:59,010
Of course I love vans, but there's no
arch support in it. Slip on Van Gogh,

725
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:00,760
like fucking tying shoe laces,
man.

726
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,420
You've had them now for a few weeks
and talk about them constantly.

727
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,520
These are the best purchase
and it's expensive.

728
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,900
It's like a, excuse me 80 but
almost throw up $80 or something.

729
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:17,080
But I've had him, I love him. Good.
Now we need a slipper for you.

730
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,190
Yeah I do.

731
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,740
I want to get it cause right now you've
got the Ugg slipper with the open back

732
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:27,550
style but you don't like that.
Why don't you like about that?

733
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,130
I like slip in and out.
I liked that.

734
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,250
I like being able to just
walk in like an Armenian guy.

735
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,780
I don't want to have to
pull up on the back. Right.

736
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,670
But what don't you like about your
current? Oh those are just worn.

737
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,500
Those just worn cause that it's not
that good because it's flat footed too.

738
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:46,390
You need some kind of
arch support in there.

739
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,480
I like a little warm and I like ease
and comfort of getting in and out of a,

740
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:53,140
I'm going to find it for you.

741
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,460
I just found some aliases going back
to mathematics for just for a moment.

742
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,980
Okay. Okay. The ghost
rider, Johnny blaze meth.

743
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,340
Mr Meth, meth. Mr [inaudible],
hot Nichols, hot Nixon,

744
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,540
big John Stud.
Shaquan got a law to cow,

745
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:14,260
the iron lung metaphysical
man to Cali and stallion.

746
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,150
John, John McLean, John John
blaze, Ini, Johnny Dangerous,

747
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,680
uh, the Shaolin Assassin, the blended one.

748
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:28,690
John Blaze Ini, the m e t h o
d man that he meister. Okay.

749
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,530
I just wanted to remind myself of those.
This is college memories. All right,

750
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,300
so you guys make your own
fucking Aka list and um,

751
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,620
will you get me some slippers then?

752
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,720
Yeah, I mean I like to, I feel like you,
you're wearing some bullshit right now.

753
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,290
Right now I'm wearing flip flops because
I can't find my slippers. Yeah, man.

754
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,840
Here's what I do.
I'm going to get you some on Zappos.

755
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,060
What you need is a material like
soft on the inside and then free.

756
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,490
Yeah. In the back. Yeah. Yeah.
That's what I need. Okay.

757
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:01,580
I'll get it for you.

758
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,010
Good pair of slippers can
change your life. It sure can.

759
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,850
I'm telling you because I don't like
to walk around in socks because my feet

760
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:10,684
fucking hurt.

761
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:16,120
Soccer flag dirty and then I got to take
the dogs out to shit and Piss 500 times

762
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:16,954
a day.

763
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,650
And I don't want to wear normal shoes
around the house cause then they tracks

764
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,760
and dirt and everything.

765
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,010
By the way, if anybody knows
it's listening, why? Um,

766
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,260
this htmi makes the,
I'm like,

767
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,750
why the screen goes blank
and then it pops back up.

768
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,550
Even though nothing's being done. Will
you please message me and let me know why?

769
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:41,150
That's why it's causing that and if
there's a way to remedy that so I don't

770
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:45,190
fucking, you know, shoot
someone. Thanks. Um,

771
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,330

where you think of this

772
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,930
a sweat or must fucking life.

773
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,020
Who's been to my house on Saturday?

780
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:21,670
Yeah. Bang them. No, but I'm sure it
means hit. I know, right? It's still,

781
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,000

You think you could still my

790
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,330
She felt,
but I swear on my life,

791
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,850
every single person that was in my house,
Bob Bang,

792
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,960
every person that was
in her head like that,

793
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,370
no other shit. This happens to
her. Did you hear what started? No.

794
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,690
Like they stole this and then my debit
card and so their sheet people notice

795
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,543
steal from her

796
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,460
to feed. They could still from my house,

797
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:19,590

798
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:24,450
I swear on my life about

799
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,960
it's both. I swear on my life
I'll go bang every single cut.

800
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,973
That was it.

801
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,580
Yeah. Maybe as you, shouldn't

802
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,350
these assholes come off? Yeah. I think,
yeah, that bad bad group of friends, Bruh.

803
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,890
Yeah. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.
Meet them at the pub glove.

804
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,300
Don't make them at your hat as you fuck
them all. Like you're threatening to,

805
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,470
they might just keep stealing stuff.

806
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,700
Remember that story about the girl that
went to go bang the Wu Tang clan or had

807
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:58,450
all of them? Oh yeah. Oh, you're down
her throat. And by the way, I knew.

808
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,260
It's funny you brought that up. Uh,
did you ask him about that? Well,

809
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:06,430
I thought you were going to say that and
I imagined that like dozens and dozens

810
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,490
of comments, we're going to be like,
why didn't you bring up that blow bang.

811
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,980
Most importantly, yes. Why can
I tell you the reality of it?

812
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,060
If I would have brought up that to him,
he would have been like, wait, which city?

813
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,680
Right. Uh, you know how long I've
been famous for? Right, right, right.

814
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,980
Like world famous have the Wu Tang clan or

815
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,270
a him in particular because he's also
considered like the good looking one of

816
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,370
that group. He's handsome.
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

817
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:34,410
So like he imagine like
if I would be like, Hey,

818
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,650
do you remember where you got a blow job
once on a tour bus? He'd be like, oh,

819
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:40,770
that one time. Yeah. Yeah, I
remember that. No, he'd be like, uh,

820
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,010
that's like saying like, Hey, remember
that time you had tacos for lunch?

821
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:48,580
And he was like, yeah, no, I
remember. Who's The guy? The,

822
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:52,870
the sweet baby. Jesus. Big Baby. What
was his real old dirty bastard like?

823
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,360
Yeah, that guy was in the band too. He's
not a looker, the hottest ones method.

824
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,400
Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean he's getting
all of it. Yeah, you could, you know,

825
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:05,100
you can make, obviously it's
subjective, but I think,

826
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:09,620
you know a Kappa Kappa Chino.

827
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,150
Yeah. So you're like, why
did that happen right there?

828
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,530
Why did that just pop the
spirits? Yeah. Cop Kappa.

829
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:20,010
Donna's definitely not cuter.
Well No,

830
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:22,530
I'm saying that like he's also
not even an original nine,

831
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:25,830
so he's going to like trickle
down post who's not getting the,

832
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,310
which can't be bad. No, if you're
hanging out with them all the time.

833
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,780
But if like one of them was like,

834
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:33,030
I want to blow method man
though he's busy right now,

835
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:37,940
he's got his dick sucked by
second aftermath after him,

836
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:43,740
you can fuck blow who's second
in line? Well you know, you're,

837
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,330
you have like the um, the CEO of it
all also carries a lot of weight,

838
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:51,650
a lot of power because he's the
architect of everything. No Rizza.

839
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,720
So like if you were like woo obsessed,

840
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,650
he would actually be the,
the real achievement.

841
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:03,650
So let's say I'm going to the Blue
Tang clan, right. For a blow bang yet.

842
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:08,650
So the first gentleman I will approach
is the pyramid of the hierarchy of

843
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,360
rappers in that group and that group here.
I think it depends on it.

844
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:13,770
That's what I'm saying.
It depends on what,

845
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:18,790
if you're talking about the
most powerful male Rizza okay.

846
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:25,340
If there is a well know and
that's not necessarily true.

847
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,230
I mean some people like,

848
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,960
cause I'm a fan of the liquid
swords. Oh, I gotcha. I gotcha.

849
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:38,520
Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.
And then a lot of people, you know,

850
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:39,780
a lot of people,

851
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,730
hardcore Wu Tang fans or feel
like there's just a supremacy,

852
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:49,430
dedication and just, you know,
something about Ghostface.

853
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,940
I forgot. So he would definitely
be aesthetically I'm talking,

854
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:56,610
I'm going aesthetically. I mean, you know,

855
00:55:56,611 --> 00:56:01,410
I would say you would probably have
TJ's a and method as the top two,

856
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,020
probably more traditionally handsome guys.
Okay.

857
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,330
And then I blow method.
Okay. And then I blow Reza.

858
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,760
You could face killer.
Okay.

859
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,720
Still got a lot of dicks hanging around.
It's kind of waiting to get sucked out.

860
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:23,190
I mean, you got inspected decks just
hanging out there. You know, Ray Quan,

861
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,230
just like, what about me, man? I'm having
some ice cream. I can't get my Dick Sag.

862
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:30,880
Right. Um, you know, a lot of decks,
if you go on and you got to go all in,

863
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:34,930
you God, uh, he's suing
them right now. There's a,

864
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,930
aren't they always suing someone in the
Wu Tang or he's in the Wu Tang clan.

865
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,080
He's suing the Wu Tang clan.
Okay. For royalties. Yeah. Yeah.

866
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,340
There's a lot of guys in
that band that there's,

867
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,020
I don't know how their band's money.
He's got a bad bite. Yeah. But, um,

868
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:52,300
how do you make money in a
band with fucking 20,000 dudes?

869
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,270
That's a good question. It's gotta be
a bad, bad bite. It's a bad bite. It's

870
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,100
a bad back, bad, bad, bad
bike. Got to Pat Pyke. I Dunno.

871
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,100
There's 20. Yeah, there's nine guys.

872
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,980
But then there's all these side guys
and that's what I'm saying now the,

873
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,210
now you know what I heard the guy in
the rolling stones is pay to play the

874
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:17,440
drummer. Yeah. Ronnie Wood. Yeah, I heard
that. Yeah. What were we talking about?

875
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,630
That yeah, we were in thanksgiving.
I told you that. Yeah.

876
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:24,150
Which is so interesting to
me. Yeah. Because basically
royalties question, right?

877
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,670
So these pay to play, it's pay to
play. Yeah. He gets paid per gig.

878
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,760
I mean paid handsomely. Sure, sure.

879
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,360
But like rolling stones
is only Keith and I'm mic.

880
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,120
That's great. Yeah. For
those two bros. Yeah.

881
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:41,410
So like they get the writing
credits there, that that's
them, that's their empire.

882
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:45,340
And they get the residuals. They get
all, all that stuff. Yeah. Brilliant.

883
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,580
So Ronnie Wood has got to be worth
the fucking pouring millions.

884
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:51,430
He's getting paid. Right. But
uh, but that's the way to do.

885
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:54,130
I don't know if the Wu Tang
structured their deals the same way.

886
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:57,370
I don't know what their deals are.
That structure would be all,

887
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:02,170
all in [inaudible] hands. I bet. So he's
the owner. So I blow him first for sure.

888
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,430
Okay. Yeah. Wow. Interesting.
Well, thankfully,

889
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:08,950
only hundreds of thousands
of people here this,

890
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,540
so maybe your dream will come true.

891
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,870
Could you imagine me in the Wu
Tang blow? Bang. No. Hey guys. No,

892
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,630
cause you're not like that guys. What
happened? I would not even know or not.

893
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:26,470
Gosh, goodness gracious. This
little little bitty blurb.

894
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:31,300
They really bad for me. Hey
guys. Anybody else? A mom. Yeah,

895
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:34,550
they would really like that. It's
like your jeans high and tight. Um,

896
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,100
I want to see it. If this lady get
her, uh, her belt backwards. Oh, right.

897
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,390
Most importantly,
yes.

898
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,590
You feel you're fucking oh by
life book. I'm going to fuck you.

899
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,770
Stop ever. She go on. If you
don't ever stop you poker stop.

00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,670
Well that's a lot going on here.
Yeah.

904
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:03,590
Well you think she has like Gypsy blood
you think or what? Absolutely. Gypsy know.

905
00:59:03,591 --> 00:59:07,850
She reminds me of the bad girls club.
I remember that one. That was like a,

906
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:13,390
come on. What's her thing? She
goes, we were saying, I don't know.

I think my privacy,
you know what I'm saying?

908
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,170
She Oh like that kind of
that that character. Yeah.

909
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,320
No,
I got no privacy.

910
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,460
No. Oh, I know what this is
called in England, right?

911
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:35,390
A chav. A chav. I think it's a Chav.
It's because that's their white trash.

912
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,360
That's their version of like a legend.

913
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,500
That was the best reality
show on BBC ever forever.

914
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,400
From lad debts to ladies. Yeah. We
fucking love that show. Lad exhalation.

915
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,160
It's the best show ever and it was so fun.
I don't know where to find it now.

916
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:52,994
If it's still there.

917
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,130
So fuck you nasal lab.

918
00:59:55,290 --> 01:00:00,130
Yet people feel they can come
to my house and still off me.

919
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:04,450
You little child, you little
tribes. Lucky you. Champs.

I swear you are all
champs. Your trends, Chad.

933
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,620
She's really 885 Oh, not the,
wait for a minute. I was like,

934
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,240
she had a belt.

935
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:07,040
The weight 189 she when
the UFC championship.

936
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,130
Okay. Yeah. Ruff. Ruff, ruff.

937
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,780
So you and I were watching
football last night. Yeah.

938
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,150
Yeah.

939
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:22,130
And the, I've noticed that every
fucking time. Football's on Kelly.

940
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:25,370
Yeah. Kelly Clarkson shows? No,
Carrie Underwood, one of the two.

941
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:27,080
I don't even know who it
is, honestly. I don't know.

942
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,213
Yeah.

943
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:33,670
But she's on every time there's
football. Yeah. Carrie Underwood.

944
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,600
And she's cute as fuck. And she's really
talented. I really, I like her actually.

945
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:42,280
Yeah. But that fucking football song is
the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my

946
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:47,070
entire, and it's so boring
too. It's like she's a s

947
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,740
what? Gone on. Watch that football,

948
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,810
football on a Sunday night, we're gonna
Watch that ball get thrown around.

949
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,940
It's Sunday night.
You're like,

950
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,823
Jesus,

951
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,460
I know five year old wrote this.
It's so funny. You know what happens?

952
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:09,350
You get conditioned to these things. Yeah.
So for me it's just background noise.

953
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:12,680
I don't hear it. But then when you point
out, like when an outsider points it out,

954
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,270
then you're like, oh, this is so
fucking dumb. Because it is like every,

955
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:18,104
it's like,

956
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,050
okay,

957
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,620
and they have like this, it's
all, I got pop video. Right.

958
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:29,060
And now they have like the
football players walk by
and go like, no matter how,

959
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,910
and like wave, we're all gonna
blow bang her lane. Yeah. And then,

960
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,080
then the lady's like,
yeah.

961
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,003
Yep.

962
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,970
Well
you're gonna love it too.

963
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,820
It's the stupidest song I've
ever heard. Yeah. It's so stupid.

964
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:52,050
Oh yeah.
Sunday on the Monday night,

965
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:58,020
Sunday on the Monday night.
I used to love,

966
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,500
there's a couple of themes that I liked.
Um,

967
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,970
I like the old school
college football theme song.

968
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:10,080
Let's see if this is it or
not from it was years ago.

969
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,030
Okay.

970
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,920
Okay. Um, it's no Carrie
Underwood, but I'll take it.

971
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,370
Let's see.
Let's see if the

972
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:24,080
everybody likes football and she
looks cute. She looks amazing.

973
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,293
Yeah.

974
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,860
Going around and high five.

975
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:35,910
There you go. That's it, man. Eric
and right there, they should have biz.

976
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,260
Bring that shit back.
Yeah.

977
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:41,060
But you know what is good about Carrie
doing that song is that she's so American.

978
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:45,620
Like she's so apple. Exactly. Perfect for
it. And Middle America is like, fuck yeah.

979
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:50,420
I want to catch that football
to Carrie. Come on. Oh, girl.

980
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

981
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,790
We all like football.
That's how I feel like,

982
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,560
Ooh, the song should be what it is. Yeah.

983
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,130
Except it's like honkytonky some,
somebody has to help me with this.

984
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,530
Html flag football.

985
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,910
Tasty lacked Doritos.

986
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:19,800
Okay.

987
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,180
Now what's the name of the stadium they
played in last night? Was it staples?

988
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,380
Oh, right. Fedex. Ups. I'm sorry. Fedex.

989
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,670
Ups. Fiji water stadiums.
See where that last?

990
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,700
I think the game was in Seattle
last night. So, so did they name,

991
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,720
I don't know what the name of
corporate oppressors. I don't know.

992
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,100
It is something corporate oppression. It's
definitely, there's definitely a score.

993
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,200
A score. Starbucks, Kentucky Fried
Chicken. Mcdonald's Burger King venue.

994
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,730
Yeah.

995
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:54,670
Peep up. Nightmare bleep,
bleep, bleep, bleep, bloop.

996
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:59,600
Wow. They fucking drop the
hammer on him last night. Jesus.

997
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,740
40 to seven. I didn't
even realize that. Um,

998
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:08,120
I haven't muted good. Let's see where they
play. I don't even know the name of it.

999
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:10,310
It's, it's like a famously, um,

1000
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,620
oh, century link field. I say.

1001
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:18,640
That sounds like,
can we mommy,

1002
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,930
can we go to the century link field?
God,

1003
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,200
what a bummer.
Can we go to the Kodak?

1004
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,020
The Kodak Gallery Auditorium?

1005
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,120
Uh,
so many are named after banks.

1006
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,510
I know they chase national stadium guys.

1007
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:42,700
The Wells Fargo arena. I know we
did this fun and I forgot. Okay,

1008
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:47,290
here it is. Okay. Kansas
City is still awesome. That's
Arrowhead stadium. Thank God.

1009
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,350
The cowboys play at a t and t.

1010
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,320
The panthers play at Bank
of America stadium. God,

1011
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,540
Seattle is century link. Oh boy.
Jacksonville plays at Everbank

1012
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,090
Washington Redskins play at Fed ex field.
Fedex.

1013
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,410
Cleveland plays at First Energy Stadium.
What a bummer.

1014
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:13,720
Detroit plays at Ford field,
which makes sense. Yeah.

1015
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,390
Atlanta plays in the Georgia Dome,
which is cool.

1016
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:20,050
It's still called something normal.
New England plays at Gillette Stadium.

1017
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:24,760
That's neat. Miami plays at
hard rock stadium. Hard cock.

1018
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:28,070
Pittsburgh plays at Heinz field.
Well that makes sense.

1019
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:32,680
That's from Greenbay Lambo, which is the
only one of the only traditional ones.

1020
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,090
San Francisco should be our favorite.
They play at Levi's stadium.

1021
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:41,380
Those jeans, man, the Levi's
companies there too. It's right.

1022
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,440
Philly plays at Lincoln financial
field. Oh boy. That's a bummer.

1023
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,060
The Lincoln financial fee.

1024
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,080
Now the rams are playing
at Lee Memorial Coliseum,

1025
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:53,780
but that'll change when their things
done right. Cause there who bought that?

1026
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,790
Well, no, I don't remember.
But they're, they're, you know,

1027
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,100
they're building a stadium for them.
So that's definitely, I wonder who,

1028
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:05,290
I forget some horrible fucking,
the colts play at Lucas oil stadium.

1029
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:09,700
Oh my God. Yeah. There's
Mercedes Benz. There's Metlife,

1030
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:14,470
new era field, Nissan
Stadium. God, what a fun,

1031
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:18,910
authentic experience is. The only other
school ones are Oakland Alameda Coliseum.

1032
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:23,500
Paul Brown is where the bangles play
a Raymond James where the a plays and

1033
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:28,410
soldier field in Chicago still plays a
soldier field. Um, God, yeah, they're,

1034
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,900
they're terrible names.
Absolutely terrible. It's,
it's a, it's just shameless.

1035
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,710
Is nothing just cook named
and the Rose Parade? No.

1036
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:40,950
Like we have to call it the
Citibank Rose Parade. Yeah.

1037
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,190
They pay so much for naming
rights. I mean, it's unbelievable.

1038
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,090
We're talking nine figures. Oh, I bet.

1039
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,730
Just to be able to call it
because they know. Yeah.

1040
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,610
And then every week when they go,
we are here live at a US bank stadium.

1041
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:55,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1042
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:01,630
You know what your mom's house needs to
by naming rights and auditorium or maybe

1043
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:04,690
a public restroom facility.
No, I know. We need to, do,

1044
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:09,930
we need to sell naming rights to this
place that's up to the studio. Yeah.

1045
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,350
Look and do another episode of your mom's
house live from chipotle, the studios,

1046
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,930
you know. Great idea. Yeah, that'd
be really cool. Right? You follow me?

1047
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:20,840
A great sponsor. I like to, no,

1048
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,500
from Armand Hammer
Studios, right? Colgate,

1049
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:28,970
if we should have a tooth sponsor
and all Colgate's he knows,

1050
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:32,120
or what does that toilet paper we get?
We can do that.

1051
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:37,121
Sharman Sharman studios that even has
a nice ring to it live from Sharman

1052
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:43,040
studios. There's so much toilet
paper here, and we say it at the,

1053
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,680
at the very top. And then they
go, yeah, of course. We'll say it.

1054
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:47,900
You guys give us $100 million
and we'll say it every week.

1055
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,620
Welcome back to Sherman
studios back from a break.

1056
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,110
It's live from Sherman studios.

1057
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,720
I might not show. This has nothing
to do with, it just reminded me,

1058
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,610
we happened to catch that show.
Uh,

1059
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,930
outdaughtered PLC about the quintuplets.
Yeah.

1060
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:11,630
And that the woman that stays
home with six kids, five babies,

1061
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:16,580
one year old babies and then like
five year old daughter. I mean,

1062
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:20,810
and she's really got such a better
attitude than we do about child rearing.

1063
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:25,040
You and I are exhausted at the end of
the day with a one year old with one one

1064
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:29,680
year old and she's like, well,
they're challenging by the way.

1065
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,580
We had an amazing disposition. They
weren't like, we're fucking wreck.

1066
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:38,630
Oh my God. Twins would have just
put us one of us in the hospital.

1067
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:43,550
And they were just like, well these five
we feed and eat. And they were like, fine.

1068
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:48,500
She's very spirited. Oh boy. You're
really, it really makes you feel lazy.

1069
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,600
I do. I'm like, fuck. I guess when you're
in that position though, you're like,

1070
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:58,370
this is my reality. You surrender because
you can't be like, this sucks. No, no.

1071
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,980
You have to be like, oh,
that's what I do. You can't,

1072
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:03,290
if you're five babies deep in the game,

1073
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,940
you can't even acknowledge that it sucks
ever. Cause it's too late. You're all in.

1074
01:10:07,941 --> 01:10:10,640
You're all in for the rest
for the 18 years. Five.

1075
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:14,870
So it now imagine if they had our
arrangement where I had to get on a plane.

1076
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:18,410
And you have live in help live.
Yeah,

1077
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,410
because we have our lovely,
wonderful nanny,

1078
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:26,411
but she goes home course and also I don't
like to have my kid raised entirely by

1079
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:28,670
another person.

1080
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:32,540
I like to spend a lot of time and you
want to take away that pussy too, right?

1081
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,820
Right.
Yep.

1082
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:41,040
Did you see our Sassy Sassy
nanny shoes today? Yeah,

1083
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,950
she had real Sassy.
She kinda highlight,

1084
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,550
choose on raw Mustang.
It was quite a thing.

1085
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:55,160
Do you find girl tickle you?
I don't need this drop

1086
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:01,310
crevice. Can we play? Finally,
I've been dying to play this.

1087
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:04,310
The guy who sent in him
doing the Starbucks,

1088
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,950
what is it called? The the challenge
called the mommy challenge.

1089
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:14,070
The genes coffee challenge
and this is how you do it.

1090
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,590
The way this guy did it
is exactly how we do it.

1091
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:21,030
Tom and I do this every time you order
from Starbucks or from a fast food place,

1092
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:26,450
do this. Let me see where it to
start. The revolution. What, uh,

1093
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:31,230
you forwarded it to me and me,
ma'am. Tell you to your, uh,

1094
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:33,210
personal, my personal, oh, here we go

1095
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,580
back. Me and me, me, me,
me, Betsy is such a jerk.

1096
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:47,950
Last night we gave them
both t r e a t s is Huh?

1097
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:51,450
And Fif was chewing his
chance. His bone. Yeah.

1098
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:55,700
And Schnitzel was just hot
and just glassing it. Yeah.

1099
01:11:55,710 --> 01:12:00,090
Remember she was right. Not Scared of
him. Not Scared, not scared at all.

1100
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:05,070
She should be. So what we did is we told
everybody when we got drive throughs,

1101
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,430
especially, we go to Starbucks
a lot, we order our coffee,

1102
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:13,040
we always call the person
genes and mop and mommy, mommy,

1103
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:17,760
we say both, you know. Um, but
the way he does it, this guy,

1104
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:20,800
he really nailed the right way to do it.
Right.

1105
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:25,320
Because you're supposed to do it like
you're supposed to go kind of, you know,

1106
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:29,040
kind of fast. You met, you make it sound
like you're saying the right thing.

1107
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:33,120
It's almost like you're saying sir or
ma'am, right? Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me, sir.

1108
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,850
Like you do it like and
then you make it hard. Yeah.

1109
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,890
It's all about nonchalant and, and
just make it a throwaway. You don't,

1110
01:12:39,891 --> 01:12:43,810
you don't want to draw too much attention.
Right. You wouldn't go like a mom. Me,

1111
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,090
hello mother. No, no, no, no. Yeah. I
want to get, yeah, right. Very chill.

1112
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,340
All right here. It does a
great, let's see. Good work.

1113
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,130
Hey there. What's coming
up for you? Hey Mommy,

1114
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:58,131
can I get up 90 ice hazelnut
coffee with cream coffee with

1115
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:06,950
a grenade bold with a cream and two
sugar in the raw figures in the that.

1116
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,370
Yeah, and I was an MP
Para Grandad, grandad.

1117
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:18,270
They polled with two sugars in the round
to do pay cream. Yes. And anything else?

1118
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,870
That's all.
You're going to have enough nice jeans.

1119
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:25,603
Nice jeans.

1120
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,770
Yeah, that was fantastic. Perfect. It
was absolutely fantastic. Thanks gs.

1121
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:38,390
That's exactly how we do it.
That's exactly how we do it
fast. Yeah. What's a bold,

1122
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:43,280
bold? He ordered a boy. I have no idea.
Is it like a drip coffee flavor? Maybe.

1123
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,040
Maybe come, I don't know if you
know this, but in the summer,

1124
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:50,630
who is this a [inaudible] 97 I was
a Starbucks employees. Tom, sorry.

1125
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:54,410
Tom Is the one who sent that. Thank
you Tom. Yeah. Really good work. Great,

1126
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,360
great work. Um, uh, he goes, hey mommy.

1127
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:02,270
That's exactly how many.
Yeah. Yeah. Hi Mommy.

1128
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,030
You know what's really insidious
that they started doing through it,

1129
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:08,870
our Starbucks drive through is they go,
hi, would you like something to eat today?

1130
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,150
Yeah.
And they enter the fee to any

1131
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,280
person and you're like, a course.
I'd like something to eat today,

1132
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,330
but we're trying not to be fucking fat
fucks. Yeah. But there's also this thing,

1133
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,120
they know that people
order drinks at bars,

1134
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:26,500
but now they're encouraging food.
Right. Cause so they're like,

1135
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,150
and there are so aggressive.
It's recent. Yeah.

1136
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:32,080
It's the last few weeks
where they'd been like,

1137
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,920
where you pull up and they know you're
going to get a coffee. So they just start,

1138
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:38,800
they go get you some food today
and you're like, no. They're like,

1139
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:40,810
you sure you don't want anything to eat?
Come on fatty.

1140
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,250
And then when you're done and
you go, that's it. They go,

1141
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,260
you sure you don't want any food?
And you're like,

1142
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,760
that fat fucking piece of
shit did to me last week.

1143
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:54,760
I was there with Lj and the car. And
she's like, you shoot, you shoot.

1144
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:58,090
Don't want some, you don't want like a
cake pop or a pace. And I was like, dude,

1145
01:14:58,091 --> 01:15:01,120
you're so sneaky. I'm like, no, I'm
trying to be good dude. By the way,

1146
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:03,250
I just saw on our,
on our cheat sheet here,

1147
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:08,530
the tickle pussy guy is Orlando Brown.
He's the former star of that.

1148
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:11,920
So Raven, no, no wonder he's so handsome.

1149
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,870
And he was arrested in February,

1150
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:17,650
2016 for hitting his girlfriend while
park police station and also having a meth

1151
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:22,540
on him. And now he's at the full
finger ring that he makes videos with

1152
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:28,850
the, what is it called? A full finger ring
of full finger ring. Yeah. Cause it goes,

1153
01:15:28,851 --> 01:15:32,560
it tickles pussies with that. So
he was on that. So Raven, yeah.

1154
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,650
He's got those actor. Good luck.
That's for sure. Yeah, you notice that.

1155
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:41,680
So we have uh, another,
uh, a couple other emails.

1156
01:15:41,681 --> 01:15:43,510
Can we want to get into a
couple of other ones? Um,

1157
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,040
water champions solve that said, Oh
boy, I dunno. I don't even know the car.

1158
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,560
It could be you. I don't know. I
don't know what it says. I'm mommies.

1159
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:52,540
I was masturbating the
Fart porn this evening.

1160
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,480
She's and began to wonder where's the com,

1161
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,690
which naturally led me to
wonder about the evening,

1162
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:03,720
the never ending debate of who the true
water champion is in head to head sports

1163
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,960
that are combat oriented.
Traditionally gender weight,

1164
01:16:07,961 --> 01:16:10,720
stuff like that are
considered Christina piece.

1165
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:13,360
Clearly the female water champion.
Well,

1166
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,210
Tommy's undisputed male water champion,
right?

1167
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:21,570
So the female astro is unfortunate from
Mami te or is it there is a loophole.

1168
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:27,010
Tommy and alias Dj Dad mouth
are both openly nonbinary.

1169
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,520
The fact that they who's Pronoun is
currently unknown are openly nonbinary

1170
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:36,190
excludes male.
Considering the rules of gender fluidity,

1171
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,260
Tina has the option to become male
long enough to simply the killer.

1172
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,820
They're both feeling me male,
female,

1173
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,820
male and female titles
within seconds of each other.

1174
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:49,270
This would also make the fluid
champ in several respects.

1175
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:53,340
Tom does not have this option due to
his rigid stance on being nonbinary.

1176
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Neither gender Tom may have the title of
genderless water champ Chatam choose to

1177
01:16:59,861 --> 01:17:03,880
claim it in order to keep his Brown's
violent and his jeans acceptable case

1178
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:08,430
close. Sincerely Jesus Christ. Wow.

1179
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,310
So that's um,

1180
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,580
yeah,
very interesting dissertation on it.

1181
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:18,050
So what he's saying is I can claim the
title if I claim my gender fluidity.

1182
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,180
Now hold on. It's what he's saying.
I don't know. I mean I've got,

1183
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:26,000
I've got an an email update.
You, I've got a report on you.

1184
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:30,770
Uh, from wet balls, beach
from wet balls, beach,

1185
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,760
Tom Tom's water intake,
this,

1186
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,580
this weekend in wet ball speech.
He writes,

1187
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:42,581
I am proud to say the champ
stayed hydrated his entire
set and topped it off by

1188
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:45,470
annihilating an entire bottle in one step.

1189
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:49,850
It was truly inspiring and I in turn
went home and drank an entire gallon and

1190
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:51,590
stuff like that.
Truly enjoyed the show.

1191
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:53,450
I can't wait to hear next
time in South Palm Beach.

1192
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:57,200
Now I will say Paul to my friends.
Cheers.

1193
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,780
It's the first time you've
drank water this entire show.

1194
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,990
Let the record note
that I've been drinking.

1195
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:07,760
I've been hydrating this whole fucking
time and I have two primaries to be fair

1196
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:11,380
though. Nope. This and that. This
is my 38th glass of water today.

1197
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,810
Liar lies.
You know,

1198
01:18:14,811 --> 01:18:18,980
you always say you drink water off
camera or you only do it on camera.

1199
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:20,571
I know.

1200
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:25,310
I just wanted to say that this is
the probably the very first positive,

1201
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:29,330
uh, Tom Drinking Water
report that I've had. Yeah.

1202
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,520
So it sounds like you're deliberately
doing some water out of posturing.

1203
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,400
You're not even proud.
Well,

1204
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:42,020
I'm just saying it's about
time you stepped it up and
pretended that you are the

1205
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:45,140
water challenges. Be Proud.
I am. That's why I fucking,

1206
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:48,800
I'm encouraging you to drink more water.
You need to pee clear also.

1207
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,890
Can I read another one? Sure.
Just an interesting thing.

1208
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:56,270
Just wanted you guys to know that there
is a town in Oregon called Brownsville.

1209
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,490
Interesting. Now I think, isn't
there one also in Tay Hos? Wow.

1210
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:02,420
What a neat world.

1211
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:06,890
Well, we know where we're going to retire,
that's for sure. Speaking of bee holes.

1212
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:09,140
Dear Mommy's,
in my 34 years of life,

1213
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:11,300
I've been doing something
we all do every day wrong.

1214
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:16,301
Apparently it wasn't until I saw numerous
times on the television actors wiping

1215
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:20,690
their be whole in the sitting position
that I realized I must be the only one.

1216
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,470
If you didn't guess already I wipe
standing up. I don't know why.

1217
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:28,550
I don't know why not. When I realized
this was a situation I asked my wife,

1218
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,570
she was astonished and bewildered to
the fact that I not only wiped while

1219
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:33,231
standing up,

1220
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:37,050
but I also thought that everybody in
the civilized world also wipe standing.

1221
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,760
So I tried to do it the normal way and
found an incredibly uncomfortable stand

1222
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:45,860
up, grab a cheek and spread with
one hand and wipe with the other.

1223
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:49,610
That's how it's been. And that's
how it will be. My ass is clean.

1224
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:53,330
Don't judge me. Your thoughts, rob

1225
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:57,180
coon unique.
What do you think?

1226
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:01,680
I'll tell you what I did before the
washlet. Well, I would also ask him,

1227
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,660
are you seven?
Cause I think that's how they do it.

1228
01:20:03,661 --> 01:20:08,040
To Jesus spread and then wipe stand.
Can I tell you what I used

1229
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,670
to do real talk before
the washlet three 50 okay.

1230
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,830
I would do a combination of both.

1231
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:17,940
If it was a difficult why now this is
before or in lieu of the shit to shower.

1232
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,700
These are hard to fart on. Hard to Fart
on. Hardest. Sit on it doesn't feel good.

1233
01:20:21,701 --> 01:20:21,850
Yeah,

1234
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:22,683
I know.

1235
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,400
Sorry.
I had to get that out.

1236
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,750
You know you look like the cars,

1237
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:39,410
the cosmic your face was
like when the cause what?

1238
01:20:39,411 --> 01:20:42,400
It will be eating a Hoagie and then
Clair would catch him and then he's like,

1239
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,200
you know, he pretended like he didn't
see it. Oh, he's pretending to you.

1240
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:51,010
Hear that one or no? Barely heard it.
Yeah. I don't think they heard it either.

1241
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:54,540
Please continue. I don't know what I'm
talking about. Oh, you said that before.

1242
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:57,910
The specificity. This is if I
don't do shit to shower. Yeah.

1243
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,000
Before the washlet I
would do a combo of both.

1244
01:21:01,001 --> 01:21:04,830
Meaning I would do at exploratory.
Yeah. First going on anyway.

1245
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:09,430
What's going on?
If there was a lot happening,

1246
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:15,090
I would do some sit down wipes and then
I went to state and then do more wipe

1247
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:16,780
standing.
So I would do both.

1248
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:20,923
Yeah.

1249
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:25,910
What are you saying? Yeah, I mean,
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a mostly sitter.

1250
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,740
Here's The Times that I've stood to wipe.

1251
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:31,610
If I'm having a real itchy
ass whole day and I'm,

1252
01:21:31,611 --> 01:21:36,230
let's say I'm out and I'm, I don't
know, I'm in a department store,

1253
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:40,820
right? Like Jesus, right. When I go
to check, I won't sit down to check.

1254
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:44,480
I'll check standing, wait, wait, wait,
check the paper. Like you'll get like,

1255
01:21:44,481 --> 01:21:47,300
I'll be like, I'll be like,
my ass is itchy. Right.

1256
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:51,100
So what I'll do is I'll go in the
bathroom, I'll wet some paper. Yeah.

1257
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:56,210
But I'll do a standing wave that's like,
yeah, I won't sit for that one. No,

1258
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,410
because you're not shitting
though. Right. But if I'm,

1259
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,620
I won't stand to Wyatt and this guy's
obviously, he's mentally, oh. But yeah, I,

1260
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:08,330
I disagree. I've often done a sit and
then stand to finish up the cleanup.

1261
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:13,100
Yeah. Yeah. That's not that crazy.
Oh, he's good. Somebody wrote,

1262
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,470
you know, we had the, the NFL but whole
debate I talked about Josh Potter. Right.

1263
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:21,140
He also did um, wet balls,
beach with me this weekend.

1264
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,540
I had great shows.
Yeah.

1265
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:27,520
We were talking about what position
has the cleanest a whole, yeah. Um,

1266
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:31,130
this guy writes the cleanest a-holes
has to be the center. If they stink,

1267
01:22:31,131 --> 01:22:34,580
the quarterback will let you and the
whole team know because your hands are on.

1268
01:22:34,581 --> 01:22:37,790
That guy's taint makes you self conscious.
Can't wait to see in Atlanta.

1269
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:40,100
Thanks Mitch. Um, interesting thought.

1270
01:22:40,101 --> 01:22:44,630
I mean I myself played center for um,
you know many years. Middle School,

1271
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:49,120
high school. Oh um, yeah. So you really
have an interesting perspective on that.

1272
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:53,720
Do your, and he is right. You are, you are
more, your butthole is in your head. Sure.

1273
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,380
Because you're, you lean forward,
you're butt's spreads a little bit and,

1274
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:01,450
and the quarterback puts his hands
under your ass hole and on your toes.

1275
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,190
Interesting. Yeah. You know what?
I've been thinking about my asshole.

1276
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:09,580
Cause now I do polities twice a
week and I'm like, I really like,

1277
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:13,450
I like to shower before and after
PyLadies because she's right there.

1278
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:18,490
Her nose is so close to everything as I'm
sweating and everything. I feel bad for

1279
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,280
this guy writes long listener with
a short response. Be whole debate.

1280
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,490
I feel like you're missing
a major category here.

1281
01:23:27,491 --> 01:23:31,000
I feel like the worst butthole
category goes to the coaches do.

1282
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:35,560
That's really funny. Just picture
rob and rex, Ryan, Wade Phillips,

1283
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:38,920
the list of disastrous
old manholes goes on.

1284
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,810
I want to thank both Eugene's for my, I'm
making my variable. Interesting. Tyler.

1285
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,190
Yup. No, that's there. It
read it. Read on the meter.

1286
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,230
These chairs are not optimal. Farting
tears. They're not good forwarding chairs.

1287
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,500
They're knocking 40 chairs.

1288
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,050
This chair or this show
was made for forwarding,

1289
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,430
so I kind of don't know what will be an
optimal chair for farting. What's that?

1290
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,980
Yeah.

1291
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:10,280
Uh, elementary school. Plastic
chairs. Well, you know what happened,

1292
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,570
you know, I did it again. I
sat on that step stool and I,

1293
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:19,110
I spread down and I sat and I
farted again. It was crazy sounding.

1294
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:24,390
Those are great steps. Steps because
first of all, it puts the plastic,

1295
01:24:24,391 --> 01:24:26,850
but it's also the deep
squat. Cause you're, you're,

1296
01:24:26,851 --> 01:24:30,780
you're squatting down all the way in our,
it's an art shit on a child's room.

1297
01:24:30,781 --> 01:24:33,660
Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that interesting?
Yeah. What a neat thought.

1298
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:36,810
I haven't a dental update. Do you
want to hit the music? Oh yeah.

1299
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,400
You've got to prepare me for this more.
I told you I had one.

1300
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,420
You didn't tell me that before.
I just thought this was interesting.

1301
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:47,740
And in lieu of our, okay, we
have a lot of contractor, uh,

1302
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,160
people around.
Okay.

1303
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,360
Is it a listener?
Dental update?

1304
01:24:59,020 --> 01:24:59,990
We'd do me a favor.

1305
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:05,120
Will you encourage me that night
to do my a whitening trays? I've,

1306
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,910
I've tried for a year.
I'm asking you to tell me tonight.

1307
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:13,040
I feel like bitsy has whiter teeth
than you. I want to do it tonight.

1308
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:17,830
Will you encourage me
or no? I remember. Okay,

1309
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:22,370
so this comes in, uh, Mike writes in,
I thought this was pretty fucked up.

1310
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:26,300
I'm a construction worker and I was
recently working for a contractor who's

1311
01:25:26,301 --> 01:25:31,301
denim as the lowest and loosest imaginable
after asking for the correct tool for

1312
01:25:31,941 --> 01:25:35,960
several weeks because the one I was
using was unsafe and someone was going to

1313
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:37,640
get hurt.
It finally happened.

1314
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:43,180
The socket blew off into my delicate
chompers and blasted about four of them

1315
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:48,280
into, how do you say
oblivion. Whoa. Right.

1316
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,490
Luckily enough,
I only have to get one fake one.

1317
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:56,550
Oh and this Thursday I am getting the
other three composite and crowned and

1318
01:25:56,621 --> 01:26:00,100
wait, how did this happen? What kind
of tools? He just says he was asking,

1319
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:03,680
he doesn't say what the socket flew
off of, what? Like is he working?

1320
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:07,250
He's a construction worker.
He's been asking, he says,

1321
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,610
he just said I was asking for the correct
tool and he doesn't say what he was

1322
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:13,820
doing. Wow. Anyways, three
composite and crowds.

1323
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:17,540
So I only have to walk around looking
like a cousin fucker for a few more days.

1324
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:21,290
Bam. We'll send more photos after
my tea. Firs are high and tight.

1325
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:24,840
That is unbelievable.
Heritable. That's crazy. Oh,

1326
01:26:24,841 --> 01:26:28,340
I'm so sometime around March I will
get the fake one after the implant has

1327
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:32,160
healed up and up jeans up. I'm so sorry
Mike. That is a terrible, terrible.

1328
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,860
I'm sure you can sue the fuck out of your
boss though, by the way. Yes, I know,

1329
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:40,570
right? There's probably, he's the
kind of guy I'm sure like on a, a guy,

1330
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:44,150
they're like gay people get two teeth
knocked out here. This is what we do here.

1331
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:46,730
But he's, he asked for the proper
tool that he needed to get it.

1332
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:50,060
That's why you should fucking have
someone pay for that. Um, I have one.

1333
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:51,380
You have a dental update.

1334
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:56,590
I was flossing very hard around my
crown on the side and I think it's,

1335
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,020
I think the crown, it's
time to be replaced. Genes.

1336
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:03,340
We got to go to the
Goddamn damn time we can,

1337
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:07,430
we haven't gotten the dentist now look
after the new year after we've settled a

1338
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:10,680
bit. You don't want to get to the
appointment. Mental work now. I know.

1339
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:15,260
Life is chaos right now. Let's make
the appointment. Yeah, I am. All right.

1340
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:16,280
We have a closing song.

1341
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:21,281
It was submitted by Dj boy butter and
it's called Mommy Fart in your face.

1342
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:25,460
Okay, thank you. Sounds like it
could be pretty good, but see,

1343
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:29,750
I have not heard it yet, but here it is.
Here it is. Goodbye guys. Hi, Mommy's

1344
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:33,530

1346
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:43,680
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

1347
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,800
Take rx bars.

1348
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:53,440
You know what I'm saying? Our
target, I'll pay $5 a hall

1349
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:58,410
arts bargaining.
I like chills

1350
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:10,030

1351
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:12,733

1352
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,030
