44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,650
We are in the new studio,

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,400
We're in studio jeans. Um, there's so much

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,290
Let's do it. Gene knew Monica. Yeah.

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,850

women. You feel me? This,

51
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,820
let me eat you one term.
This,

52
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:37,590
let me eat your one time and you're
going to, I guarantee you you're gonna,

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,580
you're gonna ask me to stick
to your house. You go to
sleep for three days. My BB,

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,693
no,

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,713
Christina.

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,493
Hello.

57
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,280
Look at this here. Look at this.
I know. See that it says next.

58
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:47,600
Dot. Brown tog et that it's my
lipsticks and the lady. Well,

59
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,970
um, it's official. It is official.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And your mom's house is continuing to
enlighten the audience with these hard to

61
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,710
find men and they're irresistible offers.

62
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,470
I thought this is the new art Kelly show.
Everybody who is watching

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,520
this is it, I guess you've never seen
our Kelly before. So that's him. Yeah,

64
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,440
he's aged a little. Just a little
bit. Yeah. Still talking about sex,

65
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,220
but going the grind in and,
yeah.

66
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,970
You know what's amazing is that like
the perverts don't age out. You know,

67
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:25,160
you're like these surely there's
a time where you're like,

68
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,730
I'm too old for boners.
I would think that, yeah.

69
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,780
Around 10 years younger than
him. Yeah. You'd be like, oh,

70
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,930
stop offering the eat girls in videos.

71
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,800
Or at least the point in your life when
you put the chain on your bifocals,

72
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,000
which is what he's done.

73
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:44,690
Like when you've got a rope around your
neck to keep the glasses on your eyes,

74
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,280
the eyes always tell the story.

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,480
And I think doctor drew would maybe say,

76
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,930
something's going on in the eyes here.
What do you think? I Dunno. It just,

77
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:56,670
it's not a normal gays,
you know?

78
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,440
That's not well. And, um,

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,730
yeah and I liked the way he phrases it.
Can we see that? Um, just the whole,

80
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,160
cause it's a whole nice offer.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,460
Oh y'all beautiful wind.
That's nice. You feel this?

82
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:13,650
Let me eat you one term.

83
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,200
This let me eat your one time and you're
going to, I guarantee you you're gonna,

84
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,770
you're gonna ask me to stick
to your house. You got your,

85
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,960
you got to sleep for three days.
My beat

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,770
did the, the European [inaudible] then
that's when his accident pop too. Yeah.

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,980
The 30 days be blue. This but it might
be from the islands. Jamaica. Yeah.

88
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,510
Well I'll tell you, this has some of
the makings of a great way. Mh Video.

89
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,750
He tried to ruin the show with that.
God dammit. The little dust in here.

90
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,460
Jesus Christ. God Damn. Ah, well
number one, let's go through it.

91
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,750
Um, framing, how are we doing? Are Pretty
terrible framing but I've seen worse.

92
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:53,300
But yeah, I mean he would
make, he would make the cut.

93
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,240
Now I'm embarrassed to say this
man has a shirt on absolutely

94
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,530
revolting that he dared
to send him his video.

95
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,580
However there is a hole and a hole and
he makes up for it with a Bandana on his

96
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,210
head. The Bandanas. Weird Bandana
gets you extra points. Sure.

97
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,250
He doesn't have all his teeth.
There's a couple of gold ones,

98
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,320
so that's pretty cool.
Yeah, that's perfect.

99
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,280
And the fact that he chose the goal is
kind of, it's, it's switches things up,

100
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,260
but subject matter is a one point.
That's how he, that's how when you get,

101
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,880
when you, when you open
like that, it's fantastic.

102
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,350
And also another checklist is
location. Location, location. Yes.

103
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,940
And this one, he chose his front lawn,
which is bold. It's an outdoor video.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,680
Neighbors. Sure. Kids are playing. Yeah.

105
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,200
It's what you want from somebody
that is living in your neighborhood.

106
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,960
Which by the way, I don't even know
that he lives in this neighborhood.

107
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,370
He might not, I don't think it's his
yard because he and his offer, he's like,

108
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,650
if you let me eat you,
you, you'll be like stay.

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,970
And I think he's like basically off he's
bay. This is basically a petition to,

110
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,960
can I sleep at someone's house? You think
so? I think so. And the trade off is,

111
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm really good at eating so we could
match him up actually with like get Elise.

112
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,610
Nikki, try it out. Yeah, this is his,
this is the try it out. Try it out.

113
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:21,410
Guy Was a beautiful woman. No, we'll
try it again once a black guys. Yeah,

114
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,680
but I had a jail. I don't think
that tried out. Guy Would,

115
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,990
I don't think this guy would enjoy,

116
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,890
he might do the beat me like you
know piss on me. Beat me. Yeah.

117
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,420
He might try it out but he's not going
to eat him. What else does he say?

118
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:36,080
He says some more stuff. No thanks. He
said some other things all done. No.

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,790
Next to push. No Bush. Do you
need to see more like we got it.

120
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,073
No we didn't

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,300
guess what more are you sure
you would time eat enough?

122
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,760
I tell you they got a man up a whoa. I
could cook for you. Clean up your house,

123
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,330
visit when you come home baby.
You just got a job in jumping

124
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,590
to toe with all of them.
Bubbles.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,310
Okay,
so I'm definitely on point.

126
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,940
He is looking for a place to stay.
You're right.

127
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:09,650
How did you know that he needs
housing and he's not a dick.

128
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,850
I'm going to cook. Right? I'm going to
clean and I'm going to, he's basically,

129
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,840
this is leading up to,

130
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:18,920
I'm guessing I'll eat you
right after that bubble bath,

131
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,660
but he's saying be cleaned for me to do
that and that's always a big issue is

132
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,070
vaginal cleanliness to these guys. These
guys are very picky about these guys.

133
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:32,840
Meaning meaning every guy that puts
out the cool car irrational. Yeah,

134
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:36,650
I got you. Okay. But they don't seem
to care about hygiene in themselves,

135
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,660
but it's very important that she
have hygiene, which is ironic.

136
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,140
I first of all the two fees you could
be missing to have your front too.

137
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,620
It's always unique weight,
but he's,

138
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,170
if you go back a little

139
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,160
more, yeah, I know.

140
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:00,750
I saw for there's oof can
really see it clearly.

141
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,970
There I go.
Dammit.

142
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,560
And you can highlight the missing two
fees because the one next to the missing

143
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,800
is gold. So you're like, hey, that's
gold. Oh Hey, there's no tooth. Well,

144
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,830
that's the thing is that
he sprung for the gold.

145
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,930
Why not spring for like the
real, the veneer, you know
what I mean? Or the implant.

146
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,700
Maybe he's living his best
life and goes, he's not like,

147
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,330
I don't need all these teeth. I see one
or two people having a good enough life.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,890
I'm living my good enough.
I,

149
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,940
oh need real chief is,
I'm living in. Okay. Like,

150
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,350
yeah, Jean Jean, it's, I can't
believe it's actually here. Okay.

151
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,580
What it's finally happening
at the top of the pad,

152
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,780
if you can see behind us, we are in
studio gene. We're proud of ourselves.

153
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,350
[inaudible] House. Yeah. You
look, we discussed the motif.

154
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,730
It is steak house meets the People's
Court. Yeah. We want it to be official.

155
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,980
Yeah, that is true. It's masterpiece
theater steakhouse and the People's Court,

156
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,010
this is a long time coming.
I mean the,

157
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,660
the dream of it is longer. The
reality of it is, you know,

158
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,830
you were super pregnant.

159
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,020
I went out and started looking at spaces
right in around June. Yeah. All right,

160
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:23,830
so that's six months ago. And
then found this place. I think I,

161
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,380
I I to say I didn't sign a lease until,
I think it was September,

162
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:32,010
October it, Elise, Nikki, yeah. I got
to listen to key in September, October.

163
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,510
And then, um, what happened next? Oh,

164
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:41,070
I had a guy who was going to do
everything. Oh, build the sets,

165
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,080
do the tech,
do everything.

166
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,240
And like the day after I signed the lease,

167
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,870
so like now I'm committed and
I walked. He was like, yeah,

168
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,020
it's not really gonna work out for me.
I was like, what? Totally screwed us.

169
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,900
I remember I was very pregnant.
It's floating around in our pool,

170
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,120
trying to keep cool in the
middle of summer. And you're
like, this guy just, uh,

171
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,020
just got pulled out. And you know,
who really helped really helped me.

172
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:10,230
The first guy I called with was Ethan
Klein. It's right, um, you know,

173
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,640
Ethan Hilo from age three.
And I was like,

174
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,780
cause I know he knows a lot about
production and sets. And I was like, dude,

175
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,370
can you,
and he hooked it up.

176
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,500
He put me in touch with Tj more
who built this set and then,

177
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,420
uh, Nadave or our very own bird,
a little behind in the nests are,

178
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:33,400
yeah. He, um, became very involved.
And then we got, you know,

179
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,860
the technical aspect going, um, pod or
help with a lot of production stuff.

180
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,700
And then we hired Mel and this great
lighting crew and then, I don't know,

181
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,720
it all came together. And then after
all this was set up, we were like, oh,

182
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,580
it's not soundproofed enough in here.

183
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,820
So then we had to hire top
tier soundproof [inaudible],

184
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,460
which we are actually halfway through it.
So I don't even know how this,

185
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,740
I hope this sounds good to you guys.

186
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,510
It'll sound even better next week when
they're completed with it, but it's, uh,

187
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,380
it's been a whole, well,
I will say, I mean, look,

188
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,180
we used to film the show next to our
son's bedroom when he was sleeping as a

189
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:17,670
baby. So we've done the show in many
different locations. Pilati studios was,

190
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,160
that was like six. Yeah, I think the
thing, this is still pretty good now.

191
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,220
This is still great. It's
still great, but you know,

192
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,660
saying I would like to point out some
old school features just so some of you I

193
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,780
know don't like change. My therapist
tells me I'm not good with change.

194
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,850
There's a lot of stuff
from the old studio.

195
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,530
If you'll notice we have our dog mask,

196
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:40,240
our mascot GG Allen is here.
I got Webster behind me.

197
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,350
City connection,

198
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,110
a Fifo with all the dog tits. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,250
Of course.
Blue Band might.

200
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:53,251
One of my favorites fan submitted things
of me as the Virgin Mary water bottles

201
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,470
of water, toilets, all the stuff you
know and love and behind me, right?

202
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,530
The dog pup play, the terrifying
pup play. Who's your owner?

203
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,100
But last time I came out as poly.
Yeah.

204
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,210
And I'm proud to say I'm bisexual,

205
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,920
but also I'm so excited.
You're ready.

206
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,660
I'm ready for this big announcement.

207
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,180
Caddying kibble
when other sounds

208
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
chips in a bowl

209
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,820
vegging out. Now I'm
building up. I'm ready.

210
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,660
Go for it guys.
After many years of talk,

211
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm proud to announce,
behold the fart Mike.

212
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,800
It's finally here. Wow. We've been
talking about this for so long.

213
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,490
We really have been. And I have to
say so many wasted far it's okay

214
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,860
but I want to thank blue band and Josh
pawn or everybody for making this fart.

215
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,703
Mike Possible.

216
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,730
I don't think this audience understands
the level of importance she put on this

217
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,360
for today because I was more worried
about you know these monitors working and

218
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:24,971
sound drops and you know those types
of technical problems and Christina was

219
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:29,930
like if this fucking
fart and Mike isn't here,

220
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,580
why did we even build the studio?

221
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,910
I agree cause I know how important
the Farc Mike is tour listeners,

222
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,240
I feel like they've been demanding it
for years and if we're going to spend all

223
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,110
this money and time building a studio,
this to me is the most important thing.

224
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,390
We should also point out that yes,

225
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:47,570
right now it just looks like
an extra mic laying around.

226
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,110
We're going to dress it up. Okay.
It's going to have its own arm,

227
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,750
couldn't have the label,

228
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,650
are going to note for today for
episode one it's merely a Mike,

229
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,890
but this will soon have the appearance
of of special of royalty basis.

230
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,560
This is really going to be something
else and hopefully we will on it's on the

231
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:12,890
arm, will be able to pass it over to the
guests and share it with one another.

232
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,950
So I was a little upset
because we usually,

233
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,350
we don't record the
show this early usually,

234
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:22,550
but we woke up this morning and
Tom had such great fart at home.

235
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,100
I had a really, I took a
disgusting shit last night. Yeah,

236
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,280
I had,

237
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,120
well I had an Omelet for dinner and
then I watched the national championship

238
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:35,930
game, uh, and uh, Bart and Arie came over.

239
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,750
So last year we went to,
at this time they came over to the house.

240
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,250
I don't drink normally,

241
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:43,550
I'm boozing it up cause I got this booze
bag friend over and you know what I

242
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:44,384
mean?

243
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,370
And he was like pouring scotch to
the rim of a glass. I was like,

244
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:53,090
what are you doing man?
So anyways,

245
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:57,060
that's sitting in my stomach and I had
to take a dump at like midnight. Really?

246
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,060
Where did you shit in our master and our
bedroom downstairs. Downstairs. Oh Wow.

247
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:06,200
Bold. I know. And then I,
um, got up this morning,

248
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:11,090
well you woke me up to be fair with the
fart and then I had a few and then I was

249
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,920
like, Ooh, this is not going to be,

250
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,700
but it upset me that we didn't
have the Fart Mike at home. Oh,

251
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,430
it upset me that we waited
so late to do this show.

252
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:22,510
We should have been doing this show
at six 30 in the morning. You know, I,

253
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,130
sorry guys. That's the new call time.
That's when it starts to happen.

254
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,960
So you're throwing money out the window.
It's true.

255
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,450
That could have been on Fort Mike.
It's very true.

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,960
So the good news is we had a lot of
bean dip while you're watching the game.

257
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,020
I'm hoping that there's still
some farts in me from last night.

258
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,930
We stopped at Starbucks, so let's
hope that all that is going to create,

259
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,740
I want to make a point here.
This is a, an amazing studio.

260
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,220
This, yeah. Um, you know, we're going
to do, by the way, a behind the scenes,

261
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,480
um, tour of everything, right?
[inaudible] band and we'll, we'll,

262
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:01,320
we'll show everybody all the
ins and outs like to what level?

263
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,880
Everything was built out. This is
better audio. It's better video.

264
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,640
It's all that stuff.
But it's still your mom's house.

265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,830
And one of our listeners actually made a,
um,

266
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,060
a quick, your mom's house. Super
Cut. Do you know who built it? Uh,

267
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,250
Caleb is a Caleb. I Dunno. I'm asking
God. No, I forgot. I forgot to look it up.

268
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,490
Okay. All right. It's all very cold in
here. I know you're happy about that.

269
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm happy about that. But uh, can we take
a look at this? Uh, this is pretty cool.

270
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,260
What he built here.
All right.

271
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,740
Mona. Julia woke up so
morning just wanting to say,

272
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,630
can I change the locks on your doors?
You want to move in? You come move here.

273
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,670
Please don't ever go back in the past.
I know,

274
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,570
cause I need to be fucked a lot man.

275
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,590
And I understand when having
sex with a gun in the ass hole.

276
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:53,480
Disgusting is nothing compares
to in front of jail, homeless,

277
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,910
not take fucking 30
Benadryl want at night.

278
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,940
I'll make you feel like a woman or man
after you experienced an enormous amount,

279
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,850
even know who your ex boyfriend is just
home, Ya know? You know what I'm saying?

280
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:11,720
Let's go pull a tribe
and a curse,

281
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:16,100
but I want to fuck you pretty bad
to get blowjobs and try it out.

282
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,640
You're gorgeous. Let's go have some
fun and let's get physical. Fuck me.

283
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,500
I have a good day,
mother fucker.

284
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,230
Find out who made that.
That was fantastic.

285
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Those are all the gentlemen I
forgot about speed and you can add,

286
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:39,650
let me eat you mix. But uh,

287
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,420
I forgot about how Ben is real
guides sometimes in a bad mood.

288
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,540
He's irate. He when, when he goes
have a good day, mother fucker.

289
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,210
He's alone.

290
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,030
Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Yeah.
Whoever made that good job.

291
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,260
Yeah.
Really sorry.

292
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,720
I had to see them all together. Like
that was kind of jarring all scumbags,

293
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,660
you know, celebrate it on this show.
Yeah, that's true. Right? It's like,

294
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:18,700
it's a lot really crazy.
It is a lot. It's um,

295
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,480
it's looking,
they're all montage together like that.

296
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,750
I think it's fair to say, I mean, I
don't want to be like too arrogant,

297
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,950
but when you see something like that,
we've kind of changed the world. You know?

298
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,913
In a lot of ways,

299
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,850
giving people a platform to
shine that would otherwise just

300
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,100
some universe like we've actually
helped these guys get. Yeah. Like what

301
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,770
if someone right now I was like, yeah,
that like some woman is like, God,

302
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:54,790
those guys sound hot. That's true. That'd
be Rad. Okay. That probably is true.

303
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,270
Probably true. Oh by the
way, got to say this.

304
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,570
So you guys know our good friends at
Saatva have always been a huge supporters

305
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:07,840
of ours,
of the show.

306
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,070
I talked to them about this and they're
onboard and I think it's so awesome that

307
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,570
this is going to be a reality.

308
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,220
So to celebrate the fact that we're
in this new space in the new studio,

309
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Saatva is going to give away a two
mattresses to listeners for free.

310
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,380
One site for one loom
and leaf memory phones.

311
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,960
Here's how you win the free mattress.

312
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,730
I think some people
will have fun with this.

313
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Send us a video no longer than 30 seconds
of why you should get one of the free

314
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:49,630
mattresses. You can show us your
current mattress, you can describe it,

315
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,970
you can just give us a reason.

316
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,680
And if it's funny and creative,
uh, we will vote in house.

317
00:21:56,681 --> 00:22:01,360
We'll showcase some of them, but
send it to our email, which is, uh,

318
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,420
your mom's podcast@gmail.com and
put Saatva in the subject line.

319
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,410
S a te Va a once again,
or if there's,

320
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,510
if there's a, if I could say it
without a belt, just for the listener.

321
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,340
It's a fun guys in the subject lines,

322
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,300
creative energy,

323
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,450
s a t v a in the subject line and send
it again less than 30 seconds and win a

324
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:33,250
free awesome mattress.

325
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,600
It's going to be either the loom and leaf
memory foam or the actual sock Saatva

326
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:40,640
luxury firm. They're fantastic.
And I want to thank Sam for,

327
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:43,330
for doing that very much.
Um,

328
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,560
can I tell you this credit what early
adapters they were to podcasting

329
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:51,340
advertising. They were our first
sponsor of your mom's house.

330
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,630
And Kudos to them for being so forward
thinking. They were awesome. Yeah.

331
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,480
I mean they still are, but yeah, that
was really cool when they got, um, uh,

332
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,560
got involved with this a while back.
We have to talk about, by the way,

333
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:06,070
before we move further along that,
uh,

334
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,220
over the weekend or before the weekend,
I think before the holiday week,

335
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,860
during our off week so to speak,
uh,

336
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,340
Louie had a set that was leaked,

337
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,030
created this in the sane backlash
in the comedy and the chaos.

338
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,440
Why is it disturbed me on so many
levels? I mean I'm, I'm serious.

339
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,010
What, what was the worst? What was
disturbing for you? Okay. First of all,

340
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,020
the idea that,

341
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,290
I mean especially when when people in
comedy who know better act like they don't

342
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,160
is what it, what bothered me is
that this is clearly a workout,

343
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,430
right?

344
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,760
Like the Guy Theater,

345
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:53,120
it's like at a club in long island that's
in governors and long gun and he does

346
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,890
like a 45 minute set.

347
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,120
It's probably his 15th,

348
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,710
12th to 15th time on stage.
Since being offstage for like 10 months.

349
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,030
And this is part of the process
of how you build material.

350
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,240
Like you do these Poppins,

351
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,670
and then he'd take that material to clubs
and then you work out some dates and

352
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:21,620
clubs and then you take it to a small
theater and then a bigger theater.

353
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,110
And then for him,
he can go even beyond that to an arena.

354
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:29,111
But I'm saying the process is that you
remove your feelings about what he's

355
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,600
done. You're talking about
comedy now, stand up.

356
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,360
Now we're going to, you know, we're,
we're going to act like the, uh,

357
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,420
well, what, what are people saying
about them? Let's start there. Well,

358
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,980
that's the thing, it's like, first of all,

359
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,540
the idea that you're judging
a workout set is insane.

360
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,570
I get it. If you're from, from the
general public and you're going like,

361
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:51,650
what are you talking about?

362
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,070
But the point is you do those
sets to be kind of reckless.

363
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,030
You do that, you speak irresponsibly,
and then you figure out,

364
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,310
like there's parts that let's say,
really don't get a laugh or get an, uh,

365
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,000
as you move along or you go too
far. All that, that that broke,

366
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,300
that didn't ban, and then I'm going to
reign it in here and there of course.

367
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,780
And then you fit, you reign it
in and you kind of go like, okay,

368
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,730
well this is how I'll, you know, I'll
make these changes. But if you release,

369
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,390
I mean you can release the 10th time
you've worked out your set. Yeah.

370
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,280
So that part's crazy to me that
people in comedy are like, Oh,

371
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,310
it's this and it's that. It's like,
dude, it's not done and you know better.

372
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
That's sharepoint as a
craftsman is someone who's
been doing this for 20 years.

373
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:41,470
Of course. What are you talking
about? Why are you asking my draft?

374
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,040
It's a frustrates draft and that,
so that part made me crazy.

375
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,650
Then the like,

376
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:53,420
just the need to really
beat the shit out of him.

377
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,080
His comedy. I'm like, what
are you doing? Why are you,

378
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:00,950
why are you doing what you're saying
is so people are now saying like, oh,

379
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:04,880
he's so thoughtless. He's acting like
an old grumpy man against millennials.

380
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,010
And it's like, well,
he was always that Pov.

381
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,160
Louie hasn't changed his POV at
all. It is exactly like, yeah,

382
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,720
here's what makes me crazy. Somebody,
if you go, there's people who go like,

383
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:20,990
I've never found that guy funny. I've
always said he's not funny. Okay.

384
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,780
You don't have to like everybody
that makes sense. There's, I'd have,

385
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,780
but people who are like,
I was a big fan and now,

386
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,180
now I heard this and now I hate him.
I'm like,

387
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,080
what are you talking about?
Like it's the same sensibility.

388
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,180
It's the same guy doing the same
type of material. He's done it.

389
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:44,070
It's like vintage Louis the
same thing except now, you know,

390
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,800
something so weird and dark
about this person. Yeah.

391
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,850
And can you still know that and, and
like him. And I think what's interesting,

392
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,710
and if you look back at all the artists,

393
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,070
a lot of people that you've loved
have been colossal pieces of shit.

394
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,720
If you look at, well, Hey r Kelly
who's inside guys now, right?

395
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,780
The crazy stuff he's done.
And can you listen to his music?

396
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,850
Elvis Presley was banging on the syllabi.
Presley who was 15 years old,

397
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,960
Jerry Lee Lewis marries his 13
year old cousin. To be fair,

398
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,910
all those guys way bigger pieces of
Shit, right? Like not even close.

399
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,240
Right? But I'm saying can you
separate the man from his work?

400
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:24,660
And that's always the
big philosophical debate.

401
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,560
I personally like on the
comedy side of things,

402
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:34,010
listening to that and then hearing
people purposely deliberately tried to

403
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,800
characterize it as a alt right,
right.

404
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,170
Right now they're like, oh,
he's a old washed up hack.
What are you talking about?

405
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,340
Like even,
and here's the thing,

406
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,320
it kind of shows you that if you decide
to frame something as such and start

407
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,050
telling people and they
people go along with it,

408
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,650
then it becomes a truth.
It's like trailers.

409
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,380
It's like when they were recording
trailers with different music,

410
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,540
like the shining and making it a comedy.

411
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,130
It really is about Lens and point of view
and framing except that here's the 10

412
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,060
here's the thing. In this situation,
like I, not in all situations,

413
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,360
but in this situation I'm actually so
well informed on a subject that I can't be

414
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,290
swayed to believe
something that isn't true.

415
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,120
Like I am so well informed of how this
works and what I'm listening to them,

416
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:31,830
what I'm seeing that none of the,

417
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,180
you know,
um,

418
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,410
opinions of others can make me see
something that isn't there. Yes,

419
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:42,390
I agree with you.
There is not a hackey premise.

420
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,370
Like what happens is people are
going like, oh, he said like, uh, uh,

421
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:52,320
these kids today are so crazy. And it's
like, well if you frame it that way,

422
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,640
then that's the premise.

423
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,840
But if you listened to it and
you actually hear what was said,

424
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:02,340
you realize it was a much
richer concept layered. Yeah,

425
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,540
of course. And here's what I will say too,
is that yeah, we all know what he did.

426
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,320
It's not right.

427
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Then it added that I listened to the whole
hour and I laughed and I haven't had,

428
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,750
cause he's hilarious. I'm
telling you, and I know,

429
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:19,290
I see Camila time aside from you
and a handful of our friends,

430
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,500
nobody makes me laugh. And
I was like, this is, Oh,

431
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,920
I'm so glad that he's back and I
really fucking like it. And you know,

432
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,030
you struggle with that.
You Go,

433
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,750
can you separate what the man did from
the stuff he does, the work he does.

434
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,250
And Hey, I'll tell you why he's fucking
funny enough that I think I can. Yeah,

435
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,190
I think I'm pro dammit. He's
talented. And I was like,

436
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,130
can I tell you something else?

437
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Nobody is funnier when they got nothing
to loose and Louie has lost everything.

438
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,080
And I think it's made him
fucking way funnier when
you're like, well, he said it.

439
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,830
He goes,
what are you gonna take away my birthday?

440
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,910
Fuck you and I love it bothers
me. I it, they're like, you know,

441
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,990
he's, he's had to like,
you can't act like,

442
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,370
just because other people
have suffered that he hasn't,

443
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,620
like the idea that this year has
been just a peach for him is,

444
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,670
is ridiculous to me. Yeah. No, it's like
they're like, yeah, but what about the,

445
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:16,961
I mean,

446
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:21,280
you could still respect that there's
other people that have been affected and

447
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:25,450
still say like, it's not like
this year has been chill for him.

448
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,520
Like you've been publicly shamed.

449
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,260
You have two teenage kids who see
this and see you all the time.

450
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:34,120
Do you think that's fun?
But they're like,

451
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:38,620
let's still kick the shit out
of him for his workout set.

452
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:42,710
Like what is going on right now?
He's really taking it, taking it.

453
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,740
I don't agree with it.
I don't like it.

454
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,290
But I do want to point
something out aside from the,

455
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:51,250
unless you had something else that I
was just thinking too, like when did it,

456
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,460
when did we become such a bunch
of fucking sissies that you like,

457
00:30:57,201 --> 00:31:00,850
you can't have sympathy for a group or
you can't have real life feelings for

458
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:05,560
somebody for a group and yet still make
fun of them. Like what happened to that?

459
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,400
You know what I'm saying? For instance,
Joan Rivers, her husband was deaf, right?

460
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,920
And so she would make
jokes about deaf people.

461
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,490
And just because you joke about it
doesn't imply that you don't have sympathy

462
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,700
for that group. Do you know
what I mean? Like, well,

463
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,560
we can joke about things that he
might still feel sympathy for.

464
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,790
Need something to do it all the time.

465
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,150
But right now I'm saying people don't
have that distinction in their minds.

466
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,120
They think as you make fun of it,
that you're an, you're an asshole.

467
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,060
You're not proline.

468
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,240
Everybody who gets it gets it.
In other words,

469
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:37,180
people reasonable,
they get that.

470
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,030
And here's the other thing
that people that don't get it,

471
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,440
the only thing that's making us go like,

472
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,800
what the fuck is wrong is that
you hear them because they have,

473
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,300
we all share this like these platforms.
So you see them going like,

474
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,050
what's wrong with you? How could you
make fun of that deaf person? You know?

475
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:58,000
And so because you ingest their
nonsense, you go, oh my God,

476
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,910
everything's fucking, my hands are
numb. But what I was going to say,

477
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:06,730
it's fucking kiss. My face is frozen too.
It just, uh, let me put on my jacket.

478
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,900
No, you know what's, what,

479
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,220
here's my theory on these people that
come out against the dark comedians,

480
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,450
these social justice warriors. To
me, I'll tell you what the theory is.

481
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,550
I think these guys are so afraid
of their own dark sidedness.

482
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:25,930
They're so afraid of the demons within
them that they're going to call it out in

483
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:28,330
somebody else. I you,
you're bad. You're sinful.

484
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:32,410
It's just like the preacher who's
hating the gaze and not, you know,

485
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,590
the homosexuals are going to burn and
it's the same guy who was blowing other

486
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,470
guys in the bathroom stall and doing
crystal meth. Right? Like Ted Haggard.

487
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,820
I gotta say you usually
don't say anything smart,

488
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,630
but I think you're pretty
off the chill in the air.

489
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:48,650
It's really chill in the air is
making your brain work. Okay.

490
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,760
I'm serious though. I tell you what,
these fuckers that are co Colin Louie out,

491
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:56,090
first of all, for those of you
don't know it, standup comic code,

492
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,920
it is just an unspoken code that you don't
Shit on another dude for what they're

493
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,650
doing creatively.
You don't Shit on other comics,

494
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,750
end up not understand that we can
critique on your personal life,

495
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,870
but it is nobody's
fucking business and free.

496
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,760
And for people to call the
general public become it's code.

497
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,700
You never fucking do it.
And the fact that these guys are doing it,

498
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,450
it's I think despicable and it
goes against everything creative.

499
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,310
And there you go. There I fucking
said it. Yeah, I just got, dammit.

500
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,780
I was bothered by it. I think we're
both potter. Do we have a minute?

501
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,470
Oh yeah.
So yes.

502
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,790
What I wanted to talk about it was,

503
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,810
it was so fucking funny the other
day when you were telling me,

504
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,830
Oh, I hear so much. Yeah. So what
was going on? And you're like,

505
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,630
I'm really having,
oh,

506
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:52,610
I was having anxiety about the baby and
he was getting sick or something and I

507
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,260
went to have dinner or we're
going away and you're like,

508
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,810
I just, you know, I just feel it.
I'm worried about the baby. I'm like,

509
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:05,210
I don't think he's really sick. He's been
coughing. I got to go to the dot. No,

510
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,970
we just had a cold. But I in my
mom brain, I'm like, oh fuck,

511
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:10,310
we gotta go to the doctor again tomorrow.
I hope he's okay.

512
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,790
I hope it's not the croup, blah,
blah, blah. And then I'm like,

513
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:19,250
and I look to you for comfort
and, and you go here, watch this.

514
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:23,390
This'll, this'll cheery up. No, I just
go, you gotta see this? Gotta see this.

515
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,310
I set up my phone, I give it to him. Like,
watch this, watch this. And it's the, uh,

516
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,930
the trailer for us, the new
Jordan Peele movie, you know,

517
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,760
is that a Romcom instead of a
jaunt? It's good for anxiety. Sure.

518
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,040
Because especially about
your children. Yeah. Perfect.

519
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,840
It's um, but the, the trailers
amazing. And uh, I was,

520
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,780
I was pretty stoked. He
takes a, I got five on it,

521
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:55,310
the loonies track from
the 90s and slows it down.

522
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:00,850
And so it sets this tone for
this deeply disturbing thriller.

523
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,110
And then you were like, what the fuck
are you making me watch this for? I said,

524
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:06,944
I'm anxious.

525
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,520
I think the one thing you don't give
somebody when they're anxious is a horror

526
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:11,520
movie trailer.
No.

527
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,930
It really made me laugh about like
losing your kids and stuff too. I'm like,

528
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,340
it was pretty great. It was pretty
great. It would be like here,

529
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,800
watch the new Jodi foster movie on.
I can't do this shit man.

530
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,250
Thank you for doing that. Tom, you always
know how to really make me feel good.

531
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,430
You are welcome.
Well look at

532
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,910
gene,
so excite.

533
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,330
We should take a moment and
we'll be back with great guest

534
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,740
right after these words.
Your mom's house.

535
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,430
We'll be right back. All right,
and we are back. All right,

536
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:52,020
pretty good and we're back with
an all timer, a hall of Famer.

537
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,470
First ballot.
I'm you so excited.

538
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,550
We're so excited
that you're here.

539
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,510
11 your voice goes love when your voice
that you're octaves and pitch change,

540
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,050
but we're also not just excited
that you're here to show you stuff,

541
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,620
but we're also so excited to announce
that you are going to be doing an

542
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:14,460
additional you only you know you don't
work hard enough or we have thrown your

543
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:15,294
way.
Yes,

544
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,980
you're going to be doing a podcast out
of here on our second set that we have

545
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:24,030
here. Let's be fair. We should we be
calling it a podcast. It's a youtube,

546
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,250
it's a full on extreme. They,
all this stuff you have here,

547
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:32,460
it's going to be deployed for that.
Let's call it a pod for the moment. Sure.

548
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,840
A show. It's a show. It's a
show. It's a show. Um, that we,

549
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,720
here's the cool thing.
We,

550
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,260
we respected that when you first came on
it was just like, hey, would you come on?

551
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,860
And it was, I was fans of both
you guys. That's very nice. And I,

552
00:36:47,861 --> 00:36:51,180
and I kind of knew what your mom's house
when I did not know what I was going to

553
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:54,690
be subjected to,
nor did I know what a sadist your wife is.

554
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,690
So enjoy my discomfort or that
the audience would really enjoy.

555
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,630
Well, it's your audience.
So I think the discomfort,

556
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,180
I think we enjoy having a professional
opinion on what's going on. To be fair,

557
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:11,080
not just the clips,
but I was uh,

558
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,610
I was reflecting today when I was thinking
about coming over here and how joyous

559
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:18,600
I was and they were, and sort of,
I wanted to congratulate you guys.

560
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,530
I'm excited for you.

561
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:25,350
You have the opening volley with these
guys was does far to push stool out or

562
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:30,480
not. This is why we have you on the
show. And I thought, wow, so here we are.

563
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,160
Here we are. We're coming full
circle that your medical degree, Oh,

564
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,220
I've been to radio long time and
sort of nothing surprises me.

565
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,690
However that moment stayed with me,
puts the shit out of shits,

566
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,730
push the farm

567
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,360
and then we played for you a
tons of funny clips. Funny.

568
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,530
Yeah. So, um, funny.
That was funny, right?

569
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,580
The guy that was a snake bite biting it.

570
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,090
I didn't get to see none of that was
just audio. Okay. Yeah. He's just,

571
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,730
he's just funny. People's misery is funny,
right? That what I'm supposed to eat

572
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,980
seriously reflecting on all this
this morning. The other thing.

573
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,160
The other thing is,
aside from your ugly at my discomfort,

574
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,290
the other thing was Tom's genuine joy
at people's misery. He was like, yes,

575
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,080
yes, this is joyous. And it was that,

576
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,740
that likes a layer of discomfort on
me that I almost couldn't tolerate it.

577
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:33,240
So that's where the discomfort really
goes over the top and I came back,

578
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:36,100
I've made maintain friendships and,
and not only that,

579
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,170
I'm going to be a part of this,
this shift pirate ship. Well,

580
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,980
here's the thing I wanted to like
in summary is that you came on,

581
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,340
you didn't know what to
expect, uh, the audience.

582
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,780
So loved having your voice in this world.

583
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,180
And then that's what
led to the idea of like,

584
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:00,310
what if you did a show here where it,
it's a little mix up of like,

585
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,030
you know, speaking of things that you
want to talk about your in your own lane,

586
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,120
commenting on clips from the show,

587
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:09,850
which seems to be like a
really fun thing to happen.

588
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,320
And then talking to some people to hold
that comedian. Yes. Deconstructing them.

589
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,960
Oh my God. After dark dude, I love it.

590
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,300
That's what it's going to be. All the
fun that you're talking about. Sex,

591
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:25,060
drugs and rock and roll
and crazy comedians.

592
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,570
And I want you to psycho analyze all
the comments. I'll do the best I can.

593
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,930
So fascinated by that.

594
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,220
Is it your own stuff and your husband now?

595
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,660
Yes.

596
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,980
I'm fascinated by human beings and I
just thought about how we is my voice in

597
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:42,970
this world is that,

598
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:46,990
what'd you say to them in this world and
this world and this world. And it is a,

599
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:51,550
it is an alternative universe over here
and you should know that your fans are

600
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,490
quite enthusiastic.
Yes.

601
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,240
I was at a MTV movie awards.
Did I tell you this story?

602
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,870
And a woman flew out of the booth to like,

603
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,880
I had just gone over and gushed
at, uh, what's the kids name?

604
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,590
That shit's creek. Uh, it's, I don't
know. Shit's creek is a great show here.

605
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,380
Oh really? I don't like many comedy.
Uh, Dan, I forget his last days.

606
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,930
He's there anyway.
And the Levy Dan Levy,

607
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,510
it was gushing over at him is, he's the
other ones. What's The dad's name? Eugene.

608
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:27,970
Eugene's Day.
The Dad and uh,

609
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,960
and I was just gushing at him and then
I was literally nearly tackled by one of

610
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:36,730
your fans who was like a
35 year old female. I mean,
not exactly what I expected,

611
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,620
right? Of attractive 35 year
old female who like, who,

612
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,790
who seemed sane but was behaving insane.

613
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,380
And I say this with peace and love,
peace and love, peace and love.

614
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,780
She was one of the lovely
woman would not leave.

615
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,080
I couldn't get enough like wanting
to be a part of this world.

616
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,490
We encourage that you,
you did it him,

617
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:03,220
if anybody sees drew body
camera guy wasn't bothersome.

618
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,560
It was not bothered. She was,
she was much like Christina.

619
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:09,070
I was an observer of this human
behavior and thinking, wow,

620
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,150
this is a different world,

621
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:14,020
but I become a part of and I better
double down on our show on it.

622
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,370
Our fans,
let's put it this way,

623
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:23,320
they have transformed Garth Brooks
is social media, right? Tommy,

624
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,300
what did you say? That we've taken
over? We've take things by storms.

625
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,890
So just be prepared but
not be, there's, look,

626
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,260
there's limited time with you and there's
a lot of money. Here's what I want to,

627
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,220
first of all, I want, I want
to be your videos. Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,060
So here's what I wanted to,
uh,

629
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,970
so this has been the latest like thing
that blew up on the show and to set it

630
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,870
up. I'd love to get your
whole thought on this. Okay.

631
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:55,880
So here's what happened.
I feel like here's the setup.

632
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,870
Let me just tell you.
Okay.

633
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,990
I feel like somebody who like either
like needed major dental work,

634
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,980
like revisions in their mouth going in.
Now again, I'm like, okay, here we go.

635
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,870
I'm used to this, but don't start
drilling. I love it. Okay, so,

636
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,410
so are like a cancer patient,

637
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,600
get testicular cancer has
getting chemo and going,

638
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:22,700
Oh God, you're right.
All right. Here we go.

639
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,620
So I just went like,
okay,

640
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,470
I want to give you the setup because
it makes more sense this way.

641
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,730
Here's the setup

642
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,840
man. Was that the gym? Is
that this guy? Yes. Okay.

643
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,300
He was at the gym and he sees
an attractive woman. Okay.

644
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:42,470
Leaving the tanning room at the gym sees
that she had signed in at the sign in

645
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:47,410
sheet. Was this pre or post
to be too? This is pre. Oh,

646
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,170
so there should be a few years. But
he's, he signed, he sees her sign in,

647
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:54,810
so he knows her name. Okay. Okay.
So when what he does with his,

648
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:57,900
he's think he's on the spot.
He goes, you know what,

649
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,030
I'm going to follow her out into the
parking lot. And he says her name.

650
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:03,270
Do you want to be listeners and viewers?

651
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:08,320
No, he's behaving like one. Right.
This is pretty nice. It's pretty,

652
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,340
oh,
advance keeps going.

653
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,230
That's where your listeners cut off and
the right videos began. That's right.

654
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,520
So this guy

655
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,820
sees her, he calls out her
name. Her name's Julia.

656
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,760
And she thinks that
because he knows her name,

657
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,480
that we must be let me
show. She's like, yes.

658
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,470
And he's just tells her like, Oh, you
know, I saw you here, blah, blah, blah.

659
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,650
I'd like to take you out.
Sometimes. She's like, well,

660
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:37,010
I'm kind of thinking about getting
back with my ex, you know, he's like,

661
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:39,980
how about just dinner? Uh, can I
have your number? And she goes,

662
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:44,690
how about I'll take your number and one
of those movies. And she shows her phone,

663
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,950
cause it's in her hand.
He puts in his number and dials himself,

664
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,930
has her know. So, but that's where
she goes, thanks. Good night.

665
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,260
And then she goes home and the next
morning she wakes up and this has been

666
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:07,190
texted to her number, this video. And is
she, she the one that sent this to you?

667
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,320
Well, eventually it yet,
but yes, we're listeners.

668
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,460
And then we ended up meeting
her and getting the story.

669
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,150
But so I just wanted to get
your take on this as a hello

670
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,373
as a,

671
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,230
I met you yesterday or their
body fluids involved. Julia.

672
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,070
Just me.
Joe just wanted

673
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,650
to say hi.
Wish you a great day.

674
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:40,080
Tell you that meeting you yesterday and
getting a look at you was probably one

675
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:43,200
of the greatest moments of my life.
You were so beautiful.

676
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,300
You don't know how beautiful you are
to me. I mean just, you're gorgeous.

677
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:49,140
You're precious.

678
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,020
There's more perfectly
normal. Perfectly okay.

679
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,400
Does he pull the gun up to his head?
You're going to,

680
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:00,730
you're going to go out with me or else,

681
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,830
but it's been sitting in my
mind when you said to me,

682
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:08,240
you want to go back with
your ex boyfriend, please
erase him from your memory.

683
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,400
Don't ever go back in the past.
I know,

684
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,780
cause I've been there and I understand
when you know you're trying to find

685
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:19,781
somebody and you go on dates and nothing
compares to Eurex but there is that

686
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,300
better person out there and Giulia,
I promise you it is me.

687
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,600
Perfectly normal.
Perfectly natural.

688
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,210
Does he hasn't threatened to kill
the boyfriend? Yeah, that's okay.

689
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,650
It's just pillow like you've never
been loved before. I will cherish you.

690
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,850
I'll make you feel like a woman,
a real woman. I believe me.

691
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,390
After you experience mate, you won't
even know who your ex boyfriend is.

692
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,810
Here we go. We're going down. We're going

693
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,673
down.

694
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,970
He these is this all one video. One
video, but it's chopped up. Okay.

695
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,940
Put up your heart to make in your ARVs.

696
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,920
Let's go full throttle.
I could see me falling in love with you.

697
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,280
It just so I don't know. I just
looked in your eyes and I just melt.

698
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,190
Oh yeah. So he's still open
the pathetic zone. Okay. Okay.

699
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,250
I feel bad. What are you waiting for?
You're waiting for it to cross into. Well,

700
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:20,780
hold on. So I'm expecting,
I'm heading off.

701
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,470
I'm expecting either some sort of
totally sexually inappropriate move,

702
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:29,770
which then will get disgusting or
some sort of threat of violence.

703
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,440
It's expecting one or the other.
So

704
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:42,230
both are possible. Right? So if I were
this woman, I'd be like, Oh, Jesus Christ.

705
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,950
Paul cops are called the MCI.
Okay.

706
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,030
Okay. Anyhow, I've had an off to work.

707
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,570
This is my cute little home.
Everything you see behind me,

708
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,950
I built everything every square inch
from crown mold into chair rail,

709
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,390
the floors to lighting, to
plumbing, doors, windows

710
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,091
speaking,
have lighting.

711
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:06,790
Does he have like some special like
Instagram lighting in his kitchen?

712
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,700
Did you see that? Yeah, they looked
like pretty well, like weird.

713
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:13,720
The weird lighting. Okay. Pretty unique.
Yes. Do you want him to work on your own?

714
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,593
No.

715
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,820
Does the type of guy, again,
I'm a very handy guy and uh,

716
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,140
I'd love to build you. Whatever
you want. Oh, you're a sweetheart.

717
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:28,210
So I hope this video doesn't scare
you. Oh, sorry. How I feel sorry,

718
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,070
dude, I just want you to that. Okay. Okay.

719
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,650
Now I look forward.
I'm going out to dinner with you,

720
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,590
so let's make it happen.
Nah,

721
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:43,040
dude, I'm so sorry. What do you think's
going on with this guy? What's going on?

722
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:47,850
What do you think's going on
this layered?

723
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:52,250
What's, what's wrong with you man?
Peace and love. Peace and love.

724
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:55,340
I don't know this guy. I don't
know you sir. I don't know you sir.

725
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,350
I don't mean to disparage you,
but laughing.

726
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,180
You guys don't understand something.

727
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:05,510
You now have your physician on your
platform. Liability comes with that

728
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,690
piece and a law of peace and love.

729
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,960
This is strictly in analysis based
on a video and not knowing this man,

730
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,500
but I mean, it's a kind of a narcissism,
right? I mean, it's a, it's a,

731
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,050
it's not really processing reality
in that reading social cues.

732
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,400
You worry that it flips into sociopathy
where she's just an object for him.

733
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,140
And so, you know, it doesn't
really, yeah. Mattered to him.

734
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:30,190
What she's thinking or feeling because
he's decided she's the one now his

735
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:34,440
defense. How would you say this guy is?
This guy was probably 45 really? Yeah,

736
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,210
I was hoping. So 27 well, I,

737
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,260
you should know there's lots of this
going on in the twenties really? Yeah.

738
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,350
Lots of stock.
This is stalking behavior essentially.

739
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,620
Socking as always.
There's no

740
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,281
needles.

741
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:56,280
They because they were you
happy with this is fascinating.

742
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,940
So, so he, I have to
breathe deep in this place.

743
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,410
I love this house.
Um,

744
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,700
they are not doing normal sort of dating.
They don't,

745
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,370
they don't form and break relationships
normally during adolescence. Right.

746
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,720
We'd normally,

747
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:17,930
you have them and break them and have
them and break them and you date none of

748
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:19,670
that. It's all sort of
hooking up and hanging out.

749
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,230
And so when they actually developed sort
of a real attraction or an attachment

750
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:26,120
to somebody,
they don't know what to do with it.

751
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:29,840
They don't know how to navigate that. A
manager. So we get a lot of people going,

752
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:35,560
males 27 or more like 25 going,
uh, well I met the girl might,

753
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,660
I met her at the girl of my dreams and
we went out and she wouldn't so into it,

754
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,960
but uh, that was just there and you
know, she was, she didn't understand it.

755
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,480
So we became friends and we're good
friends and I've been waxing her car and

756
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:51,440
cleaning. Yeah. Carpet the last
two years. And now it's time.

757
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,160
And those two years I've
been stalking. Right. Wow.

758
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:59,330
He's hanging out stalking weight and now
he's like, now you need to it's time.

759
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,980
Well, can I tell you the full story
now? Oh No. So he followed her.

760
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,830
Oh, she found out where her ex
lived. So it was real stock.

761
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:11,630
And then he disemboweled that man
on the freeway in New Jersey. No,

762
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:12,763
just

763
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,530
in your head please let it go.
Let it,

764
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:23,531
let us see where I go with [inaudible]
to lie to somebody and let you believe

765
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:31,130
that. Horrible. It's like,

766
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,230
that's my dad. No, I don't have
the heart to torture you. I like,

767
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,910
my husband didn't know that.
That didn't happen the last,

768
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,830
but he did send a few more
videos. He, yeah, she was,

769
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,250
she able to get rid of him.

770
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,180
Now he is aware of his creepiness
because at one point he goes,

771
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:52,000
I hope this doesn't scare you.
Like there's an awareness there is and it,

772
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,930
but it's a dismissing of it. Right, right.
It's like it's like you, you wouldn't,

773
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:00,020
of course you wouldn't be, you know,
you're not scared by me. Of course I,

774
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:03,770
because it's me and I hope it doesn't
do it because it won't anyway.

775
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:08,180
Cause it's me. It's, yeah. And the
duration of this stuff and the,

776
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:11,640
so let me ask you then for a word to me,
I get very sad when I see a car.

777
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,660
He said usual when I watched your what?
See,

778
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,420
this is why we're interesting.

779
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:22,010
So when I see people get run into in
a garage and their legs get cut off,

780
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,890
I feel bad when I see this
guy. Right. You're, you're,

781
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,400
your production staff has probably
never seen us in action cause they're

782
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:35,410
laughing their asses off. He
goes like this. I feel bad
for them because, you know,

783
00:51:35,411 --> 00:51:37,800
it's interesting,
I was listening to podcasts.

784
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,940
Are you saying they're all like the
persuasion has become a really hot topic

785
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:44,120
lately I think because of Trump and
that's all he's doing is using persuasion

786
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,770
and uh, and people go, you must got
to take other people's point of view.

787
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,010
Let's see the point of view when I go,
no,

788
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:54,770
that's all I do all day is I try to
put myself in there literally in their

789
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,500
shoes,
in their body and feel it not,

790
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:59,960
not invade their body
or be overtaken by it,

791
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,180
but to really try to
understand what that is. Sure.

792
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,900
And so I automatically see this guy and I
just, Oh, poor dude. Oh man, it's so bad.

793
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:10,040
So bad. So sad. Desperate.
Right. I ruined it.

794
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:13,480
I ruined the whole thing.
Now is even funnier.

795
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,620
We've actually gone back.

796
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:22,270
Good Morning Julia, which is how this
starts. God, let me ask you this.

797
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,210
True for the women listening because I
in my twenties had guys like this too who

798
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:28,700
didn't seem to understand boundaries
and that I wasn't interested.

799
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,980
How should a woman deal with
something like the guy to fuck them?

800
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,630
You got a fucking guy.
I was going to say that I let them know

801
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,850
[inaudible] go get out of here.

802
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,200
So that when you were going to say,
sorry.

803
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:52,460
No I was going to say from
just very firm but non amo,

804
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,180
not hysterical or emotional I think
and, and, and then that'll ramp it up.

805
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,980
Well any contact ramps it up, right.
So you have to be firmed, deliberate,

806
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:05,180
swift and sure. And then no
more contact cause any contact.

807
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:11,270
How about a deliberate text back? Like
let's say girl gets this kind of video,

808
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:16,220
what is the text back to the texting
or emails that kind of is a good idea

809
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:19,880
because you have a documentation and just
say any and really make it any further

810
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:20,960
contact.
Here is what I'm gonna do.

811
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:23,300
I'm gonna contact the FBI and the
local police. You are freaking me out.

812
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:23,930
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:28,930
It'd be kind but firm at free and clear
in no cracks in the wall cause they will

814
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:34,050
exploit any crack and any future
and they will escalate it.

815
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:37,000
So no blowjobs nothing.
Don't, sorry Tommy. I know,

816
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,580
I know it worked for
you a couple of times.

817
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,900
That's why they keep doing it cause
it keep working. Right. So um,

818
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,700
oh okay.
Yeah.

819
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:50,330
So we've been really fascinated by Garth
Brooks. And I want to tell you, oh,

820
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:54,530
I here. Okay. I'm not sure I understand
why. And by the way, it's not that we're,

821
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,450
we're not shitting on his music
or his talent. It's nothing. Yeah.

822
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:02,460
He was super talented guy who's
unbelief has an unbelievable fan base,

823
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:06,920
right? Yeah. But he has
a dark side. I think so.

824
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:12,420
And I also think that he has
this really disconnected,

825
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:17,310
um, sense of like how to
interact with, right. So, so the,

826
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:20,720
so Garth book, the human being is
probably different than the guy.

827
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,320
See what the hat up there on the day
probably carefully protected that they

828
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:26,970
manage. Right? Right. That's for your evil

829
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:34,110
because of this like country music
fan base where it's like, oh shucks,

830
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,550
I just like it bacon
pie with my daughters.

831
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,840
I think something, boom, here's the thing,

832
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,570
the cracks in his real self show in these,
so obviously his team was like,

833
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:48,180
you need to be on social media
and he's probably reluctant.

834
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,600
I don't know if you've ever seen the
initial, do you have when he, I've not,

835
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,590
I've not gone down the Garth
Brooks prep. Okay. With you.

836
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,180
You have the initial announcement
that he's joining Facebook or no,

837
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:03,150
is that Qta I don't have that. You
don't have that? Okay. Well then this,

838
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:08,160
I want to see this. This is not well
here. Well, this is a, okay, so this is,

839
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,250
he has inside studio g, which is, uh,

840
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:16,370
like his behind the scenes look for the
fans where it's a studio and it's access

841
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:20,130
to, you know, here's where it works.
Stuff out, always with a smile.

842
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,660
Everything's always glorious. Every, I'm
always in a good mood, everything's great.

843
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,630
And his wife is Tricia.
Tricia,

844
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:33,420
or can you do this
thing? Oh, oh, oh Jesus.

845
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,290
Oh dear. Your cod. As she's doing
that, she's very hard question.

846
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,190
I don't know why women,
but as he doing this segment for his,

847
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:47,850
like behind the scenes show, I think it's
like his Facebook channel or something.

848
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,340
Uh, a door opens. Oh,
he's just so we get to it.

849
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,350
Like what was the Welsh guy's name that
was on the Golden Globe with a heavy

850
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,810
accent? Yeah, Christian Bale. Notice
my name finding as I get older.

851
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,210
Sorted your best Christian Bale,

852
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:03,120
like a Christian Bale moment where we
screams at the staff. Remember that?

853
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,170
You'll see, you'll see
certain, yeah. Let me just say,

854
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,370
unfortunately what I'm
seeing, just looking at the
picture here, peace and love,

855
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:12,540
peace and love. I don't
know. Garth Brooks,

856
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,880
a little bit of what we call Plethora Ra.

857
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:18,770
I'm gonna pull through a
little bit of little Billy,

858
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,460
a little bit of parotid and large,

859
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,770
maybe some booze maybe. Let's see. Okay,

860
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,690
so here's this clip. Let's take a look at.
Nothing wrong with that. Yeah, no, I know.

861
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:36,170
I just don't want to say, yeah. Let's
see. Let's take a look at this clip,

862
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:39,610
but you just looking at this
point, it's a small, small moment.

863
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,860
I just want to get your thought.
All right. Very subtle. So I got,

864
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,540
is that supposed to happen?

865
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,260
[inaudible]

866
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,170
happy birthday.

867
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,710
Do you think he murdered whoever knocked
on the door or no, he would have a,

868
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:02,680
we're not a birthday. We'll
be that. We'll look at that.

869
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,600
That's what I'm talking about. Dart.
Dart. That's supposed to happen.

870
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,590
The rage,
the quiet at a very,

871
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,570
very good seething rage that's supposed
to happen and that wasn't good this time.

872
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,950
Last time was more, we'll do it again.
Does that supposed to have, there we go.

873
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,600
Yeah. Yeah. But you sense it too,
right? Like he's seeding blink, SOS,

874
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,040
Christina [inaudible] problem at all.
He's just blank. I'll be her pretty tired.

875
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:33,700
We every week on Friday.
Okay. Um, no. Yeah,

876
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:34,750
that's uh,
okay.

877
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,460
So he's got an aggressive side to him
that we didn't know that for sure.

878
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,360
Just check, check guy.
But to be fair to him,

879
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,470
I mean, he's like, he's like a crazy
superstar. You know what I mean?

880
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,310
Who knows what he's used
to and can't tolerate it.

881
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:52,060
Maybe he's tired and so I'm willing
to just go. Maybe that was a moment.

882
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,680
Maybe I really like that.
Does he smoke cigarettes now?

883
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,410
But sometimes he'll talk real
sexy and some of his voice,

884
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:04,260
so he does other gutter of the fried.
It's going to ask you tube.

885
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,380
Have you heard of his alter ego?
Chris Gaines. Oh my God, what is this?

886
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,270
You don't know that.
That's the Goth version.

887
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:14,380
So he did this thing for a while where
he put on a different persona called

888
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:18,760
Chris Gaines where he was kind of golf
looking and he even Photoshop his face to

889
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:23,300
be thinner and gaunt and more
and more sensitive and it was,

890
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,340
it wasn't,

891
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,180
I don't think its fan base appreciates
it as much as they appreciate what gets

892
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:30,040
it back story for it so
that like Chris Gaines,

893
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:34,270
his parents died when he was young. Oh my
God. So He's, he's trying to capitalize,

894
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:36,530
he wants to be like a grunge artists.

895
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,370
He went for it and he put out an album
as this and then he nearly wiped the

896
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:45,310
Internet clean of it after he
decided not to do it anymore.

897
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,370
It's pretty interesting.
You guys have tapped into something.

898
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,810
I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but I think you found something for here.

899
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:58,050
Does he have a civilization
on the backside of the
moon that Chinese are going

900
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:00,820
to dig in mind? Let's,
let's talk. He's Tom

901
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:07,440
for his latest towards stadium, but he's
a huge superstar. Yeah, that's a big deal.

902
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,120
It's pretty wild. Right?
And you don't know.

903
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,260
We really don't know what
that does to people. Right.

904
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,960
But that's the thing is I think a big,

905
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,740
like a big part of what we're picking
up on with him and being kind of just

906
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:22,370
weird is that I can't imagine what
that level of fame does to you.

907
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,060
It just will.
Especially there,

908
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:28,100
there's sort of a confluence of factors
is the kind of person that seeks that

909
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:28,934
kind of fame.

910
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,660
The kind of person that we as a society
elevate to that kind of paint, paint,

911
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,600
fame and then what it does to them.
This was a confluence of factors.

912
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:41,320
It's now it's not the fame itself,
right? It's that seething rage.

913
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:45,590
It was already there. I'm just saying.
And the intolerance is probably, you know,

914
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,440
just the overworking and the alcohol and
whatever else. Where else, I dunno. Pills,

915
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:53,650
whatever. You know, I
feel like I've got, um,

916
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,700
the insult dog behind you.
What,

917
00:59:56,701 --> 01:00:00,440
what is this is for pup play.
It's not sexual.

918
01:00:00,441 --> 01:00:01,730
That's not sexual at all.

919
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,060
You seen those people that they wear
masks and then they pretend to be dogs and

920
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:08,170
smell each other's butts. But it's
not, it's not sexual. It's just a, hey,

921
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,210
I see that. Please Tom, may I
please you want to see this?

922
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:16,240
I want to see that because we have seen
furries and I imagine this is sort of a

923
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:20,630
furry part, but when you got to the
sniffing of this, but Christina,

924
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,890
maybe that's your version of the dog.
Do you have a dog mass clip?

925
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:29,890
Uh, well on my show you'll have
to tune into my show. I will,

926
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,040
I will. I will, uh,

927
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:37,100
look into this and maybe we should
have a dog, but play every week,

928
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:37,960
maybe something like that.

929
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,530
They have a theme or professional
counsel on this as well.

930
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:46,310
The other day I was experiencing some
anxiety on the drive home from dinner with

931
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:50,810
my husband. You know the baby was sick
was when we all went out to dinner.

932
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,560
Oh my God,
we're stuck with this guy.

933
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,830
And I was like, Gosh, you know I'm
experiencing anxiety and he goes, here,

934
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:05,300
watch this. It's really good. It's
really good. This is this, by the way,

935
01:01:05,301 --> 01:01:09,380
does Susan know you're putting out
like you're doing webcam stuff alone?

936
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,510
Is this you? This is me. Is that
not you? It could be. Let's see.

937
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:18,590
You wouldn't be required
to make daddy call.

938
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,810
What she recorded me. I didn't
know. I didn't put it up. She did it

939
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,930
be done in a way,

940
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:29,931
but you want to do either with your body
or a friend of yours that's a girl that

941
01:01:30,841 --> 01:01:34,020
you can sell with picture and
saved that he stroke to her.

942
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,650
Yeah, normal. Perfectly natural.
Does it. Perfectly healthy.

943
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,250
But he reminds me of like
a Spiderman evil villain.

944
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,510
He's like w w like I
wonder what he's like.

945
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,570
I would love to see him in his real life.
You know what I mean?

946
01:01:49,571 --> 01:01:53,530
That's the part that I find
fascinating. Like, this is such a, this,

947
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,760
I guarantee you this piece of him is
something that he puts way out over here.

948
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:59,910
He had denies it exists. Oh, right.

949
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,950
Then he goes through his life as a bank
president. Right. You know what I mean?

950
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,940
And then what is that doing that
compartmentalize and partly it's trauma.

951
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,650
It's true that this traumatized piece
of himself that comes out in once while

952
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:15,460
needs, needs attention, but he's like,
it's detached though. It's disconnected.

953
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,220
Trauma is morphed into a sexual
as it is. Oh, is that right?

954
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,250
It's one form or not. I mean, let's
put it this way. I'm sorry guys.

955
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,380
It always has a,
let's put it this way.

956
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,240
I'm not saying there's a
direct correlation between
trauma and sexual fetishes.

957
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:33,810
I'm saying that when you're traumatized
and naturally it affects important parts

958
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:35,490
of your life, like your sexuality. Right?

959
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,390
And so especially when you have a cutoff
part of yourself that may be injured

960
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:41,730
and dysfunctional,
I don't know what's there.

961
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:47,080
That need is aggressive and angry and
whatever, so it'll act itself out. Wow.

962
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,690
Hey, good time man. It didn't seem like
the healthiest message to put out. Right.

963
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,980
Did this, uh, alleviate
your anxiety? You saw this

964
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,180
trailer for a horror film? It's a
Jordan peals new movie. US that,

965
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,820
that trailer just what
do you think of that?

966
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,420
Does that like Asperger's where he
doesn't read the social cues or cues,

967
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:09,120
how to document these things?
Because one day there will be a court case

968
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,570
and child custody will come with the
question, so you're going to need this.

969
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:19,230
Just keep that licensed physician list.
What?

970
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,280
You know what's interesting?

971
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:24,570
The last I was trying to show her
that trailer all day, so I was like,

972
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:26,340
you have you seen the trailer?
And then that dinner, I was like,

973
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:28,650
have you seen the trailer? And then
we were in the car and I was like,

974
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:32,710
you got to see it. And then when I
showed, she was like, I'm anxious. Oh

975
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:39,690
He's speaking of which can I hit burden
my show immediately I sort of created

976
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,180
bird. Do you know this?
You don't know this.

977
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,650
What do you mean the first
time you told them that him?

978
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,530
Of course he didn't do that.

979
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:50,820
But the first time he told them
the machine story was on love line.

980
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,820
I made him come back the next
night and tell it again. Really?

981
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:57,000
He said I should go out and tell
this story in public. And he's,

982
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:01,440
that was his career began when you ask
it. If that's not the case. That's true.

983
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:07,550
And I love him in the certain kind of
way and I wonder his podcast to it.

984
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:10,200
We should, I should go over and do his
and promote all this stuff. Fantastic.

985
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,270
I mean, we should all go over
there and do it or something.

986
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:16,410
That'd be great last night
and drank a lot. He drinks.

987
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,860
It was neat because most
pieces of Tobar I have a,

988
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,730
I have scotch or bourbon and
a, you know, put it in a nice,

989
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,810
they're like nice glasses for
it. Yeah. And uh, you know,

990
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,840
usually it's like halfway
kind of pores have it serve.

991
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,920
He would then he would do it poor and do
it to the rim of the glass. Oh my God.

992
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,120
Of the necks of the
niceness and glad is rough.

993
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:44,490
That is rough. I don't know.

994
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,130
There's a man that puts the car,

995
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:56,790
the call out for somebody
to be his baby daddy thing.

996
01:04:56,791 --> 01:05:00,010
Yeah. And then what's the woman
like who, who's answering the call?

997
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,530
It is also somebody injured who wants to
explore to make money from injured men.

998
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,600
It's a prostitutes is
going to be somebody.

999
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:09,740
It's somebody who was
also compartmentalize,

1000
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:13,650
but as I will tolerate it to
a certain point and fuck it.

1001
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:16,440
I'll just be interesting.
And what about women who make fart videos?

1002
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:20,680
What's the deal? I could
do that. And what's the,

1003
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,870
you'd be the cake Fart, I think, right?
She was sitting in the cakes farting.

1004
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:30,250
I know her, right Tom? I got, yeah,
I got it. Is it really that wrong?

1005
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:33,800
She always sees, you know,
sometimes we played uh, like uh,

1006
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:37,650
dom videos and like there's this
one where they like, they'll,

1007
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:40,990
there's some guys who actually
like getting kicked in
the balls and punching the

1008
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:44,440
them really hard to why? Yeah.
Have you seen killing eve yet?

1009
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:51,160
What's that? Oh, you'll go
insane for this killing eve. Wow.

1010
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,930
It's like a nine part series,
but it's what Sandra, Oh,

1011
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:57,250
won the golden globe for them. Oh
really? Yeah. And it's uh, it is she eve,

1012
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,940
she's w they're actually
in a weird way to Eve's,

1013
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:03,820
but she's one of the eaves and the,
um,

1014
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:05,350
and I can't explain
about you're seeing it,

1015
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,490
but there's a scene where a guy gets
his balls clamped and like I said,

1016
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,370
I don't know. I mean we've, we've
watched these for a laugh and it's,

1017
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:16,450
it's really crazy to,
and sometimes I got to tell you there's,

1018
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,400
there's a lot of stuff that I just
don't fully get what I mean, I'm like,

1019
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:23,560
like I don't know that you physically
can, can get by or get Polish with. Yeah,

1020
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:28,150
me too. I don't quite get it. Every time
we've watched these things, she goes,

1021
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,500
I could do that. I could do, I
could, that'd be fun to do it.

1022
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,710
She expresses show me one, I want to see
your reaction. We'll see it in real time.

1023
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,370
Can you show me once we don't have a week,
clearly I have to come back.

1024
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,000
You have to come back. Yeah.
That's another thing for him. Yeah,

1025
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,120
we actually were having to, my truck
is, we're actually running out of time,

1026
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,660
but there's like, all
right, I will be back.

1027
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:53,130
I'll be back and come watch my
show here on this platform. So

1028
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:02,140
we didn't even mention there's
a fart Mike here. Mike,

1029
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:06,850
if you have a fire. Love it. Did
she say my con? Yes, many times. Um,

1030
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,170
by the way, uh, we had a new hats
made or no, if you like these.

1031
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,400
Oh, I'm not sure Rachel,
and I'll let you have that.

1032
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,750
How did we get those emails
working on the, the lights? I think

1033
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,060
it was Mel. Yeah, the lighting designer
worked on a show and he brought these in.

1034
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:31,240
So anyways, would you like one or no,
it's okay. I want to give him to the fans.

1035
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:35,990
Okay. Yeah, we're selling
them for like, do I wear the

1036
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,200
thing all the time. Oh really?
Oh cool. You know, the last
stand, if I saw you did,

1037
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,440
you spoke differently about your dad that
I've ever heard you talk about? Yeah.

1038
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,190
Oh yeah.
Usually I didn't know.

1039
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:52,500
It was funny cause I have Christina's
idealised view of your dad, right? Yeah.

1040
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,660
And you were a little bit more realistic,
let's say.

1041
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:59,960
Probably closer to I,

1042
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:03,240
I'm interested in that too.
As time goes on we'll,

1043
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:05,900
we'll dig into that a little bit.
Dad loved it, but whenever you say,

1044
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,670
hear me use the word Wunderman,
it's, it's that I wonder, I wonder.

1045
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,870
I'm thinking our money, whatever.
Whenever I see right. That's how I know.

1046
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:16,560
Cause I've heard you say right, but
even you know it, even when you know it,

1047
01:08:16,561 --> 01:08:19,250
it still works. It still
works. It works no matter what.

1048
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,380
I know it's one of those things.
She goes,

1049
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:25,340
I have a fantasy that bump up by and I'm
like, God dammit. Is that what I'm doing?

1050
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:29,000
And then she's great. She gets it every
time. So how have you been therapy?

1051
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:33,340
10 years? I did 11 years and I contemplate
going back for a psychoanalysis.

1052
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:35,660
We love to do that. I'll
tell you it. Yeah. Anyway,

1053
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:40,640
I've got a great lady I'd like
to add or a psycho analysis,

1054
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,920
but I had to commit to like four or five
times a week at staff would want to sit

1055
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,850
on one of your sessions to see,
literally,

1056
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,640
literally I wrote my therapist
and node years later I went,

1057
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:56,420
how the fuck did you tolerate that
boring bullshit for all those years?

1058
01:08:56,430 --> 01:09:01,340
That's really no. Nothing like you
can be. No, I think they get bored.

1059
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:04,050
I'm sure you get bored.
I mean, no, cause she,

1060
01:09:04,051 --> 01:09:06,740
she was very attuned and
she's busy attuning to be,

1061
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:08,420
and that's what I needed
and I'm still like,

1062
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:11,730
how did you tolerate all the droll
and nonsense for all those years?

1063
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:14,960
Just like thank you for just sitting
through that because there really wasn't

1064
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:17,810
anything to complain about.
I have a good life.

1065
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:23,470
My parents were shitty. Yes. Oh,
that's plenty to complain about.

1066
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,120
So I did it for 10 years. Yes, I meant,

1067
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,010
but that's how long it takes
to get into that. I know.

1068
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:30,770
And I had sort of trauma light compared
to what some people experience,

1069
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:34,550
you know what I mean? So, yeah. But don't.
Don't minimize your trauma. Thank you Tom.

1070
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:38,720
Thank you Allen.
But we celebrate trauma on this show.

1071
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:43,700
Oh yes you do. Yes you do. Is there
more video from me? Is there one more?

1072
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:45,650
I don't know it come.
Daddy is, was that it?

1073
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,340
Well we want it to be
cognisant of your time.

1074
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,710
I'm kind of running out and stuff but
I'll come back to do we have two on the w

1075
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,940
on the books now? We
got to do already. Yeah.

1076
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,100
There's a couple of things we definitely
have to show him when he comes back.

1077
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,330
We've got to get deep into the dog
thing cause I think, well the smell,

1078
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:05,430
it has a smell.
It's important.

1079
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,870
Talks about smell and creating your own
smell too. Like smell like Jesus, stop.

1080
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:11,160
I'll get to see this.
But top was so gross.

1081
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
When you finger on the crack,
gas does smell it.

1082
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:22,790
Okay, so on these matters, that's
different. That's a guy. What's he saying?

1083
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,640
That's only smells. Okay. He's,

1084
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,510
he's having anal sex with a woman pulls
out and there's some shit on his day and

1085
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:34,730
then she's like, I don't want to do
it anymore. He goes, it's only submit.

1086
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:38,870
It's just okay to get her
to keep doing it. It just,

1087
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:43,490
it just speaks volumes about men. That
is his kneecaps could be bleeding out,

1088
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,820
falling out. He'd be like,
it's just, just keep going.

1089
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:49,880
You go and they do keep going.
That's the amazing thing. He really,

1090
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:54,260
to me the more amazing part is not him
but the woman that he's going like,

1091
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:55,094
what the hell?

1092
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,990
We also have clips of delusional men
who are like missing teeth and clearly

1093
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:01,850
disheveled in, they're
like, I want a virgin.

1094
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:06,680
I want a woman who 120 pounds only
the best for me and what is wrong?

1095
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,230
Can you play for him real
quick to see is like a minute,

1096
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,460
just today's opening clip.

1097
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:15,310
Just the first just to get him
like [inaudible] properly. Well,

1098
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,280
just to see like what would you
think is going on with this guy?

1099
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,320
I mean like whenever
you open with that Tom,

1100
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,860
I get a shutter down my spine.
What's going on with this guy?

1101
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,290
I just want to see what's
going on. Yeah, go ahead.

1102
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:36,560
All Yo beautiful women. You
feel me? This let me eat you.

1103
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:40,690
One term is,
let me eat your one time and you go,

1104
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:44,060
I guarantee you you're gonna, you're
gonna ask me to stick to your house.

1105
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,390
You go here, you go to sleep
for three days. My baby

1106
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,870
and he goes on. I love him.
He's pretty great, right?

1107
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,290
I haven't lovely offers to cook and clean.
Oh my God,

1108
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,230
this is just take a bath when
you get home. If I were a woman,

1109
01:11:57,231 --> 01:12:00,710
he'd be Damn fucking bring him. He's
my husband. Yeah. How could you not be?

1110
01:12:00,711 --> 01:12:05,711
It's just overtaken by that and somehow
somewhere really put together on buddy

1111
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:10,190
actually went for that. That's why he's
able to do that. I would like to know who,

1112
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,770
probably a mirror image.
I'm expecting

1113
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,690
we can find her in your video pile too.

1114
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,790
But now I'm wondering,
I'm really wondering what's going on.

1115
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:26,540
Is He, is he on the streets? Do we know?
It looks like a, it's kind of like that,

1116
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:31,220
right? Yeah, it's a yard
somewhere. It's astonishing to me.

1117
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,880
There's this,
this world of

1118
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:40,340
skis oid skis to effective schizophrenia,

1119
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:41,780
that sort of zone,

1120
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,680
the things they can believe about
themselves and their place in the world is

1121
01:12:45,681 --> 01:12:49,280
always just, just delusion,
delusional and it to me,

1122
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:53,060
and it may be subtly delusional, like you
can call this settle if you want. Yeah.

1123
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,860
I call it kind of subtle. Uh, and it's,
to me that's just, I just, I just,

1124
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:01,190
it's one of the, I have zones,
right? Like I can't like process.

1125
01:13:01,191 --> 01:13:03,520
This is one of those zones.
You can't wait.

1126
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,490
I can't relate because I have low self
esteem and I don't feel I feel small and

1127
01:13:07,491 --> 01:13:12,310
that important and stuff.
And to have somebody go, hey
man, let's go. I'm the batch,

1128
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:13,790
I should be the president.

1129
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:16,040
And the truth is you could
probably eat somebody real well,

1130
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:19,820
but you're just putting out
videos like that and maybe hit it.

1131
01:13:19,821 --> 01:13:23,180
He'd have to like build up to that point
where he could actually gauge and said,

1132
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:26,630
behavior. Call me crazy,
Colby. Fucking crazy.

1133
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:31,190
A good, bad for my soul. This is going
to be bad for my soul. I know it.

1134
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:36,220
That's why I'm having this horrible
thought. Like, Oh, what have I done? Why?

1135
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,820
But this is why I know I've got a
problem. Why do they not have teeth?

1136
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,470
It's always part of it, isn't
it? Just on these videos,

1137
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:50,400
there's poor lighting and it's what topic
did the teeth are missing? It's in a,

1138
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,450
usually you go, oh, that must be
math or coat or something else,

1139
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,990
but it's not necessarily a drug
addiction and it's in that schizophrenia,

1140
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:00,560
schizophrenia forms cause while effective
and some of these people can be in

1141
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:05,000
kind of kind of in the world, they just
aren't really in the workplace. Right.

1142
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,520
You know what I mean? They, they,

1143
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:11,150
they may be dependent on somebody and
they may kind of look sometimes seminoma

1144
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,580
and these days they get
caps and things and see you.

1145
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:16,960
If they have like a family that's taken
care of you and you miss the teeth part,

1146
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:21,010
but the teeth is a, is a clue. Yes. I
think so too. Yeah. How fascinating.

1147
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,040
Because part of not being in the
reality. Right. Right. That I,

1148
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,940
this is all a mess and, oh,
well anyway, let's go eat

1149
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:33,270
this trip.
Right.

1150
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,680
We will. A doctor drew, I hope
your fans are happy there.

1151
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,600
This is a, oh, that's fine.

1152
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:46,020
That's amazing. And you're going to
be here. I'm going, I'm going down.

1153
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,220
I'm going with them. I'm
going, if I need to stop now,

1154
01:14:50,221 --> 01:14:55,040
please go to Dr Com and give
me your thoughts. Absolutely.

1155
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:59,010
Yeah. But as now I'm, I'm going
with them. And where else,
by the way, this, this pod,

1156
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,270
you can get a Dr. Carr everything. It'd
be Dr Com. Yeah. Everything. So Graham,

1157
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:02,790
what is it?

1158
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:06,000
A doctor drew Pinsky and I'll do some
Instagram lives and stuff and maybe we'll

1159
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,590
do Instagram live like maybe
routinely starting these shows. Sure,

1160
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:11,930
yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I just
wanted to say that the, uh,

1161
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:15,890
the new show he'll be doing will be
available as on this youtube channel on

1162
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:19,940
Fridays. Um, and it also be available
to download if you want to listen to it.

1163
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,890
And it'll be doctor drew after
dark after dark. All right. G,

1164
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:25,820
D d a

1165
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:31,570
dean,
a Di Da Di da Di da Dad.

1166
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:34,440
It's going to be the dad
bod. Okay. We'll be back

1167
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,290
talking about floats and Dick's break.

1168
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,770
So real quick,
I know,

1169
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:45,070
thank you for sticking around an extra
minute or we were about to just jump off.

1170
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:49,800
Yep. But, uh, but we couldn't
resist one of our producers and,

1171
01:15:49,801 --> 01:15:54,270
and a great comic and friend Josh Potter.
Uh,

1172
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:58,930
we were talking about this
the other day. Um, Josh,

1173
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,700
go ahead and tell what happened.

1174
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,550
Well, uh, so Dr drew,

1175
01:16:02,551 --> 01:16:06,930
I just want to preface this by saying
my first job in radio was born hopping

1176
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:11,760
love line really when I was
19, uh, back years ago. Where,

1177
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:15,930
what studio? We've had many, many. I
worked for one oh 3.3 the edge in Buffalo,

1178
01:16:15,931 --> 01:16:19,710
New York. Oh, okay. So you were, okay. So
you were at one of our affiliates. Yes.

1179
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,390
I was just bored hopping. Not Yours. It
was a satellite. Yes. Have nothing to do.

1180
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:26,790
So I listened to the show often and uh,

1181
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:30,510
I decided I needed help with
something, so I'd call in. Oh.

1182
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:35,040
And I called in and told my problem.

1183
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:39,390
And then you said, oh boy,
another delayed ejaculation call.

1184
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,310
And then you hung up on me.

1185
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:49,300
What happened? What is the one,
no, as a person who does radio,

1186
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:53,350
I understand why you did what you did.
The show needed to move and you need it.

1187
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:57,040
I wasn't in control of the phones as
well, so it wasn't me. I'm sure. No,

1188
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:00,850
I think it producer maybe hung up on it
and it's a Corolla. But go ahead. Okay.

1189
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:05,530
Yes, no. So I, I never got the
ants. All right here we can also,

1190
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:10,070
it's still well, yes, yes, yes, of
course. Well, no. So I mean it is

1191
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,840
still an issue and I have not, I have not
read it. It is the fact that I can stay,

1192
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:20,180
I can maintain, I just go back, go over
the top. What's that all about? So I,

1193
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,060
I'm thinking of it more of a biological
thing that people want to make it a

1194
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:25,830
psychological thing that you're not
willing to be open and free and new.

1195
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:30,170
Give of yourself to the
person. Kindergarten teacher
beat him mercilessly. Okay.

1196
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:34,430
Well there's that. Strangely,
that's what happened to me.

1197
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,450
My kindergarten teacher grabbed
me and shook me to my babies.

1198
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,620
Had I could have that done to him
and mine kindergarten. They do.

1199
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,330
We're in the same kindergarten. I'm
sorry, back to check on his dick. So,

1200
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:51,480
uh, are you ever able to
I have like twice. Okay.

1201
01:17:51,481 --> 01:17:54,620
So what of course went with myself
of course. Right. So we did,

1202
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:57,350
unfortunately it has to do is
bring himself right to the point,

1203
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,040
has he knows how to do and then
include his partner in his head.

1204
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:05,240
Then I really think it's, it's,
it's, it's very hard to treat.

1205
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,790
And I think one of the reasons is
where her treated cause he didn't so

1206
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:10,850
biological, it's just, I, I understand it.

1207
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:15,260
The guys that tend to be more on the
premature side, it seems incomprehensible,

1208
01:18:15,261 --> 01:18:19,490
but that's cause that biologist so
very different. And uh, there is no,

1209
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,540
I mean people talk about
treatments and things.

1210
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:24,650
I've never seen anything that's really
very effective other than you got to work,

1211
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,910
you have to have a steady partner,

1212
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,610
you have to work with him
or her regularly on this.

1213
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,070
And they have to be sort of willing
to kind of go along with it.

1214
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:34,460
The big thing would be like a
regular partner would probably,

1215
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,480
I just need someone who can push the
right buttons. No, it's actually not that.

1216
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:42,980
It's somebody who's willing to
watched you or listen to you or or,

1217
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:47,840
or have you do what you need to do and
then get themselves involved in that in

1218
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:50,290
various ways. We've got to
start with a coffee date first.

1219
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,240
I think the video we learned earlier
in the show. Send a video. Yeah,

1220
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,150
maybe with a full on how to
and that they are into that.

1221
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,990
Do you have like really kinky little
secret things that you do to get yourself

1222
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:05,630
off me? Yeah. No, not at
all. I'm pretty mundane.

1223
01:19:05,631 --> 01:19:09,140
I think I'm very mundane and whatever
it is you got to bring that to.

1224
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:14,141
Then basically all sex though just ends
without you finishing all of it all.

1225
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:17,340
All right. It can be very
effective. Right, but all like here,

1226
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,770
every time Tom asks a question about it,
so I keep thinking I'm fast, I'm fast.

1227
01:19:21,771 --> 01:19:25,670
How's this work on fat
Super Fan? I understand.

1228
01:19:25,671 --> 01:19:29,930
I saw that every question
you asked children. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, without kids.

1229
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:34,280
I'm still just like that,
but that's my usual.

1230
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:38,560
I'm just, I'm just amazed though. I'm just
amazed. I'm saying like, I want if the,

1231
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:41,690
if we can get anything out of this show,
it's just for Josh to come.

1232
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:46,610
So the is it, is it possible you'll
have to keep tuning in? Really?

1233
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,110
This'll be going so well. You
help them out. Lead? Nope. No,

1234
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:54,200
I don't think with your head. But
we talked to him. I'll talk to him.

1235
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:59,370
Can we just it, but will you talk through
it more? She of course. Okay. I want Josh.

1236
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,010
Josh line would be that guy.

1237
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,583
Drudgery.

1238
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,930
I can't wait someday. That'll
be you. One day. My Baby.
Can't wait. All right, thanks.

1239
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:16,620
Thanks guys. Alright, and we're back. Uh,

1240
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,670
we have switched out guests. We
tossed one into the trash. Oh my God.

1241
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,430
We picked up another one.

1242
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:28,850
This guest is a longtime friend
who I would venture to say is even

1243
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,233
a Sunday.

1244
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,270
What am I? Good buddies. Good
buddies, a great comedian,

1245
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,730
great podcast or Ryan
Aka sickle cell second.

1246
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:46,740
Look,
it's,

1247
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:51,740
I'm very excited to be here at day
one of your mom's house studio?

1248
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:56,690
Yes. It's studio jeans. Oh, his
studio gene inside studio jeans. Oh,

1249
01:20:56,691 --> 01:21:00,530
I'm inside studio jeans at your mom's
house. I just got to learn the lingo.

1250
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,890
That's got to learn the lingo man.
Jeans at your mom's. Uh, yeah.

1251
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:08,150
You were asking about my
pup play mask. Yeah. So,

1252
01:21:08,151 --> 01:21:09,830
well I was asking you about that mask.

1253
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:13,580
You clarified that it was a pup play mass
that could have been a Halloween mask.

1254
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:18,340
No, it doesn't look sexual.
No, it's just scared.

1255
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,170
Scared. A couple of friends, that guy.

1256
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,750
They're nice guys and we just hang
out and we put any of these guys,

1257
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,420
like seven guys would getting cages.

1258
01:21:26,421 --> 01:21:30,060
We put tales in and then a guy
basically trains us, you know,

1259
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,800
an outside one inside a dominant
one in or you got an outside,

1260
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:37,340
he's got like a sick outside
owner outside the cage.

1261
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:42,030
And he commands owner. Yeah, he's
an owner but it's not sexual. Again,

1262
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,860
it's guys to hang out,

1263
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:48,940
get to know each other and chill dues
that want to just relax bit like I got it.

1264
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,950
I got a rock wilder mask at home.
I'd love to come play with you guys.

1265
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,620
Rock Wilder and rock people at Maryland.

1266
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:00,470
I used to hear these dudes
always call a German shepherd.

1267
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:02,600
I heard a guy one time
called a German shepherd

1268
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:06,690
problem. You got Doberman Germans,
Europe are all wrapped up wrong.

1269
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:09,230
German

1270
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:13,750
shepherd. You know, you have
such a unique accent and no,

1271
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:18,040
it's like Mississippi or
something like that. But we were,

1272
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,670
we were going over because Christina
doesn't know how to say certain things.

1273
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:25,900
Could you tell me, I saw that you did
see that? How do you say that word?

1274
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,490
The mini word. The full version.
Miniature. Miniature Mina. Sure.

1275
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:32,590
Not Miniature.

1276
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:38,230
It's not the queen's English
says miniature. What many? A Cha.

1277
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:43,390
There was no queen over here. Number
one in jeans studio. There is,

1278
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,350
is that,
I want to get that right.

1279
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:52,620
Uh, here's a, here's a true test.
Go ahead. How do you say the,

1280
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,410
the wax,
um,

1281
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:00,780
that you color with a crayon versus
what else is the other option or crown

1282
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:06,060
crown. Crown. Crown.
Yeah. I've never heard

1283
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,250
that. Queen's English wears the crown,
but I'm fucking color when though crowds,

1284
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:14,200
I've never heard. You've never heard
crowns that's really from crayon. I, well,

1285
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:17,650
I did get crown a lot from kids in school,
like, Hey Ryan, do you have any crowns?

1286
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:20,770
And I'm like, [inaudible] 64 of
them right there. I'll be like,

1287
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,870
none of these are crowns.
Now pray on,

1288
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,740
there's a word that I've been saying
and correctly that I just figured out.

1289
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:30,850
It's dissociation,
not disassociation.

1290
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:36,160
I've been saying it incorrectly
for my entire life. I'll be honest,

1291
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:39,200
I don't even use that word.
M B, a t I t you know,

1292
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,350
come back to combatitive.

1293
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:47,020
I was saying combatitive instead
of combative like you're making,

1294
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:49,240
you're going to make me confess on,
oh,

1295
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:53,680
there's a word where I add that extra eye
and it's a all, what the fuck is that?

1296
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:57,760
I can't say, Oh, I've got to
think of it. It'll come to me.

1297
01:23:57,761 --> 01:24:01,210
There's one where I add an I to and I'm
like, there's not. That's not there.

1298
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:05,910
Fuck yeah. We wrote down
so bad. It is with ks,

1299
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,310
plural.
People throw the s on the,

1300
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:12,890
on the Nordstrom's to
always throw a Nordstrom.

1301
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,770
Pronounce this word.
Ryan.

1302
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:19,750
S. T. A. T. U. S. Status,

1303
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,820
status. Status. Status. Status.
So some people do say status.

1304
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,920
What about, what about Da ta data?

1305
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:32,850
I see data on that. I
say data. I looked at it.

1306
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,590
I think I'd go more data. Data. Yeah.

1307
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:40,870
What about that school in
Indiana or also the, you know,

1308
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,950
and otre regardless.
Just played a company Notredame yeah,

1309
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:51,260
you said it right, right. It's
Notre Dame. Goddammit. Dom.

1310
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:56,480
He's right. Yeah. I mean America is Notre
Dame. Notre Dame. I said no for dumb.

1311
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,350
Especially if I'm hanging out with
like college football buddies.

1312
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:05,710
Let's well damn game. Yeah.
They love it. They love it.

1313
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,610
The fans here are really into the Alba.

1314
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,310
That's a hardcore college
football fans love.

1315
01:25:12,311 --> 01:25:15,190
What are you guys wearing in your ears
right now that aren't the headphones I

1316
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:18,480
have on my head that they're sitting here.
A Gucci is fucked, but these are nice.

1317
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:21,190
These are inner ear ones. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1318
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,770
I to put on my winter jacket
cause it's so cold. It's, yeah,

1319
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:28,270
it's studio cold in here. Feels
the same shit. You're alert though.

1320
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:33,550
I'm while I'm on point. Notre
Dame, Notre Dame, Notre Dame.

1321
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,110
Um, have you ever had this where
you're talking to somebody,

1322
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,150
you're having a normal conversation
and you ask them like a basic question,

1323
01:25:40,151 --> 01:25:40,984
like where are you from?

1324
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,660
And then they have to close their eyes
and they're talking to you like this

1325
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,780
asked me why her friend Christina,
where are you from? Well,

1326
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:52,570
I was born in Windsor,
Ontario,

1327
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:56,620
Canada and then I moved to La when I was,

1328
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,970
that was five seconds where
if I see that my ass was gone

1329
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:07,620
go. You ever see that? That's
your window to run? Yeah. Yeah.

1330
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,493
You get that a lot

1331
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:13,520
when you engage someone out of
kind of kindness and humanity,

1332
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:17,300
like a toll booth guy or the guy
in the lobby and you're like,

1333
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:19,670
how's it going man? He was
like, funny that you asked

1334
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:25,290
start and he's like, yes, you're the first
guy that asked me that shit. All of it.

1335
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:28,910
What do you want? Start with childhood
and you're like, what the fuck man,

1336
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,400
here's my book. Open up to the chapter
one right there. We'll start out,

1337
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:36,600
I'm going to put it on. It's like your
drivers that you keep texting me about.

1338
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,030
They love to tell you wait,

1339
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,400
goes dry. The same guy, that same guy,

1340
01:26:42,401 --> 01:26:44,560
but that's not that crazy
if it's the same company,

1341
01:26:44,561 --> 01:26:49,360
but at the same guy in different, the
first time he picks me up, he, this guy,

1342
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,590
he picks me up and he goes, terminal
six today, sir. And I go, yeah,

1343
01:26:53,591 --> 01:26:57,910
it's a nice nice guy. He's wearing
a suit, big, you know, SUV,

1344
01:26:57,911 --> 01:27:02,470
like a suburban. And I start
emailing and then make a phone call.

1345
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,120
And when I finally hang up,
I look up,

1346
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:07,190
I realize we're pretty close
to the airport, so I go, oh,

1347
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:08,950
or make a pretty good time.
He goes, cause I fucking

1348
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,940
drive man. And I was
like, what? He goes, oh,

1349
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:18,740
you know, you see this hands on 10 and
two kinds of shit. I don't fucking ran off

1350
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:22,350
fucking drive, man. And I go,
yeah. And he's like, you know,

1351
01:27:22,351 --> 01:27:23,910
you see a lot of stupid shit out there.

1352
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:27,960
I mean all the professionalism just come
on. He goes, you see lot of stupid shit.

1353
01:27:27,961 --> 01:27:31,440
Lot of times you wonder why is it stupid
shit happening and you pull up is cause

1354
01:27:31,441 --> 01:27:34,470
there's a stupid motherfucker in
the car. And I was like, yeah,

1355
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:38,640
true. That is true. You can drop me out
here if you want. I feel like he's like,

1356
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,840
he's like man ramping up.
And then

1357
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:46,080
so I text both you guys about that guy.
Two weeks go by,

1358
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,930
I see a walk out with my bag, go to the
airport. This time I see a sedan, Nice.

1359
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:54,030
A nice car.
And

1360
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,390
I had my bag and I'm like this,
this is the guy I think, you know,

1361
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,970
I don't say anything. He's
like, how are you doing?

1362
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:08,160
Put the bag in the car in the trunk
and I get in the back and he closes the

1363
01:28:08,161 --> 01:28:12,540
door. I go, this is a nice ride. And he
turns, he goes, I call this the pussy cat.

1364
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:19,520
I swear to God immediately
car can I sit up front?

1365
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,100
And then he, he starts turning around.
He goes, I ain't buy like this. You know,

1366
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:29,490
everybody wave, it means shit. And I was
like, okay. It's like a nice, isn't it?

1367
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:34,140
Is it something like it's a nice sedan.
Like I have Mercedes or nothing bigger.

1368
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:37,080
More than that though.
No, no. Nothing flashy.

1369
01:28:37,081 --> 01:28:39,990
Draw like pussy wagon on the back
of fucking Quinten. They're not,

1370
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:44,490
it's not sexy.
He fucking turns the car around.

1371
01:28:44,491 --> 01:28:48,480
We're going to the stop sign that
is 40 yards from our house. He goes,

1372
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:53,430
I fucking a couple of older
bitches, I swear to God. And I go,

1373
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:57,180
really? And he goes, yeah man.
Cause I got a theory like what is,

1374
01:28:57,181 --> 01:29:00,990
he goes women and they sixties.
It's like the pussy comes back to,

1375
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:06,480
and I go, all right. And he's
like, he's like, yeah man,
these won't fuck want, fuck,

1376
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:10,500

goes, the body sometimes tight,

1377
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:13,050
but they can't hide that face man.
I'll fucking rank lives.

1378
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:15,180
Don't look them in the
eye. And I go, okay,

1379
01:29:17,570 --> 01:29:22,570
how about [inaudible] work?

1380
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:27,690
He starts, you know, he's uh,
he's like, yeah, amazing. I
got this other bitch. She,

1381
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:31,050
she's a tease though, you know, she'll
play with my Dick and uh, you know,

1382
01:29:31,051 --> 01:29:34,530
fuck around, smoke something, drink
something. But then I'm just trying to,

1383
01:29:34,531 --> 01:29:36,960
I'm trying to fuck her. She'll say she
has to go home. I told her, I said,

1384
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:40,250
I ain't got no guy. I've got no time
for that shit because when this digging,

1385
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,420
it's ready to go, man. And then it's like,

1386
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,510
how would you say he was probably in
his sixties too late fifties he's like

1387
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:52,520
talking about the old [inaudible].

1388
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:57,360
So we're in the car business. He
just citizen. How old are you? 60

1389
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:03,450

And I'm like, all right. You know,

1390
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,980
just kind of like having
one of those moments.

1391
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:09,400
He told me this crazy story and
I'm just quiet and he goes and my,

1392
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:12,750
you ever notice when you don't come,
how that'll fuck with bitches mind?

1393
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:17,180
Oh my God. Like I don't have that
problem. Yeah, right. I'm like,

1394
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:26,010
yeah, but that's, that's his
conversation and then we put the,

1395
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:30,930
he's like, have a nice flight.
So crazy Tommy. I know. What
did you say to all that?

1396
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:35,070
I was just laughing and like, or I
would, did you record any of it? No.

1397
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:39,870
I thought about it then I felt this
audio. I know I wanted some audio. He um,

1398
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,280
I'm sure I'm going to get him again.
I'm sure they're going to,

1399
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,440
if the guys come twice, it's like, it
feels like he came twice last night.

1400
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,200
He gives him old,
old bitches.

1401
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:51,960
I don't know if he'd go get him a good,

1402
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:57,990
he's always told me he sounds like
he's just jog. I don't like this shit.

1403
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:00,590
He told me that and I was like,
that's cool. The guy. Yeah,

1404
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:05,280
the guy that's got your life in his hands
and the wheels on ain't give a fuck.

1405
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:12,170
What? He was like, God, I fuck all
that to two shit. All these airbags,

1406
01:31:12,171 --> 01:31:14,820
bags and shit, man. I didn't have
any of that when I was a kid.

1407
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:17,840
Let's see what this thing is.
Ready to dive right into a semi.

1408
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:20,370
Like it's all right when that man,
he's a wild dude.

1409
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:27,160
I don't give a fuck. I'm not, tonight
I'm going to talk for by trade, by trade.

1410
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,543
He's a

1411
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:34,860
second Manco but you have
a knack for psycho drivers.

1412
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:38,410
Remember the guy they used to pick us
up and we lived in Korea town. Yes.

1413
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:41,730
He liked to smoke crack.
I talked about that dude in a special.

1414
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,240
How did you find out or drop them?

1415
01:31:43,241 --> 01:31:45,130
I like to smoke or there were
usually actually pretty good.

1416
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:48,060
I was going to say they're pretty open.
This dude he ran,

1417
01:31:48,061 --> 01:31:49,540
I mean this is when like,
you know,

1418
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:54,950
this was like the best option for us at
the time for an airport ride because a

1419
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:56,660
crack at this,

1420
01:31:56,670 --> 01:32:00,320
well y'all come long ways to studio genes.

1421
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,091
So what is that?

1422
01:32:01,091 --> 01:32:06,091
I get a ride like a car
service from crack drivers.

1423
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:08,860
So right here guys,
I'm proud of you

1424
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,500
guys,
studio g but if you have the,

1425
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:16,450
if you need to get to the airport and
like in these are flights for like our

1426
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:19,860
middle weeks and you know like yeah,
start starting to do no money.

1427
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:24,250
So he would be, he was for a long time,
he was reliable cause I'd be like,

1428
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:29,370
I have a flight at 8:00 AM and I need to
get picked on. He says, right. Yeah. Um,

1429
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:33,490
and I need to get picked up at like six
30 or whatever. And he would be like,

1430
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:37,180
I'll be there. I'll be up.
Do you know why though?

1431
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:38,620
Because he'd already been up partying.

1432
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:41,580
It was up a neighbor cause that's
where he bought crack. That, that,

1433
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:45,790
that neighborhood's really Latino and he
won't say the name of the street that I

1434
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:48,550
remember. Carondelet yeah, that's right.

1435
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,050
That name has stuck with me for some,

1436
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:56,110
it's such a weird Carondelet.
It's actually, I think you
could name someone that,

1437
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:56,870
yeah,
no,

1438
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,703
you could

1439
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,680
maybe like use my girlfriend
Karen sounds like a first team.

1440
01:33:03,681 --> 01:33:05,240
All ACC safety or something.

1441
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:09,730
The little pockets right then Carondelet
he'll shake. It's like corner.

1442
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:13,490
Uh,
one of the,

1443
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:18,290
he drove and he was like,
I like, I like these girls.

1444
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,930
Then we pulled up and there
were like young Latin girl.

1445
01:33:21,931 --> 01:33:24,650
He's creeping up next to him because
we were pulling the stop sign he can,

1446
01:33:24,651 --> 01:33:28,460
cause I liked these. He goes, I love the
little brown ones, man. I was like, okay.

1447
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:32,870
And he was in his sixties,
you know, he's like, oh,

1448
01:33:32,871 --> 01:33:37,250
I like these little brown ones. Man.
I'm really like, okay. And then, yeah,

1449
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,230
a one time he was a,
he's like, you want to,

1450
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:43,870
you want to hit like as of what we'd like,
he's still driving.

1451
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:46,370
But first I thought
you're going to say crack

1452
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,210
and drive us to the airport.

1453
01:33:50,211 --> 01:33:54,950
He get high as he was driving us running
the car service and never asked once if

1454
01:33:54,951 --> 01:33:58,670
you're okay with that or the smoker.
And he was like, I mean, he's like,

1455
01:33:58,671 --> 01:34:01,410
are you cool or what? You know? And
I was like, yeah, don't be a pussy.

1456
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,090
Then he's like, this shit. You know

1457
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:15,770
from like him talking about weed,
I'm like, yeah, I'm cool with weed.

1458
01:34:15,771 --> 01:34:16,900
And he was like,
well,

1459
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:21,310
it really misses the fucking hardcore
stuff and talking about smoking crack,

1460
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:24,010
I was like, really? Like you
do that? He's like, I mean,

1461
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:27,160
every once in a while I'll do
all the time. So I was like,
oh, you still, he's like,

1462
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:30,890
I dabble. You know when it's time to
like have some fun, you know, I'll,

1463
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:32,680
I'll fucking,
I like to just freak myself.

1464
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:35,380
I remember he told me that I like
to get real high. Just freak out.

1465
01:34:35,381 --> 01:34:36,214
Looked through the people

1466
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:40,950
look likes. Oh I remember.
Yeah. We were like,

1467
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:46,920
like about, I said, cause I, I'm like,
what do you like about smoking crack?

1468
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:50,430
What do you enjoy? And he said, I, I get
real paranoid and freaked out. And I,

1469
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:53,130
I like to look out to
people and see his coming.

1470
01:34:53,131 --> 01:34:56,580
I'm like terrible until this moment.

1471
01:34:56,581 --> 01:34:58,220
I've never even considered

1472
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:03,220
the fact of just the sheer volume of
humans on this planet at any given point.

1473
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:04,370
The billions of people,

1474
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,150
a percentage of them probably do like
to be scared and freaked the fuck out.

1475
01:35:08,151 --> 01:35:12,080
And it makes sense. Maybe that's what,
maybe that's what the crack addicts are,

1476
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:16,420
that percentage of people that really
have a high, tall joy that yeah.

1477
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:19,610
But also I have a high tolerance for weed,
but also I'm a weed smoker.

1478
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:22,880
I would smoke my weed
of good. Uh, you know,

1479
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:27,430
probably two minutes after I dropped y'all
off, I wouldn't be smoking weed alive.

1480
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:31,590
No, no, no. What I'm saying is this
though, do you ever have, you did,

1481
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,570
does the experience exists for you where
you've gotten too high and you're a

1482
01:35:35,571 --> 01:35:40,160
little paranoid? Yeah. So one of my
friends is a daily smoker. You pee,

1483
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:43,160
you know people who have like
contraptions, like you know,

1484
01:35:43,161 --> 01:35:47,240
you put this volcano thing
and here wait to all of it,

1485
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:51,830
this motherfucker and there's like
shovels and all kinds of,

1486
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,690
what are you doing?
It's always the newest way to get,

1487
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,680
and then the weed is never just weed.

1488
01:35:57,681 --> 01:36:01,490
It's like there's crystals and they said
this to the moon and they brought it

1489
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:04,490
back and it's got all types of Shit.
And then you know,

1490
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,630
it was in the rain forest and you're like,
all right man. It's like you smell it.

1491
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:13,040
You're like this unbelievable looks crazy.
So this dude,

1492
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:17,690
I smoked a little bit and I go,
yeah man, I, I'm way too high.

1493
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:22,130
I'm kind of freaked out. And he's
like, yeah, me too. And I go, I go,

1494
01:36:22,131 --> 01:36:25,220
don't you smoke every day? He's
like, I do this every day. I get,

1495
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:29,060
I get to that like paranoid
freaked out part. And I go,

1496
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:32,870
why don't you hate it? He goes, yeah,
but then I liked going back there too,

1497
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:33,704
you know?
So like I,

1498
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:37,040
I hate it while I'm this freaked out
and then I go back and I do it again.

1499
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,570
So he likes to live in that anxious state.
Yeah.

1500
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,440
Can I tell you say I get it now, now
that I think of it, cause you know,

1501
01:36:43,441 --> 01:36:44,860
I'm just thinking about what
you were saying like, you know,

1502
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:48,840
were here like done too much acid and
you're like, oh I got to hold it together.

1503
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:51,330
Do this. Got It. Okay. But
whenever you do too many drugs,

1504
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:53,880
you have to hold it together and
you're just trying to hold together.

1505
01:36:53,881 --> 01:36:57,540
And it's like all your focus
is in holding it together.

1506
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,370
And there's something freeing about that.

1507
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,640
It's like when people rock climb
or do something dangerous, right?

1508
01:37:02,641 --> 01:37:05,280
You're so present because you're just
trying to hold your shit together.

1509
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:08,460
You're in survival and when you're in
survival, you're not thinking about bills,

1510
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:11,190
your divorce. It's a good point.
The children, you're ignoring

1511
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,350
whatever to smart things today.
It's crazy.

1512
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:20,440
Do I get a star? Yeah. Well, you have
this chart. I'm gonna get you a new hat.

1513
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,080
The hat comic, right? Yeah.
I've got loads of, Oh shit.

1514
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:28,890
You got to put on one of these toboggans
not what people call them. Beanies. Yeah,

1515
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,570
she's really cold. Yeah. You look
good in a beanie, Christina. Yeah.

1516
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,940
Let me try it out. I gotta get a
y on h one. I was going to say,

1517
01:37:35,941 --> 01:37:38,190
do you guys sell those cars?
You should ours. Oh wait.

1518
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:40,290
You'll learn why you got to show you.
I've got to show you this.

1519
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:44,910
So this was where I'm watching
over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So
there's, uh, this, this, uh,

1520
01:37:44,911 --> 01:37:49,410
these twins were on in Australia on
Australian TV. I'm a twin. I should know.

1521
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:54,500
Check this out. They're mixed race twins.
I always forget that. I'm not sure.

1522
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:56,070
These are twins.
At listen to

1523
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,830
read science,
you got to listen to the,

1524
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:04,040
I've read sign the anchor, like, just
clearly listened to what they say. Okay,

1525
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:08,550
go ahead.
One of the sisters is obviously bike.

1526
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,433
Briova is wide.

1527
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,090
The Alma twins come from a
mixed race family in the UK.

1528
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:17,170
Maria has taken off to her half Jamaican
mom with dark skin and Brown eyes and

1529
01:38:17,171 --> 01:38:21,920
curly dark hair, but Lucy got her dad's
fair skin. Good on it along with straight.

1530
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,920
Look at the guy. He's like, I said,

1531
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,140
the way Mike Myers snapped
his head when Kanye said,

1532
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,260
George Bush doesn't care about black
people. He was like, wait a second.

1533
01:38:33,261 --> 01:38:34,700
This is live right now.
I'm stuck with that

1534
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:40,790
math labs almost shot off.
He said,

1535
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:45,680
your wife, congratulations on you.

1536
01:38:45,681 --> 01:38:49,160
Good on you got the white stuff.
You got the good stuff,

1537
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:51,253
by the way,

1538
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:55,700
very observant. I watch down here.
That went from 24 degrees, 25 degrees.

1539
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:58,470
It's almost the same temperature
in this God damn studio right now.

1540
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,660
Wait,
let's hear it again

1541
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:07,820
and is there please tell me some why
I reacted out of that. What's that?

1542
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,080
One of these girls say anything
about it? No. No. Wow. That's
terrible. They're like,

1543
01:39:12,081 --> 01:39:14,720
we hear it. All the sisters,
twins turning heads.

1544
01:39:14,721 --> 01:39:16,310
This dude turns his mother fucker.

1545
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:17,923
He does.

1546
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:21,470
Oh,

1547
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:25,880
my twins come from a mixed race because
look at the guy's taken off to her half

1548
01:39:25,881 --> 01:39:29,180
Jamaican mom, dark skin and
Brown eyes and curly dark hair.

1549
01:39:29,181 --> 01:39:34,090
But Lucy got her dad's first skin good
on it along with Oh, unbelievable.

1550
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:39,340
And she says dark skin. She goes down
and tell him what she says that. But she,

1551
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:45,090
no, no. Yeah, I like your restaurant.

1552
01:39:45,091 --> 01:39:45,720
Is this Australian,

1553
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:49,410
I'm assuming? Yes. Yeah. Do
you guys really an accent
again? That was really good.

1554
01:39:49,411 --> 01:39:51,910
Right? Go ahead. The other twin got, uh,

1555
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:56,910
her father's fast skin
and complexion and uh,

1556
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,050
ah,
Gotcha.

1557
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:04,570
Father's fair skin and
complexion and supremacy.

1558
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,650
Yes.
She does go like,

1559
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:17,120
and then the other guy got the God stop.
So sorry for you.

1560
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:22,010
But her twin sister got,

1561
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:27,180
oh, the goodness of the white.
I felt like a say. Yeah,

1562
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:32,700
but don't worry. The other sister was
not as unfortunate. She got the whites,

1563
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:34,170
the whites.

1564
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:41,810
How old is this? I don't know what
you'll do with that red hat, but oh well.

1565
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:47,080
It's unreal. My life. Fantastic.
I've read a good honor.

1566
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:49,270
Like I said,
science and um,

1567
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:54,940
you can actually have two kids from
two different dads who are twins.

1568
01:40:54,941 --> 01:40:57,730
Like there's a,
this is what I read.

1569
01:40:57,850 --> 01:41:01,420
There's a small window where you could
actually impregnate a lady twice,

1570
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:05,800
two different people and they come out
the same day, everything like this.

1571
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:10,000
And by definition you're twins because
you're in there at the same time and

1572
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:14,200
everything. Sure. But it
doesn't necessarily mean
biologically. That's the same.

1573
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:18,350
That's a real hoe though, right there,
right. She's, it could be, well,

1574
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,800
it's a real slot. That one, you know,

1575
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:25,630
unfortunately gave a child dark skin,
but hey, she made up for it. Yeah.

1576
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:29,510
Probably had sex the next day to
balance it out. Yeah, that's true.

1577
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:31,380
It's been a three slides.
Could have been a threesome.

1578
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:32,500
That could have been Chelsea lately.

1579
01:41:32,501 --> 01:41:36,820
Once we did a story where a woman had
to uterus to uterus and both of them was

1580
01:41:36,821 --> 01:41:40,710
impregnated. Come on by two
different daddies too, I think. Yeah.

1581
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:45,940
And you can and then have both those
babies. Yeah. Out of your pussy. Wow.

1582
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:50,890
Out of your mind. Not My boss. How do
you pussy hole. Hey, by the way, uh,

1583
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:55,990
I love the bird made you think
of anything. Uh, before I forget,

1584
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:58,390
we have the official,
your mom's house Fart Mike.

1585
01:41:58,391 --> 01:42:01,300
So if you feel as what you have to
fart during the show, let me know.

1586
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:04,210
I'll turn it on. You have to turn it
on and then you go ahead and park.

1587
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,620
I kind of feel like I was an inspiration.

1588
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:09,160
Did I not tell you guys you should have
a fart Mike or fart on the mic or you

1589
01:42:09,161 --> 01:42:13,330
should record it or some maybe not
take credit for something. Okay, well,

1590
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:17,980
oh sure. Okay. Um, so I can
just get up and grab that.

1591
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,640
Oh boy. Oh, you have to, you
have to power it up. Yeah.

1592
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,820
You wouldn't want to miss that.
She's real excited about,

1593
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:33,190
give me a five minute heads
up if you've got a power. Um,

1594
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:37,960
I feel good. I don't have any
guest speaking of farts. Let's, uh,

1595
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:41,270
check out this. Check out.
This already start off.

1596
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:44,680
It's already started off.
Good. Check this out.

1597
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:50,530
No, I shouldn't eat so much, baby.

1598
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,060
Why is you could get into me. Yeah.

1599
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:57,760
Cool.
You know,

1600
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,160
seems like that something's
going to happen, you know,

1601
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:06,580
doesn't it feel like it's about
something's about to happen?

1602
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,440
Something like if I'm her,
I'm moving,

1603
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:12,690
right?
Oh No.

1604
01:43:12,691 --> 01:43:15,280
Rush to boot and they're giddy up.

1605
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,130
Bite my head. Okay, I'm ready.

1606
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,880
What is going on with you guys?

1607
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:30,450
Must know she is not been put our mouth.
No she's not.

1608
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:32,250
I thought he was gonna Fart.

1609
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,950
I thought he was going to Fart and
accidentally shit all over her.

1610
01:43:34,951 --> 01:43:38,040
That's where I'm at. Let's see what
happens. Well, were at your mom's house.

1611
01:43:38,041 --> 01:43:38,874
That ain't happened.

1612
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,720
Right.
And her full face Co.

1613
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:53,660
Oh my God. What is happening?
You know what's interesting?

1614
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:58,661
We fart on our dogs' heads and one of
them does not like it and the other one

1615
01:43:59,271 --> 01:44:03,020
does is again, yeah, I want to
make sure I see this correctly.

1616
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:19,230
That's in her mouth. That's
gold. That's gold veins, right?

1617
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:24,570
Lack of respect is what that is for
yourself. She put herself back there.

1618
01:44:24,571 --> 01:44:25,404
He didn't make it.

1619
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,170
He wouldn't even ask.

1620
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:35,783
That was her.

1621
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:40,570
Yeah.

1622
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:42,850
That's how you come. Okay. I mean

1623
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:47,350
it's rare that a woman
enjoys the vets with Dessa.

1624
01:44:47,351 --> 01:44:49,730
What stands out the most is that like you,

1625
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:52,540
I mean if that's the other
way around you're like, Yep,

1626
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:56,890
there's just another sick
fucking guy. Right? Like it's
just, there's just endless,

1627
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,300
one thing we've learned doing this show,

1628
01:44:58,570 --> 01:45:02,440
there's an endless amount of sick
fucking guy, man willing to do anything.

1629
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:06,580
But when women do it, it definitely stands
out more. It's special. It is special.

1630
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:10,820
It is spelled, she's a neat trick. She is,
hey, she's making this guy really happy.

1631
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:15,880
It gets to go baby. I got a fart about,
she was like, well hold up, hold on.

1632
01:45:15,881 --> 01:45:20,200
Don't waste that shit. And then she
gets him positioned face in his,

1633
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:23,620
told him to hold. Hang on real
quick man, don't let that loose.

1634
01:45:23,621 --> 01:45:27,130
I want all of that one of those
like bite his lower lip kind of like

1635
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,030
she was all,
that's what I like.

1636
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:34,420
God Damn Hillary Clinton
never did that to me.

1637
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:43,510
No, never did that to me during that. I've
got the burps but not the farts today.

1638
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:48,730
Yeah, that's a tough one for me. Cause
you could be the best woman in the world.

1639
01:45:48,731 --> 01:45:51,250
But if you were like, if
you were everything. Yeah,

1640
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:56,050
I mean a good person to my daughter.
Great to me.

1641
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:59,490
I shouldn't say great to everybody. My
daughter included. Not just good to her,

1642
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:00,373
great to me,

1643
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:06,280
but if everything checked off and
you were like, I'm a millionaire,

1644
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:11,170
you don't ever have to work again. I
couldn't kiss you. I couldn't. I'm sorry.

1645
01:46:11,171 --> 01:46:11,750
What do you mean?

1646
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:16,300
I could know that the one hang up
of all the shit on the list is like,

1647
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,660
I just like you to Fart in my
mouth. I would be like, I can't,

1648
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:21,640
that's a deal breaker for you.

1649
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:29,380
I have to disagree with you.
Pass you pass.

1650
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:33,030
I does it have to be done on
video or can be some shit private.

1651
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:34,360
Whatever needs worried.
She's like,

1652
01:46:34,361 --> 01:46:39,090
don't you go fucking wasting those
God damn farts and she's not there.

1653
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,870
And then when you fart she fingers.

1654
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:50,100
I'll tell you what. Here's what, here's
what's good. I'm already entertaining it.

1655
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:54,600
Yeah, that is so nasty. I couldn't think
about, you've got my asshole there. You,

1656
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:58,350
I hope Hillary Clinton. That's me.
That's right. I left you that message.

1657
01:46:58,351 --> 01:47:00,180
Clinton eight my asshole.

1658
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:07,500
That was back when I was smoking and
drinking whiskey row when I was in my

1659
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,560
sixties the way back to this. So this is
awesome. This angel comes into your life.

1660
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:14,150
Yeah. And she does
everything right. Right.

1661
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:17,690
Everything money to like unlimited
money. I don't even have to worry, honey,

1662
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:21,240
you don't have to work. Come
here and pocket left your
daughter. She likes to be,

1663
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:23,550
she's like, I love the
ravens. I want to go to games.

1664
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:28,530
I just want to you a box about your
box. Let's have crab cakes. She's,

1665
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:31,200
you know, she's just the best. You
just love everything about her.

1666
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:34,680
And then she's like, just fart in my
mouth. You know? Not even every day,

1667
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:38,670
every other day. I mean,
look, it will be tough.

1668
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,500
It's all I can think about it.

1669
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:44,520
That's that one thing is
all I can think about.

1670
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:46,770
Not everything else
you just listed at all.

1671
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:49,260
Like we'd be flying to a
ravens game and I'd be like,

1672
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,550
I haven't kissed this woman right here
and I just farted in her mouth last night.

1673
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,130
I don't know. I don't think I could
do that. I think you get over it.

1674
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:59,970
I don't think I can mentally get
paid. I would try. Here's the thing,

1675
01:47:59,971 --> 01:48:01,170
I don't that I have the stomach.

1676
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:06,420
Okay, I hear what you're saying. That
that part is kind of nasty. The the shit,

1677
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:10,970
the FARC particles and are barely nasty
sparely now I agree is barely Nancy.

1678
01:48:10,971 --> 01:48:15,590
You can fart through the fabric of your
genes and that way the particles don't

1679
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:20,290
get in her mouth of poop. But, but
here's my thought. In terms of fetishes,

1680
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:23,270
he's like, Huh, let's,
and in terms of fetishes,

1681
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,970
it's a really easy one to accommodate.

1682
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:30,170
You're not really actively doing magic
set for what you normally would be doing.

1683
01:48:30,171 --> 01:48:34,490
You, you would normally fart anyways.
She's just enjoying what you normally do.

1684
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:36,470
It's kind of a blessing in the sky.

1685
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:39,830
You have, and always have
had a way with me, Christina.

1686
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:43,010
So I'm going to entertain it and say,
okay,

1687
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:47,690
you're not 100% wrong because it's not
me that's getting the fart in my mouth.

1688
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:50,720
I am delivering the Fart.
And when you say it like that,

1689
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:55,820
I might be able to power pastor for
a few months. But what if you fart?

1690
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:56,900
You have to fart through.

1691
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:59,600
Could you imagine if I brought her over
and you didn't know anything and then

1692
01:48:59,601 --> 01:49:03,440
when we broke up your guys will be like,
why did you guys split? I'd be like,

1693
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:06,890
number one,
I just can't fart in her mouth anymore.

1694
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,043
That's what she's doing.

1695
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:20,990
Any woman wanted that? I
don't. I couldn't get past it.

1696
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:25,170
I could seriously, is that
the deal breaker? I just,

1697
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:28,040
why wouldn't know that? Like I
don't have done that. By the way,

1698
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:30,170
I've never had that
precedent set where I'm like,

1699
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,840
I'm not going to date any woman that ever.

1700
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:34,730
This is the first time it's ever been
asked to me and it's the first time it's

1701
01:49:34,731 --> 01:49:36,410
ever, well, let them present

1702
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:37,720
threshold.

1703
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:42,520
What if she insisted on wearing this
dog mask when during your lovemaking,

1704
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,190
is that a deal? Every time,
every time it sort of thing.

1705
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,260
That's a deal breaker. She wears it.
That's a deal breaker every time.

1706
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:55,630
What do you, how do you see it? What about
role playing? What if she's just like,

1707
01:49:55,780 --> 01:50:00,280
you know, just call me like a
Puerto Rican slot or something.

1708
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:01,600
But she's white,
you know,

1709
01:50:01,601 --> 01:50:05,020
like she has some type of like race play
fantasy or something. What if she, yeah,

1710
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:09,010
and it's like horribly racially
offensive for you. I actually was,

1711
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:12,460
I had that one time what I was with,

1712
01:50:12,461 --> 01:50:16,810
I was dating a black girl who wanted me
to talk to play that kind of shit and

1713
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:20,500
bed and I was like,
nope, really? No, no way.

1714
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:25,300
She said call me names, yes.
Offensive names. And I was like,

1715
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:30,290
no,
like Carondelet

1716
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:35,980
I was like, I'll go
Carondelet that is it. Okay.

1717
01:50:35,981 --> 01:50:37,930
Just give me a ballpark.
It was the n word.

1718
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:42,760
One of those was other ones
were just other horrible
just things. And I was like,

1719
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:46,980
I can't, couldn't get past the n
word, so I don't even remember what

1720
01:50:50,130 --> 01:50:51,540
turns me off

1721
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:55,643
like that.

1722
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:00,540
But she wasn't saying it to
say it does not turn me on.

1723
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:02,530
So she was like,
call me that.

1724
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:06,670
That was one of the things and just
other just filthy, nasty, horrible shit.

1725
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:11,630
And I was like, I'm good.
Filthy by the way. Uh,

1726
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:14,200
the one who the one,
no,

1727
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:19,220
they the girl who stayed at your house
and like know that that crazy girl that

1728
01:51:21,131 --> 01:51:21,964
was not her one,

1729
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,900
that was an email and it was all because
of an email you and I exchanged and she

1730
01:51:25,901 --> 01:51:29,350
got my password and read that email that
you and I exchange and that's why she

1731
01:51:29,351 --> 01:51:31,240
got mad because they're totally different.

1732
01:51:31,241 --> 01:51:35,470
Girl is a totally different girl is not
that at all. But um, I met this girl,

1733
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:37,240
she ended up staying
at my place one night.

1734
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,790
I left ahead of her and just was like,
whatever.

1735
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:44,590
And she hacked my password on my computer
and just went through emails and saw

1736
01:51:44,591 --> 01:51:48,940
one that you and I had said and it
was nothing. It was a simple joke. Um,

1737
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:53,050
and I really don't remember what it
was, but she was just like, fuck you.

1738
01:51:53,051 --> 01:51:56,620
How dare you talk about me like that.
He's clearly hack my password.

1739
01:51:56,621 --> 01:51:58,960
So I changed it and I was like,
leave me alone. I'll leave you alone.

1740
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,720
And that was it. But it really
wasn't anything terribly offensive.

1741
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:03,790
She just was pissed that
we were talking about her.

1742
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,540
What kind of horrible things to the
other lady want you to say? Go ahead.

1743
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:10,100
The one we were already talking about,
she's like,

1744
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:13,450
call me the n word as we're doing it.
I mean like filthy.

1745
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:17,680
You were that you up. How does she set
you up for the race? She's like daughter,

1746
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,740
does she go like, wait, does she
listen to this show your daughter? No,

1747
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:26,260
she will tell you. That's
true. How does she set you up?

1748
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:30,230
Like you guys are, is it like
you're making out for a while? Well,

1749
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,960
if it was set up this way,

1750
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:36,760
it wasn't like this one time
gradually got to getting crazier.

1751
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:37,630
Like it was,

1752
01:52:37,631 --> 01:52:41,140
there was one time where she was staring
me in the face so much and we were,

1753
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,390
we were done.
I said to her,

1754
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,750
I feel like you wanted me
to call you a bitch. And she
goes, I did. And I was like,

1755
01:52:47,751 --> 01:52:50,240
Holy Shit. And that's
where it started. Like,

1756
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:53,690
she kept getting at it like
call me names and I was like,

1757
01:52:53,691 --> 01:52:56,510
I'm not going to fuck us
cause if I'm wrong, uh,

1758
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:58,890
I mean that is not going
to be a good thing. Sure.

1759
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:02,960
But who knew how wrong I was allowed to
be and they do it. But I'm saying did,

1760
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:06,940
did the next time when it did it come
up again like in the heat of pull them

1761
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:09,770
bitch just became a thing cause I didn't
have a problem calling. Oh really?

1762
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:15,020
Whatever. If that's, I don't
mind bitch. But yeah. Um,

1763
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:20,140
for that slot, that stuff, if she
was okay with that, I'm like, oh,

1764
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:23,810
that's your thing. That's fine. You're
requesting it. But so you were going,

1765
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,300
you're going along with that part of yeah,
we'll get a little bit.

1766
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:30,860
And then it got to like, when the request
came in for like, for the tip top,

1767
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,173
was it,

1768
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:36,710
was it in like are you like naked or
is it like you're just having dinner?

1769
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:38,510
She's like, Hey, by the way at
night, what do you step it up?

1770
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:39,980
I think they were at Shakey's.

1771
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:43,693
Yeah.

1772
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:49,060
Yeah. Uh, I really don't remember,

1773
01:53:49,061 --> 01:53:53,380
but I would probably say
at that point we were just,

1774
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:58,120
I mean we're probably even at that point
like still close on just making out

1775
01:53:58,121 --> 01:54:01,350
talking and stuff like that and then she
started like, you know, and I was like,

1776
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:05,950
yeah, let me just stop going. That's
interesting cause like you can generally,

1777
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:09,213
yeah.

1778
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:15,890
Yeah. I mean can't eat generally
gauge when someone is like game,

1779
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:16,981
like you know what I'm saying?

1780
01:54:16,981 --> 01:54:21,060
Like it's kind of bad on her to not gay
that maybe you weren't comfortable with

1781
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:26,520
that kind of stuff. I don't
know. It's an odd choice.

1782
01:54:26,970 --> 01:54:30,530
It's an odd choice.
It's definitely an odd choice for good.

1783
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,910
It would've been amazing if she had said,
what'd you do that? And you're like,

1784
01:54:32,911 --> 01:54:36,930
I've been waiting the whole time
but only at the grocery store.

1785
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:39,470
[inaudible]

1786
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:44,440
thank God you asked man. I was just
like, I still to this day that's a,

1787
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:46,930
this the same graph said this
before on stage and everything.

1788
01:54:46,931 --> 01:54:50,470
This is the same girl that when we first
had sex she said out loud to herself,

1789
01:54:50,471 --> 01:54:54,760
but way out loud. I can't believe
I just slept with a white guy.

1790
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:59,500
I'm loud. Yeah. This is hilarious to me.
I laughed so fucking hard. I was like,

1791
01:54:59,501 --> 01:55:02,310
that is great. And then it
progressed and I was like, that is,

1792
01:55:02,311 --> 01:55:06,220
this is turn not great here guys. That's
what I fuck. I never heard this story.

1793
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:11,090
I forgot about it until you, uh,
played this, this romance here.

1794
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:17,650
Get me all fired up here. And
a studio. Jean's mother. Oh,

1795
01:55:17,651 --> 01:55:22,210
before, before we, I don't, I don't want
to forget about it. The new podcast.

1796
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,520
It's called the honeydew.
Yeah, the honeydew. Uh, you
can subscribe now. You can,

1797
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:29,720
you can start listening to it.
It's a big group.

1798
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:34,360
You can get a prescription
right now. Um, audio,

1799
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:39,730
audio is going to start coming
out on Mondays, right? Yeah.

1800
01:55:39,731 --> 01:55:40,960
So we're going to move things around.

1801
01:55:40,961 --> 01:55:44,310
Currently right now
through January audio only

1802
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,980
until we get in the studio
and do video is Wednesday.

1803
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:48,720
Every Wednesday through January,

1804
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,740
we hit February and we
officially get in the studio.

1805
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:57,570
We're going to slide audio to Monday,
video to Tuesday. Okay, perfect.

1806
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:02,760
And the studio or the video you can
watch here on the y youtube channel.

1807
01:56:03,010 --> 01:56:06,540
Um, you're going to be over
on this set here. Studio.

1808
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:09,780
What's that set to set to set B?
Yeah,

1809
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:14,910
I'm also native.
Can you jump on for one second?

1810
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:19,320
You set up a separate, uh,
channel for clips, right?

1811
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:24,890
So now people can subscribe to what is
the youtube.com/your mom's house clips

1812
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:29,310
and that's like highlights and things
like that of all the shows that we'll be

1813
01:56:29,311 --> 01:56:32,520
putting out from the main channel.
So full episodes on the main channel,

1814
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:35,430
which is the one you're
currently subscribed to and
have the clips channel is

1815
01:56:35,431 --> 01:56:37,260
where all the highlights are going.
So if you want a watch,

1816
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:40,140
like the three minute thing or the
clip or like the highlight of this,

1817
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,710
this call is animation or whatever,
those will all be on the clips channel.

1818
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:47,910
Full episodes only will be on the main,
correct.

1819
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,150
Now can I ask a question as an
audience member and fan as well.

1820
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:53,700
So we will have one,

1821
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:58,380
your mom's house youtube page where
all uh, shows will live. That's right.

1822
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:03,420
And then a separate completely
clips from all shows. Yes. As well.

1823
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:06,540
Yeah. That's great. Yeah. So you
can, you can just, you'll get,

1824
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:09,240
you'll get clips from all these shows.
Um,

1825
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:13,440
so in February you can look
forward to watching the show.

1826
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,770
I'm the honeydew on Tuesdays,
right.

1827
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:21,320
Your Mom's House Wednesdays,
Dr Drew Fridays. Um,

1828
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:26,100
I'm not sure about there's another show
or two. We'll know soon, whatever. Um,

1829
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:32,180
but honey do, you did do the first
one I did with, uh, Josh, he was my,

1830
01:57:32,181 --> 01:57:36,430
he, so I'd like to have a rotating
cohost at times that I vibe with the,

1831
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:41,250
I just think also I'd like to have promote
and come on and laugh with. But, um,

1832
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:44,400
yeah, he was the co host
for that. Basically,

1833
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:48,870
I introduced myself to anyone who
doesn't know what the fuck I am,

1834
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:51,530
which is pretty much as you did
the crappies for years. Yeah.

1835
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:54,930
And reintroduce myself and I don't
know that I've completely got,

1836
01:57:54,931 --> 01:57:58,620
I don't think I ever really got into my
story that deep on crab feast I think I

1837
01:57:58,621 --> 01:58:01,480
did on other podcasts.
Um,

1838
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:04,720
and it got a lot of a really good,
um,

1839
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,820
response and reviews and even Karen
Kogarah for my favorite murder,

1840
01:58:08,821 --> 01:58:11,180
gave it a shout out and
it was a huge bump. Yeah.

1841
01:58:11,181 --> 01:58:16,181
So very excited for the things
ahead and to be here in a studio,

1842
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:21,090
jeans at your mom's house and
Christina, have you been, I'm stoked.

1843
01:58:21,091 --> 01:58:23,640
I really want you to be,
once we get cameras up,

1844
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:26,520
I really want you to be like number one,
if you can do it,

1845
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:30,420
we got to talk about you and
I always talk about it anyway.

1846
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:35,370
Might as well just record it for
a fucking change. That'd be great.

1847
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,940
The premise is of honey
do for those of you don't.

1848
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:42,070
So the premise of the honey
do is just highlighting and

1849
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,990
laughing at the low lights of life.

1850
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:47,920
Anytime you've ever felt
thrown away or not good enough.

1851
01:58:47,921 --> 01:58:51,610
Or it could be a life story,
it could be an individual story.

1852
01:58:51,611 --> 01:58:55,840
Maybe it's a divorce or a,
a firing from a job or whatever.

1853
01:58:55,841 --> 01:59:00,841
But it's all about the negative in life
and laughing in the face of it and,

1854
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:05,040
and coming out on the other side.
And looking back and being like, God,

1855
01:59:05,041 --> 01:59:08,140
I remember when I thought that shit was
the worst and thank God that happened.

1856
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,740
And why is it called honey deal?
It's called the honeydew because a,

1857
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:13,200
I was eating one night and,

1858
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:16,980
and I didn't eat the honeydew out of my
fruit cup because I never eat the honey

1859
01:59:16,981 --> 01:59:21,981
do out of my fruit cup and I don't have
a serious like hate for honey do I just

1860
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:23,360
don't fuck with the honeydew.

1861
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:27,400
And then when I walked out I saw it
everywhere on the tables and I was like,

1862
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:28,720
oh I'm a honeydew.

1863
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:33,040
I've been thrown away time after
time and break people's hearts.

1864
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:35,710
I wanted to know.
I want to laugh at that shit cause it's,

1865
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:39,580
it's empowering and it's therapy and
it's helpful, sweet and delicious.

1866
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:43,450
If you get a good one, if you get a
good one, there's nothing wrong with it.

1867
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:46,910
But since then I had a fruit
cup yesterday. I've tweeted it.

1868
01:59:46,911 --> 01:59:48,540
They didn't even bother with
the fucking honey do there.

1869
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:52,180
What do we wasted our money on that shit
for. People been tweeting at me like,

1870
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:55,720
hey, here's the fruit platter left at
my work and it's like three pieces of

1871
01:59:55,721 --> 02:00:00,290
cantaloupe and honey dew on a bed
of lettuce. Someone's, I said,

1872
02:00:00,291 --> 02:00:04,600
who the fuck's putting fruit on lettuce?
I like cantaloupe but not the honey.

1873
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:06,210
I do too.
I like cantaloupe.

1874
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:08,950
There's a small percentage of
people that do like honey do.

1875
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:11,950
Just like there's a small percentage of
people that want farts in their fucking

1876
02:00:11,951 --> 02:00:16,040
mouth from their loved ones. So very
small. The honeydew is the fart.

1877
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:21,130
That's right. By the way, it's
that woman of the fruit world.

1878
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:23,440
Let me put a call out.

1879
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:27,520
One time we put a fart call out to guys
who have the fart fetish cause we were

1880
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:31,600
like, come on like are you for real?
And these guys wrote in who really?

1881
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:33,610
They're like,
yeah and they explained their whole thing.

1882
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,020
I just want to put a call out.

1883
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:39,360
If there's any women out there with
the with do they really want you to

1884
02:00:39,361 --> 02:00:40,870
definitely going to
want to hear from them.

1885
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:45,530
You're going to hear from them the one,
it's like shame her.

1886
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:48,760
She's, well no, here's the
specifications. It's not like,

1887
02:00:48,761 --> 02:00:52,900
do you like it when your Hubby farts? Are
you around? That's what I want to know.

1888
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:56,080
Do you want to put your mouth up on it?
It's a thing for you.

1889
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:58,570
It's one thing that Dutch oven somebody,

1890
02:00:58,571 --> 02:01:01,690
it's another thing to just put the shit
right in the oven. You know what I mean?

1891
02:01:01,691 --> 02:01:06,550
Like God, Oh God, it makes
my stomach turn. Uh, by the
way, do you want to give him,

1892
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:08,230
we were discussing before.
Sure.

1893
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:11,410
What you would do if you
could eat anything and never,

1894
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:15,320
Tom and I had this discussion
a while back. You know,

1895
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:19,210
there's a point where you turn 40 or even
your late thirties where you can't eat

1896
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:21,670
shit. Bass for me, like early
thirties. But yeah, go ahead.

1897
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:25,600
Like you just can't fucking eat the
way you did. And it's a bummer. Like,

1898
02:01:25,601 --> 02:01:28,200
now we have the soda at the
House, like Stevia, Shit.

1899
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,820
Like you can't even drink a soda
because you're going to get fucking bad.

1900
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:32,163
So I was like,

1901
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:37,340
what would you do in order to be able to
eat whatever you wanted and never gain

1902
02:01:37,341 --> 02:01:38,620
weight?
Like what would you give up?

1903
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:41,540
And so we start running through
this stuff and I was like, Tom,

1904
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:46,320
would you give up a tooth just missing
one tooth, but you can eat anything?

1905
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:50,390
Hell No. She was like, what
about one of these bags,

1906
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:57,100
grandma teeth back here didn't bother
back. Whatever I want and never gain.

1907
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:00,310
I was like, yeah, yeah, that's a good
deal. And that tooth Doug brought,

1908
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,040
it's already gone. You save them money
all around. It's a win win. There you go.

1909
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:09,260
So we all agree that we'd lose a tooth.
He's easy. What's the next one? Okay. Uh,

1910
02:02:09,261 --> 02:02:13,730
would you live in Nebraska? Okay.
And here's the stipulation. I know.

1911
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:17,930
Well, I'll say, here's my answer.
This is what I look like right now.

1912
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:20,930
I don't live in Nebraska.
I'd rather just look like this.

1913
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:27,200
But here's the thing, you, you live in
Nebraska. Nine months out of the year,

1914
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:30,470
you're allowed to travel.
You can travel for catch spring training,

1915
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:32,600
go eat whatever I want.
I was somewhere else.

1916
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:35,030
But you're eating everything
you want in Nebraska.

1917
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:39,800
Keep in mind so you know
it's American gravy and shit.

1918
02:02:40,590 --> 02:02:45,210
Jury. Oh, you do as
gravy. Mashed potatoes,

1919
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:49,460
like Vietnamese food, pot
roast, garbage. I can't, Shit.

1920
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:52,880
One time I made a mistake. Somebody
invited me over for dinner. I was like,

1921
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:53,960
make whatever you want.
And they were like,

1922
02:02:53,961 --> 02:02:56,360
I'm going to make pot roast and
carrots. And I was like, I'm not coming.

1923
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:00,530
That's the one thing I probably should
have fuck up. Put on my list. Boiled. No,

1924
02:03:00,531 --> 02:03:04,340
I would not do that. I wouldn't
live in Nebraska. No. Even Omaha.

1925
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:09,680
Well, no. Yeah. Again,

1926
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:11,990
this is what I look like.
I live in Los Angeles.

1927
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:15,420
If the choice is to stay looking
like this in La, I'll fake it.

1928
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,800
I'd keep these extra 20 pounds on me.

1929
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:23,340
That Katie's extra 40 live out here.
Yeah.

1930
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:29,870
You need that in Nebraska.
Those nine must be cold in Nebraska.

1931
02:03:29,871 --> 02:03:34,820
You're skinny like you're a Nebraska 10
but what if you in your mind are like,

1932
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:39,830
I want to be fat, I want to be fat.
Then stay where you want. Exactly. Yeah,

1933
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:40,820
that's true. No, you're right. Okay,

1934
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:44,480
so we all agree we're not going to
fuck Nebraska. That's right. Okay.

1935
02:03:44,481 --> 02:03:49,481
What'd you sleep in the dog crate with
the dogs at night like you know I put

1936
02:03:49,851 --> 02:03:51,410
bitsy and fee for then goodnight Tommy.

1937
02:03:51,411 --> 02:03:54,560
And you go in the crane and just get
to eat what I want. Nothing. I'm good.

1938
02:03:54,561 --> 02:03:58,730
I'm good on that.
Will you clean up crime scenes like nope.

1939
02:03:58,790 --> 02:04:02,200
Like really horrific, brutal
crime scenes. There's a,

1940
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:05,680
then you can eat whatever you
want. Yes. I wouldn't take that.

1941
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:08,310
Can I tell you a story? No, you wouldn't.

1942
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:16,220
You would be vomiting every, everywhere.
Every time will be some new shit.

1943
02:04:16,221 --> 02:04:19,490
Like an eyeball on a wall up here.
You're like, I'd seen that shit.

1944
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:22,640
This attitude of like,
no problem is such bullshit.

1945
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:25,580
Then I can come home and eat
lasagna and eat my feelings away.

1946
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:30,200
You would not even make it. You wouldn't.
You would be so physically though. Yes.

1947
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:35,420
I feel like I got it. Just a woman
torn open, like come desensitized.

1948
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:39,150
Know what you're talking about.
Yeah. Become fucked up. Call.

1949
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:43,290
Not desensitized,
but think how skinny I'd be in hot to who?

1950
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:45,430
The dead people are looking at
you every day. They don't need me.

1951
02:04:45,431 --> 02:04:48,750
They can't even say, Hey, you look nice
lady. You know what? We get my, Oh,

1952
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:53,460
I'm over there. I like it here in
Lincoln. You look, are you with Lincoln?

1953
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:57,150
10 girl. All right. Well would you sleep
on a dog crate with my dogs? Hell No.

1954
02:04:57,570 --> 02:05:00,840
No one's dog or a dog
house. No, that's not easy.

1955
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:04,890
What about pooping outside?
Like my dogs every time.

1956
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:09,360
Every time you have to beat
your opponents. Yeah, a
no problem. Not a problem.

1957
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:12,750
Man's great IP outside. Last
night, a few times I peed outside.

1958
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:14,970
We were in the backyard.
Yeah, having a cigar.

1959
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:17,760
You pissed in my backyard a
number of times. Your boy,

1960
02:05:17,761 --> 02:05:19,800
what do you think your boys are
going to be paying? No, I know,

1961
02:05:19,801 --> 02:05:23,520
but did the exam and then birthday too.
Great.

1962
02:05:23,521 --> 02:05:26,520
He drops his pants to his ankles
to take a look like a child. Yeah.

1963
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:31,410
I'll show you your toddler. Um, so I,
so you would pee and poo in my backyard.

1964
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:36,090
No problem. I do that even if
I look like this. Look. Yeah.

1965
02:05:36,091 --> 02:05:39,620
Cause that's, Oh my God. My
friend did that at though.

1966
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:43,170
We went to a ravens game
match the urinals for the men.

1967
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:45,240
There's like a lie to 10
deep at every one of them.

1968
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:48,420
Bob Buddy walked up and dropped his pants.
There's God,

1969
02:05:48,421 --> 02:05:51,900
they have ankles like birth did right
there at the front of everybody just peed.

1970
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:54,280
I just could, I could not stop
laughing. I was like, what?

1971
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:58,140
There's a hundred fucking feet
one. Okay. Give three kids.

1972
02:05:59,890 --> 02:06:04,110
What if, what if you can eat anything
you want, but every time you,

1973
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:08,590
you start a show, a standup show,
okay. You just subtly say Heil Hitler.

1974
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,633
My Name's Ryan.

1975
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,300
No,

1976
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,690
you mean the one time I get to say that
I get the look like what I want for the

1977
02:06:14,691 --> 02:06:18,990
rest of them.
I'm good.

1978
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:23,810
But what if you got to say it on talk
shows and stuff? Yeah, no, no, no.

1979
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:28,110
I know I'm good on that. Oh, I'll
go 300 pounds. I ever do that shit.

1980
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:31,440
I'll be like, wheel me out.
They said I'm ready. Alright.

1981
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:34,340
What if you just have
to work a Heil Hitler

1982
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,970
in conversation? You don't have
to start with, he used to be like,

1983
02:06:37,050 --> 02:06:40,800
you just have to find a way to work it
in that organic. You would do that. Yeah.

1984
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:43,080
Yeah, you would. I'd be like, you know,

1985
02:06:43,081 --> 02:06:46,980
funny thing Ryan and I'm studying the
Holocaust Heil Hitler and a funny thing

1986
02:06:46,981 --> 02:06:51,240
they used to say and I would work.
Do you want to do that?

1987
02:06:51,470 --> 02:06:56,400
That's easy. I feel like that blue band
so far, shitting and trusting in your, uh,

1988
02:06:56,460 --> 02:07:00,630
what'd you do? That one, and it is just
Jewish. Just squeeze in a Heil Hitler,

1989
02:07:00,930 --> 02:07:04,280
but to be able to eat anything you
want and never gain weight. Ooh.

1990
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:05,780
And all I gotta do is say,

1991
02:07:05,781 --> 02:07:10,220
how is it that you have
to find a way to say hi.

1992
02:07:10,221 --> 02:07:14,660
It was gotta to be like, Hi Hitler
like that. Hi. Hi. That's a high,

1993
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:19,160
that's a friendly, hello.
Yeah. Oh Dude, dude,

1994
02:07:19,161 --> 02:07:21,740
I saw a Chinese Hitler.
I saw,

1995
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:25,840
I swear to God, I can't
believe I, I don't remember

1996
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:30,700
this when I was in San
Francisco over the weekend. Uh,

1997
02:07:30,701 --> 02:07:35,170
amazing by the way. Always amazing,
amazing shows. I'm walking down a grant.

1998
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:37,000
Yeah. Chinatown. Yeah.

1999
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:42,300
There is a dude who like
probably in his thirties,

2000
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:45,970
he had his hair pulled
back into like a man bun.

2001
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:49,840
He's wearing like a throwback
49 or starter jacket.

2002
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:54,850
And he had a Hitler stash.
I was like, this guy is,

2003
02:07:54,851 --> 02:07:56,950
and he was walking with such confidence.
He was like,

2004
02:07:57,130 --> 02:08:01,500
I dare you to point out that I
have a start. I'm Chinese wearing a

2005
02:08:03,550 --> 02:08:08,390
jacket and 88 started jack.
He had boots on God,

2006
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:11,820
a boots, military boots.
Not like, no, no, no.

2007
02:08:11,821 --> 02:08:16,770
He had like a, I don't know, like,
you know Staci boots, like cool.

2008
02:08:16,771 --> 02:08:20,370
The cool guy boots. I don't what the
fuck you would call him? Martin's? No,

2009
02:08:20,371 --> 02:08:24,750
not doc Martins, but they were like,
uh, like Johnny Depp would wear. Yeah,

2010
02:08:24,751 --> 02:08:28,140
like that kind of boot. Right.
And then, so then, and then jeans,

2011
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:32,600
throw back starters, 40 niners
jacket. You sure it was on our logo,

2012
02:08:32,610 --> 02:08:37,140
not a Nazi symbol and that you fuck
close up word. I mean a deliberate, oh,

2013
02:08:37,141 --> 02:08:40,650
he walked right by us to be deliberately,
dude. Yeah. It's only deliberate.

2014
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:44,420
Your whole life's like I dare someone
to say some shit to me right now.

2015
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:48,280
It's not like you can't,
that's where I,

2016
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,180
that's where I thought
you were going to go.

2017
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:54,020
I thought you're going to ask if I
would shave the stash like that. No,

2018
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:59,260
I wouldn't do any of that to eat whatever
you want and never so far I will shit

2019
02:08:59,721 --> 02:09:03,570
and Piss in your yard. That's where I'm
at so far. I'm sure you have more common.

2020
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:08,820
What if? Can you just say
the n word to ones? No.

2021
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:10,030
Once a day

2022
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:16,830
you have to work.
Even though your podcast,

2023
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:20,060
you will all,

2024
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:23,560
it will be me alone on that fucking desk
filling the whole God damn thing goes.

2025
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:35,890
I feel like,
is she on her knees about do a gang bang?

2026
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:39,400
It's like 10 black guys
pausing to have a conversation.

2027
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:45,060
Maybe I should tip toe lightly and say
n word weed out this so it's just going

2028
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:47,420
to be seven of you then.
Okay,

2029
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:53,260
so you wouldn't do that either?
Hell No. No. What'd you know?

2030
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:56,470
You would know your life is ruined.

2031
02:09:58,230 --> 02:10:00,820
The funny thing is to ask someone
like, Hey, would you ruin your life?

2032
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:01,840
Oh you wouldn't.
That's weird.

2033
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:09,530
Now you are a twin brother. Do you
think he believe you? If you told him

2034
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:14,640
that you can come in forest routes

2035
02:10:18,450 --> 02:10:22,790
for, okay, I'm, I'm being
serious. I know you are.

2036
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:26,350
Okay.
You smoke meth with your brother.

2037
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,560
You have to do this once in your life
and you can eat whatever you want and

2038
02:10:31,561 --> 02:10:32,800
never gain weight.
This is a one time

2039
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:35,350
you smoke meth with your brother.

2040
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:41,280
You masturbate and you ejaculate in four
strokes and then he pulls his penis out

2041
02:10:42,190 --> 02:10:43,060
and he does the same

2042
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,770
and that's it.
That's all you do.

2043
02:10:45,830 --> 02:10:48,890
But you can eat wherever you
want to watch each other do that.

2044
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,910
I'll smoke meth with him once,
but as the keep my dick in my pants.

2045
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:58,250
You wouldn't do that just
once. No. Why not? We shared.

2046
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:04,430
We shared a room growing up, so I'm sure
we were doing it around it. Yeah, I know.

2047
02:11:04,431 --> 02:11:07,100
I was getting my fix and and a
bathroom and everywhere else. Yeah.

2048
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:09,170
Never once said,
I'll walk in the bedroom,

2049
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:10,700
but you're just going
to jerk this real quick.

2050
02:11:10,701 --> 02:11:14,390
Why don't you get out of here and play
some double dribble real quick and I'll

2051
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:16,010
come back.
Switch.

2052
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:20,510
Call me fucking controllers in front
of your brothers. I would not know.

2053
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:23,870
I'm sure he's listening right now.
Disappointed in Delaware, but uh,

2054
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:25,980
I wouldn't do that though.
All right.

2055
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:29,840
Serve yourself pretty sad for a square.

2056
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:31,640
What'd you do that in front
of one of your sisters?

2057
02:11:31,641 --> 02:11:36,620
Todd's different that I
bought your dad? Yeah. Okay.

2058
02:11:36,621 --> 02:11:37,310
How about this?

2059
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:41,060
Would you watch your dad come four
strokes and then you can eat whatever you

2060
02:11:41,061 --> 02:11:43,740
want. If you could stand up
there and be able to guess,

2061
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:47,800
it's going to say I'd never be able to
keep it down ever. I think of my face.

2062
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:51,800
Yeah. That is so traumatic though,
to see your dad. Oh, to me,

2063
02:11:51,890 --> 02:11:55,790
I couldn't even imagine. I don't think
you could eat. No, no, you're not eating.

2064
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:59,450
That's why he'd stay skinny.
That's trauma, trauma and stress.

2065
02:11:59,510 --> 02:12:03,290
The rest of your life like I
can't eat. All right. Um, look,

2066
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:07,510
I want to make sure people know it's the
honeydew. You can subscribe right now.

2067
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:15,920
I was organic. Thank you.
Want to get it wrong?

2068
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:17,320
You wouldn't charge him
in front of your father.

2069
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:21,290
Let's just to remind everybody that
takes the honeydew podcast.com.

2070
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:23,900
I'm Ryan sickler on all social media.

2071
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:30,460
The first plug I've ever had.

2072
02:12:33,430 --> 02:12:37,080
It's the worst slash best, I gotta
be honest. It's studio genes.

2073
02:12:37,330 --> 02:12:41,720
What have your studio g
yes. Oh my God. I'm very,

2074
02:12:41,721 --> 02:12:43,210
I'm very excited for the,

2075
02:12:43,211 --> 02:12:47,870
the what the future holds here at
the studio genes. Your mom's house.

2076
02:12:47,930 --> 02:12:51,890
Yes. I'll be doing the honey do
podcast and studio B. So exciting.

2077
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:55,190
I'm very excited. I think it's a, it's
a really good line for you to be in.

2078
02:12:55,191 --> 02:12:57,950
I think you're going to have a really
interesting perspective on stuff.

2079
02:12:58,060 --> 02:13:01,430
I hope so. We'll see. Um, I, you know,
I'm nervous. I'm starting all over again.

2080
02:13:01,431 --> 02:13:04,940
It's you get out of your
comfort zone, which I like
and that feels good. But also,

2081
02:13:04,941 --> 02:13:07,220
you know, there's so
much that goes, you know,

2082
02:13:07,221 --> 02:13:10,610
there's so much that goes into
starting something new and an ending,

2083
02:13:10,611 --> 02:13:12,980
something you've been
doing for such a long time.

2084
02:13:12,981 --> 02:13:16,670
So I'm very excited and I
really appreciate you guys
making me a part of the

2085
02:13:16,671 --> 02:13:20,000
family members. You're always can
wait to shit and Piss in your yard.

2086
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:24,810
I'm doing that for free and you
gotta check off of your brother and,

2087
02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:29,780
and we'll picture your dad doing
it. Oh God. So the show's about

2088
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:31,980
every

2089
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,750
Monday and then two,
the vignette beginning in February,

2090
02:13:36,751 --> 02:13:39,060
February.
Currently audio on Wednesday.

2091
02:13:39,061 --> 02:13:43,560
You will get audio Monday
video Tuesday in February.

2092
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:44,483
Wow.

2093
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:53,880
That's, it will be a we back momentarily.
Thank sickle cell. Thank you guys.

2094
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:58,200
And we're back.
We ate unfortunately,

2095
02:13:58,201 --> 02:14:03,000
wasted a couple farts in the
green room here in the lobby,

2096
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:06,240
but who knows,
maybe some magical happen.

2097
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:14,550
That was pretty impressive.
You just give us the heads up.

2098
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:16,080
We got to say who's here

2099
02:14:18,490 --> 02:14:23,490
are our final guest for today's
episode is the great and drew Santina.

2100
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:28,950
Thank you. Yay. Thank you. I
might fart. You might fart.

2101
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,920
We have an apartment if I have to.
You'll just pass it over here.

2102
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,190
That's so great that you guys
thought of everything at the studio.

2103
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:37,020
Well if nothing else,
she was like,

2104
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:42,050
there's no way we're moving to a new
space and not getting apart my priority by

2105
02:14:44,341 --> 02:14:48,470
the way off. So if you feel it,
you got to grab it, turn it on.

2106
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:51,780
It's like a loft. There was no
wind sock on there either. No,

2107
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:52,770
I didn't really want to get in there.

2108
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:58,110
The fart Mike is ironically what every
microphone is that any comedy club I've

2109
02:14:58,111 --> 02:15:00,830
ever played.
How disgusting that does a microphone.

2110
02:15:00,970 --> 02:15:04,800
So I dunno what comics set it,
but it made me laugh so hard.

2111
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:09,260
Someone we were at the Improv and someone
was onstage like like spitting in it

2112
02:15:09,261 --> 02:15:12,480
like yelling and spitting and doing a
lot of that stuff and then the comic that

2113
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:14,520
was like in the booth by the
Improv next to me, it was like,

2114
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,310
I wish I brought my own mic
and I was like that's so funny.

2115
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,950
It's true cause part part of the time.
You do get up there and you're like,

2116
02:15:20,070 --> 02:15:23,520
Oh God, this fucking record. By the
way, he realized how it wouldn't be.

2117
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:25,920
It wouldn't be that crazy.
Sounds crazy,

2118
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:30,060
but the reality is it wouldn't be that
crazy to show up at gigs. I'd be like, Oh,

2119
02:15:30,061 --> 02:15:32,880
and I brought my mic and you're
like, they'd be like, okay,

2120
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:36,770
and then you plug it in. It'd be like a
forgotten thing. Totally should do it.

2121
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:39,660
Bands who play, like when you go
to see like a band at the whiskey,

2122
02:15:40,050 --> 02:15:43,170
they all bring their own shit.
They don't share the same many things,

2123
02:15:43,171 --> 02:15:45,420
so they're like,
I don't want to share that guys,

2124
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:49,920
Mike or or drums or they replace
everything and no one cares.

2125
02:15:49,921 --> 02:15:52,510
It's not like it's a good idea.
We should start doing that.

2126
02:15:52,830 --> 02:15:55,860
I think it would be even funnier if
we just carried like a wind sock.

2127
02:15:55,861 --> 02:16:00,480
We just put it over just to protect the
shows at the comedy store where the guy

2128
02:16:00,481 --> 02:16:05,370
before me sick sniffling and everything.
I'm like asshole.

2129
02:16:05,490 --> 02:16:09,480
When I first moved to La, Don Barris, who
does the, the, the, the late night led,

2130
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:13,020
the last spot at the comedy store.
He probably, and maybe still does,

2131
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:15,600
he would lick the mic. No. Wow. Yeah.

2132
02:16:15,610 --> 02:16:18,770
Would lick the microphone and like rub
it all over his body and it really start

2133
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:22,460
laughing. God, you can get a whiff
of a Mike and you're like, oh,

2134
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:27,180
that's what disease and death and just
a horror smell like sad. A lot of sad.

2135
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:30,130
You know,
it doesn't smell these mikes fresh.

2136
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:33,850
These are brand new brand we're going to
do. We're doing ASM are right now where

2137
02:16:39,240 --> 02:16:42,280
that is so weird that that's a huge,
I mean props if that's your thing.

2138
02:16:42,281 --> 02:16:46,310
But I tried watching one.
I get uncomfortable with that Cetera.

2139
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:50,320
But people fucking love it. No, Nikki
Glaser came in and told her, she was like,

2140
02:16:50,321 --> 02:16:52,770
I'm one of those people.
It sends tingles down my back.

2141
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:57,280
I can't cause cause I watched
the one, um, there's this,

2142
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:01,090
she's actually kind of funny to this
black chick on youtube who she has really

2143
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:04,750
long nails that she oftentimes we'll like
touch the mic with her nails and shit

2144
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:08,590
and people, I mean the comments, it's
like millions of people like love it.

2145
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:12,640
But I tried. That's what she
does. She does. That's her
thing. I mean she also does,

2146
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:14,770
it's kind of like a podcast
too, I think. Like she does,

2147
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:16,390
she talks and talks about stuff.
But yeah,

2148
02:17:16,630 --> 02:17:20,830
she just like analyze analyzes like a
bag of Doritos and she's slowly opens it.

2149
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:24,640
She talks about you imagine that's
your fucking lane. You're like,

2150
02:17:24,641 --> 02:17:27,460
you see my new house, my fucking
car. I'm like, what? What do you do?

2151
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:29,210
Open Dorito bags and I,

2152
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:34,420
I scratched the microphone and Tom Tom's
making a lot of money doing that Dorito

2153
02:17:34,421 --> 02:17:39,310
thing he does. We're just talking about
it at the lunch break here that you know,

2154
02:17:39,311 --> 02:17:44,311
the metrics involved like networks
will have the Nielson family retreats,

2155
02:17:44,471 --> 02:17:48,610
which I've never met a Nielson family.
We'll navigate such a lie.

2156
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:52,630
I've never met one either, but I've
heard of one. You know what I mean?

2157
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:54,790
You know someone that knows someone
that has one. That's the only,

2158
02:17:55,090 --> 02:18:00,090
that's the closest I've come is my friend
said that his friends were a Nielson

2159
02:18:00,131 --> 02:18:04,450
family. I don't know who, you know what
I think might be the Nielsen families.

2160
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:08,700
There it is. Yup. This is the
Birkman. Oh, you need to, Oh,

2161
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:13,240
you need a separate burp and fart. Fart.
Mine. I think the Nielson family. Oh,

2162
02:18:13,241 --> 02:18:16,750
this is, I don't want a bourbon.
This is too nice. I'm going to be,

2163
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:19,780
I'm going to be a polite
guest. Yeah, you stare at her.

2164
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:23,350
You just burped in the bike. I think
the Nielson family, those people,

2165
02:18:23,351 --> 02:18:23,591
when you know,

2166
02:18:23,591 --> 02:18:26,890
when you drive and you see a house with
a huge satellite on the back of like a

2167
02:18:26,891 --> 02:18:29,740
huge dish, you know what I mean?
Not the direct TV, like a big one.

2168
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:32,720
They have like a radio, so that's the
Nielsen Guy. That's who I think that is,

2169
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:37,120
because I remember those in the 80s like
people got like there's a channels back

2170
02:18:37,121 --> 02:18:41,740
then was huge dishes and they're like
sitting in their yard and I always was

2171
02:18:41,741 --> 02:18:42,431
like,
I don't know,

2172
02:18:42,431 --> 02:18:44,880
that looks like it gets gotta be
government issued or something.

2173
02:18:45,090 --> 02:18:48,160
That's the Nielsen thing. Like I don't
know anyone that's known them direct,

2174
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:52,300
but someone's like, yeah, he lives next
to my uncle. He's that guy, you know,

2175
02:18:52,690 --> 02:18:55,470
he like Moe's with the mower that's not
automatic, you know, the fucking level.

2176
02:18:56,350 --> 02:19:01,000
And when we were just talking before
we were on like you worked at old navy,

2177
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:04,090
I worked at old navy and I was thinking
immediate thought was like you had

2178
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:07,240
record sales. I did. I was actually
a really good salesman at old navy.

2179
02:19:07,241 --> 02:19:10,780
I'm not kidding. I really was.
Well this is really funny.

2180
02:19:10,781 --> 02:19:12,460
I joked about being the sandals salesman,

2181
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:16,900
but because like sandals at old navy
or kind of like, um, $3, well not even,

2182
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:18,090
I think they're like two,
two,

2183
02:19:18,150 --> 02:19:20,560
two like they're like two for two
for four or something like that.

2184
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:24,730
They're right by the front register. So
you, so like every time I was at checkout,

2185
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:27,040
I would always just be like, you
want to go some sandals? Or you know,

2186
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:31,190
people like without thought would just
be like, okay, the power of suggestion.

2187
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:33,980
Oh my God. Well they're there and
they're just kind. Someone always goes,

2188
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:35,080
I guess I need sandals.

2189
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:38,190
Or you always do for summer or if you're
going on a vacation, hopping around.

2190
02:19:38,191 --> 02:19:42,860
I'm thinking of like those, those weird
purchases because you do it with gum.

2191
02:19:42,861 --> 02:19:46,310
Like you never really looking for
gum. Just happen. If somebody says,

2192
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:51,260
and there's some good gum
here, you're like, oh yeah,
the socks. When you buy shoes,

2193
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:54,490
like you want some socks and you're like,
you have socks, but you're like, yeah,

2194
02:19:54,580 --> 02:19:57,260
yeah, but those are what goes in these
shoes. So I guess I should buy those.

2195
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:01,430
I should buy those too. They should
make shoes that come with socks. And

2196
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:12,080
I was
like eight years,

2197
02:20:12,081 --> 02:20:14,750
man, man. Never taken them off. Let
me ask you a question about old navy.

2198
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,790
My suspicions over the years, maybe fan,
fan of the gap. I love it all. And Banana.

2199
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:25,100
Interesting. Two of the three
is cool to me, but like,

2200
02:20:25,101 --> 02:20:28,820
but like banana for some reason
it's like bananas, like, um,

2201
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:33,080
j crew's like, Ya know, lame
nephew. You're like, man,

2202
02:20:33,081 --> 02:20:36,260
it's like office where I don't
wear too stiff as close. Yeah.

2203
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:41,000
But correct me if I'm wrong,
I feel like old navy sizing is this,

2204
02:20:41,001 --> 02:20:42,460
everything's a size up the gap,

2205
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:45,490
but they make it appear a
size smaller for instance.

2206
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:49,890
And Old Navy too is a reality for,
you know,

2207
02:20:49,970 --> 02:20:52,850
eight is really a 10.
Do you think it's probably because of uh,

2208
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:55,580
well I think old navy is,
volume is probably way bigger.

2209
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:57,680
So they serve as more people
than the gap does. Right.

2210
02:20:57,890 --> 02:21:02,890
So I imagine it's because of the average
human American body is a little bit

2211
02:21:03,210 --> 02:21:07,550
bigger, but they do do that. Right?
I've noticed that the sizes are bigger,

2212
02:21:07,551 --> 02:21:10,040
but they say that there are smaller and
I think it's also because like if they

2213
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:12,110
ever made a mistake in the
sweatshop when they were like,

2214
02:21:12,111 --> 02:21:14,510
make it a four and they just made a
billion of them and they're like, okay,

2215
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,280
that's that now. That's
what, that's our shirts now.

2216
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:21,260
I think they just have to like stick
stick to it at some point. It's a mass.

2217
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:25,040
Yeah. Old Navy is basically Costco
for a close. And by the way,

2218
02:21:25,041 --> 02:21:28,580
Costco has great clubs, ironically
enough. They sell like brick clothes.

2219
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:31,250
I had a guy yesterday telling
me, he was like, dude,

2220
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:36,320
he had a huge chunky watch on and I was
sitting at my local bar watching the

2221
02:21:36,321 --> 02:21:40,640
bears lose and I don't want to get
into it, but it's fine. I mean anyway,

2222
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:44,450
and this guy had a huge yeah,
except for that.

2223
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:48,560
And then it ends on a kicker missing
and kick butt, whatever. Um, he, I said,

2224
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:50,900
where'd you get the water from? We
go to Costco. I was like, really?

2225
02:21:50,901 --> 02:21:55,320
That looks like a nice, nice. He
goes, dude, it is everything. Yeah.

2226
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:58,520
He hits me in the face with it, but he
was like, yeah, no. Usually these are,

2227
02:21:58,610 --> 02:22:02,530
you know, whatever, 800 bucks, whatever.
And I got it for one 29. I was like,

2228
02:22:02,531 --> 02:22:07,160
how does Costco do that? There's gotta be
some weird science to it. They're like,

2229
02:22:07,161 --> 02:22:08,660
tricking us all ready?
Here we go.

2230
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,680
Yeah,
I love it.

2231
02:22:18,681 --> 02:22:22,460
In the boots. They both nodded. Smile.
That's exactly what we wanted to,

2232
02:22:22,461 --> 02:22:23,294
I've been for,

2233
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,210
well it's official. We're
wrapping up the studio. That's it.

2234
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:37,460
That's the only reason why
I am so proud of you.

2235
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:41,720
Your tears in your eyes.
What is real love? Wow.

2236
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:44,490
She goes about to have
another fucking baby.

2237
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:51,690
Can you smell by the way,
easily for today, my worst
fart. You know what I mean?

2238
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:55,320
Yeah. I had some rips earlier, but that
was just kind of, that was the weekend.

2239
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:57,870
It was one of those like you
guys soundproof. Did you smell,

2240
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:01,960
smell proof the studio. I would
stay over there. How are you?

2241
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:05,070
I'm gonna sit right here. Oh my God.
I was the best moment of my life.

2242
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:08,560
Just do you guys fart in
bed together all day? Yeah,

2243
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:10,600
but not like you got to get a whiff of it.
I mean,

2244
02:23:10,870 --> 02:23:13,230
you know it's interesting because I,

2245
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:16,650
I know there's some couples that I've
talked to that don't fart and bet the farm

2246
02:23:16,651 --> 02:23:18,420
outside of bed in front of each other,
but in bed they won't.

2247
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:19,470
You know what can be interesting.

2248
02:23:19,471 --> 02:23:24,471
Would you show our buddy cause that guy
that in bed and tell me how you think

2249
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,520
you would handle something like this.

2250
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:32,460
So can we just address the fact
that moment took 10 years to happen?

2251
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:35,130
I know, I know. And it
finally just happened.

2252
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:39,930
Can I tell someone I'm proud to be here
for that moment and we're proud to have

2253
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:44,010
you. Thank you. I just want to, it's
really huge guys. That was major for me.

2254
02:23:44,011 --> 02:23:48,350
I don't know. That was a big deal.
Thanks. I do you want to make it?

2255
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:52,140
I make a speech. Well you know
before I farted before on this show,

2256
02:23:52,141 --> 02:23:55,770
but you got to stand up. You got
to hold thing. It's a whole thing.

2257
02:23:55,771 --> 02:23:59,490
And to have a designated Fart,
Mike, I really, you know,

2258
02:23:59,491 --> 02:24:02,700
you see it like Golden Globes last night.
I really want to thank,

2259
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:03,543
I'm serious here.

2260
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,340
You're 100% do the credit because
when we were leading up to this,

2261
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:09,240
I mentioned earlier,

2262
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:14,010
I was concerned about the light and the
video and these mikes and making sure

2263
02:24:14,011 --> 02:24:18,630
the control booth was ready to go and
the Internet and you last week we were

2264
02:24:18,631 --> 02:24:21,990
testing video and audio and you were like,
God dammit is that Fart Mike Ready?

2265
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:25,740
And when the dog was like, no,
it's not really a priority. You Go,

2266
02:24:25,741 --> 02:24:26,700
why are we even moving?

2267
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:30,770
Why are we moving if we're not going
to step up our game and you really,

2268
02:24:30,970 --> 02:24:32,550
listeners,
it's important to me.

2269
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:36,040
I don't know how important it
is to the listeners. Email us,

2270
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:40,110
wait to hear how many
people are like please,

2271
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:45,580
this has to be a highlight.
You're going to get a lot of

2272
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:53,690
the birth of my children, my
wedding day. One, two, three. Yeah.

2273
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,430
Easy. Yeah. That's great.
It's really something. I don't
know. I feel blessed though.

2274
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:59,100
That's going to be at
your eulogy by the way.

2275
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:03,900
Birth the children married and
the FARC. Mike. That's true.

2276
02:25:05,850 --> 02:25:07,830
I know.
I love you,

2277
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:12,870
but I want to show Andrew this.
So this guy,

2278
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:16,350
I already liked the image,
he's videoing himself.

2279
02:25:16,770 --> 02:25:20,220
Go ahead and give him a little
taste of what's about to happen,

2280
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:30,020
baby. What is you could get into me.

2281
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:31,793
Yeah.

2282
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:38,640
So is this what you and your lady or
like the way that he goes, you know,

2283
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:42,680
so we know that a poop who was coming
comment and we just don't know what's

2284
02:25:42,681 --> 02:25:46,280
going to happen. Like is she about to run
out of the room? What's going to happen?

2285
02:25:46,281 --> 02:25:48,050
So I'll uh,

2286
02:25:49,350 --> 02:25:53,920
go ahead. Sorry. Oh No. Rush to boot now.

2287
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:59,670
Giddy up. Ah, well bite my head. Okay,

2288
02:25:59,671 --> 02:26:00,520
what else I'm running?

2289
02:26:02,670 --> 02:26:06,540
Do you see my fucking face? I did see
an I, that's exactly why we play these.

2290
02:26:06,570 --> 02:26:10,770
Oh my God. And then I
genuinely am like, oh,

2291
02:26:10,771 --> 02:26:15,390
this is so funny. He's going
to shit his pants. No, no,
no. And she's like, hurry up.

2292
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:19,853
Oh,

2293
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:28,303
Ooh.

2294
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:35,930
Yes. Right in your mouth. No, no. Yeah,

2295
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:40,420
no guys.
No right in their mouth.

2296
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:42,970
What would you do if your
wife started this with you?

2297
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:48,010
If wanted me to fart in her mouth. That's
it. Seriously. That is it. Do it again.

2298
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:52,180
Yeah. Let's see the yard in your
mouth? Yeah. What's the problem?

2299
02:26:52,181 --> 02:26:53,050
I don't see the big

2300
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:02,223
no problem.

2301
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:09,430
Phone is ringing an old time we phone.
What kind of shape?

2302
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:13,460
What percentage of checks you think
are are into this? Yeah, it's got it.

2303
02:27:13,461 --> 02:27:17,830
Who to 2% of women into this less the no,

2304
02:27:17,831 --> 02:27:20,610
I think two is a pretty safe number.
People under some weird shit.

2305
02:27:20,790 --> 02:27:23,070
Have you seen the videos on it? I mean you
will have it. Have you guys, what am I,

2306
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:23,993
what am I asking?

2307
02:27:24,210 --> 02:27:27,500
You've seen people that love to get
kicked in the Dick as hard as it. Yes.

2308
02:27:27,510 --> 02:27:28,490
We talked about that.

2309
02:27:28,491 --> 02:27:32,040
That should be a way lower percentage and
it's way higher than I think like I've

2310
02:27:32,041 --> 02:27:34,800
seen the videos on line and it had like
40 million views and you're like well

2311
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:36,840
people like this and like
there's the one we watched.

2312
02:27:36,841 --> 02:27:40,770
We watched that like Argentine one where
she was like suffered and she's like

2313
02:27:40,771 --> 02:27:42,860
pulling, holding his nuts down.
She was like, I want to suffer,

2314
02:27:42,861 --> 02:27:45,780
I want to see the blood and then she
just like, like a fucking speed bag.

2315
02:27:45,781 --> 02:27:49,270
Just drills him. It makes me nauseous
when I source like penis stuff.

2316
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:52,830
That stuff just makes me laugh. But
like anytime tugging, punching, kicking,

2317
02:27:52,831 --> 02:27:57,390
pulling, penis, wolf, I can't, I don't
know how but that that's repulsive.

2318
02:27:57,391 --> 02:28:00,510
But good for them if they're in love.
Yeah. If that's the, if that's their love,

2319
02:28:00,630 --> 02:28:03,450
if that's what it is.
I just also think, um,

2320
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:05,340
something is violently
wrong with that girl.

2321
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,770
So that will be a deal breaker
for you and your wife? Yeah,

2322
02:28:07,771 --> 02:28:10,740
I feel like if you're going to eat farts,
I feel like that's it for us.

2323
02:28:11,650 --> 02:28:15,480
What if she's like so perfect and every
other way and I've heard you speak

2324
02:28:15,481 --> 02:28:17,610
glowingly of your wife. Yeah.
And she was like, Oh look,

2325
02:28:17,611 --> 02:28:19,200
all I'm asking is that
when you got to Fart,

2326
02:28:19,201 --> 02:28:21,460
every once in a while you tap
me on the shoulder. You let it,

2327
02:28:21,461 --> 02:28:25,070
you let me know and I eat it. Um, ah, no,

2328
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:29,150
you don't need to do I feel like,
you know, if she says, hey babe,

2329
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:33,830
I really want you to Fart in my mouth.
And I would say anything else?

2330
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:37,850
Pick literally anything else, anything.
She goes, do you want me to come or not?

2331
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:41,600
Not Anymore.
Not if that's your thing.

2332
02:28:41,930 --> 02:28:43,970
But she doesn't even look like she's
getting sexual pleasure out of that.

2333
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:47,630
That's just, uh, that's just like a thing
they do. Let's talk about this though.

2334
02:28:47,631 --> 02:28:50,750
But what, what's the harm in it
for you? If that's what she liked?

2335
02:28:50,751 --> 02:28:53,750
Cause I have to kiss her mouth at some
point. So Ryan, so Ryan was saying,

2336
02:28:53,990 --> 02:28:55,940
well that's just the next logical step.
What am I,

2337
02:28:55,941 --> 02:28:57,920
am I never going to kiss her
over again? No. What if we,

2338
02:28:57,950 --> 02:29:02,420
what if you were pants or jeans or some
thick denim so that the fart particles

2339
02:29:02,421 --> 02:29:05,570
don't actually get into her
mouth? It depends on, you know,

2340
02:29:05,571 --> 02:29:07,010
I did some research after,

2341
02:29:07,011 --> 02:29:09,500
after doing you guys a show and there's
only so many genes that have enough

2342
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:11,270
thick enough denim to
protect the FARC particles.

2343
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,100
There's only two made around the world.

2344
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:17,840
Maybe you had a whole whole jeans or
one of them and then this company out of

2345
02:29:17,841 --> 02:29:22,160
Alaska. Okay. No, but I
think, I think first of all,

2346
02:29:22,161 --> 02:29:25,590
that's boxers. He's in
boxers. Oh, he's got that.

2347
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:30,030
He's really pushing it. He's pushing
boxers. Might as well be paper machete.

2348
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:33,500
So that part's the streaming right into
her mouth or you about to go please,

2349
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:37,170
please. I feel like it's
on the precipice, but we,

2350
02:29:37,171 --> 02:29:39,460
you know how like light make someone
sneezes. What makes someone far?

2351
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:42,780
What can you do that? I want to
jump the gun here guys. Okay. Okay.

2352
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:47,330
Give me a minute. I don't do
that to us man. I got real
excited. I know. I'm sorry.

2353
02:29:47,870 --> 02:29:50,900
You're on deck right now. We need to in
the batter's box swinging a doughnut.

2354
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:53,690
I'm afraid I'm going to pee
myself cause I worked the pushing.

2355
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:58,780
If you push too hard place to let God
let it happen when he wants to or she,

2356
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:04,070
I don't mean to gender.
What gender do you ever,

2357
02:30:04,130 --> 02:30:07,640
do you ever pee when you fart? Yeah,
I, since I had my Second Child,

2358
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:10,370
I pee when I cough, I
pee when I laugh. Ooh.

2359
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:13,790
It just happens because
your muscles are so weak.

2360
02:30:13,791 --> 02:30:16,670
I just gave birth five months ago so it's
still kind of still tighten them back

2361
02:30:16,671 --> 02:30:20,330
up. It's still, I'm still reeling
back in. Yeah, I get that.

2362
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:24,740
Do you have, do you have is leakage
of thing? That's a big deal. Yeah.

2363
02:30:24,741 --> 02:30:27,390
You can buy panties that
actually absorb the,

2364
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:30,710
the little amounts of pea that you
create. All that. Don't do that for guys.

2365
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:33,260
You guys should have that.
Do you have a little bit of leakage?

2366
02:30:33,261 --> 02:30:34,700
Do you have a little bit
dribble? Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

2367
02:30:34,701 --> 02:30:37,760
And no one talks about that, like that's
why don't you have a pad in the front?

2368
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:40,550
Oh, like underwear built with a
little bit of pad for absorption.

2369
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:43,910
We've got two ideas on the show,
but I feel like we could sell,

2370
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:46,980
make billions of dollars. I don't
know what the fuck we're doing. Yeah,

2371
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:49,280
I feel like that's the thing that
nobody wants to talk about that men,

2372
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:52,940
as you get older, every guy has a
little bit of drip edge, but no one,

2373
02:30:52,970 --> 02:30:56,510
no one says anything. So you go
pee and then the lows a little bit.

2374
02:30:56,511 --> 02:31:00,080
There's always a little bit,
even if you shake, you know,

2375
02:31:00,170 --> 02:31:01,970
especially after we've
been having a few drinks.

2376
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:04,430
Then if I shake in a Pete whatever,
I still got some.

2377
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:08,810
And sometimes you walk away from like
a urinal and you're like, oh my God,

2378
02:31:08,811 --> 02:31:12,500
I think I'm pissing down my thing.
I'm still just pissing, yeah,

2379
02:31:12,501 --> 02:31:14,570
it's not dribbling. I'm
full, full pissing my pants.

2380
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:20,160
Now when I bring this up because
I imagine you have pretty

2381
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:24,810
good game. Okay. It's just
like a sense that I have and
we have a, we played a guy,

2382
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:28,470
uh, we, we're not going to play in
right now, but this guy became a, uh,

2383
02:31:28,710 --> 02:31:33,710
quite a hit on the show for his very
forward approach to contacting this woman,

2384
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:38,010
Julia. That's right. Okay.
And then I'm excited we got,

2385
02:31:38,011 --> 02:31:42,090
so we got ahold of this is
just voicemails, voicemails,

2386
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:45,930
apparently,
I don't know how long they've been around.

2387
02:31:45,931 --> 02:31:48,570
They've been around a few years at least,
but we've never heard them.

2388
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:53,930
So this woman release these voice mails
that this man left on her phone and

2389
02:31:54,841 --> 02:31:59,310
we'll play them in succession. Like how,
how she received that. Okay. This is true.

2390
02:31:59,311 --> 02:32:02,100
This is Julia. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Totally different persons.

2391
02:32:02,610 --> 02:32:06,900
Different woman releasing voicemails
that a different guy, but you can,

2392
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:11,210
you can hear the build. Okay. Yeah. Things
changed. Yeah, it was such a good fart.

2393
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:12,400
Hi Ashley.

2394
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:16,900
This is Davey is five o'
clock Tuesday afternoon.

2395
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:21,100
I don't know what time you coming home.

2396
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:25,820
If you have time,
maybe we can go right hitting Brandwidth.

2397
02:32:25,870 --> 02:32:29,350
You can have dinner together right here
in Brooklyn. You call me back please.

2398
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:32,860
Three mono line or one bye bye.

2399
02:32:33,300 --> 02:32:37,380
Okay. I know you edited that,
but a piece of me is like, God,

2400
02:32:37,381 --> 02:32:42,330
this guy doesn't even know how to
say his phone number three one oh,

2401
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:46,840
he reminds me a lot. I remember.
Reminds you of um, yes. Yes.

2402
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:50,800
This is David. I'm, I'm guessing
David's not as God given

2403
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:53,210
Salah May. By the way. Solomon is a,

2404
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:57,900
they're a lady was late leaving extensive
messages on Christina's mom when she

2405
02:32:57,901 --> 02:32:58,740
switched her number.

2406
02:32:59,590 --> 02:33:03,390
How did she get your number? No, when I
switched my phone number to a new, Oh,

2407
02:33:03,391 --> 02:33:07,230
it was something I've done. I've had that
before. Yeah, right. For a years I'll get,

2408
02:33:07,231 --> 02:33:11,220
I still get like dry. This guy's a drug
dealer. Hits me up if I want Xanax.

2409
02:33:11,221 --> 02:33:15,270
And then this other one that's
kind of Nice to be on drugs,

2410
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:17,190
it's like a gambling
thing. He's like, hey,

2411
02:33:17,191 --> 02:33:20,060
the Knicks versus the whatever
you want in. I'm like, Geez,

2412
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:23,420
you adopt a burner phone
number you've got to generate.

2413
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:28,480
Never. That called me. She
would get mad and calling me.

2414
02:33:28,690 --> 02:33:32,920
She would leave most of the message in
Farsi and then we'd have people translate

2415
02:33:32,921 --> 02:33:35,200
and they were like, Yo,
she's raw dude. She's like,

2416
02:33:35,230 --> 02:33:36,770
tell this mother fucker to get the,

2417
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,790
she was telling her how to keep
wearing pearls out of her fruits,

2418
02:33:39,791 --> 02:33:44,080
like Thai plastic bags all
around your training like crazy.

2419
02:33:44,170 --> 02:33:45,490
So this guy keep going with this guy.

2420
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:46,901
Hi,

2421
02:33:46,901 --> 02:33:51,890
I see you said Davey is
7:30 PM Tuesday night.

2422
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:56,330
Oh, it's the same night call on my phone.

2423
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:59,390
I don't know if you were trying
to call me back. No, I didn't.

2424
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:04,920
I missed you or what happened or
just avoiding my phone didn't ring,

2425
02:34:05,870 --> 02:34:10,640
but I have your number as a miss.
If you did call me,

2426
02:34:10,670 --> 02:34:13,160
can you please call me back again?
Nice.

2427
02:34:13,161 --> 02:34:16,880
7:30 PM three one zero nine

2428
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:20,420
eight imagine leave this
guy two hours later.

2429
02:34:20,450 --> 02:34:25,040
Hey maybe you called and wires
got crossed to the operator,

2430
02:34:25,041 --> 02:34:27,650
not put you through to the right.
What year is this guy?

2431
02:34:27,651 --> 02:34:30,140
I think this is my
favorite move is like a,

2432
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:34,880
I see the missed call and I think that
maybe it's you even though I don't see

2433
02:34:34,881 --> 02:34:38,200
that you call, here's my number
again just in case. Yeah. Jessica,

2434
02:34:38,390 --> 02:34:41,720
just in case you saw me already
bothered you before. Did I wonder if,

2435
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:44,200
did he send texts as well?
I don't know if he sent texts.

2436
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:46,840
Definitely left more messages.
Let's see.

2437
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:59,520
Can you just call me for five minutes

2438
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:02,890
or I should

2439
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:07,660
just forget about you.

2440
02:35:07,661 --> 02:35:12,661
I told you a decent human being but it
seems to me is you are not so I don't

2441
02:35:14,771 --> 02:35:17,560
know what to tell you.

2442
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:22,030
I taught you or someone I can talk.

2443
02:35:22,031 --> 02:35:27,031
Then you are somebody decent so can you
just call me for five minutes if you are

2444
02:35:28,511 --> 02:35:32,620
not available so I can just throw
you a number to the garbage.

2445
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:39,120
It was very odd to just print out a phone
number and then throw it in the trash.

2446
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:42,830
You picked up on the fact that
as that message was ending,

2447
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:47,860
there was some anger building
10 throw to the garbage.

2448
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:51,350
That's how I pizza.
You were a decent human being by the way.

2449
02:35:51,351 --> 02:35:54,320
He mentioned that twice.
I thought you were a decent human being,

2450
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:59,570
not someone who would call every two
hours bugging you. That's a good person.

2451
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:04,140
We're on. Call me. Yeah, number
three. So it's five seven 39 yeah,

2452
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:07,640
on a Tuesday. About
Friday. Can't be that busy.

2453
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:12,110
You can't be that busy and a decent
person wouldn't be that busy. Impossible.

2454
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:13,790
Decent human beings aren't busy.
So do you,

2455
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:17,080
are you going to call me back or should
I throw your shit in the trash right now?

2456
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:20,750
You can feel just the end. He goes,
so I don't know what to tell you.

2457
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:23,840
It's like almost a murderer's ploy.

2458
02:36:23,841 --> 02:36:27,950
And his brain was deciding whether
to say something aggressive or not,

2459
02:36:27,980 --> 02:36:31,790
and then he ended with like wood
or do I throw in the garbage?

2460
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:35,340
Like he didn't know whether it'd be
like, fuck you right back. But he,

2461
02:36:35,341 --> 02:36:38,840
but he saved himself at the end
by just saying, just come on.

2462
02:36:38,841 --> 02:36:41,690
Call me back or month or do
I just need to stop this?

2463
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:44,300
I wonder if you call us again.
Maybe. Maybe this one's nicer.

2464
02:36:48,290 --> 02:36:51,390
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with your phone.

2465
02:36:58,650 --> 02:37:00,330
Oh, nice. That's great.

2466
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:08,120
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with your phone.

2467
02:37:08,390 --> 02:37:11,080
Every time you con you disconnected,

2468
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:15,290
I don't know what the fuck is wrong
with this phone call or the way is,

2469
02:37:15,291 --> 02:37:17,660
I cannot even talk to you.
What is this?

2470
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:21,350
What does he know how that works? Wait, so

2471
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:25,570
disconnected. First of all,
he didn't leave a time,

2472
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:27,190
didn't leave his phone number again.

2473
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:31,090
I feel like the consistency is broken
now and so now we know he's mad.

2474
02:37:31,150 --> 02:37:33,520
Every time he calls his disconnected.
What does that mean?

2475
02:37:33,521 --> 02:37:36,670
The phone is disconnected? Yeah. We
don't know what's going on. It's broken.

2476
02:37:36,671 --> 02:37:39,160
You know how often your cell phones
gets it's gonna disconnect it.

2477
02:37:39,250 --> 02:37:41,470
That's such a common name.
What the fuck you call it again?

2478
02:37:41,471 --> 02:37:45,680
I see another missed call,
Ashley. Yeah, so, so this is is,

2479
02:37:45,681 --> 02:37:48,940
is this the beginning of the me
too movement is this kind of list?

2480
02:37:49,970 --> 02:37:54,220
This is how I start. It
should be, but there's no way.

2481
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:57,840
Okay. Ah, fuck a prostitute.

2482
02:37:59,140 --> 02:38:01,720
So many fucking

2483
02:38:03,380 --> 02:38:05,340
fuck you are.

2484
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:08,550
You're 14

2485
02:38:14,170 --> 02:38:18,760
and dismissal for motherfuckers to four,
three, four, three or four prostitutes.

2486
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:21,490
I would love to have a counter on
that. That it, that sounds like,

2487
02:38:21,491 --> 02:38:25,150
you know when somebody takes Spanish
101 when like a white kid and he only

2488
02:38:25,151 --> 02:38:28,150
learns a few cuss words. Yeah. And
he says them over and over and over.

2489
02:38:28,151 --> 02:38:28,984
Like he did that

2490
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:31,560
fucking phone.
Mother fuckers.

2491
02:38:32,430 --> 02:38:36,620
Motherfucker prostitute. Yeah. Yeah.
Mother fucker prostitute. Yeah. Um,

2492
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:40,350
I mean this is good. Uh, let's go
to numb. Yeah, that one, right?

2493
02:38:44,470 --> 02:38:48,250
Pardon me?
I knew there's so many bad,

2494
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,320
so many

2495
02:38:59,750 --> 02:39:01,070
still.
Do

2496
02:39:03,490 --> 02:39:06,590
you think I need it?
I said you are beautiful.

2497
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:09,310
You are cops fucking mother fucker

2498
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:19,480
because
you,

2499
02:39:23,590 --> 02:39:27,040
I
have to put it

2500
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:32,993
short.

2501
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:38,500
Call me anyway.

2502
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:41,240
Cocksucker motherfucker.

2503
02:39:41,250 --> 02:39:43,980
I got to say this could be a
nice monologue piece for you.

2504
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:50,020
I like it as a performance
because I printed out the
pause because I have to put

2505
02:39:50,661 --> 02:39:55,340
the pillow over your face.
It just such a fuck.

2506
02:39:56,020 --> 02:40:00,530
I mean it really emphasized.
Yeah. You know, it is, it
is very obvious when Rachel,

2507
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:02,990
yeah, that was a little mean.
You can just stick to prostitute,

2508
02:40:02,991 --> 02:40:05,480
cock sucker motherfucker.
And then you've been good and necessary.

2509
02:40:08,170 --> 02:40:09,410
Yeah, no, it's interesting.

2510
02:40:09,411 --> 02:40:12,800
Is that what good morning Julia and this
guy have in common with doctor drew was

2511
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:15,000
mentioning was that narcissism?
Yes.

2512
02:40:15,090 --> 02:40:19,800
It's the same thing of like he was
waiting for Joe to turn ugly like that and

2513
02:40:19,801 --> 02:40:22,520
said this guy ended up
turning. Yeah. Yeah.

2514
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:25,710
So it drew analyze the good morning Julia
Guy. He was just bracing. He's like,

2515
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:30,300
he's like, so it's, it's about to get
violent or grotesquely sexual, you know,

2516
02:40:30,301 --> 02:40:33,870
and yeah, it didn't go there. And then
he was just like, wow, this is, you know,

2517
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:38,760
this guy's obviously has like
kind of sense of a grandiose,

2518
02:40:38,761 --> 02:40:41,880
you know, feel really illusions
of grand jury. Yes, yes. And,

2519
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:46,140
and basically most people like that and
like this or without shame too. You know,

2520
02:40:46,141 --> 02:40:50,520
you can't shame them. But this guy,
he does it. He does anything here.

2521
02:40:50,521 --> 02:40:51,630
That's very interesting.

2522
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:55,410
Let's if we psychoanalyze this for people
that have no background doing this at

2523
02:40:55,411 --> 02:40:57,450
all or schooling,
I'll just say,

2524
02:40:57,900 --> 02:41:01,350
he says you're a cock sucker motherfucker.

2525
02:41:01,770 --> 02:41:05,790
And then he says,
you can suck my cock motherfucker.

2526
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:09,770
And then he says, and then he said,
you're too ugly to suck my cock. Right.

2527
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:11,430
He wants it,
but he doesn't want it.

2528
02:41:11,431 --> 02:41:14,300
He's playing real hard to get here
and then go suck some black dicks.

2529
02:41:15,430 --> 02:41:16,350
Maybe he's in the cooking.

2530
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:19,650
Maybe he wants to see her suck on the
black cause that's what that seems like.

2531
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:23,730
Yeah. So you cock sucker. Go Suck Black
Hawks. You can't suck mine. You should.

2532
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:26,160
You should suck. You're
too ugly to suck. Mine.

2533
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:27,660
I'll cover your head but let you stuck up.

2534
02:41:29,070 --> 02:41:29,280
Okay.

2535
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:33,110
This guy is full circle. He's
all over the map. He's emotional.

2536
02:41:33,170 --> 02:41:36,060
He's emotionally unavailable is I think
what this is. Yeah, that's the breakdown.

2537
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:39,290
I think he wished he could be really
more attuned with what's going on,

2538
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:42,120
his emotions and he just Kinda, it's a
cry for help. It's a cry for help. Yeah.

2539
02:41:42,121 --> 02:41:45,060
I think, I think, I think his last
relationship ended very poorly.

2540
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:48,000
I think that's what really happened
here. He's trying, could you imagine?

2541
02:41:48,001 --> 02:41:51,090
But this is essentially the guy in
the bar who's like in Brentwood,

2542
02:41:51,270 --> 02:41:54,210
what's a bright white, but he's like,
Hey, what's up? What's your name?

2543
02:41:54,211 --> 02:41:57,930
And he's drunk. And then you're like, I'm
not interested. Fuck you, bitch. Yeah.

2544
02:41:57,960 --> 02:42:02,490
It's that. That's a real guy. You
experienced that of your whole life?

2545
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:05,550
My whole life. But he's
usually very drunk. Yeah.

2546
02:42:05,551 --> 02:42:09,470
You can see them coming a mile
away. You know it. You know what?

2547
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:11,430
The minute he talks to you,
he's fuck it.

2548
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:14,600
You've had enough guys in your dating
life experiences that have done it.

2549
02:42:15,990 --> 02:42:16,180
Okay,

2550
02:42:16,180 --> 02:42:18,700
that have done that to you, that
have been like, yeah, you're hot,

2551
02:42:18,701 --> 02:42:21,720
and then you're like, I'm good. And
they're like, fuck you. Yes a lot.

2552
02:42:22,150 --> 02:42:25,260
It had a cool tactic. That's, I mean,
it's got to work all the time. It happens.

2553
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:27,610
You did it. Every one of those guys
[inaudible] everyone, I'm married,

2554
02:42:27,730 --> 02:42:32,290
I'm married one every like every time
you're out late night at a bar by 2:00 AM

2555
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:35,470
that guy rolls, right? So alcohol
plays a part. I am always,

2556
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:40,240
but see that's why la closes at two and
that happens, uh, places like Chicago,

2557
02:42:40,241 --> 02:42:41,080
they never close.

2558
02:42:41,230 --> 02:42:44,680
So you kind of just avoid that to
some degree cause those guys just keep

2559
02:42:44,681 --> 02:42:48,090
blacking out on high closing
time. That makes, um,

2560
02:42:48,430 --> 02:42:51,670
it's that sense of I got to
get it down pat. Yes. Yeah.

2561
02:42:52,060 --> 02:42:54,970
Chicago bars or four or 5:00 AM
they just end up sleeping there.

2562
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:57,370
They go ask a girl and a girl
was like, I'm good. And like,

2563
02:42:57,700 --> 02:43:00,430
and they just keep drinking and then
they just live there for a day or two.

2564
02:43:00,670 --> 02:43:03,800
That's crazy. I've seen that by the way.
I've seen guys sleep at the bar sleep,

2565
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,140
put them outside, put them in
an alley or on a, you know,

2566
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:08,370
then wake up and they're like, hey,
I got something to drink. Yeah,

2567
02:43:08,440 --> 02:43:12,090
you want something to drink? It's seven.
We started serving an hour ago. God,

2568
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:13,880
it's a good life.
Hey if that's all you got

2569
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:21,730
do, that was our deal because that
seems pretty, they just had a, um,

2570
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:24,970
they just had a vote this past
session to put it to three,

2571
02:43:24,971 --> 02:43:27,100
maybe to 3:00 AM and how'd that go?
They shut it.

2572
02:43:27,101 --> 02:43:29,560
They shut it down at lost by
like a landslide. What? Yeah,

2573
02:43:29,561 --> 02:43:32,030
because it was something about, um, the,

2574
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:36,010
there's a budget increase then in
police force, uh, to deal with,

2575
02:43:36,330 --> 02:43:39,130
to deal with assholes that are
leaving the bar. Black problems. Yeah.

2576
02:43:39,131 --> 02:43:40,240
There's all sorts of bullshit.

2577
02:43:41,950 --> 02:43:46,270
Such a like a bump of people
spending money out that it
would be worth it though.

2578
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:48,310
I don't, maybe not
though. So you say that,

2579
02:43:48,311 --> 02:43:51,580
but I think like a lot of times people
get so fucked up so early. They,

2580
02:43:51,730 --> 02:43:54,740
I think a lot, most people leave
the bar before 2:00 AM yeah.

2581
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,830
Because they know it's going to close.
Do you know what I mean?

2582
02:43:56,831 --> 02:43:59,200
Like either go get more liquor
and go to someone's house.

2583
02:43:59,230 --> 02:44:03,310
I feel like it at 2:00 AM only on peak.

2584
02:44:03,490 --> 02:44:07,270
Maybe a Saturday night is the bar packed
when it closes every other night of the

2585
02:44:07,271 --> 02:44:09,940
week. It's like, you know,
staggered. I feel like that's,

2586
02:44:10,570 --> 02:44:13,780
I feel like every time I go out and I
see that if I've ever closed the bar,

2587
02:44:13,900 --> 02:44:15,910
I look around, I'm like,
we're, we're pretty sad.

2588
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:20,080
There's like 15 of us sad people here
staring at each other. The lights go on,

2589
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:23,470
you know, like we should go home.
Everyone's like, yeah, this is a bummer.

2590
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:28,690
This is like a really pathetic
underwear. England, it closes at 11 yeah.

2591
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:32,890
Well the British people drink all
day, all day. So you started earlier.

2592
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:35,440
They don't really have, I don't
think they care because they're like,

2593
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:40,120
they wake up and like, oh, grab a pint
and eggs and beans. You can't last.

2594
02:44:40,121 --> 02:44:43,400
If you really do that, you know, like
your days where you're like, it's,

2595
02:44:43,430 --> 02:44:44,470
it's morning.
You're like,

2596
02:44:44,471 --> 02:44:48,220
let's get drink and right now
people do it and I'm so impressed.

2597
02:44:48,221 --> 02:44:49,870
I'm going to be honest, if I say like, oh,

2598
02:44:49,871 --> 02:44:52,420
we're going to a baseball game and
I'm going to have a couple of beers,

2599
02:44:52,810 --> 02:44:55,510
the night is called off, whatever I
was going to happen that night. Can't,

2600
02:44:55,511 --> 02:44:57,380
can't exist. It's over. Yeah. Won't exist.

2601
02:44:57,430 --> 02:45:00,130
I'll be at home and people like you have
to come out and you remember when you

2602
02:45:00,131 --> 02:45:03,940
fuck that guy, Rick in Charlotte,
he told me, we tell this story 100%.

2603
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:07,570
So I met Rick in Charlotte.
Uh, well I should say this.

2604
02:45:07,571 --> 02:45:09,160
I met him in the Appalachian Mountains,
right.

2605
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:12,490
So I met him in the mountains and
we were both hiking. Yes. And, uh,

2606
02:45:12,610 --> 02:45:13,540
what happened was,

2607
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:16,900
is I'm hiking during the day and
I was a little bit sad and lonely.

2608
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:20,200
I was gonna have a big fight with my
significant other. And uh, this guy, Rick,

2609
02:45:20,230 --> 02:45:21,340
I was out of water.

2610
02:45:21,341 --> 02:45:24,940
My camel pack had ran out of water
and the ric had had a Campbell,

2611
02:45:24,941 --> 02:45:29,850
pat had a one of the 12 gallon at first.
It's just like necessity. I, well, I,

2612
02:45:30,030 --> 02:45:34,000
I was kind of bending over co dry
coughing, you know, and he goes, hey bud,

2613
02:45:34,030 --> 02:45:37,990
you know, he's on another P, you
thirsty? I said, I love it. And he goes,

2614
02:45:37,991 --> 02:45:41,050
you can suck on my pole. So that's
what they call them, suck on my poles,

2615
02:45:41,230 --> 02:45:44,300
sharing camel backs. So he
walks over to the, you know,

2616
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,720
the other peak with me and you know, I'd
give him, first of all, I give him a big,

2617
02:45:46,721 --> 02:45:51,150
big hug. Yeah. Big Guy.
Real big guy. Yeah.

2618
02:45:51,180 --> 02:45:55,660
Kind of like I'm a real heavy,
probably like three 30,

2619
02:45:55,661 --> 02:45:58,670
three 45. Wow. But not tall. You know,

2620
02:45:58,720 --> 02:46:03,070
he was a short for 10 for
10 but three 53 65 maybe.

2621
02:46:03,490 --> 02:46:07,660
And he shoved his full in my mouth. Yeah.
Big Guy. Shoved it right in my mouth is,

2622
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:12,320
you know, and just, you know, made me
suck and I sucked it down. And um, I said,

2623
02:46:12,321 --> 02:46:14,750
you know, I have a show tonight. I'd
love you to come see me to stand up.

2624
02:46:14,751 --> 02:46:17,360
And he said, no chance, but you
can meet me at my hotel afterwards.

2625
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:21,440
And he's not a comedy fan. That's
crazy. Yeah, it was nuts. It was nuts.

2626
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:24,080
You still went and did your show bombed?
Bombed two sets.

2627
02:46:24,081 --> 02:46:26,930
Because I just was thinking about Rick
the whole time and the moment I got off

2628
02:46:26,931 --> 02:46:29,870
the second set, you know, the owner was
like, oh fuck, I was all mad, you know,

2629
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:31,220
as I was like I gotta Roll Dude.

2630
02:46:31,221 --> 02:46:34,430
And I went right to that Hyatt
and just how fun was that?

2631
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:37,010
It was at first it was a little
daunting to be honest with you,

2632
02:46:37,011 --> 02:46:39,280
cause he is a large man and I just did,
you know,

2633
02:46:39,590 --> 02:46:42,380
there was never a discussion over
top or bottom. It was pretty obvious.

2634
02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:47,330
So you know, um, I was
recovery. Uh, not bad.

2635
02:46:47,390 --> 02:46:50,300
I mean not too bad.
At least he made me an ice bath,

2636
02:46:50,301 --> 02:46:53,110
which it's takes so many trips to go to
the hallway because of the ice machines.

2637
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:56,890
Never ever, ever just a
little baby bucket. Yeah.

2638
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:59,780
So we borrowed a few buckets from
other people. We kind of got,

2639
02:46:59,781 --> 02:47:01,250
it was like a communal community thing.

2640
02:47:01,251 --> 02:47:04,250
It was like pass the bucket down and
everyone was like, why are we doing this?

2641
02:47:04,251 --> 02:47:07,460
If someone's sick, if someone
hurt. And you know, I bent over,

2642
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:10,730
I opened up my moon pie and I
showed him what happened. And uh,

2643
02:47:10,731 --> 02:47:12,740
I sat in there for about an hour
and a half and everything was fine.

2644
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:14,880
I got to say, it's one of
my favorite stories. Yeah.

2645
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:18,140
But can I update you on something
because you've asked me a few times.

2646
02:47:18,590 --> 02:47:23,030
Rick has fled the country. Where
is he? You know, he said he, he,

2647
02:47:23,031 --> 02:47:25,670
I got a suspicious email.
Um,

2648
02:47:26,330 --> 02:47:29,600
I have some weird suspicion email and it
just said I'm leaving and I'm going to

2649
02:47:29,601 --> 02:47:30,290
the Netherlands.

2650
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:33,800
So I think this fall is going to be my
trip to the Netherlands to try to find

2651
02:47:33,801 --> 02:47:37,490
Rick. Wow, cool. You could probably build
a tour around it, write it off, you know,

2652
02:47:37,491 --> 02:47:39,710
I love that. I would absolutely
love that. But then again,

2653
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:43,430
I'll be thinking about Rick not comedy the
whole time. Yeah. Your Bom, Bom, Bom, bom.

2654
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:48,320
And that's pretty cool. Yeah, it's so
romantic. It kind of is. It kind of is.

2655
02:47:48,321 --> 02:47:50,510
You know, and in this modern
age, no one really talks about,

2656
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:55,340
nobody really will romanticize every time
two guys have like a gay joke and film,

2657
02:47:55,341 --> 02:47:57,680
they're always like, oh, you know,
it's, it's just, it's too cheap.

2658
02:47:57,770 --> 02:48:01,250
This was real love. This was real cool.
Yeah. For the first time in a long time.

2659
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:05,870
I gotta tell Ya. I remember
when I met, uh, Saint Tino,
I was like, Hey Tom. He goes,

2660
02:48:05,871 --> 02:48:09,790
I'm just glad you're not named Rick. Oh,
that's a weird thing to say. Sure. Yeah.

2661
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:13,490
But why? And then he told me the whole
story. Do you say it to everybody?

2662
02:48:13,491 --> 02:48:17,120
And he's like, if they're not named
Rick, I do. Most men. Yeah. Yeah.

2663
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:20,960
Well I don't trust most guys after
experiences like that. Oh my bad. Yeah.

2664
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:22,550
So I just, you know, that, that, that,

2665
02:48:22,551 --> 02:48:24,950
and that stuck with me and I know you
brought it up cause it's the podcast,

2666
02:48:24,951 --> 02:48:28,700
but it does stings a little
bit. I'm sorry. That's okay.

2667
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:31,490
This is your show and a, that's
true. I'm going to let it go.

2668
02:48:31,491 --> 02:48:36,200
I didn't mean to hijack, no,
come on. No, no, no. It's not
disrespectful. Not at all.

2669
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:39,740
No. It's respectful. It's respectful
because it's your, it's your house,

2670
02:48:39,890 --> 02:48:43,760
your mom's house. I want to make
something clear. We are overjoyed.

2671
02:48:43,850 --> 02:48:46,350
First of all that you're going to
the Netherlands to find Rick. Yeah.

2672
02:48:46,370 --> 02:48:48,830
But secondly that whiskey,
ginger,

2673
02:48:49,130 --> 02:48:53,930
your podcasts that everyone should
subscribe to, please download, review,

2674
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:57,800
thumbs up, stars, write a love letter. Uh,

2675
02:48:57,820 --> 02:49:02,820
also you will very soon be able to
watch the watch his podcast here on this

2676
02:49:04,761 --> 02:49:08,880
youtube channel. He's going to
record it in this set over here. Yup.

2677
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,920
And the video coming up. We'll be coming
up on Monday, starting in like two weeks.

2678
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:17,720
Is that right? Or something like
that. Give or take. All right, so,

2679
02:49:17,730 --> 02:49:21,690
but it will be a regular thing where
you can watch the video on the youtube

2680
02:49:21,691 --> 02:49:26,370
channel or you can download and listen to
whiskey. Ginger, you are hilarious dude.

2681
02:49:26,371 --> 02:49:30,480
So I, I'm super, super pumped that you're
doing. Thank you. I'm so, I'm excited to,

2682
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:34,200
you know, like, uh, I know
this sounds like I'm pandering,
but you guys are kind of,

2683
02:49:34,980 --> 02:49:38,460
I mean there's only two or three people
that really told me to kind of get into

2684
02:49:38,461 --> 02:49:40,080
it and you guys are kind of part
of the reason that I did it.

2685
02:49:40,230 --> 02:49:43,230
I avoided doing a podcast for a long
time cause I just was like, I don't know.

2686
02:49:43,620 --> 02:49:46,140
I don't know. And I like doing other
people's podcasts, but I just didn't,

2687
02:49:46,230 --> 02:49:47,750
I just didn't feel like I was like,
ah,

2688
02:49:47,751 --> 02:49:49,680
I don't have anything to
offer and all that shit.

2689
02:49:49,681 --> 02:49:51,530
But you guys were kind of the part of the,

2690
02:49:51,610 --> 02:49:55,530
the last thing that pushed me over the
edge to do it honestly for Rick and do it

2691
02:49:55,531 --> 02:50:00,060
for Rick, but I have this weird fewer
natural man. You natural. Thanks man.

2692
02:50:00,290 --> 02:50:03,000
I have this weird fear.
He's not listening. That's
the weird thing, you know?

2693
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:04,350
And that kind of eats me alive.

2694
02:50:04,470 --> 02:50:07,950
There could be like a cool Easter
egg in every episode for Rick.

2695
02:50:08,430 --> 02:50:09,660
You know what I mean?
Shout out to Rick,

2696
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:13,320
like maybe you get a camelback and
you kind of do things. That's my,

2697
02:50:13,350 --> 02:50:15,520
that's my Carol Burnett sign off.
I stuck a little bit of a cold.

2698
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:18,780
I can't hold back for Rick
exactly. Or like, you know,

2699
02:50:18,820 --> 02:50:20,880
I don't remember what you said.
Was it a favorite food?

2700
02:50:20,881 --> 02:50:24,270
But maybe we put a little bit, you don't
remember? I said what? I said I forget.

2701
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:28,390
Are you serious? Wait. It was, was
it pistachios or I as a chicken pie.

2702
02:50:28,460 --> 02:50:32,340
Pistachio Mash.
That's like some elaborate.

2703
02:50:32,341 --> 02:50:36,230
I've told I've told you this 10 10 12
times Robert to have set up, you know,

2704
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:38,460
to get, I was looking at putting
a little bowl of it on the,

2705
02:50:38,461 --> 02:50:41,160
you have a studio here. We got. These
guys can cook some shit up. All right.

2706
02:50:41,190 --> 02:50:44,100
I'm sending a recipe and I want that every
time. All right. That's in my writer.

2707
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:48,390
It's a chicken pie or pistachio
mash. Wow. Have you never had that?

2708
02:50:48,810 --> 02:50:52,740
It's a delicious dish. Well, Rick turned
me onto it. Oh my God. Can we move on?

2709
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:56,660
This is going to really,
that's, that's crazy. Bury me.

2710
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:58,710
I don't want to get you going,
but I also have this clip.

2711
02:51:04,320 --> 02:51:07,210
Sorry ma'am.
Rains and the corner.

2712
02:51:08,670 --> 02:51:09,780
That really goes deep for me.

2713
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:13,920
I have a clip of Pristina haven't
played yet on the show. Ready?

2714
02:51:18,690 --> 02:51:21,450
There you go.
You sound great there by the way.

2715
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:24,960
My older,
my career before.

2716
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:28,120
How did you skip out on
having the valley voice and

2717
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:31,110
super conscious of it?

2718
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:36,350
When I get with my BFF Shauna who
grew up in the valley too, we,

2719
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:40,170
we are regressing to like, oh my God
dude. Like fucking Bro. Like dude bro.

2720
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:44,660
Like Bro, but that,
but, but, but Sally up,

2721
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:47,170
speak up, speak up. Speak that kid.

2722
02:51:47,180 --> 02:51:49,770
That was a revival with Paris
Hilton I think in those girls.

2723
02:51:49,771 --> 02:51:53,550
But she did that Paris Hilton was
kind of like the Nicole Nicole.

2724
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:56,550
That girl brought it back,
I don't know,

2725
02:51:56,551 --> 02:51:58,530
but there was big in the
eighties speaking to come back.

2726
02:51:58,531 --> 02:52:02,910
You know Lindsay Lohan is got a TV
show now you guys know does MTV,

2727
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:05,290
I just saw a billboard on
sunset and they immediately it,

2728
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:09,600
that's the name of the show that
I googled it.

2729
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:14,110
She has a fucking show on TV about rehab
or something. Yeah, I imagine it's life.

2730
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:17,380
It's her life. It's just, it's a reality
show. It's got to be sad though. She,

2731
02:52:17,410 --> 02:52:21,700
she was so talented. I know.
Isn't it weird that that
talented goes the other way?

2732
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:25,330
Yeah. I like, it's w I never,
that's so strange to me. So fuck,

2733
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:27,670
when you're kind of mediocre
town mediocre and you fall off,

2734
02:52:27,671 --> 02:52:30,370
like if what I ended up falling off,
people will go, yeah, okay, that's fine.

2735
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:35,350
But when you like, when you're like
huge and you're the thing for sure.

2736
02:52:35,351 --> 02:52:38,710
Now look at them. I'm giving
you, put Rick in my head.

2737
02:52:39,220 --> 02:52:42,610
Rick used to tell me you're not worth it.
That was kind of my favorite.

2738
02:52:42,611 --> 02:52:44,590
That was turned me on.
You're not worth desk.

2739
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:49,330
And he had this sweet deep voice.
We have to get a search party.

2740
02:52:49,950 --> 02:52:54,950
We got to find Rick in the Netherlands
and you toward another one 65 well we all

2741
02:52:55,031 --> 02:52:58,090
get, let's can we go? So we
get, maybe he's gonna stand out.

2742
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:01,360
Those people were all long and
lean. You know, you'll find your,

2743
02:53:01,361 --> 02:53:04,810
Hannah mentioned it. People are like, Oh,
you're talking about like short fat Rick.

2744
02:53:04,811 --> 02:53:09,220
Yeah, I know exactly know gay
Rick. That's the name of it.

2745
02:53:09,221 --> 02:53:13,510
That's the name of the tour
back yet. Let's find Rick.
Let's fine. Rick, the tour.

2746
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:19,150
I'll go. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so down.
I'm very sorry. Lindsay. Load hands. No,

2747
02:53:19,151 --> 02:53:21,280
nothing. She, I feel she's
doing a TV show and I can't,

2748
02:53:21,281 --> 02:53:24,820
it's just so funny to think that there's
so much good garbage television man.

2749
02:53:24,821 --> 02:53:27,990
It's awesome. I think it, do you
watch the bachelor bullshit or no? No,

2750
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,510
we're really in the bachelor of
the bachelor. It just started.

2751
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:35,680
We're watching 90 day fiance.
I'm all over it.

2752
02:53:36,670 --> 02:53:40,720
It's one of my favorite shows I've
ever seen, ever created. Ever credit.

2753
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:44,270
You know what Brexit might
have after lockup. I like it.

2754
02:53:44,350 --> 02:53:48,490
But 90 Day has more drama you like, yeah.
90 Day has better drama for me. The kid,

2755
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:50,770
the kid, um, and the names
are bad. I'm bad with names,

2756
02:53:50,771 --> 02:53:54,190
but the kid who has the wife that has
the baby over over in Russia that he had

2757
02:53:54,191 --> 02:53:56,410
to come back.
I believe their love.

2758
02:53:56,670 --> 02:54:00,640
I actually believe that actually believe
their love. You also empathize with him.

2759
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:02,920
When you see them getting angry,
you're like, you're young.

2760
02:54:02,921 --> 02:54:05,110
You just got to work to shut out.
Totally take a couple deep breaths.

2761
02:54:05,230 --> 02:54:08,770
Just kids like going through a
weird love struggle and I buy that.

2762
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:09,561
You know what I mean?
Well,

2763
02:54:09,561 --> 02:54:14,370
so much responsibility at such a
young who's loved by the most, uh,

2764
02:54:14,380 --> 02:54:17,380
well there is no, there is
literally no love between the, uh,

2765
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:19,600
the girl who has two kids
from two different dads.

2766
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:24,100
The blonde girl with the Jamaican guy.
See, she does have two kids. Yeah,

2767
02:54:24,470 --> 02:54:26,290
she's mentioned that.
She's mentioned it. Okay.

2768
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:29,140
Another reason that I don't believe it's
real love because this woman has two

2769
02:54:29,141 --> 02:54:32,930
children. You never even see
that this is what she mentioned,

2770
02:54:32,931 --> 02:54:36,570
that I go like three episodes
and you're like, shit,

2771
02:54:36,610 --> 02:54:40,030
it's never come up again probably with
their father so she can do this nonsense

2772
02:54:40,031 --> 02:54:43,070
show. I gotcha. I see. That's why I
don't believe in any of that. Also,

2773
02:54:43,090 --> 02:54:45,850
like I think he cheated
on the wedding day,

2774
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:49,660
which is a bowl that is a bold move.
I mean, if you're going that far yet,

2775
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:52,550
we haven't made it to the wedding day.
Sorry,

2776
02:54:56,500 --> 02:55:00,490
I'm the, I'm the Queen Bitch. That girl
who's like on the stairs, she's like,

2777
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:03,850
that is, I like you. You biggie.

2778
02:55:03,851 --> 02:55:08,851
How sick and the Cottica we get to Biggie
Pooley she's so great and she hates

2779
02:55:10,401 --> 02:55:11,670
the mother.
A biggie.

2780
02:55:11,730 --> 02:55:15,710
Poorly gets a biggie booty
and her teeth are enormous.

2781
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:21,950
People know, wow, look big money.

2782
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:25,790
Her teeth are bigger than veneers, you
know, bigger than those. She's like, yeah,

2783
02:55:25,791 --> 02:55:30,710
like the big, the Steve Harvey's, she,
she's good. And the um, the kid, the,

2784
02:55:30,810 --> 02:55:34,080
that, that's the vague,
that's Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.

2785
02:55:34,250 --> 02:55:36,020
That's my favorite part
that goes with this mom.

2786
02:55:36,021 --> 02:55:39,290
And she hates the place that they live
and he lives with his mom. That poor guy.

2787
02:55:39,320 --> 02:55:43,310
I don't even, I, oh, I feel so bad
for him. It's not even fun anymore.

2788
02:55:43,570 --> 02:55:45,050
Do you know there's like some
people on the show, you're like,

2789
02:55:45,230 --> 02:55:46,370
I don't feel about you trapped yourself.

2790
02:55:46,430 --> 02:55:50,870
Like the dad that disowned his daughters.
Yeah. So the other girls, it's like, dude,

2791
02:55:50,871 --> 02:55:54,290
I don't feel bad for you, but the Vegas
Guy, I feel sad for him because he like,

2792
02:55:54,291 --> 02:55:57,620
he loves Vegas, he loves his mom.
This girl is like, Fuck Vegas,

2793
02:55:57,621 --> 02:56:01,640
you mom is bitch and shit. And he's like,
I love you. You're my dream girl. He, uh,

2794
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:06,410
it's the, it's like, we always say
like cool. At one point he's like,

2795
02:56:06,411 --> 02:56:09,380
well, you're, everyone knows
a boy's best friends. His mom,

2796
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:14,540
and then they have like a, a joint bank
account. He and his mother, 33, 33.

2797
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:16,820
She's like,
what about when we get married?

2798
02:56:17,210 --> 02:56:19,280
What are you going to do as far
as the bank account? He's like,

2799
02:56:19,640 --> 02:56:22,130
just keep you on it. You
know, all three of us,

2800
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:24,680
all three of us would be
like a big happy family. Mom.

2801
02:56:24,681 --> 02:56:29,180
My wife and I share a checking account,
checking account.

2802
02:56:29,660 --> 02:56:31,970
It's, so, imagine the fights
that will come from that,

2803
02:56:32,240 --> 02:56:35,360
that the mother is like fighting
with a Brazilian over what she saw.

2804
02:56:35,361 --> 02:56:38,300
She bought on their check.
I mean like couples do that.

2805
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:39,193
Husbands and wives do that.

2806
02:56:42,410 --> 02:56:47,090
Wow. That was way better than
yours. Wow. Yeah, that was, dude.

2807
02:56:47,091 --> 02:56:50,960
Are you pushing off the leather?
Are you getting lift?

2808
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:01,580
That's the best day of your life.
Well, she did say kid's wedding farts,

2809
02:57:01,581 --> 02:57:04,610
but now it's too far, so I feel like
that it moves up. Moves up a little bit.

2810
02:57:04,930 --> 02:57:08,200
It was fun. That's really good. Hey,
can I tell you something here? Go ahead.

2811
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:13,370
You have great compression in your farts.
Let's talk about it.

2812
02:57:13,400 --> 02:57:17,420
It just sounds like a perfect bubble came
out like a perfect fart bubble. Just,

2813
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:20,600
yeah.
Tom's was more like,

2814
02:57:22,490 --> 02:57:24,810
cause there's little Ripley.
Yeah, there's also in there. Yeah.

2815
02:57:24,890 --> 02:57:29,570
I'm so mad because I had
such killer farts today.

2816
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:33,800
I know. And then you let them all go.
They, none of them got captured. You know?

2817
02:57:33,801 --> 02:57:35,240
It's like when you're trying
to get a set and you're like,

2818
02:57:35,241 --> 02:57:39,500
a fucking killed it last night. Why
don't you set up the camera? Nothing.

2819
02:57:40,190 --> 02:57:44,810
Hey, can we say this? Yeah. Your
farts are just as valid as her farm.

2820
02:57:45,620 --> 02:57:50,030
Don't get down. You're far shaming.
You're forced shaming yourself. Yeah, no,

2821
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:53,700
I know. I should just celebrate yours.
You know, try and be happy for me. Yeah,

2822
02:57:53,710 --> 02:57:57,830
that's true. Sorry, I'm sorry.
That was a really cool fart.

2823
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:03,480
Next episode you're going to have some
parts of your own. Yeah, I have a feeling

2824
02:58:05,120 --> 02:58:08,660
that he heard that without
headphones in there.

2825
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:11,233
That was up.

2826
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:16,920
You know what I'm really happy about
is the people listening to this podcast

2827
02:58:16,921 --> 02:58:19,750
wearing their ear buds.
Now they can hear the FARC clear.

2828
02:58:19,800 --> 02:58:22,590
Imagine someone with a good sound
system in their car. The base on that.

2829
02:58:25,130 --> 02:58:26,490
Talk about new advertisers.

2830
02:58:28,290 --> 02:58:31,390
Just opening the gates for marketing.
Hello money.

2831
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:37,980
How many other podcast? You know
who does have it? Your mom's house.

2832
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:41,550
That's fucking right. That's the
only one. You're the only one I know.

2833
02:58:41,551 --> 02:58:44,670
Let me build, I also didn't eat like a big
enough thick breakfast. I'm really mad.

2834
02:58:44,671 --> 02:58:46,800
I was on the run this morning,
but if I had a big breakfast,

2835
02:58:46,980 --> 02:58:49,170
this is about the time
that I'm letting them ride.

2836
02:58:49,590 --> 02:58:53,370
Like I had to go pee in there before the
show run. You went for a run? Yeah, but,

2837
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:57,720
but like I had to pee before the show
but like I thought another hour and I'll

2838
02:58:57,721 --> 02:59:00,480
have to shit and I was kind of bummed
I couldn't shit here cause I would have

2839
02:59:00,481 --> 02:59:03,560
loved it. Chris in this place
with my shit day one. Oh yeah,

2840
02:59:03,990 --> 02:59:05,490
no I mean from my front,
a personal level,

2841
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:09,270
I do like to make myself known and then
place that I'm new to. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

2842
02:59:09,271 --> 02:59:12,810
Like every time I go to a meeting in
Hollywood I always, shit, I'm not,

2843
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:13,703
I'm not joking.

2844
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:16,710
I have a Cappuccino machine in my house
and I make probably three or four shots

2845
02:59:16,711 --> 02:59:20,020
of espresso.
Do you time it out so that you know,

2846
02:59:20,310 --> 02:59:22,110
if the meeting's at 11 o'clock I'm up,

2847
02:59:22,170 --> 02:59:24,330
I'm up at like eight o'clock to
like do work, whatever. And I,

2848
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:27,840
and I have my last sip about
an hour and a half prior to,

2849
02:59:28,740 --> 02:59:32,160
that'll give you perfect 90 miles because
I can show up 10 minutes before the

2850
02:59:32,161 --> 02:59:34,850
meeting. I can go into the lobby
awkwardly talked to them one,

2851
02:59:34,910 --> 02:59:37,950
where is the bathroom? It's right
here. It's in the office. Perfect.

2852
02:59:37,951 --> 02:59:40,290
Do you let people know in the meeting
what happened or you like, Hey,

2853
02:59:40,291 --> 02:59:43,260
just so you guys know. Sometimes
I say to the receptionist, I go,

2854
02:59:43,450 --> 02:59:47,520
I've got a lot of stomach issues just so
that might get passed down the line on

2855
02:59:47,521 --> 02:59:51,960
one of those [inaudible] boards
shitting here and he let me know. Yeah.

2856
02:59:52,110 --> 02:59:54,720
He had just had an hour move and
they were like, that's definitely,

2857
02:59:54,721 --> 02:59:57,780
I think it's a power move. I bring my
own baby wipes wherever I go. Yeah,

2858
02:59:58,270 --> 03:00:00,780
just in case. Yeah, I do. They're
on your car during my car,

2859
03:00:01,010 --> 03:00:04,060
just in case I need to clean
up, you know, and I used to do,

2860
03:00:04,650 --> 03:00:08,730
I used to have comedy deodorant in my
glove box, but that's really smart.

2861
03:00:08,731 --> 03:00:11,160
Before nice be so nervous
and I would just put,

2862
03:00:11,161 --> 03:00:14,500
just to put on an extra layer
before standup, do you do, do you,

2863
03:00:14,550 --> 03:00:16,650
does your sweat smell?
Do you have a smelly sweat?

2864
03:00:17,340 --> 03:00:19,500
Because I sweat a lot sometimes,
but it won't smell it. No,

2865
03:00:19,501 --> 03:00:21,600
she doesn't smell well
then it doesn't matter.

2866
03:00:21,601 --> 03:00:24,330
Then you get the rings
on your shirt on stage.

2867
03:00:24,570 --> 03:00:26,640
I'd be so nervous that I
would get the sweat rate.

2868
03:00:26,730 --> 03:00:30,180
Third idea we're gonna make
our third product is shirts
like trauma, sweat rings.

2869
03:00:30,330 --> 03:00:34,290
Oh, that's so cool. They're already there.
Built in socks, sweat, ring. That's it.

2870
03:00:34,291 --> 03:00:37,570
And then didn't we have
something? Oh, the fart or, well,

2871
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:40,440
the big catcher in the front, which by the
way will be our highest seller. I mean,

2872
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:42,860
so we just chopping up are like a billion.

2873
03:00:42,870 --> 03:00:45,630
We just have like forklifts carrying
the money around that we're making from

2874
03:00:45,631 --> 03:00:48,600
these ideas. How can these guys, can
you guys help carrying money in there?

2875
03:00:49,570 --> 03:00:52,470
I feel like they can, they'll
figure it out. So we always,

2876
03:00:52,471 --> 03:00:56,010
we have like a gift for just being
sent the coolest guys on the Internet.

2877
03:00:56,350 --> 03:00:59,940
And I know that, uh, these videos of, of

2878
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,110
just like guys that are out there,
they usually,

2879
03:01:02,111 --> 03:01:05,410
there's a certain criteria and
usually the way it looks. And anyways,

2880
03:01:05,650 --> 03:01:10,280
here's a new one. Oh, nice. Yes.
There's already a great image. Uh,

2881
03:01:13,990 --> 03:01:16,000
um, let's see. I already asked to say

2882
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:21,700
very, here's my question. Why is it so
hard to meet a girl? Just to fucking fuck,

2883
03:01:21,701 --> 03:01:24,640
bro. Why is every girl when the come
into your life and make your life fucking

2884
03:01:24,641 --> 03:01:25,474
complicated.

2885
03:01:25,850 --> 03:01:30,380
You know what I mean? Preach. Yeah, true.
Every single piece of that was true.

2886
03:01:30,710 --> 03:01:34,540
Yeah. What the fuck, Bro? Why can't we
find a girl to fuck? It's like a cro.

2887
03:01:34,541 --> 03:01:38,510
Magnon he does. What does that, what it
does? What does that Spanish, a beautiful,

2888
03:01:39,830 --> 03:01:43,460
beautiful caveman. Yes.
Is this a Geico ad?

2889
03:01:44,230 --> 03:01:46,420
Really looks like it's stupid.
What else?

2890
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:51,400
Meanwhile, their life and their situation
is solely fucking upside down. Okay.

2891
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:54,340
But they want to fucking come disrupt
your life. I don't understand this shit.

2892
03:01:54,550 --> 03:01:58,690
Okay. A lot of women out there fully
fucking full of shit and they're stupid.

2893
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:00,033
Straight up.

2894
03:02:00,450 --> 03:02:02,970
Here's what's weird.
He says their life was upside down.

2895
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:06,270
I feel like perhaps his
might be upside down. Well,

2896
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:09,630
what's in the back will tell
you this before we play this,

2897
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:15,270
this fits all the mold for a perfect,
your mom's house video.

2898
03:02:15,330 --> 03:02:20,100
Go ahead, Tom. What are the criteria?
Well, uh, horrific camera angle. Got It.

2899
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:24,660
Uh, less than ideal lighting. Perfect.

2900
03:02:25,730 --> 03:02:30,730
Um, the shortlist shirtless
Deborah was, is huge. Yeah.

2901
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:35,370
Um, either missing teeth and
or unkempt in a general sense,

2902
03:02:36,390 --> 03:02:41,390
just got knocked that one
out of the fucking park and
some type of either a drug

2903
03:02:42,481 --> 03:02:47,481
induced or mental delusions that lead to
a rant that is aggressive in nature and

2904
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:54,060
or disturbing. And also
don't forget, yeah,

2905
03:02:54,630 --> 03:02:58,610
location. Location is the right place.
Yeah. Where is he and I, and I affect shop

2906
03:03:00,550 --> 03:03:05,550
mommy behind him wrapped in an American
is imagine this guy picks you up for a

2907
03:03:07,050 --> 03:03:10,560
day. So come check out this.

2908
03:03:11,180 --> 03:03:15,750
Fuck you dumb bitch. Dinner was
good. You won't come and Swat you.

2909
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:17,620
Stupid Bitch Bitch.

2910
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:23,570
One thing to fuck with my head,

2911
03:03:23,571 --> 03:03:26,220
but ain't nobody gonna fuck my brother
said I'm not letting that shit go down,

2912
03:03:26,221 --> 03:03:29,190
so it's just gonna fucking go kick rocks.
I don't know.

2913
03:03:29,440 --> 03:03:32,570
I don't understand why so hard to meet
a girl just to fucking fuck I said it.

2914
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:35,130
You don't like it? Delete.
Ban You. I don't give a fuck.

2915
03:03:36,030 --> 03:03:39,790
Whoa dude. Why is his brother had
nothing to do with this? I don't know.

2916
03:03:39,810 --> 03:03:40,471
It'd be nice.

2917
03:03:40,471 --> 03:03:42,690
It would be nice if we saw his brother's
side of it was his brother was like,

2918
03:03:42,691 --> 03:03:44,270
dude,
I don't support any of that shit.

2919
03:03:44,271 --> 03:03:48,400
It looks like a skeleton in
the background. Like it's,
it's fun. It looks normal.

2920
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:51,810
What's, what do you have
in your room? I mean Shit.

2921
03:03:52,440 --> 03:03:54,250
All right,
but this relationship shit with bitches.

2922
03:03:54,370 --> 03:03:57,880
Go clean up your own backyard before you
come. So when Niggas backyard for sure.

2923
03:03:58,870 --> 03:04:03,830
Timeout. What? Why are they outside? Get
inside if you're going to be on a date,

2924
03:04:03,890 --> 03:04:06,170
he put them in near all that
cool stuff he got in the room.

2925
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:09,370
Don't be in the back yard.
Cool stuff. Cool. What do we,

2926
03:04:09,380 --> 03:04:14,330
what is this man's name by the way?
Ted, this is Ted. I think so. It's done,

2927
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:18,120
isn't it? I imagine a Ted, I was
going for something like he dropped,

2928
03:04:18,350 --> 03:04:21,890
he dropped big words. He did,
right? He did. He dropped it.

2929
03:04:21,891 --> 03:04:25,190
He dropped quite big words. Yeah.
God. The angle and here's the thing,

2930
03:04:25,580 --> 03:04:30,170
he's already not a traditionally
handsome man. Timeout.

2931
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:33,740
What makes you say what the
fuck the fuck makes you proud?

2932
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:36,350
Are you taking shots at this guys?
Looks,

2933
03:04:36,980 --> 03:04:39,200
what is it about this guy that's
not right? You're right. No,

2934
03:04:39,201 --> 03:04:42,200
I should be in the sky. It looks fucking
awesome. What are you talking about?

2935
03:04:42,201 --> 03:04:43,730
Two things. Sorry. Give me two things.

2936
03:04:43,731 --> 03:04:45,800
If you find that attractive
about him just to see,

2937
03:04:45,810 --> 03:04:47,990
what do you say no is it doesn't count.
Go.

2938
03:04:48,020 --> 03:04:52,880
Go once on the track of about
this guy. Yeah. With your size.

2939
03:04:52,910 --> 03:04:55,060
What's not appealing from
this angle? Right. Go ahead.

2940
03:04:57,600 --> 03:05:02,060
I was like, is this Brad Pitt on
a bad day? Maybe the angles. Uh,

2941
03:05:02,150 --> 03:05:06,650
here's the deal man. Like if you
are ready on that side, you know,

2942
03:05:06,651 --> 03:05:09,860
why don't you try to make the angle
flattering? It's like you just know,

2943
03:05:09,890 --> 03:05:14,280
like not under here is never
good. It's never going to
be good from here. Never. I,

2944
03:05:14,470 --> 03:05:18,620
I feel like this might be
his most dominant. What if
he's extreme? What if he's,

2945
03:05:18,710 --> 03:05:23,420
what if he's an LP and he, this is his
best angle is up. No thanks if he's an LP.

2946
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:27,070
I never thought of that. Yeah. Look
at the door behind him. See the,

2947
03:05:27,100 --> 03:05:31,640
like the bride of Chucky doll. It's so
beautiful. Yeah. Gorgeous art. Yeah.

2948
03:05:31,670 --> 03:05:34,940
That's just so great. Gorgeous
art. Can you zoom in on that?

2949
03:05:36,180 --> 03:05:40,220
That doll that is Harry Truman on
that dog in the background? No,

2950
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:41,853
fuck it.

2951
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:44,380
Well, it's up on my Instagram. Hey guys,

2952
03:05:44,390 --> 03:05:48,020
I'm on a roll today because
women are fucking stupid. Okay.

2953
03:05:48,021 --> 03:05:52,760
They're fucking stupid.
Why?

2954
03:05:52,761 --> 03:05:56,780
It's so difficult for good guys
to me to fucking saying woman.

2955
03:05:57,080 --> 03:05:59,760
I don't understand why everyone
was a fucking stupid idiot.

2956
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:03,480
Could there be like some could there
maybe be like some paralysis or something

2957
03:06:03,481 --> 03:06:07,230
going on? Like just the way that,
so maybe we should feel bad for him.

2958
03:06:07,290 --> 03:06:12,270
The chest feel bad. You know what? If
he's w okay, you're going to feel bad.

2959
03:06:12,271 --> 03:06:16,110
What if he's legless? He's not like, how
do you know we don't see any of his legs?

2960
03:06:16,230 --> 03:06:18,930
He would make it an issue.
He would make it an issue.

2961
03:06:18,931 --> 03:06:22,920
That might be where this anger is stemming
from. This is old legless legless Ted.

2962
03:06:23,610 --> 03:06:26,870
I feel bad for old leg lists and here
you are throwing shots at his looks.

2963
03:06:26,970 --> 03:06:27,803
Hey guys,

2964
03:06:28,950 --> 03:06:33,570
what am I looking at on the lower left
frame there is that, is that a tattoo?

2965
03:06:33,790 --> 03:06:38,010
I want to know what those tattoos are
so bad. Yeah. Oh right. I want to know,

2966
03:06:38,011 --> 03:06:42,090
it looks like a bird wing was probably
right off. You don't see Christina,

2967
03:06:42,091 --> 03:06:46,050
you big meaning it's the straw that he
blows into. Make the chair move. You know

2968
03:06:51,390 --> 03:06:53,490
he is fucking stupid bitch.

2969
03:06:55,990 --> 03:06:59,880
I mean it moves another couple of years.
Not, don't, don't you put that on me.

2970
03:07:00,400 --> 03:07:02,000
Do you?
You really

2971
03:07:04,410 --> 03:07:08,430
funny.
Are you going to be this mean to this man?

2972
03:07:08,570 --> 03:07:09,850
Don't shoot you guys,
don't you

2973
03:07:10,100 --> 03:07:14,190
the song. I just don't understand
it. I just don't do you understand?

2974
03:07:14,191 --> 03:07:17,040
We are in the situation we are
in because woman ate the apple.

2975
03:07:17,160 --> 03:07:19,350
It is woman's fucking fall.

2976
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:23,730
Gimme back my fucking rib and go
back to her. Fuck you came from

2977
03:07:24,360 --> 03:07:29,190
dude, this is religiously informed as
well. Dude knows what's up for sure.

2978
03:07:29,310 --> 03:07:33,510
You telling me if this guy sent
this video out and you saw it,

2979
03:07:33,511 --> 03:07:37,980
you wouldn't think to give him a shot.
I let them tell you what, come on.

2980
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:41,830
Oh, he does make some good points.
Where's your first date with him? Uh,

2981
03:07:41,910 --> 03:07:44,800
let's think about it. Hold on,
let me, let's be real. Let's be,

2982
03:07:44,980 --> 03:07:49,090
where's your first day? First of all,
he is he going to call? No texts.

2983
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:53,430
Like they'll call, he'll call you from
a payphone? Yeah. Yeah. He'll call.

2984
03:07:53,431 --> 03:07:57,660
You find the one pay phone at the airport.
It's we,

2985
03:07:57,661 --> 03:08:00,990
it's gotta be a weird location.
And then my brother's house,

2986
03:08:05,810 --> 03:08:07,580
his brother and I'm going to eat,

2987
03:08:07,780 --> 03:08:11,250
I got to take the bus down to see
my car's in the shop in the shop.

2988
03:08:11,251 --> 03:08:14,100
It's such a great lie. His car's
been in the shop. There's whole life.

2989
03:08:14,310 --> 03:08:18,270
It doesn't have a car. Never had a car.
So he, so he takes the bus and he says,

2990
03:08:18,271 --> 03:08:19,500
how about we meet at the restaurant?

2991
03:08:19,980 --> 03:08:22,320
Do you think it's a restaurant or do
you think he's going to go Starbucks?

2992
03:08:22,321 --> 03:08:25,810
I think it's what he calls. He calls
everything a restaurant. How? How quick,

2993
03:08:27,570 --> 03:08:30,540
how quickly do you think he goes
from like, all right, we're like,

2994
03:08:30,750 --> 03:08:35,070
so three o'clock. So like you're
fucking stupid. Do you think,

2995
03:08:35,130 --> 03:08:39,090
do you think it's a matter of, if
you're like, that's three and he's like,

2996
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:42,350
fucking bitch. You're like, no. I
was saying like three 15. All right.

2997
03:08:44,590 --> 03:08:48,930
On the edge of Andrea.
What's his life like?

2998
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:53,730
This ted,
once you're really good at Teddy,

2999
03:08:54,270 --> 03:08:56,940
teddy, you analyze this
last time, teddy. Well,

3000
03:08:57,180 --> 03:09:00,030
here's the thing about teddy and the
thing that I said that I knew that you

3001
03:09:00,031 --> 03:09:02,340
didn't know what he is like less
and that is, that is the truth.

3002
03:09:02,370 --> 03:09:04,630
When Tom said about the
chair. That's true. Okay,

3003
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:07,740
so he does take the bus and that's only
because the buses are equipped with

3004
03:09:07,741 --> 03:09:10,380
already uh,
chair loading accessibility.

3005
03:09:10,980 --> 03:09:15,000
How big of a side you should feel bad
about that bus driver let when he sees the

3006
03:09:15,001 --> 03:09:18,390
chair at the stop, Mike, the bus
driver, Mike. Mike is Mike like,

3007
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:21,150
all right,
let's go to take second.

3008
03:09:21,151 --> 03:09:23,580
Like you think it's really
annoying to him every time.

3009
03:09:24,270 --> 03:09:26,790
But I can tell you this guy's chalk
full of good jokes and he always tells a

3010
03:09:26,791 --> 03:09:30,660
good joke when he gets it. I tend to
pretty good at your small quick stuff,

3011
03:09:30,690 --> 03:09:33,900
you know what I mean? Like, uh, you
know, he says, you know, like when he's,

3012
03:09:33,901 --> 03:09:37,290
when he was rolling on the bus the first
time Mike was annoyed and he's like,

3013
03:09:37,650 --> 03:09:41,760
come on dude, you know, like speed it up.
And he was like, you know, he goes, look,

3014
03:09:41,761 --> 03:09:44,780
you've got a leg up on me. You
know what I mean? You know,

3015
03:09:45,110 --> 03:09:49,770
is fakies and Mike side I could
sense. All right. So now he's like,

3016
03:09:49,771 --> 03:09:52,690
hey teddy. Right. The second cub,

3017
03:09:52,770 --> 03:09:56,600
second of times he did hold up the bus
an insignificant amount of time. Yeah.

3018
03:09:56,630 --> 03:09:58,020
Yeah. Cause there was a girl, the bust up,

3019
03:09:58,030 --> 03:10:01,030
he was calling us stupid bitch
and it was yelling at him.

3020
03:10:01,031 --> 03:10:04,960
These rants are common for,
for Ted. Very, very common.

3021
03:10:05,350 --> 03:10:09,620
But it all stems from the fact that
his brother has a bigger cock. Oh yeah.

3022
03:10:09,880 --> 03:10:13,470
That is a big issue in their family.
Yeah.

3023
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:16,870
It's just a fact about their family.
They live together.

3024
03:10:16,871 --> 03:10:19,240
He and his brothers still,
or does he live alone?

3025
03:10:19,241 --> 03:10:20,590
Does this guy have his own apartment?

3026
03:10:20,610 --> 03:10:23,640
Is it going to take me back
to his own place? 10 his
brother lived together. Yeah.

3027
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:26,890
Yeah. They lived in the halls and
the skeletons and all the cool stuff.

3028
03:10:28,270 --> 03:10:32,890
They share a room in a house in Tarzana,
so it's somebody else's home.

3029
03:10:33,250 --> 03:10:35,110
We don't really know those
people to be honest with you,

3030
03:10:35,350 --> 03:10:37,540
but they lived together
in this room for short.

3031
03:10:37,541 --> 03:10:42,010
Head goes like you like a doll's
and artifacts and stuff like that.

3032
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:46,180
And if you're like no, see that. She's
like, you fucking idiot bitch. Yeah.

3033
03:10:46,210 --> 03:10:48,240
And you're like, I'm sorry.
Like here, like here,

3034
03:10:48,580 --> 03:10:51,550
like I'll be the girl
and on the date with Ted,

3035
03:10:51,730 --> 03:10:56,650
you guys go ahead and give it to me.
Give it to me. This is how I'm the girl.

3036
03:10:57,740 --> 03:11:02,620
Christina, are you
familiar with not really.

3037
03:11:02,621 --> 03:11:05,410
What does have an extensive collection?

3038
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:09,730
Oh fuck you bitch. Is that what you're
saying? Is that how that was pretty good.

3039
03:11:09,731 --> 03:11:12,730
That was really good. Really good. Do
you see my reaction? I went like this,

3040
03:11:12,731 --> 03:11:15,740
but you know what? I really
went like my pussy is wet. Yeah.

3041
03:11:16,300 --> 03:11:20,470
The moment you yelled at me like that, I
got to see it. By the way, that red is,

3042
03:11:20,471 --> 03:11:22,980
I'm terrified. Where can I
go with you? Yeah. You know,

3043
03:11:23,410 --> 03:11:26,410
it goes back and then write in. That's
what you were like scared. I'd be like,

3044
03:11:26,411 --> 03:11:30,790
fuck yeah, that's what, that's
Kinda his ransom. Why he does it.

3045
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:34,360
Because he said that happens so many
times, like multiple, seriously.

3046
03:11:34,361 --> 03:11:38,200
Where does he take, where does this guy
go on a first date? Like let's be, well,

3047
03:11:38,201 --> 03:11:42,130
I feel like if he could, so if you do,
you know, you're, you get the call,

3048
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:46,810
you take an Uber, he takes the bus,
uh, and, and he says, let's meet up.

3049
03:11:46,840 --> 03:11:50,220
He says, let's meet up at this. Let's
meet up at a tire rack. You know, like a,

3050
03:11:50,400 --> 03:11:52,470
the to change, you know,
he's got to meet there.

3051
03:11:53,440 --> 03:11:55,290
That's where his brother worked
at the tire, the tire rack.

3052
03:11:55,750 --> 03:11:58,240
That's a tire chain store. You
don't want to tires. And He,

3053
03:11:58,241 --> 03:11:59,074
his brother works there.

3054
03:11:59,290 --> 03:12:02,200
He shows you some of the dopest tires
that they've got that smile that month on

3055
03:12:02,201 --> 03:12:06,880
sale. And if you're kind of not into that
because you're not into that, he's like,

3056
03:12:06,910 --> 03:12:10,000
all right, you're a stupid
fucking bitch. Exactly.

3057
03:12:10,420 --> 03:12:14,410
Do you not like Pirelli's like,
fuck dumb bitch.

3058
03:12:14,790 --> 03:12:17,410
What are you a Michelin Bitch?
Fuck out of my life?

3059
03:12:17,411 --> 03:12:20,170
He tells his brothers showed this bitch,
she's p ones and she was like,

3060
03:12:20,590 --> 03:12:22,840
she didn't get it for sure.

3061
03:12:22,990 --> 03:12:26,470
And then his brother Bitch
fucking dump bitch. I'm bitches.

3062
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:31,210
So that was, that was the test. That's the
test. Let's just say you pass the test.

3063
03:12:31,440 --> 03:12:36,010
I love p one 50 tires. I should
is tight. You dumb bitch.

3064
03:12:36,011 --> 03:12:40,030
I love that. You love that shit. Fuck
yeah, dude. You want to go to dinner?

3065
03:12:40,031 --> 03:12:44,400
You fucking tramps. So it's
a win. Win. Yeah. And then,

3066
03:12:44,680 --> 03:12:47,410
but here's the thing, he says,
let's go get something to eat.

3067
03:12:47,620 --> 03:12:49,990
Where do you think he's going to take you?
This is what I'm wondering.

3068
03:12:51,170 --> 03:12:55,730
I can tell you telling Taco too easy.
Too easy. No, because that's Kinda,

3069
03:12:56,360 --> 03:12:59,430
that's kind of Nice too. I
think it goes like this. Uh,

3070
03:13:02,190 --> 03:13:05,600
do you wanna get something to eat?
Yeah, I'm hungry. I'm not hungry.

3071
03:13:10,610 --> 03:13:15,110
That's it. That's it. Kick
rocks. All right guys. I'll
see you later. It's like, yeah.

3072
03:13:15,140 --> 03:13:19,640
Yeah, you will. Fucking
expensive. Dumb Bitch. Want to
eat food all the time? Nope.

3073
03:13:19,700 --> 03:13:21,410
He's got a blow. Oh
yeah, he's got a blowout.

3074
03:13:23,450 --> 03:13:25,370
You know where I think he might take you.
You know what?

3075
03:13:25,371 --> 03:13:27,320
I think he might take someone like you,

3076
03:13:27,710 --> 03:13:30,770
someone like you because you're
prettier than the average girl. Oh Wow.

3077
03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:33,570
Average girl. He probably treats
a little bit worse. Oh definitely.

3078
03:13:35,550 --> 03:13:40,370
But someone like you, I feel like
he would take you to a Johns,

3079
03:13:40,400 --> 03:13:42,500
you know the other, not Vons, but John's,

3080
03:13:43,190 --> 03:13:45,020
he would take you to a Johns
to the Deli Department,

3081
03:13:45,021 --> 03:13:47,240
let you pick out your own salmon.
I'd be like,

3082
03:13:47,241 --> 03:13:49,010
that's he like you build
your rest a few meets.

3083
03:13:49,090 --> 03:13:53,900
Maybe you're like ham and then like he's
like hands on sale. Yup. Slice to ma'am.

3084
03:13:54,060 --> 03:13:57,590
Two meets tops. Bitch. You're like,
can I get the Italian? He's like, yeah,

3085
03:13:57,591 --> 03:14:00,170
right bitch and I'll let you
get four kinds of fucking meat.

3086
03:14:00,950 --> 03:14:02,940
Capicola and get outta here.

3087
03:14:02,941 --> 03:14:05,300
Kind of Bryce not giving
her brands give was a sliced

3088
03:14:07,880 --> 03:14:11,180
ham sandwiches. You go out
for hand sandwiches with tab.
You don't need any bread.

3089
03:14:11,181 --> 03:14:14,330
Bread, get fat. No one's a fat
bitch. All right, let's roll.

3090
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:16,640
So then when you're
turned on after your meal,

3091
03:14:16,940 --> 03:14:19,790
he's rolling out of there
and you've got to go back.

3092
03:14:19,820 --> 03:14:22,010
You go back to his crib
and you're down at, fuck,

3093
03:14:22,040 --> 03:14:23,860
are you down to fuck at this point?
I mean,

3094
03:14:23,861 --> 03:14:27,200
aren't you turned off from
the whole experience so far?
He's talked to you. Cool.

3095
03:14:27,350 --> 03:14:31,040
He's taking you to cool places.
This guy is a fucking date,

3096
03:14:31,560 --> 03:14:35,060
some sliced ham. You got two
hands. You got to hand sandwiches.

3097
03:14:35,650 --> 03:14:39,650
The sad thing is I can picture the woman
that is under him like there's a woman

3098
03:14:39,651 --> 03:14:43,880
broken enough please. She's like, this is
what I'm worth. This is what she is. Yeah.

3099
03:14:43,881 --> 03:14:48,340
This is nice. He gave me this me and yeah,

3100
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:53,170
and he's only called me a bitch like six
times. I think he's just playing. Yeah,

3101
03:14:53,250 --> 03:14:55,790
I think he's just joking around
when he calls me a dumb bitch.

3102
03:14:56,720 --> 03:14:58,100
Aggressive sense of humor.

3103
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:00,920
You get back to his place where
his brother is there in the room.

3104
03:15:01,250 --> 03:15:03,890
You walk in the room,
his is curating some of the doll work.

3105
03:15:06,210 --> 03:15:08,990
What's with adults though?
I'm being serious.

3106
03:15:08,991 --> 03:15:12,650
Why does Ted collect the doll?
That's their passion.

3107
03:15:13,610 --> 03:15:15,710
That's always been something that
him and his brother had been into.

3108
03:15:15,860 --> 03:15:17,510
I don't know if that's something
to laugh at by the way.

3109
03:15:17,570 --> 03:15:20,690
That's really their passion. Yeah. Some
people have like a bunch of Steeler shit.

3110
03:15:22,010 --> 03:15:25,700
People will collect sports memorabilia.
This is the same thing. This is their,

3111
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:30,170
this is their true love
and passion investment too
because sure are worth a lot.

3112
03:15:30,171 --> 03:15:34,970
I mean, I liked football. Are you to mock
me? Right, right. So you get back there.

3113
03:15:34,971 --> 03:15:35,930
His brothers in the room,

3114
03:15:35,960 --> 03:15:40,270
his brothers in the room and his
brother is already disrobed. Oh,

3115
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:43,520
so he expects me to do,
there's got working legs though.

3116
03:15:43,670 --> 03:15:48,440
Nice thick working likes this. His brother
can squat like five 50 it's insane.

3117
03:15:49,170 --> 03:15:51,360
No, his brother's d road because
that's how they work in the nude.

3118
03:15:52,230 --> 03:15:53,670
They work in the nude.
They curate in the nude.

3119
03:15:53,671 --> 03:15:55,250
You don't want to have
all the paint and all the,

3120
03:15:55,251 --> 03:15:58,110
all the bullshit all over your clothes.
But he gonna ruin of your Nice Shit.

3121
03:15:59,490 --> 03:16:02,680
That's why he's shirtless there. They're
curating. Yeah, they're making stuff.

3122
03:16:02,730 --> 03:16:04,920
They're making cool stuff.
And so his brother and he says,

3123
03:16:04,921 --> 03:16:06,720
would you like to disrobe and
help us with some of them?

3124
03:16:06,750 --> 03:16:10,500
Are you not going to get naked and help
him cure rate? You put it that way. Yeah.

3125
03:16:10,501 --> 03:16:14,400
I feel like that's an obvious natural
to be nude and curate because you're

3126
03:16:14,401 --> 03:16:16,920
trying to get it now that
you're, I get it now. Sorry.

3127
03:16:16,921 --> 03:16:19,440
I see it and you know what happens
at the end of the night, Tom,

3128
03:16:19,441 --> 03:16:22,290
do you know what happens? What
happens? They're done curating. Yeah.

3129
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:26,940
He gets you a bus ticket home. He doesn't
even try to fuck you. You dumb bitch

3130
03:16:31,020 --> 03:16:33,690
that guys, that's really
cool why? He buys me.

3131
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:37,830
But the last bus runs at nine 30 so
he's already, he's got that down,

3132
03:16:37,831 --> 03:16:40,140
but it's dark out.
He doesn't know the bus schedule.

3133
03:16:46,490 --> 03:16:50,280
He blows and he blows you or he blows off
to the stop first. You're like, he goes,

3134
03:16:50,281 --> 03:16:53,340
I'll get you a bus ticket home, and
you're like, oh, I think it'll be,

3135
03:16:53,480 --> 03:16:56,490
it's like eight 56 I'm not giving
you the money. You stupid bitch.

3136
03:16:57,240 --> 03:16:58,980
I'm not going to let you
spend it wherever you want.

3137
03:16:58,981 --> 03:17:02,850
I'm going to give you a ticket so you
make sure that you spend the money on the

3138
03:17:02,851 --> 03:17:05,460
ticket, right pocket
it, try to get rich off,

3139
03:17:06,450 --> 03:17:09,150
which does sound like something that
women have done to him in the past,

3140
03:17:09,151 --> 03:17:11,070
which is why he got mad. He
gave them cash. She's like,

3141
03:17:11,071 --> 03:17:14,370
you'll just for your bus bitch.
And they went and got something else.

3142
03:17:16,480 --> 03:17:18,300
Oh you go to Sephora,
you fucking bitch.

3143
03:17:18,600 --> 03:17:22,110
You bought some rouge bitch that
was for the bus, for the bus.

3144
03:17:22,620 --> 03:17:26,880
Use the money for what I fucking told
you to use it for. You know some rules.

3145
03:17:26,900 --> 03:17:31,680
But here's the thing, my mother
used to call on your way home.

3146
03:17:31,681 --> 03:17:35,040
You're on the bus. You just like
lost it in that glow of love,

3147
03:17:35,041 --> 03:17:38,820
that new relationship energy. And
you're just like, wow, awesome.

3148
03:17:39,090 --> 03:17:42,830
Do you think you're like immediately like
I got to go out with them again? What?

3149
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:47,790
What's like the feeling of yes,
I am in love and I think to myself,

3150
03:17:48,220 --> 03:17:51,130
when's he going to text?
When's he gonna call? Right.

3151
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:55,560
But he's playing the game too because
playing the long game three days before

3152
03:17:55,561 --> 03:17:58,500
any contact.
So it's a game of chicken where I'm like,

3153
03:17:58,501 --> 03:18:02,850
do I do I acknowledge that we
had a wonderful night together?

3154
03:18:03,090 --> 03:18:06,030
Do I wait for him? That could be a
risk though. But here's the thing,

3155
03:18:07,140 --> 03:18:09,990
it's 2019 and I'm a
progressive sort of gout. Okay?

3156
03:18:10,090 --> 03:18:14,430
I'm not afraid to reach out and let a
guy know how I feel and take initiative,

3157
03:18:14,690 --> 03:18:18,270
so I'm going to send that first text.
What do you think your first Texas at Ted.

3158
03:18:18,670 --> 03:18:21,360
She's super cash.
Hey,

3159
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:26,550
she's a thanks for the bus fare home.
Super Nice meeting you and your bro.

3160
03:18:26,610 --> 03:18:28,810
He's big into punctuation. I'm
just letting you know that. Oh,

3161
03:18:29,120 --> 03:18:31,620
so I'd want to know what the big
curve balls going to be though. Matt,

3162
03:18:32,100 --> 03:18:36,900
his brother ends up texting you on
his own. Do you think so? Oh yeah.

3163
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:41,550
Oh yeah. Yeah. Squats a lot. Well,
look at this as you're texting Ted.

3164
03:18:45,930 --> 03:18:49,930
Hmm. That's a new, open
it up. Yo. What's up?

3165
03:18:50,320 --> 03:18:52,600
Oh Shit. It's Micah. You fucking bitch.

3166
03:18:53,890 --> 03:18:57,770
Ted's brother Mike. It's
a biblical name. No Shit.

3167
03:18:57,771 --> 03:19:02,230
He talked about God and it's right there
religious. Then you have that moment.

3168
03:19:02,270 --> 03:19:04,090
Now I have to choose
between the two brothers.

3169
03:19:08,980 --> 03:19:12,610
What are you going to choose? This
is a big issue. Okay, well hold on.

3170
03:19:12,611 --> 03:19:15,790
Let's go through it. The merits
of both. On one hand you have ted,

3171
03:19:15,791 --> 03:19:17,680
it was kind of a quiet introvert.

3172
03:19:20,670 --> 03:19:24,670
Yeah. On one hand you've
got this cool guy, ted,

3173
03:19:24,671 --> 03:19:27,580
who we've discovered,
right? On the other hand,

3174
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:32,290
Mike has got a cool job at the tire store.
No tires front to back.

3175
03:19:32,291 --> 03:19:36,250
I mean you'll never have a tire
question in your life, sir,

3176
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:41,290
and your life and he's employed like the
guy with a good job. Health insurance.

3177
03:19:41,860 --> 03:19:43,270
You know what I mean?
To think about these things for you.

3178
03:19:43,350 --> 03:19:47,980
The future children 401k health insurance,
strong man lifts all day,

3179
03:19:48,060 --> 03:19:52,720
right? Yeah. Ted took me to
the Deli counter. He did.

3180
03:19:52,840 --> 03:19:54,790
Don't forget that.
I'm not forgetting it,

3181
03:19:54,850 --> 03:19:58,060
but I feel like this blood you
choose to meet to meet. Yeah.

3182
03:19:58,061 --> 03:20:01,270
You didn't just get one because mica
is known to be a guy that only lets you

3183
03:20:01,271 --> 03:20:03,630
have Turkey. It's true.
He's a Turkey Turkey,

3184
03:20:03,920 --> 03:20:06,550
but I'm saying that Micah might
take me to a sit down restaurant.

3185
03:20:06,700 --> 03:20:11,620
I'm talking olive garden. Really?
That's a big leap for a guy.

3186
03:20:11,680 --> 03:20:14,800
I don't, I think he doesn't. I think
Mike is more conscious of his finances.

3187
03:20:14,860 --> 03:20:16,420
I think he,
because he's making a lot of money,

3188
03:20:16,450 --> 03:20:18,800
he's been making a lot of
money and he sees some,

3189
03:20:18,850 --> 03:20:23,230
some hottie blonde he come through and
you know all your pitches like the money

3190
03:20:23,260 --> 03:20:26,830
dude, you think he's going to take
me? Where's Micah take you? You get,

3191
03:20:26,831 --> 03:20:29,800
you get cooked at home and he makes
you cook the meal for you guys.

3192
03:20:29,801 --> 03:20:34,150
But we'll hold on. Why don't you
come over and go over and cook,

3193
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:37,600
but I can't. But then the brand
or is there you fucking making,

3194
03:20:38,680 --> 03:20:41,470
how am I going to cook?
How'd the brother's gonna
be there too? If I go back,

3195
03:20:41,471 --> 03:20:44,080
he's got to take me out cause I already
devised a plan to get Ted away from the

3196
03:20:44,081 --> 03:20:44,800
house.

3197
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:47,880
He does this thing sometimes where he
has a buddy who has a astro van number.

3198
03:20:47,881 --> 03:20:52,210
The old astro vans drive him way up out
to like Simi Valley and he makes them

3199
03:20:52,211 --> 03:20:54,220
try to get home anyway. It's like
a game that they play. He's like,

3200
03:20:54,221 --> 03:20:58,090
you've got to get back to, so he's got
a couple hours to kill brotherly love.

3201
03:20:58,120 --> 03:21:00,610
It is there, but it's just for
fun. They're just joshing around.

3202
03:21:00,760 --> 03:21:04,000
But it does give him a good gap of
time. That's true. So you're there,

3203
03:21:04,001 --> 03:21:05,470
you're going to be alone with him.
Then he's like,

3204
03:21:05,471 --> 03:21:10,410
Yo come over and fucking cook dummy.
So you go over to Mike,

3205
03:21:10,411 --> 03:21:12,490
his house to cook.
I mean when you put it that way,

3206
03:21:12,491 --> 03:21:15,360
it's like is it easier to pay it?
Okay.

3207
03:21:16,960 --> 03:21:20,560
And then I come home there. I'm also, we
don't have pots and pans. Fucking stupid.

3208
03:21:20,590 --> 03:21:23,150
Bring your own shit. Some shit
on the way over here. Okay.

3209
03:21:24,040 --> 03:21:27,640
He doesn't have weird sense
of humor are so funny.

3210
03:21:28,670 --> 03:21:32,320
Oh you guys are hilarious. So you
go through all this breakdown. Who,

3211
03:21:32,390 --> 03:21:36,190
who is more worth it to you, Mike or
or 10 but that's okay. So like I said,

3212
03:21:36,191 --> 03:21:40,780
on the one hand on paper looks
better. Sure. On the other hand,

3213
03:21:41,290 --> 03:21:46,220
Ted's a little more secure.
There's more emotional security.

3214
03:21:46,221 --> 03:21:51,160
What's head? He's not going
to cheat on me. Mike has got
a lot going. Hell No. Yeah,

3215
03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:51,471
he won't.

3216
03:21:51,471 --> 03:21:53,900
You're actually right about then if I'm
a girl who was a little insecure and

3217
03:21:53,901 --> 03:21:55,610
beaten down,
like you know,

3218
03:21:56,120 --> 03:21:59,490
I might go for Ted cause like have
you watched love after lock up?

3219
03:22:00,020 --> 03:22:03,440
The premise is like you get somebody who
is so weak that they're never going to

3220
03:22:03,441 --> 03:22:05,570
leave you and that's what you want.

3221
03:22:06,850 --> 03:22:11,640
A 90 day fiance, the Indonesian
chick that comes over to Wisconsin,

3222
03:22:11,930 --> 03:22:16,880
my favorite. How about he's like, ah, I
left for a week. His plays is such a mess.

3223
03:22:16,910 --> 03:22:19,880
Not Darn it and it's such a fucking dump.

3224
03:22:21,060 --> 03:22:24,080
So sad. It's so depressing, but you,

3225
03:22:24,110 --> 03:22:26,630
you end up feeling so
much better than that guy.

3226
03:22:26,660 --> 03:22:29,480
Like I always like just want to
reach through the TV and be like,

3227
03:22:29,481 --> 03:22:33,680
you fucking idiot. Yeah. No, but you know
what he, a lot of those people ask for it.

3228
03:22:34,190 --> 03:22:38,380
A lot of those people ask for it.
They want it, they know it. Okay.

3229
03:22:38,570 --> 03:22:41,360
You're on a TV show called nine yet
you have to get married in 90 days to

3230
03:22:41,361 --> 03:22:45,770
approve someone's visa. Yeah. You're
rushing this thing you for no.

3231
03:22:45,820 --> 03:22:50,240
At no moment. Did you step back and go,
this seems a little contrived, right?

3232
03:22:50,450 --> 03:22:54,140
No moment. Well then you ask
for it. If you're that into it,

3233
03:22:54,360 --> 03:22:57,050
that you don't have the self awareness
to go. This is a little crazy,

3234
03:22:57,550 --> 03:23:00,590
like a little weird, a little crazy. If
you have none of that self awareness,

3235
03:23:00,950 --> 03:23:04,070
I'm cool. That's going to, I'm fine
with that girl from Jakarta, right?

3236
03:23:04,071 --> 03:23:08,630
She has extreme wealth like she comes
from, which is very odd, but I think,

3237
03:23:08,631 --> 03:23:13,050
what do you think it's to come here too.
She wants to go to medical school.

3238
03:23:13,400 --> 03:23:13,731
I know,

3239
03:23:13,731 --> 03:23:18,440
but it's got to be deeper than that to
get away from the family because medical

3240
03:23:18,441 --> 03:23:21,730
you can get, they can get visas to come
to. Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

3241
03:23:21,750 --> 03:23:24,440
There's actually use that guy.
There's gotta be something.

3242
03:23:25,040 --> 03:23:26,300
There's got to be something
that we don't know.

3243
03:23:26,300 --> 03:23:27,830
Something about like
property or real estate.

3244
03:23:27,831 --> 03:23:30,590
That's a big thing for people overseas
to come and buy property and real estate

3245
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:34,010
or investing in something.
There's something that we
don't know that's happening.

3246
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:38,480
I like how depressed she gets when she
realizes what his life really is. Like,

3247
03:23:38,510 --> 03:23:42,380
oh my God. Oh we all get to press.
It hits me harder than it hits her.

3248
03:23:42,640 --> 03:23:45,320
It's rough because she's just,
she's literally going down.

3249
03:23:45,321 --> 03:23:49,700
She's smart enough like to have the
analization of like how sad it really is.

3250
03:23:49,750 --> 03:23:53,480
Yeah. But it hits home
harder when we watch it cause
you're like, you're in this,

3251
03:23:53,481 --> 03:23:56,000
you're stuck in this thing.
This is like quicksand for her.

3252
03:23:56,290 --> 03:24:00,170
She's actually not a stupid person,
which is so weird that you're like,

3253
03:24:00,171 --> 03:24:01,040
it's not a trick.

3254
03:24:01,400 --> 03:24:05,960
She's not like being coerced or she's
not being pulled into something sad and

3255
03:24:05,961 --> 03:24:06,770
gross.
Yeah.

3256
03:24:06,770 --> 03:24:11,390
She is smart enough to use the system
but also like put herself in a worse

3257
03:24:11,391 --> 03:24:15,110
situation. That's why I think
something else. It's fascinating.

3258
03:24:15,111 --> 03:24:20,060
Something must be up to the surface.
A show on TV. We have to wrap up.

3259
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:24,020
Yup. Sadly, you are always the
best. Thank you for loving you guys.

3260
03:24:24,830 --> 03:24:29,580
