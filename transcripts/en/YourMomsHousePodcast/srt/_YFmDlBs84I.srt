champ bottle. I have one at the house.

00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,950
I use it around the house.

76
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,450
What's great about it is that it doesn't
have a tinny tastes the way a lot of

77
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:17,650
water bottles often do. And I love
the top, the Sippy Cup, the sippy top.

85
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,680

Go to your mom's house,

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,593

You didn't get tickets to the take
it down to her. Oh, is that right?

91
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,750
Fucking

92
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,580
what was that last bit?
Master of accents?

93
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,240
David Bowie.

Amen.

95
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,980
And there's something about it.
Oh, let's do something about it.

96
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:32,970
I'm fucking fuming.

97
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,610
Tears come out of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jesus. I was very upset to this day.

98
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,260
How did you find this one?
Ah,

99
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:51,380
someone sent it to me saying that
this was Christina from the future.

100
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,870
I wasn't sure, but I mean, I kind of
see, I see. The reason I kind of do too,

101
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,190
actually, if I'm being honest. Yeah. I,

102
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,310
I don't not see a resemblance.
Right?

103
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,920
Like if I were to gain
a good other fifth day,

104
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,490
those are my old teeth.
Those are teeth I had when I was a kid.

105
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,390
The space and then that
bulging eyes. Easy. Yeah. Easy.

106
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:18,950
If you had stayed after your semester
or your year at my hair. Yep. Yep.

107
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,070
This could have been Mississippi.
Be you eating those sandwiches.

108
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:26,660
You love curry chicken, mango
chicken man Chutney. This bitch, man.

109
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,860
I know it's not, it doesn't not, not
look like me. I'm not going to lie.

110
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,660
This would make, it could be my
Dick invert grow into my body.

111
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,610
What are you talking about?
If this was like what?

112
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,120
I woke up and saw in the
morning, I'd be like, Bib.

113
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,930
Nobody wakes up next to this woman.

114
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:46,250
Someone does know that's
a celibate man now. Yeah.

115
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,240
Now you gotta maintain bro as you can
keep going. I don't know. That's it.

116
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,410
Thank God. Oh, what is she
so upset? She stress me out.

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,010
It's possibly about the weather
soaking wet.

118
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,983
Yeah.

119
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,370
Maybe she's talking about her panties
though. Awesome. She's getting turned on.

120
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,070
I am referring to the weather.
So this is your confirming this

121
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,620
every day for months and months.

122
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,050
I'm going to do my whole
set with a British actor.

123
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,530
When you do it like a pirate
from pirates of the Caribbean,

124
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,880
like a fake British Pirate
Crocodile Dundee.

125
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,960
I know the difference.

126
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,040
You don't know you're doing your
British accent like Crocodile Dundee.

127
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,343
Do it again.

128
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,550
I bet you were invited to London
was you didn't just show up.

129
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:17,230
Demand this to invitation only.
Bitch. Hashtag invitation.

130
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:20,890
Invitation only. Yeah. We keep
a strict code around here.

131
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:22,210
Not just anybody can get on a

132
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,600
bit of a Wyffels. Not
a fucking phrase. It.

133
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:36,400
Bob's your uncle in British town.
Got All, what was your uncle and

134
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,340
you know

135
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,840
what?
Put it this way,

136
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,360
at the end of sentences,
it's a little more proper.

137
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,230
You know London, isn't it? Cockney

138
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,950
bangers and mash. I love it. I could,
I could live there. You know what?

139
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,690
You're going to love their bro.
Real talk.

140
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,120
English breakfast is kind of the
fucking jail I remember. Yeah,

141
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,280
I remember last summer I was
in London and it's so long ago,

142
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,020
but I was there with you also.

143
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,680
Peter's invited wrestle and is a little
place called the o two arena. Can you,

144
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,300
can you even believe that you did that?
I think about you doing that.

145
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,770
And we went to Bam.
We did London though too.

146
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,900
And it was crazy. And he was to
10,000 how many people each show?

147
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,490
I was shitting my pants for you and,
and Russell would go up there anyway,

148
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,430
so it was like, no. First we did a
tuneup, his warmup show unreal was in,

149
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,360
I guess it was in Birmingham, right? Or
was it, yeah, it wasn't Birmingham. Yeah.

150
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,570
Were we went to Birmingham.
He's like,

151
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:56,410
we do a up show before the arena show.

152
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I hadn't even been in an arena and the
warm up show in Birmingham was 7,000

153
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:06,520
people. So he was just like, he's
kind of get, you know, get loose.

154
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,170
See what it's like here. I bombed on
that show. I ate shit and Birmingham,

155
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,240
you're a lot harder on yourself
because I remembered that didn't go.

156
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,480
You did not bomb. I didn't bomb bomb,
but I was like, Huh. And he actually,

157
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,710
we were talking after the show. I was
like, uh, yeah. I remember I was like,

158
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,570
is that there wasn't great.
And they're like,

159
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,120
that's because this is what even he said,
he goes,

160
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:33,121
those people were off the boat like he's
like here that you did it show tough

161
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,324
foreigners.

162
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,880
But in London it was a little
more like art contemporaries. Yes.

163
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,760
I remember it was such a unique experience
of Russell Peters Shell because you

164
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,240
look down,

165
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,240
you look at the audience
and it was just a sea of,

166
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,520
yeah, it was my step. Dad put it that way.

167
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:59,170
My step dad and his family and
it was right, there was a huge,

168
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,240
the Birmingham show,
he was like,

169
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,590
these people just got
here and then London.

170
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,300
It was like,
what?

171
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:11,410
You'd expect a mix of everything
to the culture and any reference,

172
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,680
but the shows when really
differently, very differently. I mean,

173
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:18,090
I couldn't imagine being,
I don't even know how far along comedy.

174
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,910
Where are you at that point in
your career? Uh, seven, eight.

175
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,130
I remember I was shitting nervous for
you and watching you up on these huge

176
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,620
monitors and I was like,
how is he doing this right now?

177
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:34,340
I was just so impressed that you could
even have the nerve to die. I couldn't.

178
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,840
We showed her two weeks later I
did a comedy central presents.

179
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,380
Isn't that crazy work? Yeah.
Wow. With a full charge. Right?

180
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:46,240
Wasn't he charged Jay Larson.
Wow. Taped or special? Very cool.

181
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,100
I remember that when, when
I was in London, I was like,

182
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:55,240
man, we're pretty close
to broke. Oh yeah. And uh,

183
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,920
Russell, I didn't tell him.
I was like, man, but he, um,

184
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,060
he had his personal wire, the payment
to us. I was like, oh we can pay our,

185
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:08,080
I remember that he was so generous
and kind. He flew both of us out,

186
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,230
put us up in a hotel, fed us, I mean,

187
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:15,010
and his wonderful brother
Clayton and his wife.

188
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,280
And it was just wonderful trip.
It was a wonderful trip.

189
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,930
I'll always be grateful to Russell
Peters because he kept us alive for a few

190
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,200
years. Yeah. There's a few people, right.

191
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,980
And so many people have that story by the
way. Oh, I know. Oh Russell. Well yeah,

192
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,820
we'll have a guest come I think. I don't
know if it aired. Yeah. George Perez,

193
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Russell. Peter Stories.
Well, very generous.

194
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,040
And I've met like 10 other guys
who have a story like that. Yeah.

195
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,560
A lot of people have a Russell
stories. Sweet guy, sweet family.

196
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,170
So we were at the country club,
it the mall and um,

197
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,160
I've decided as a married person,
cause we've been together for 15 years.

198
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,480
Um, I'm just going to start
letting you pick out my clothes.

199
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,500
You introduced that whole concept to
me. Yeah. I never thought that way.

200
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,550
You were like, you should pick things.
And I go, why you? Because you look at me.

201
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,480
Yeah.
I don't look at me.

202
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,350
You look at me and I should just
start taking you shopping as well.

203
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,570
I'm talking about how I'd
never do that though. I do.

204
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,770
I try to get you to approve
things. Yeah, but I was so we went,

205
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,630
I went dress shopping
with you and I was like,

206
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,880
just go pick some stuff
that you want to see me in.

207
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,150
And of course she brought
back the shortest,

208
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,030
lowest cut hoochie stuff.

209
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,410
My teds were coming out of every dress. I
was like, man, I got these monster Ted's,

210
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,510
they don't fit.
And like cute little girl.

211
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm a grown ass woman and you don't
want to see what we got about to shoot a

212
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,034
scene.

213
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,000
Keep those tits in that dress.
But there has to be a of raw.

214
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,710
Ah, what? What's the theme?

215
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,700
What's your fantasy? Oh,
you're like, oh, it was,

216
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:03,590
I hope you try it on in the dressing
room. Sure. Yeah. What don't we do that?

217
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,120
Let's go back to the mall right
now. Yeah, you're backed up.

218
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,460
You are so nasty. What'd I say to you?
I was like, when I go out tonight,

219
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:18,290
you got to jerk it. Yeah, I can see
that. The phone's ringing. I go,

220
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,820
I got my,
I got to the comedy store tonight.

221
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:23,140
I can't make sweet marital loves to
you tonight cause I'm working. I said,

222
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,250
when I'm gone, I want you
to clean your pipes. Yeah.

223
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,010
And what did you tell me you're
going to do with your pipe sauce?

224
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,510
I said I was going to check
off on your pillow so that you,

225
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,100
when you get back home, you lay down.
It's just like, what are you five?

226
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,780
You sit up, you're like, what's going
on in your pillows? Stuck to your head.

227
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,560
Are you listening to that? To Matt?
Hello? Slowly just falls off. You're like,

228
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:49,430
what is that? It's nine. He talked
to your lady. That's how it turned.

229
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,580
Tricks on what checks.
That's what chicks like.

230
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,460
Chicks don't like this kind of talk.
Yeah, they do. Listen, I'm damaged goods.

231
00:16:55,461 --> 00:17:00,290
That's why I tolerate this kind of
tall. I got trauma. Childhood issues.

232
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,760
No normal woman. No normal woman
will put up with this. No, no man,

233
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,810
no, you got me. You got me at
a vulnerable point. I was like,

234
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,080
like a wounded, uh, what's the word?

235
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:17,030
Gazelle snatched me right up before I got
into therapy. You know, I like you. I,

236
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,000
I love you. I love you. Are you

237
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,310
anyways, I taught her three year old
son. How to say I need to take a dump.

238
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,320
And you've not been
happy with I don't think.

239
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:34,640
I mean cause obviously I think
that's funny, but you know it's good.

240
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,030
There's context and like then you have
our little boy in situations like,

241
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,460
you know, looking like the animal. I
just don't want him to, you know, to be,

242
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,910
to say it to somebody and then
they're like, that's really cool that,

243
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,180
well listen, I need to take it
down. But it isn't dirty. It's not,

244
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,950
it's not little kids. I gotta
make a poo poo. Poos dumb, boring.

245
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,790
I know. But these three, man, what
about Brown? Can we compromise?

246
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,960
Can I teach him to say I need to make
a brown? Yeah, I think that's okay.

247
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,490
I mean dump has a little funnier.
It's funny here. It is funny here,

248
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,390
but we're not shooting
up, you know, a video.

249
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,200
It's what's the point of
having to comedian parents
if it's not going to be fun

250
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,720
for you. All right. You
know what I mean? Okay.

251
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,910
He's going to be saying that
people are gonna be like, Hey,

252
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,510
you know something really ha today.
It wasn't very nice.

253
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,920
Your son announced he had to take a dump.

254
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,660
He refused upon on his pull ups
the other day at school. Yeah.

255
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,560
And I was like a free ball and dude.
And he was like, yeah, good for him.

256
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,340
That's what he wants. I like that. I like
a little rebelliousness. It's good. Okay.

257
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,090
Well, healthy distrust of
authority. I gotta take a dump.

258
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,280
So one day I was like, excuse
me? He's like, I take a dump.

259
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,110
And I was like, okay. Yeah. And I noticed,

260
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,490
don't think I didn't notice this morning.

261
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:00,440
I got out of the shower and it was
fucking so cold and around like,

262
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,180
I'm happy you are.
And then I check the thermostat.

263
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:07,530
You had it down to 68 degrees.
It felt good. It felt nice.

264
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:10,800
How old man? By the way, you fall, you
always fall asleep before me last night.

265
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,870
I don't know if you do this in
the middle of the, of your sleep,

266
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:17,490
you kicked your blankets off, you
know? No, I did. Yes you did. No Way.

267
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,740
Yes you did. That's you then you're
just, that's propaganda. Nah,

268
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:26,070
it's not propaganda. You kicked it off
and did determine NAC on yeah, of course.

269
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
And we were hot both. I was like, I'm hot.

270
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,600
And then I look at you and you're like
obviously telling me that you're hot.

271
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,570
I'm not hot. Yeah, you
were hot. You were hot

272
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,390
blue man. Just but Hashtag Thermostat,
gate, Thermostat, gate. Yeah.

273
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,610
Go ahead and tweet me.

274
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:46,610
Let me know what your ideal temp
is in spring time. [inaudible] um,

275
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,320
I like a 76.
That is where I am.

276
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,760
And then in winter and the spring I like
it to be 76 actually all the all times.

277
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,400
Um, let me know what your ideal temp is.
Ladies. There's no way anyone's like you.

278
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,850
No one said,
oh one six man,

279
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:06,630
she had it 78 for a while. She's like,
it feels good. It does feel good.

280
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,900
It's nor doesn't feel good. And
look, everyone's shaking their hand.

281
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,140
Well Blue Band. What do you

282
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,070
about Chris 72.

283
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,910
Now we know that it's in my lane.
I,

284
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,720
Josh can't weigh in cause he's severe
disturbs the cockroach and he's like 45

285
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,420
feels nice
by the way.

286
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,750
Did you guys battle it out
of over who got the, uh, the,

287
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,730
the ball kick the ball mate?

288
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,360
I mean, we haven't discussed
it yet, but I know, uh,

289
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,870
you know he has a Greek genes in them and
I can see his chest hair coming out of

290
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:45,950
his shirt sometimes. Yeah. Oh, okay.
Maybe Chris wants them to Chris. Oh,

291
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,070
Chris barely asked some hair.
Oh,

292
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,160
but this isn't going to be for the arms.
Can we do it?

293
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,200
Can we have some type of contest where
you guys battle it out? You know? Oh Shit.

294
00:20:56,201 --> 00:21:01,180
Yeah. What would be the parameters? All
shaving. Yeah. That's a really nice kit.

295
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,870
It is a really nice kit from
manscaped. How about pushups? Pushups.

296
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,780
Oh,
he's walking.

297
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh my God. Jesus just walked
on our set. I didn't even know

298
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,500
your bombs. That was we'll be
right. Yes, right around the pipe.

299
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,220
But that valley, sometimes I get to
the page, so I got the trim. The hair,

300
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,910
the tape split ends. Yeah. I
take this bullet in his arm.

301
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:33,370
I just leave like a little Bush.
Just role and then you fucking uh,

302
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,920
yeah. We're going to dig. It looks
good. My girls don't get handled.

303
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,790
I've never seen my balls don't get no.
Hey,

304
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,230
I get like a wall strand from time that
Trump. Are you Harry on your chest? No,

305
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,450
I have no hair on your
butt. Your cooler. Oh No.

306
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,240
You don't have a Harry Potter
Hall? No, I go, that's nice.

307
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:53,480
Sometimes the time you get that wild
hair that grows out and you just pluck it

308
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:58,150
out. I got a forest back there
in your asshole. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. No, no, no. I'm not a,

309
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,400
sometimes I shit hair.
Would they call lumping young Cuban?

310
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,660
What's that called? Lumpy you.
You don't have a lot of hair.

311
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,940
I have hairy legs, dude. You know I did a
Spanish set a few weeks ago. All Spanish.

312
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,710
How'd you, how'd it go? It went
well. It went well. I had a fun time.

313
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,430
It was Marvin for that.
I go to Miami,

314
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:21,020
I'm going to add a second show on
Thursday and just try a Spanglish show.

317
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,860

do is go up there and play.

318
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,200
And one of my relatives yeah.
With that broken English and they know it.

319
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:39,680
Fucking hilarious. Yeah. And my hands
are great for that. You did that span.

320
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,550
You did, uh, your, I think it was your
stepfather or your uncle and your,

321
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:46,460
this is not happening, right.
What happened? What happened
here? What happened here?

322
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,280
What happened? What happened? Yeah. And he
would try the same all the fucker. Yeah.

323
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,000
That's all he knew. Yeah. That's
all he knew. And I love the,

324
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,200
the detail of like when, uh,
what he could say that to you,

325
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:04,170
but like if the cops come and he's like,
no, nobody knows English, you know,

326
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,810
they played that.
So what is so fun and they played it.

327
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,640
It's hilarious at this. I should take
risk. Are you ready for this? Yeah,

328
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,290
that my mother would come home at night.
She'd go,

329
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:19,070
listen tomorrow he can't go to school
equals and we give you a hundred bucks.

330
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,060
Go to de Luca with them.

331
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,610
Look was an attorney and the
neighborhood fucking deadly Jew deadly.

332
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,660
He represented you.
You got Scott off like I know people,

333
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,320
you know the Sullivan
Act Now the Sullivan Act,

334
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,060
those when you get pulled over
with a piece in New York City,

335
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,750
you just go straight to jail.
You do a year say, oh right,

336
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,710
don't fucking worry you
are a half whatever dog.

337
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,580
I still want him to get people
off of that. Off of gun charges.

338
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,340
He had a menu like when you went to
see him and go, okay, sit down Tom.

339
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:57,020
Nice to see Christina is the situation.
They caught you with this.

340
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,760
They got you on the phone.

341
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,400
I can make the tapes disappear and I can
get to the judge that's going to cost

342
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:09,401
you 400,000 for 300,000 the
tape will be admissible,

343
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,890
but Ohio, an FBI witness to say
that they were tampered with.

344
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,370
You're still going to do six
months, but 200,000 he, dude,

345
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,810
nine months and 400,000 you got
to do 18 months. Give me a call,

346
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,490
think about it.
Great to see.

347
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,250
And it would be like a re wrote
my mom and step out and be like,

348
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:29,600
at what anybody else would be like,
okay, Lisa, you don't even know.

349
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,290
They knew what he was saying. Right. They
would never let the cat out of the bag.

350
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,740
They, yeah, they played immigrants.

351
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,560
Keep that leverage. However you got
to keep your of jury duty too. Yeah.

352
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,990
It's a Hungarian community trick.
My Dad,

353
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:46,980
I said once I get the thing Songolo
talk, Manto, Donald, thank you.

354
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:48,600
Just go in and you're like,
oh, you want to hear it?

355
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,570
These poor bastards,

356
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,810
these poor white basses and Hollywood
doggedly had thrown under the jail. Yeah.

357
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,080
For paying off their fucking kids college.

358
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,930
Yeah.

359
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,843
Nala bail.

360
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,360
They're going to get thrown under the
jail and the two 50 she's going to get

361
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:07,400
some probation.
We'll listen.

362
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:12,430
I kidnapped the Dude Ruhlmann a trunk
of a car and my bail was 50,000 yeah,

363
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,820
it's always paid $1 million,

364
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:18,440
a million dollar bail a piece
and the next day when they,

365
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:22,220
when you went to use their ATM
card, it was like, it's an good,

366
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,040
what are you talking about? No good.
I just put a half a mil in that.

367
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,150
No you didn't. No you didn't. The
feds get on that shit over there.

368
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,660
They don't even fuck around those
people sucking Dick Right now.

369
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:36,230
Full House check tripping
in the valley right now.

370
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,850
That's a half of la racketeering.
They just seize your assets. Yeah.

371
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,160
They wait to you come from trial,
which and then they just take everyday.

372
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,850
It's wild. May Go to your house
the next day with tape recorders.

373
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,950
Crazy that they felt so
compelled like that there

374
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,260
kid could just go in there, kick it.
We've got a gotten to any college,

375
00:25:58,261 --> 00:25:59,570
but they're like, no, my
kid's going to go here

376
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,663
guys.

377
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,790
I do not want my child involved
in any aspect of this area.

378
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,410
I am just waiting for a signal
to get the fuck outta here.

379
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,410
Whether it's a little out of Reno,
maybe it's Vegas,

380
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,790
maybe it's time to see and it's because
of what's happened in the last three

381
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,400
years.
Harvey Weinstein,

382
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,660
Jesse Small at uh,
you know our Kelly,

383
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,630
you've got to think of this
Michael Jackson documentary.

384
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:31,930
You just saw this thing
with these fucking people.

385
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:35,200
Pay for your kids to go to college.
It's a bad environment.

386
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,440
Just think of this is all
the Hollywood machine. Yeah.

387
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,320
If you really think of Jesse's son
a lot, I feel bad for him. Yeah.

388
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,650
I feel bad for him because
he got sucked into it.

389
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,450
Have you ever been on a set and you see
people getting sucked into it and then

390
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:52,380
one day you come out of that fog between
the business manager of the agent,

391
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,470
this manager,
you're 19th assistance.

392
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,880
You're fucking broke now we go
on the road because we enjoy it.

393
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,780
I don't go on the road for money. I go on
the road cause I'm a good fucking time.

394
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,760
When you go on the road for money because
you need to pay the mortgage and yeah,

395
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,530
that's, that's, that's not that much fun.

396
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,870
Taking pictures with
people and hanging out.

397
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,010
It's not so the point I was getting to us,

398
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,400
they're so stupid. She looking
at me, you're like, man,

399
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,150
I'm not the most intelligent guy
I got into University of Colorado.

400
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,720
No high school diploma. Really? Oh yeah.

401
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:34,030
I just kept telling them I'll
send them next week after week.

402
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,850
Every time they bump into me, the
counselor was your high school diploma.

403
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,960
Next week it's coming
overnight, mail, Fedex.

404
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,580
Then I went to continuing Ed,

405
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,900
which is an extension of the University
of Colorado and you go there first for

406
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,930
awhile and then when you get enough
credits you transfer into the,

407
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,390
I got the letter, you get you to
go to shit or get off the pot.

408
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,920
You got to transform it. This is
true story. I went down there,

409
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,080
I got the application,
35 bucks.

410
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,530
I just made up a bunch of fucking shit
because I had taken classes at Colorado

411
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:13,830
Mountain college and Aspen and all
those credits transferred with me.

412
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:16,380
That's not when you launched. Correct.
They didn't used to lose credits that,

413
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,370
you know when you transfer that
might need to cry. Fuck you.

414
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,850
I'm not losing. I did. I did
fucking residential wiring.

415
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:27,540
I did all these fucking classes.
So they didn't take those credits in me.

416
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,430
The university came to me,
came to my face.

417
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,190
I don't give a fuck who goes to jail now.
And they were like,

418
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,290
I wasn't thinking Tom. Yeah.
I used the application.

419
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,160
Joey Diaz.
I wasn't even thinking about it.

420
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,830
A week later denied.
But when I went to one of the classes,

421
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:54,300
I bumped into a guy that was trying to
help me and he goes, aren't you Cuban?

422
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,580
And I go, yeah. He goes,
what's your real name? I go,

423
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,420
Jose.
And the guy looked at me and he goes,

424
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,800
if you were to re do your paperwork,

425
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,900
staple your birth certificate on them.
Jose Diaz,

426
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,830
let's see what happens.
Let me put a word in for you though.

427
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,470
The application wasn't even dry.
I dropped it off.

428
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,290
And by the time I got home at the time
I had a pager, but I had a home number.

429
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,760
Yeah, and they had already left a
message. I, Jose, congratulations.

430
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,980
You've been accepted to Colorado,
listened to them.

431
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,040
I'm snorting coke with three
hands. I'm about to go to
prison. I go, no, no, not yet.

432
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,700
I hadn't kidnapped the guy yet,
so I'm taking clam selling cars,

433
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,563
not in cold.

434
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,630
I'm hanging out in the fucking see you
weight room with Michael Pritchard,

435
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:51,370
nor the football players that
teach me how to tape ankles.

436
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,970
I'm lifting weights with them. I'm
happy. I'm living like a double light.

437
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,770
I'm selling cars,
robbing people,

438
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,010
snorting blow at 90 plus c and then the
date time at from like five to nine I

439
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,880
became a fucking fag.
He students,

440
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,250
I had my little shirt on him and I
go take classes and talk to people.

441
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,390
I was studying political science because
once they came at me with that program,

442
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:20,020
but it was called to see you, Oop,
college program. Are you ready for this?

443
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,830
All you had to do was maintain a c
plus and they kept giving you money.

444
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,540
I had become Joey cash registers because
I had a friend that Halloween fresh,

445
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,850
he had a book for all the money
they gave Spanish people. See,

446
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,100
this is all those fucking
dumb white people.

447
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:43,030
All they had to do was go to the border.
As soon as the Mexican jumps the wall,

448
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:47,050
they grabbed my key. Listen, no program
or we're going to take it to her house.

449
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,880
You're going to marry my
stupid white daughter.

450
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,540
You're going to have like a fake
wedding, Guadalajara style, whatever.

451
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,650
I'm going to give you 10 g's set. You
think about the half milk, half million.

452
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,790
They paid half of them.

453
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:01,420
They could have paid twenty thousand
thirty thousand married the daughter and

454
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:03,220
now you're not Christina presents no more.

455
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,670
You're Christina Hernandez and
you walk right into fucking

456
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,090
fucking stupid. How easy, how many
loopholes you see the girl yesterday,

457
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,610
the dumb bitch didn't even play fucking
soccer. Now did you say this? No.

458
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,260
Yesterday the chip soccer,

459
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,290
they went to the soccer coach
and he said you couldn't make,

460
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,320
this is one of the daughters.
Yeah. Yesterday. Yesterday.

461
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:29,920
It came out that the guy took a chick from
around here somewhere, woodland hills,

462
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,300
and they fucking made a fake profile that
she was a soccer player and then made

463
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:37,720
the captain,
the chicken ever fucking kicked the ball.

464
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,050
The coach was like,
I never saw her.

465
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,410
So it's rocket theory was they got
the soccer coach at Ucla or USC?

466
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:50,560
Correct me if I'm alone.
Racketeering.

467
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,520
I mean it's just cold blooded and they
didn't need to go to Lowe's or treatment.

468
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,750
Yeah. Why would you have to go
to these extremes and doing this?

469
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,110
You know how much money they
would give him? Literally,

470
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,570
every time I turn my head,

471
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:06,571
I was getting that check for
25 of 100 to 5,000 Jose Marti,

472
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,090
Johnny, and he's a Spanish
guy that made more money.

473
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,280
They just don't donate and they have a
fun to sit in for Spanish people and all

474
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,020
you gotta do is just applying.

475
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,420
They would give me fucking down and you're
like, I don't know. I look nice. No, no,

476
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:26,340
no. I wouldn't talk on this. And when
I was on campus, I was like a Jap.

477
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,510
You know how jabs come around
with a camera and they buy
nothing. I ain't, no, no.

478
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:33,930
I don't know. You should've seen
me. You know what I'm saying?

479
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,660
You know what I'm saying? I wasn't
the fat chicken and uh, and man,

480
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,450
I'm fired when the heat log with

481
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,240
Nina La Nina. They would talk
to me. I didn't know nothing.

482
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:48,680
I bow like a fucking,
like I just came back from Cuba.

483
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,410
You should've seen me from why. As soon
as I hit the fucking campus, I was like,

484
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,040
oh,
I was like a half a retard

485
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,310
and I kept asking even though I was like
that retarded kid that has to follow

486
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,144
everybody in school.

487
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,760
I get to school everyday because
he forgets what the school is.

488
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,080
You've had that got to just
tag along. He's just waiting
for you. I was like, Gosh,

489
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:12,500
Shit.

490
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,000
I held that fucking Monica for two years
and when I would see people from the

491
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:21,140
college, I'd just be
shut. Sorry, what's that?

492
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,060
I said, oh my God. It
was fucking hilarious.

493
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,610
When I was shocked.
When they find my paperwork,

494
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,860
they're going to put me under the
jail with those dumb white people.

495
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,890
Cause I think more money.

496
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,310
I was taking money in prison
when I came out of prison,

497
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,240
the first place I went to him,
and this is where it is in Colorado,

498
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:42,740
they had like three checks waiting for
me, but like 12, five, that's how I got,

499
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:46,400
you know, not in the Mafia. They give
you a boost. They gave me a boost,

500
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,780
they gave me a 12 five boosts and then
when I reapplied they said you can't come

501
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,650
into the University of Colorado said
felonies. Oh really? So now they had me.

502
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,100
So I had to switch majors from political
science because this is going to hire

503
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:02,780
me as an attorney.
My plan was to get a coal plant,

504
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,800
political history, history, major
political science, history manager,

505
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,740
and then get into the Spanish
law school like a doctor.

506
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,990
And that's where the big money came.

507
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,280
That's when they started buying your
cars and paying for your apartment.

508
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,580
And let me tell you something.
Uh, about four years ago,

509
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:23,360
I got a letter in the mail from
the US State Department. They Shit,

510
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:27,200
me and my wife looked at it.
We hit the drum roll and we opened it up.

511
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,490
All they wanted back was 2,600 bucks.
Are you serious?

512
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,490
Out of the hall that they ain't
and they wanted it back though?

513
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,500
26 25 a student loan.

514
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:40,400
I had to take it out for 2,600 for
12 credits or something like that.

515
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,450
I just took the 26 and bought
a car and then sold the car.

516
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,680
I was flipping cars that on campus.
Geez. It's going. I'm saying

517
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,990
like
this was a fucking money machine.

518
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:58,110
It was a money machine.
This is why when you're Spanish on,

519
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,530
you have to do is go from
where you don't want to be.

520
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,220
You're not going to get into USC.
They're not going to give me no money.

521
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,420
We got 2000 Mexicans. This
neighborhood. Yeah. You remote danger.

522
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,210
We go to Iowa City,
Iowa.

523
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,590
Anyway with blacks and
Spanish don't want to be,

524
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,830
because they'll look at each other and go,
why are we here?

525
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:23,180
Because we'll get Mitch,
whether it's Montana, Boise,

526
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,220
Boise, you know those places.
University of Michigan,

527
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,400
the brass and the Brassica
all they got, you know,

528
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,680
so that's the mood.
The mood.

529
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,570
What did you do when you got
out of prison to make money?

530
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,350
First thing like you're, I wouldn't pick
up that check with 12 five I was like,

531
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,510
I was like fucking Henry Hill. We got to
go to Pittsburgh tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,270
My wife's like, well you have a meeting
with your probation. There's no worry.

533
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,680
It's taken care of right away.

534
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,750
I picked up the 12 five and I got a job
selling cars cause don't let anybody

535
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:00,650
out. You could breathe in through the
bottom of the glass. Don't let yourself,

536
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,890
so no, no, no. The
first I could sell cars.

537
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:06,150
I'm lying to you because
I had to get my license.

538
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,270
You have to get your license redone.
Now my driver's license,

539
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,920
but my car salesman license.

540
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,790
So I got a job in the
halfway house detailing cars,

541
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,990
but I really wasn't detailing cars. I
was selling below. What I would do is,

542
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,700
so let's say I was coming, where do you
work? I work at Thomson grow industries.

543
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,570
Six, six, six months in Berlin.
I would give them the address,

544
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:31,770
but I tell them I'm a detail, we don't
hear the phone ring, so just paid me

545
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,440
for the page.
So why would I would be driving around,

546
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:39,630
you know I have to drive
until you're level four.

547
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,250
Fuck you had a car parked two
blocks away driving around town.

548
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:47,610
When that pulled up next to a
counselor at the light and I'm like,

549
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:49,440
please don't turn around please.

550
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,340
And she didn't turn it around and I got
away wave. And this is in Colorado still.

551
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,160
This is boulder,
Colorado.

552
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,210
I was slinging coke,
selling cars. I was clean,

553
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,120
but then I came up positive
from weighing the coke.

554
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,220
When you pick up the rocks and shit,

555
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,610
this shit goes through your fingers
and it goes into your bloodstream.

556
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,680
So I piss coke and I told him the problem
started now I had to wear gloves and a

557
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,200
mask. What happened when you,
when you test the positive though?

558
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,240
The first time they made me go to a
90 day out treatment like rd lanes.

559
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,950
And you went, Oh yeah, I'm in this
someone cold and get my big success.

560
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,931
There was a chicken,

561
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:31,710
the group that would suck the just by
looking at night he'd give us a little

562
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,560
break. We'd go behind the
building, a little suit,

563
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:36,480
color main because I go back
then I tell him about my mother,

564
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,950
how she beat me with a paper towel.

565
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,020
I chick's name was Patrice.
I don't forget that.

566
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320
I would just see her when she sucked.
My daughter,

567
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,610
she was in the halfway house with me.

568
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,480
I would check in when you've got until
the halfway house you'd have to sign your

569
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:55,410
name and they'll always be a note come
by my door cause it was chicks on the

570
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,500
first floor and I would go by her door,
knock on the door,

571
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
give her a little piece of coke and
just take my dick out of the door.

572
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,690
Like if I was talking to,

573
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,150
I be hanging out like another
thing is she'd be sucking my Dick,

574
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,930
the counselor be on the other side.
Boom. I shoot my son Ain't good juice.

575
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:14,931
Put the helmet back in and I go upstairs
and hour later she'd be fucking join up

576
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:20,220
a stone downstairs by itself. I was
selling coke at the halfway house. Jesus.

577
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,450
I was loaning money. Really? I was a loan
shark. Yeah, because your rent has to be,

578
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,060
that's how they fuck with you.
The system fucks with you.

579
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:28,620
They know you don't get paid till Friday,

580
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,490
but they would make you pay your rent
on Thursday. You 75 bucks a week.

581
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,750
So I would lend out 75 for
one oh two I don't believe it.

582
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:41,260
Ask me where I came up with the
figure 75 for one or two on Saturday.

583
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,940
Let them cash that check.

584
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,980
Now what happens if someone
doesn't have the one or two ready?

585
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,270
I will fuck with them.
Yeah.

586
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,160
I just say go fuck yourself or you get
nothing from me. I've got three guys.

587
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,460
You ever stop and think?

588
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,360
Do you ever just stop about like thinking
about where you are now in your life,

589
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,110
right? You're this great comedian,
you have this beautiful family,

590
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:06,580
a beautiful daughter, and you think
about how crazy you fucking were,

591
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,520
like the shit you were doing. It doesn't
it seem like it's a different person.

592
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,030
I come to terms with it. You know that
song by the talking heads, you know,

593
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,250
you might ask yourself living in a shotgun
shack like that. When I look at mercy,

594
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,860
the Troll, I think about that
song. How did I get it? Yeah,

595
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,330
so to set that so I wouldn't go
to a psychiatrist or whatever.

596
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,250
I broke it down into three categories.

597
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,790
The first category was when I lived
with my mother until she died.

598
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:34,380
I was also on Tony. That's what
she called me a, I'm throwing it.

599
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,320
That's what my family calls me.
They don't another about cold call or Joe,

600
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:41,890
we fucking nothing.
They don't hold trying to Tonio.

601
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,510
And then when my mother died,

602
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:47,980
it became coco and that
was the motherfucker that
was just out of his mind.

603
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,650
And then when I was about
42 I became Joey Dennis.

604
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,160
Wow. I came to add two more
years or snorting coke,

605
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,270
but I was on the upswing. At least it
was like I was doing a little heroin.

606
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,790
I was doing coke during the week.

607
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:07,150
I would just do heroin on Mondays
and just carry over for the week.

608
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,580
And uh, that's how I look at it just so
I could sleep at night. Yeah. You know,

609
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,930
just so I could sleep at night.

610
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,710
There's something else amazing happened
recently that I talked to you briefly

611
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:22,390
about was that you'd always told stories
about obviously the kidnapping and,

612
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,070
and being locked up and getting out.
And you would jokingly talk about how you,

613
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,390
you sent a Facebook request to the guy
who kidnapped and he wouldn't accept it.

614
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:35,180
You're like, oh I didn't for years. For
years you would always talk about it.

615
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,520
He always made me laugh.

616
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,470
And then recently you said you
did a show and the motherfucker,

617
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,380
he came to your show.

618
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,080
I kept last last year really pissed me
off because he was supposed to come to

619
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:50,980
Tempe cause he never came Ken.
And it pissed me off.

620
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,920
Like I went back to the hotel room because
you don't remember when you're there.

621
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,830
Christina. I'm coming to your show
tomorrow night. 10 o'clock all right.

622
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,920
See you then.
And that was good drive on me.

623
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,380
Like I didn't see Joey Diaz and
somebody will go, he was there.

624
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:05,950
He just left before you got off
or something. Yeah. You know,

625
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:10,770
so he didn't show and I said that's it.
This is the fifth time he has to show.

626
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,880
Then I would, dear friend
of mine said, listen,

627
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,150
the reason why he did this show
was he hasn't forgiven himself.

628
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,410
Worked with Southam. Yeah.
Work with him on this.

629
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,920
He hasn't really come to terms
with what happened. You know,

630
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:26,830
he was no innocent bystander.
He was an deal pill.

631
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,990
He just got double cross like I did.
So when I went to Tucson,

632
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,630
I called them the week before I
said, I'm coming to Tucson. He goes,

633
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,600
I'm coming and I'm sitting downstairs.

634
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:42,680
I thought he didn't show and there
he was and I just hugged him.

635
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,460
I didn't say much cause we apologize
for each other on the phone.

636
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,170
I just hugged him for white three or
four minutes and it was like, Whoa,

637
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:53,430
this hugs we'll, I didn't
have to say nothing was just
the way I was hugging him.

638
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:55,550
It was like this,
I'm really sorry about that day.

639
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,340
I can't imagine what you went through,
you know?

640
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,730
I really can't imagine what you went
through. It was a great day for me.

641
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,350
Had a good time.
I lived out some fucking wild fantasy.

642
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,070
Do you think he really thought,
was he terrified for his life in that,

643
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:15,110
in that scenario? Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, you know why he didn't stop.

644
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,590
He got in trouble. He got stabbed in
the face like six months later. Like he,

645
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,790
he was on a roll. The same role I
was on. Let's get something straight.

646
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,050
The reason why we met someone cars,
but then he disappeared for a while.

647
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,560
He would get into a fight with the sales
manager and leap was very good looking,

648
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:35,090
very charismatic at the time. And he
came back in that time when he came back,

649
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:38,840
when I met him, when he came into my
life, he had a cast on like RV. Yeah.

650
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:43,700
One of those like casts and I go,
what happened? And he goes, ah,

651
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,730
I got chased by the cops and I
crashed into a tree and I got a Dui.

652
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:53,690
But they took me to the hospital and why?
He was in the hospital getting treated.

653
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,120
He broke out of the emergency room,

654
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,580
kicked the door down to the store pharmacy
and took every painkiller and every

655
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:05,630
bottle of liquid covad they
had jumped out the window,

656
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:09,320
three stories and ran away.
And they called them two days later.

657
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,420
So the reason he was in a position he
was in was because he knew where the coke

658
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,470
was hitting his partners.
Coke was it.

659
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,900
And he wanted to rob as partners
coke and sell it that mate,

660
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,100
do you understand this? So what
a tangle. Well, tail we, we,

661
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,430
when we tangled to deceive,
yeah, I had different plans.

662
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm not a fucking salesman. I'm
looking to just take your fucking coke.

663
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,760
So that's what went that.
So he was not,

664
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,270
and then after I saw
when I got out of jail,

665
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,730
he was even more fucked up.
I bumped into him six,

666
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,600
seven months after I got out of jail.
I was already into comedy.

667
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:53,000
I bumped into him at a bar and he
was fucked up to the guilt. He goes,

668
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:55,490
what are you doing here? When did
you get out? I'm like, I'm sorry,

669
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,090
like go sell me a gram of
Makoko and never forget.

670
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,740
Went into the men's bathroom and
they had one of those pockets gales,

671
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,580
and while he was weighing the Koch, he
was fucking happened. It kept going.

672
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,790
I can't believe you kidnapped me. Tell
him, listen, it was a bad day. It happens.

673
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,330
It's a bad day and you put yourself
in a bad position. We shook hands.

674
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,130
We even did a blast.
The bathroom,

675
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:21,131
we went out and had a beer and then
comedy took over my life and then one day

676
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:25,520
when Facebook came along and I seen
him on there and I from requests let me

677
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:28,400
throw me to go fuck.
He wrote me like

678
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,650
he is shit. Then you know that secret
compartment you have in your Facebook,

679
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,290
there's like a messenger that you get
messages on, but you never check it.

680
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,490
One day I checked in, I had 2000
messages. Yeah, he was. He's like,

681
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:48,450
you got some fucking pair of
balls asking me to be your friend.

682
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,970
You tied me up and handcuff me and shit.
You know,

683
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,960
I could move my hand for three days.

684
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,610
I was walking around like I had a
stroke and all this shit. You're like,

685
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:01,950
can we be friends? And I'm like,
wait, listen man. You know what?

686
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,180
I'm sorry you feel that way. I get it. You
know, I wasn't trying to be rude to him.

687
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,570
I just had this sense that, listen,
let me tell you something. Hey,

688
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,160
he's got that step that they want you to
reach out and apologize to some people.

689
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,490
When the fucking Christopher Moltisanti,
he got out of the other Rehab Queens,

690
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:25,800
the Sopranos, and he thought, and Tony's
asked him, are you clean? Gann he goes,

691
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,170
I'm even reaching out to some people.
In some cases I sent some people money,

692
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,780
some people flowers because
of the biologies and,

693
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,110
but it looks at me because there's
some things you should leave a well,

694
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,320
like I've reached out to
as many people as I can.

695
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,720
There's some people that are
never going to get it. Yeah,

696
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm not even going to try.

697
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:49,030
I even reached out to my ex
wife you did and said, listen,

698
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:53,080
that was a different person then and
then she went on this fucking diatribe

699
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,020
about blow up about it and I go,
you know what,

700
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,380
I'm not ever going to get through
to her either, but at least I tried.

701
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,720
I tried and the reason why she's done
that is because I've made a conscious

702
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,510
decision that we both
got something we wanted.

703
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,040
She wanted to be a mom and she
had the kid and I got to life.

704
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:18,830
So I'm like fucking then Zell and man
on fire. I gave a life, get a life,

705
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,650
you know, and I've come to terms
with it. You can do. Yeah, no,

706
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:26,030
I got a beautiful six year old,
I got the wife. There's no drama

707
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,590
and here I am fucking rainy
California right now and shit.

708
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,040
Two favorite people.
Every time I talked to you,

709
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,560
I feel like I'm about to see you like
you're going to actually make that move

710
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:41,180
though. You always talking about moving
somewhere. I want a sense of community.

711
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,650
I want somewhere I want this
shit. The end like, you know,

712
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:48,980
I just wanted to just want to be regular.

713
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,750
Like I don't see a future for me here.
If there is,

714
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,950
I'll stay here though. I, they buried me,
you know, they put me in that sag home.

715
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,640
What do you mean there's
nothing here though? I just,

716
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,310
I'm confused by that because I feel like,
I don't know,

717
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:08,750
I have a future comedy wise and I love
all that stuff, but let's face it,

718
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,613
you know,
the,

719
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,640
the other side of the industry has great
article came out about two weeks ago

720
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,650
when, and I'm not saying nothing
bad. I think the world would,

721
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,110
I think it was a great, I like crashing,
but we're crashing, got canceled.

722
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,150
A magazine put up that
when is it going to end?

723
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,410
That it's too late for America to accept
different types of comics that the

724
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:36,250
clean cut comic America has
all want to see it no more.

725
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,190
We've been pounded where they mentioned
the guy from crashing. They mentioned, uh,

726
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,270
John Malaney and they mentioned Sebastian
and this artist guys. All do great,

727
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,760
right?
Hugely successful

728
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,490
TV show would work like that because
it didn't work because of that.

729
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,090
It didn't work because
America's ready for a new,

730
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:03,010
and they even said it in the article.
If I was a television studio,

731
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,040
I be chasing the dirty
bulge on the Internet.

732
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,990
That to America really wants to see
those people with a little bit more,

733
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,740
you know, on regular friends,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

734
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,250
I would like to re pitch a
show or something like that.

735
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,960
Maybe give myself a few chair,

736
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,570
but if it's just the work
the road and do a podcast,

737
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:24,010
you could do that from anywhere.
That's true.

738
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,550
A couple of weeks ago I went to
toast, so I'm sitting in the back. Uh,

739
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,390
Lee Wellington, the guy that runs their,
a great guy and his little assistant.

740
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:38,230
I go, I'm starving. Is Do you have
any menus study? When the guy goes,

741
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:42,550
look and taste them, it's a place
down the corner. Uh, fucking Tacos.

742
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:46,990
Bourdain went there and fine,
I'll bring your menu.

743
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,190
And he came back with a major, I didn't
even look at. I go, just get me, carnitas.

744
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,420
Get yourself some Tacos, get some
fully and get some for Kate Quigley.

745
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,990
I gave him $60 and I'm not a cheap guy.

746
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,480
He came back with a box of Tacos to
them and a bean and cheese burrito.

747
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,540
He gave me back $41 it was
$19 for fucking 16 Tacos,

748
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,780
bean and cheese burrito. You know, a
couple of weeks early, I went somewhere,

749
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,740
Saint Louis or something and I got
like a fucking huge lunch. Salmon,

750
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:24,760
mashed potatoes, salad, a
cup of fucking lentil soup.

751
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,070
I tea.
Yeah,

752
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,520
$12 I told the waitress she made
a mistake and she goes, no, that,

753
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,970
that's what the food costs.
And you come here and when you,

754
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,480
you see what differences.
Again, I'm not cheap.

755
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,750
I'm just talking about I want to go
somewhere where I don't feel I'm getting

756
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:45,340
fucked in the ass. You know, how
much longer are we going to pay?

757
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:50,280
$25 for fucking luggage. No, I
don't, but I'm just saying, you know,

758
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,050
you know how much law either yesterday,
tremendous.

759
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:57,980
The biggest deal in the fucking
angel history and games,

760
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:01,510
that guy, $437 million.
And all these angel fans.

761
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,770
What do you think's going to pay for that?

762
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,050
Now your tickets went from 69 to 89
what if you and Christina and your w two

763
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:11,800
little children want to go to a
fucking baseball game? It's crazy.

764
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,920
It's four times a yard stick plus 50 for
parking for seven for a to Disneyland.

765
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:22,450
That fucking costs a fortune. I'll tell
you what, Disney land justifies it.

766
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,010
You're going to tell you something.
When I go to Disney land,

767
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,780
if I turned around and Mickey Mouse
fucks me in the ass and I paid a one 19 I

768
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:31,490
get my money's worth
and I'll tell you why.

769
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,620
You know you're not going to get blown up.

770
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,370
You know you're not going to fall off
one of those fucking rights. The places,

771
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,550
Felipe Gum wrapper,

772
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,460
not doing a fucking
something does happen before.

773
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,270
There's a little fucking Mexican dude
with the sweeper with Mickey mouse ears on

774
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,060
that comes up right behind him.

775
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,340
Pick it the fuck up then don't fuck
around at Disneyland every day.

776
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:56,800
I went to Disneyland, pissed off
this last year. First of all,

777
00:50:56,801 --> 00:50:59,400
I went to the Permian. Listen to me
tell you the hookup I got, I got,

778
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,650
I went to the premiere coke.
They couldn't find people named Coco,

779
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,900
so the guy goes,
how about Coco does I go,

780
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,820
that's my daughter would definitely
go see coke. So they took us downtown.

781
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,630
Seriously, just because of your
nicknames, because they took us downtown.

782
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:19,430
They're like, this guy's totally friendly.
Ooh, three floors, a fucking white people

783
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
martinis mixed with fucking shoe Polish
and CBD or with with my daughter and my

784
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:30,800
wife and their kid comes up
and he goes, Brian, I love you.

785
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,810
Or Rogan like you motherfuckers
are the real deal. If you ever

786
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:42,040
want to go to Disneyland.
He was my card. I got it.

787
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:46,070
I got a few of you want to call. My wife
wanted to go. I called the guy going, hey,

788
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:50,170
this is your DNS from cocoa, Hawaii.
I don't want to intrude. You know,

789
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,510
you feeling bad. You did say if there
was a hookup for Disneyland, he goes,

790
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:56,390
let me call you back.
He got me to Joe Rogan package.

791
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,920
The Joe Rogan packages drove it
or was, it just shows up, give it,

792
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,380
everybody gets it,
but they take them from caves.

793
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,540
He cuts through line. You know, the
guy gave me that deal for people.

794
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:15,340
I took my nieces and he brought his
kid and me and my wife and the tribe,

795
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,960
we stayed at the hotel. Awesome.
Two, three days. They walked around.

796
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,540
I walked around a little bit with
them. You know, there's some rides.

797
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,010
I can't do what?

798
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:29,420
That ride that you sit and you see the
world and you smell the dirt and they

799
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:34,010
throw dirt and all that shit all
around the world or something to say,

800
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,220
oh my fuck. Are you cutting
lines and shit? Right, right.

801
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:44,640
Through people he's doing.
Go for me. You're walking
around like fucking, you know,

802
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,350
you're walking around me foot deck.
He just walked back.

803
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:50,510
We won't cut through and people
want to be like, hey, we're,

804
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,900
what are you doing right
now? I think looking at, you
know, they know, they know.

805
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,920
People know. People know that you
know you're paying a little extra.

806
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,870
It's a lot of money. Yeah.
It's not no fucking jokes.

807
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,460
Oh yeah. Can you say? Yeah.
How much? 400 an hour.

808
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,330
400 an hour. And there's a
minimum for sure. Eight hours

809
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:19,010
for scratch. But you know me
and my little Jewish skills.

810
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,930
Yeah. Cut Down in half. You know
what I'm saying? You know what?

811
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:27,590
It was the Netflix thing. Yeah, I
took that Netflix, the first jacket.

812
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,630
I gave it to my wife and I go,
what do you want to do?

813
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,910
Disney land the best.

814
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:39,030
So let's go to Disneyland with
no concerns. You pay, you go,

815
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:41,730
you're getting fucked in the ass. But I
gotta be honest with what they have left.

816
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,800
That's a good fucking,
I gotta be honest.

817
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,610
I did not feel like I was getting fucked
and he didn't because every day you see

818
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:51,480
about these companies that are
roller coaster falls. Okay?

819
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:56,020
Yesterday on Carnival cruise, some fucking
white dude. It wasn't the bungee broke.

820
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,240
I'm taking my leg couldn't move. I'm
fucking going. Not a cruise ship.

821
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:01,720
Well goals a the fucking

822
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,660
fucking cruise ship on a cruise
ship shoot itself. Right.

823
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:13,661
The fuck now you cannot be that fucking
retarded walking around with three

824
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:15,760
fucking thousand people.
Yeah.

825
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,810
I hate even the same and a little fucking
room eating that fucking Maloof food

826
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:26,450
food dog. I'd rather, I wasn't
[inaudible] I gotta be terrible,

827
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,000
but that was because I was 21
she let me fucking with the ass.

828
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:33,140
We took the cruise around New York.
When you go outside New York,

829
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,350
you could gamble the whole thing, but
yeah, bring it back the next morning.

830
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,010
Okay,
so one night only horse shit.

831
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,520
It's like six nights and then,

832
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,070
and they make you sanitize your hands
before you go on the buffet because every

833
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:51,420
nasty motherfucker, it's coughing,
sneezing, touching, and then,

834
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,740
then they had an outbreak of
some orienting people every week.

835
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,470
This last thing,
every fucking week.

836
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,190
And what are you going to do on
a fucking boat for a week? Drink.

837
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,820
What's your book? Listen, go
to key west, right. The fucking
guy that take gap. Yeah.

838
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,190
I would much rather see can at a location.
Right?

839
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,250
How's your back or somewhere cool.
I will do that in groups.

840
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:16,850
Every time those groups die,
they die. They fucking die.

841
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:21,110
They don't like the group thing is flying.
The carnival cruise is a worst.

842
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:23,060
Is that what you did before
he was on a carnival?

843
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,440
I could just see the genius.

844
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,090
It's a hotel now. They take you out and
you're stuck with these fucking pee. Yeah.

845
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,530
You got to walk around. I don't want to
play shuffleboard. I don't want to bond.

846
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,560
Gee, I don't want to eat that fucking
buffet food. Oh, it's the worst.

847
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:42,790
It's the worst. I don't want to be on
a cruise. I want to go somewhere. I go,

848
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,780
first of all, I'm not a vacation type of
guy. No, you got to be for three days.

849
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,090
You got my attention for three days.
After three days, I start scratching.

850
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,030
Fucking acting it radically.
You know I've got to get the fire.

851
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,480
That's why Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday is the Lord's Day.

852
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,770
I love Sunday of weeks ago,
I broke it.

853
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,300
I went down to the stone on Monday.

854
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,090
That Sunday night for an all
things comedy showcase. Huh?

855
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,810
And I ate a bag of Dicks is I was
driving home. I was laughing. I go,

856
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,490
I'm not Lloyd's.

857
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,490
They type of cup in 1998 that Sundays
we're going to be a problem and by 2000 I

858
00:56:21,351 --> 00:56:25,560
would just let people know. My favorite
thing about it though, you, by the way,

859
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,300
you haven't definitely set the precedent,

860
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:32,310
but my favorite thing about it is you
had the policy before you were really

861
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:34,890
selling out. Yeah, no,

862
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,310
that's the fucking baller thing is that
you guys don't understand when once you

863
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,670
sell tickets you can dictate things, you
know, and people were like, all right,

864
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:46,570
it's whatever you want to do both for.
You were selling tickets. You were like,

865
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,350
I just tell them to go fuck themselves.
And I was like, I would leave Rogan there.

866
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,240
Yeah, you would. Right.
He told me you left,

867
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,680
but before I left them two or three times,
you wouldn't talk to me for a month.

868
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,290
I told you already I don't work Sunday.
He's like, you would just be gone.

869
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:02,130
Pop It on, works on this.
Why you pop it on works.

870
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,210
The last thing you want to do on a
Monday, Bro. Just stick apart. Yeah,

871
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,130
that's horrible.
I'm telling you right now,

872
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,540
what do you really want to fuck around?
Take a flight on a Monday.

873
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:17,050
You're gonna stay till Tuesday to go to
a Yankee game or why is that? I get it.

874
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,640
Yeah. You know, but there's no reason
it works on this. Think about it.

875
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,800
What the fuck do you want to do?
First of all, I don't Miss 60 minutes.

876
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,570
Yeah, that's my mother fucking
shit. I have it recorded.

877
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,540
I don't miss it for nobody.

878
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,850
I don't Miss 60 minutes for no,
I don't want you to do it on a Sunday.

879
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:40,030
I imagine you're sitting in your boxers.
You smoke a little weed.

880
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,130
If I get home from the road,
first of all,

881
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:43,830
I'd take the first flight out of wherever.

882
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,520
Always it's called 6:00 AM 5:00
AM I get home. They go to church.

883
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,200
Okay,

884
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,610
so if I walk in the door at
nine 45 I am Lord my suitcase.

885
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,500
Set the sleep apnea machine up.
Take a shower cause that slight filthy.

886
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,420
The first thing I do though,

887
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:06,310
because my ass home knows the compass
and your ass on knows when you're away

888
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:10,540
from home. So when I'm on the road I'd
take minimal shits like eight inches,

889
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:13,680
six inches, little torpedo, minimal.

890
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,580
When I jumped in the Uber at the fuck,
at that point,

891
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:23,370
that's when my asshole starts calling
me late three days of what you believe.

892
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:28,720
And after you sent me photos, before I get
into the plane, I drink a Cam boot. You

893
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,200
move. Is that Kombucha? Kombucha,
whatever the fuck he gets.

894
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:38,770
Shit moving in your stomach of the plane.
It dropped a little,

895
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,480
went out on the plane.
You drop a little. Uh,

896
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,350
what do you mean you're shitting on
the plane? Are you still free? Shit.

897
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,190
Far to the started looking around.

898
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:54,070
So I dropped a few. Those get my
luggage by the time I get to you.

899
00:58:54,071 --> 00:58:58,120
But I told the guy at midway and
I got to pick a tremendous shit.

900
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:01,930
So cause all of this fucking left lane
and get that fucking the high hop,

901
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,070
that Hov lane right now, cause I'm
there. I ain't got time to fuck around.

902
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,190
[inaudible] Laurel Canyon,
those pre far to come up.

903
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,880
I take the 20th I give it to the Uber
driver. I fucking run in the house.

904
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:20,380
I go to the back bathroom that has
a door that goes into my back yard.

905
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,070
I have three bathrooms

906
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,150
in that door. That bathroom is
priceless because I opened the door,

907
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:31,750
I sit home and there's a bong and a pipe
at a table next to me we'd underneath.

908
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:37,601
So I fill up the pipe and I hit it and
as I cough the shit slides out like

909
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:39,160
nothing like notes.

910
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:44,270
Bresson I'm not going to die like GG
and the sopranos backed up by Turkey

911
00:59:44,391 --> 00:59:45,080
pushing.

912
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,550
You just call up her close and you just
feel those blocks coming out and then

913
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:53,120
you catch one of those midway ones
that's long. He's got to keep coughing.

914
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,360
She just feel it coming out of your ass.

915
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,680
Sometimes I go to Wa and I don't put my
ball sack and the thing you dark shit.

916
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,940
Hi. You put your balls out of
the toilet. Yeah, I don't never,

917
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,510
I don't want you gotta respect your wife.
What do you mean?

918
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,260
What do you mean you
don't put your bottom?

919
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,910
Put my balls because behind the toilet.
That's disgusting.

920
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,510
Next thing you know you're sucking
my balls and get a piece falls.

921
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,530
I don't put my, I don't put
my nuts. I pick them up,

922
01:00:19,531 --> 01:00:22,090
put toilet paper and put it on my nuts.

923
01:00:22,091 --> 01:00:26,750
Acts like arrest so my shit goes up higher
so it's got more room to go down like

924
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,700
a missile.
Then when I get up,

925
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:32,720
I piss on it and the pitcher
throws it down the hill.

926
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,680
The lodge just goes in and then I wipe.

927
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:39,950
I throw it on top of that and they flush.
I washed my hands and I'm ready.

928
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,420
Now I am to the suitcase.
I said machine.

929
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,820
I staple all the receipts
to plant that bad.

930
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,470
I can't imagine that your cleanup is easy.
Do you have a washlet a bit day?

931
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,330
I have a bad day to day goes
right the fuck.

932
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:59,330
I was not the best one.
You've been on the road and you smashing,

933
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,890
wiping with dry paper.
I love,

934
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,070
I love it. I fucking pressed
that. Then I got the hot water.

935
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,210
You sit there, you go into one
of those little fag trenches.

936
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:15,450
When they start those poppers,
you will see that Dude Katie

937
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:22,010
from Katie La, the one that Chris
Burroughs, they tried to hide this debt.

938
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,410
Real sweetheart of a guy, but they
found him in a hotel. When he died,

939
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,000
they put two meth rocks up his ass and
he had a mass crowd with no fucking

940
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:36,510
eyeballs and they had to poppers and is
known as the guys were Fist Fang him. No,

941
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:40,450
the guy was assisting him in
the fucking ass. Jesus Christ.

942
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,860
Alicia use cocaine and nothing to really
put your finger up my ass with speed.

943
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:50,240
I at least put some Novacane so he was
a dentist gives you something, right?

944
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:52,370
He was a real savage.
Yeah.

945
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:56,440
This guy was inside at the pink look like,

946
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,460
what's the word where you meet gay people?

947
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:12,470
There's no more real, yeah. Real. Oh
yeah. I guess there's no real facts.

948
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,960
No, there's no real, not the left.

949
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:19,460
This morning I woke up to taking care of
business. Remember? Got Stolen by beat?

950
01:02:19,461 --> 01:02:20,130
Yes.

951
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,450
Yeah. That's what I'm white
people with white people. Yeah.

952
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,890
When they took care of business.

953
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:29,040
They didn't care about nothing that
came out like the 75 it was just dirty.

954
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,030
White people take it,

955
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:30,943
Kara.

956
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,440
This like my daughter hears and
she's like taking care of biscuits.

957
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:40,210
Biscuits. This bitch. You
got to take care of business.

958
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,650
That's all white people were wiping.
Yeah. That's where you took care of.

959
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,700
You took care of fucking business.
It's not like that anymore,

960
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,020
but was looking around
and we'll save the whales,

961
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,820
but last May I got to talk to fucking

962
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:59,140
what the fuck? A little fag from
the New York Times right now.

963
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:02,920
People will you give a fuck. Okay.
Y'All fucking family. Your father.

964
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:06,310
Fuck this daughter. Meanwhile you're
ratting on people. What's your take on Mj?

965
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,910
Michael Jackson. I think he did that
stuff. Never. Neverland. Yeah. Yeah.

966
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:16,680
The first out of my boat when I came
from Cuba was Michael Jackson. ABC. Yeah.

967
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:20,430
I love Michael Jackson with all my heart.
I love what the Jackson five did.

968
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,900
I still remember that last hour moving
violation when Jermaine left and the

969
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,950
whole,
I mean I lived through all that shit.

970
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:34,100
I watched both episodes with
an open mind and most people,

971
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:39,060
most Americans won't. People Watch that
like, wow, I was the parents fault.

972
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,750
Well again,
we got,

973
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,920
have you ever worked
on a kid show animated?

974
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,180
Have you worked on the kid
show? I get Disney show. No,

975
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,990
I didn't know what Hollywood was
about. Two, I worked at Disney show.

976
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,440
It's not about the kids,
it's about the moms.

977
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,730
Okay, so the mom show
up, they got the kids,

978
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:03,780
the kids are acting.

979
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,610
You look at the moms at rehearsal Tuesday,
Wednesday at the table,

980
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:13,560
read the whole thing, blocking on
Thursday on shoot day. Christine's,

981
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:18,300
you got to look at these fucking
cleavages out.

982
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:24,050
Miniskirt the registered around
tits are out there here and made up,

983
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:27,420
blow out.
Everybody wants to be Kim Kardashian.

984
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:32,160
And you're looking at them and they're
living their life to that children.

985
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,490
You know, I would talk to the
moms and they would go, oh,

986
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:39,720
we live in Weehawken because our kid
was doing a play in New York. And I go,

987
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:43,110
where do you usually live in? Look,
come from Kentucky. And I'm like,

988
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:44,520
where's your heart?
He's in homework.

989
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,340
We're out here living in Burbank in a
studio apartment, trying to get roles,

990
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:55,530
you know, and it was really like, it
really showed me like, what makes a woman?

991
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,450
I could see a kid, but now you're
pushing it. They were like,

992
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:02,610
pistol Pete's father,
pistol Pete Maravich.

993
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:07,060
It would beat them if they lost like
that, that we're talking about. Never,

994
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:10,230
never land. When I got,
when I did the longest yard,

995
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:14,520
I got caught up when it's very tough,

996
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:17,170
not too caught up.
Went with like the Hollywood thing.

997
01:05:17,171 --> 01:05:22,171
Very tough with you say cut
and everybody's laughing
and you do the same thing

998
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:27,550
six times and people laugh and people
blow smoke up your ass and this movie

999
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,250
comes out, you know, blow up. You know,

1000
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,990
you buy it at one time when this career,

1001
01:05:32,991 --> 01:05:37,750
you bought it at one time you
bought it and then it's gone away.

1002
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,480
You see it for what it is that
they're all a bunch of motherfuckers.

1003
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:44,170
You know when you watch the
Elvis documentary, he says,

1004
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:49,060
it is old father. I said, we
realize he was damaged goods.

1005
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,220
Our role, our role, our job was just
to put 'em out bed so we died. Yeah,

1006
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,211
the captain,

1007
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:59,290
what were the criminals and it's about
his own fucking where pieces of meat.

1008
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:04,390
We're replaceable. It's six years on
new terms ago. It shows up in Montreal.

1009
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,850
Yeah. Nobody's returning
your calls. That's,

1010
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:11,320
but we get caught up when
you watch the documentary a,

1011
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:14,520
I do believe both those boys be,

1012
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,980
I feel bad for the parents
because it was just taken dick,

1013
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,120
if we're in the business and we got taken,
think about it.

1014
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,800
What would you feel? What would
you feel like right now? Fucking,

1015
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,960
I don't even know was a
mega star like that anymore.

1016
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:36,290
Took interest in your child and say
your child had talent and we're going to

1017
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:40,440
take him to the top and I got a
rehearsal studio right down the corner.

1018
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:45,010
Drop him off every day at three.
You're going to come for a few days then.

1019
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,550
I know, but knowing what we know
about this business, like I,

1020
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,160
I would never put my children
in the show business.

1021
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:55,210
Like who wants to have her kid working
when they're four or five years old?

1022
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:59,110
It's not cool. I don't want that. Life
is terrible. Take come to my child.

1023
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:03,850
I don't want it. They can't see it. But
when you're from some, but they weren't.

1024
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,550
These people were from California.
No one was from Australia

1025
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:09,560
valley and the other ones were
from California. Yeah, right.

1026
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,510
But still Michael Jackson come
at the house and see me crazy.

1027
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,310
You got to remember he bought her a
house. He loaned them money for AF. Yeah.

1028
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:21,920
And then he told her was a gift
that they want the money back.

1029
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,270
There's so many different variables.
I'm not mad at the parents.

1030
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,460
It happens to us as at the
table when we come here,

1031
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,150
they give us a show. We
actually buy, you know,

1032
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,290
how many people have we seen
come and go this time? Oh my God.

1033
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:43,020
What do you think they left
here with a sober mind.
Everything is for me. No. Yeah.

1034
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,680
They left here with a smack
to their fucking face. Yeah.

1035
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,680
How many chicks really
did come in and blow?

1036
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,460
Nasty guys didn't get anything
I could think of that have them,

1037
01:07:52,461 --> 01:07:55,000
that suck my dick and then
how to handle them. Well,

1038
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:59,820
I'll get you a spot at the fucking comedy
store and next [inaudible] helmet got

1039
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,753
behind the car.

1040
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:04,890
Another one reminds me of this topic.
We just had,

1041
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:09,190
remember that that executive at what
studio? And he was promising. Oh yeah.

1042
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:13,450
Warner brothers. Yeah. And
he was promising these girls
like, Hey, if you fuck me,

1043
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:16,220
I'm going to give you roles and
this and that. And he never followed

1044
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,840
through. And we were like, that's so
cruel. Like you're a multimillionaire.

1045
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,820
You don't need to spit that game.
You know what I'm saying?

1046
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:26,390
Like you could have just gotten
your dick sucked just by being rich.

1047
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:30,070
What if you have that
vulnerable? Yeah, I went to a

1048
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:32,623
great place,

1049
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,160
but after a couple seeds and then they
find that you were staying though.

1050
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:41,630
I had these girls showed up at the store.
I'm like, Oh my God, you're so great.

1051
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:42,440
You have an agent.

1052
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,530
They'd never seen that as a college
girls that watched met live. Yeah.

1053
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,870
I think Betty could clamp was shit.
They love Reese Witherspoon, whatever.

1054
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:51,920
I could do a restart something.

1055
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,910
The most popular girl,

1056
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:58,730
they come out here and you're up
against all the popular girls and Reese

1057
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:01,610
Witherspoon's been enacting
since she was a baby. Yet

1058
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:06,110
you've got that and they come out here
when they get caught up and agents,

1059
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:11,180
and I can't tell you how many I could
name like four times a woman look me in

1060
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,160
the eye and said to me,

1061
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:16,770
I'll do anything to get an agent
if you get me with your agent.

1062
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:21,420
And this is when I was like,
what fucking low level studio.

1063
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,100
You call them boutique agents.

1064
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,280
Really? And I would go,
anything, anything. Oh my God,

1065
01:09:31,281 --> 01:09:35,060
I really want to be an actress. Ever
since I saw the Hollywood sign, you know,

1066
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,770
they be able to have the right reasons.

1067
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,960
They don't even know why they're doing it.

1068
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,620
They just think that they're
going to go from zero to four.

1069
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:45,360
How many fucking dicks?
Marilyn Monroe side.

1070
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:49,700
Oh God, I wish I would've done that. Jay.

1071
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:54,620
Ryan a fucking train on mountain.
They fucked the eight.

1072
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,980
They fucked her to bet that
didn't shadow with something.

1073
01:09:57,981 --> 01:09:59,780
So she would shut the fuck up.
She shot.

1074
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,700
She fucked so many people they killed
just to listen to you can't, you can't.

1075
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,440
Harvey must've seen it to me is,

1076
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:09,550
well he was like three
everybody fuck this shit out.

1077
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,410
They were passing her around
all the way to the press. Man,

1078
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,680
this is depressed as fuck.
No Shit.

1079
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,760
No sure.
Those are the ones they want.

1080
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,880
They don't want the ones
that are five Beta Kappas.

1081
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,220
You're not going to put it
over on there. Yeah. That

1082
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,710
grows at a goal you can go to.

1083
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:34,720
You ever go to even do a TV show or
movie that you go to the party and you're

1084
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:40,650
just really want to fucking be there
and you see people from the movie,

1085
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,490
you wave at them. But then there's
this other 60 women that are,

1086
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:49,200
that that black, they're white,
they're Chinese, they got Afros,

1087
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:52,110
they got tight suits on,
and at one point in the night,

1088
01:10:52,111 --> 01:10:54,600
the hors d'oeuvre comes by
and just look at them and go,

1089
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,680
I don't remember me from the movie. I'm
Joey, and though I wasn't in the movie,

1090
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,940
I'm just here because my from he
gives me other sub deck. Yeah.

1091
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:08,070
When people telling me I'm there to
support Tom, you're here to suck Dick.

1092
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,200
You're here to suck a dick in one form or
another. You know, you have a showcase.

1093
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,840
The old days, if you have a
showcase at the comedy store, sure.

1094
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,680
They put an asterisk next to your name
and comics would just go down and see

1095
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:24,180
what an asterick and they would wait
till you were talking to somebody,

1096
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:27,330
come over and crack a joke.
Let me do you. And you're like,

1097
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,090
get the fuck Outta here.

1098
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,130
Because they knew you had a showcase
then they were trying to talk to whoever.

1099
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:39,120
You know, we will. We would, we had,

1100
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,550
we are instinctively whores when we
first move here. It's not our fault.

1101
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:47,820
We're just horse,
not literally whores sucking Dick,

1102
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:52,200
but we would do and put up with
things we would usually put up with.

1103
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,470
Are you going up 12th you know,

1104
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:59,030
but it's nine o'clock he's going to
be up about midnight, shit like that.

1105
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,640
And we buy into it.
There's one day that you wake up and go,

1106
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,220
this is not going to happen no more.
Right,

1107
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:08,220
and for me it was an Arby's commercial.

1108
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:13,530
I did a Hardee's,
what's the other side of the Hardee's?

1109
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:18,090
Carl's Jr. I did three commercials
and the three weeks in a row,

1110
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:23,091
three nationals and I was clean and
sober from coke and when I got clean I

1111
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:27,210
remember saying to myself, you know
what? Before I was a fucking comic,

1112
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:32,010
I was a man, but slapping people
enough with that dumb Hollywood game,

1113
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:34,560
if you got a common theme that
I'm going to give it to you.

1114
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,000
And I remember having that frame thought,

1115
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,470
getting the Hardee's commercial
and going down to Long Beach.

1116
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,540
The call was midnight and I play a mobster
with this other guy and they put us

1117
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:49,710
in an SUV. We got to pull up to
shoot a guy, but when we got there,

1118
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:53,820
the guy was eat the chicken Parmesan
sandwich and there was saw something

1119
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,690
mistake. So he was passed out. We
thought somebody got there first.

1120
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,330
So we get there.

1121
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:04,530
But my profile before I got the
commercial like you're working with,

1122
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:09,090
you know Antonio and Gillini, this
tremendous director, you know,

1123
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:12,810
he gets there with the assistant next
to him. He's got the pepe Le Pew Hat,

1124
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,960
the shirt role.
Does he see this tattoo?

1125
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:20,010
You know my new philosophy is if
I could tell you the director,

1126
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,300
I don't want to be in the movie.

1127
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,410
Yeah.
If you've got that direct,

1128
01:13:23,411 --> 01:13:27,490
the garb on and all that shit.

1129
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,010
I'm done with you. Yeah, I heard
that man. If you got the costume on,

1130
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,690
I don't want to work with your fucking
Douche bag. I don't want to work.

1131
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,620
So what happens on this?
This,

1132
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:40,360
Oh my God, I'm off the powder.
I'm just, I'm referring,

1133
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,950
I'm a fucking savage.

1134
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,550
I get made pressers up
and this is mafia outfits.

1135
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,950
They put lights inside the
car so they would disconnect.

1136
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,330
They put the lights on there
must have disconnected the break.

1137
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:56,680
So our job was to drive like 30 yards,
stop,

1138
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:00,310
slammed the door and walk towards the car.
Every time I slammed the door,

1139
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,170
the car kept rowing and they would
take cut and the guy would go,

1140
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:09,700
what the hell is going on? Put the brakes
on. And I'm like, I put the brakes,

1141
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:13,690
the brakes on it. On, sorry,
let's do it again and again.

1142
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,100
And I put the emergency, I'm like,
get out the fucking cars rolling.

1143
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:22,240
This happened like two or three
times and the director kept saying,

1144
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,700
I don't know what the fuck
is going on with youtube,

1145
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,740
but somebody better figure it out.

1146
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,940
And finally the guys went in there
and tried to fix it and again,

1147
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,840
I put it on and the guy goes,
you're not pulling it hard enough.

1148
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:38,890
You fucking dummy.
I turned around,

1149
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:42,740
it was about two in the morning and
I go, what'd you say? Motherfucker

1150
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:49,240
just froze time. And I walked towards
my, or would you say mother fuck.

1151
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:52,090
I'm like, listen, I'm not one of
your punk white fucking frenzy.

1152
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,350
I'll knock you the fuck out right now.
You ran from me.

1153
01:14:56,490 --> 01:15:01,330
The assistant and the PA took them and
ran them into his trailer and he closed

1154
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:04,900
himself in there and I walked to the
trail. I've banged on the door. I go,

1155
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,660
you're not getting away
with this one bitch. I go,

1156
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:09,760
come on here and talk to me like a man.
He goes,

1157
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:13,300
I'm on the phone with the whatever.
We're replacing you. I go,

1158
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:15,700
it's two in the morning.
You dumb motherfucker.

1159
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,430
You're never going to replace
me at two in the morning.

1160
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:23,380
Come out here and like a man.
Then the came out, he said,
walk away from the door.

1161
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,610
I go and then the first
day they came out and go,

1162
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,810
come calling the police to go
call the police. Well, the police,

1163
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:33,550
what are you going to do?
Nothing happening. It's
just two men trying to talk.

1164
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,030
I go, come out of the
fucking trailer and be a man.

1165
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:41,740
Then there's little faggy assistant
came out with the feather in her hat and

1166
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:45,390
then he finally opened the door and he
goes, nobody has ever spoken to about it.

1167
01:15:45,391 --> 01:15:49,020
I go, that's what your problem
is. We all put our pants,

1168
01:15:49,021 --> 01:15:53,620
we all put our pants on one leg at a time.
You respect me and I fucked him.

1169
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:55,690
Respect to you.
That's what men do.

1170
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:00,900
But they blown you off to smoke up your
ass assistant and all his people there.

1171
01:16:01,131 --> 01:16:04,270
And I'm going, you got to
act like a fucking man. Okay.

1172
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:07,840
You don't talk to people that way.
You talk to people like a fucking man.

1173
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:11,500
Why come from you get hit and that's it.
Let's finish this fucking commercial.

1174
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:15,070
Let's go. And I turned around
like I follow me very meekly.

1175
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,120
We'd get like eight takes and he
caught me, you can go home now.

1176
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:23,180
And I walked away and I walked up and
put my hand down and he was still a con

1177
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,550
teeth. He, you know, faculty
put his hand down and I go,

1178
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:30,640
you got to act like a man.
So okay, you got to be a man.

1179
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:34,630
Forget this director Shit.
And as I got to the car,

1180
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:38,890
his assistant came up to me and she goes,
thank you very much.

1181
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:44,440
Sometimes people forget what our
main job is to be human beings.

1182
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:49,360
Thank you. And she goes, I'm happy you
did that. I'm very happy you did that.

1183
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,630
You scared him to death. I fucked him.
Told him I was bagging him on the trail.

1184
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:57,130
It will come on here like
a man. No fighting. This is
about two men talking. Yeah,

1185
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:00,550
come out here but you don't call
me a fucking dummy bitch. No,

1186
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:04,620
don't even ever say that to somebody on
the set. You don't pay us enough. Yeah.

1187
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,400
And he worked with me like, like
I said, it took one more here.

1188
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:13,640
He was saying we're going to work all
night. Yeah. So just do the fucking cuts.

1189
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,730
Just do the trick and us,

1190
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,940
I'm not going to sit here all night
and do fucking takes. Ah. You know,

1191
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:22,640
like when I did go daddy,
they made me call the pizza
up a thousand times. I said,

1192
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:25,670
that's it no more.
If you didn't get it by now,

1193
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:29,420
go back to USD fucking acting
school and got a camera again.

1194
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,330
And they all looked at me and
I fucking went and sat down.

1195
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,690
That's it enough with this bullshit.
You want to kill four hours,

1196
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:37,270
be throwing the pizza.
Yeah,

1197
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,820
go fuck yourself.
You're never going to use this film shit.

1198
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,380
And then you see the thing of this,
you move on into like,

1199
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,720
I was there for six fucking hours.

1200
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,000
No, for what? This
business is so wasteful.

1201
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:55,030
This is the only business where everything
is done last minute and they waste a

1202
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:59,390
tremendous amount of money.
It's just gone down the fucking toilet.

1203
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,740
Oh we, we got to, we need a lama for this
thing tomorrow. Let's spend 50 grand.

1204
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:05,750
Those find the wrangler.
Let's change the set.

1205
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:08,690
You know when you are working
on various projects, right?

1206
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:12,110
They don't have a call time for you
until last fucking minute. So disrespect,

1207
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:13,940
fly him in and then it's like,
God,

1208
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,460
the waste money, we're going to,
you're working all day tomorrow. Okay.

1209
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:19,560
And then you get through like Jackie,
you're not going to work then like what?

1210
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:23,900
Yeah, I find that we'd decided we'd
move some things around and we're gonna,

1211
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,890
we found this up. We're going,
we're want to do this shot we got,

1212
01:18:25,891 --> 01:18:30,120
but we got to bring in this special
light and it's like 45 grand to use it.

1213
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:30,990
And you're like,
yeah,

1214
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:34,470
it is very like just impulsive last minute
and we're going to do this thing like,

1215
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,030
oh, okay. You don't, you
don't waste a lot of,

1216
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,860
it's a fucking thinking
about that in advance.

1217
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:41,640
Nothing bothers me more than that shit.
Yeah. Ah, how do you feel, by the way,

1218
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:45,330
this is totally off topic, but we've
been having this debate about, she,

1219
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:49,500
she taught our son who's
three years old to say,

1220
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:54,450
I have to take a dump. And I'm like, come
on now. He's going to say it. Teachers.

1221
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:57,690
Yeah, the smile on his face. I
think it's funny. It's funny.

1222
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,000
It's funny to think about
like people being like, what,

1223
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:07,440
you know, like adults treating him
differently because he speaking Kras,

1224
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:12,270
here's the deal. Yeah. You don't
why I got a potty mouth. Why?

1225
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:15,900
Because after three they
thought it was cute.

1226
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,950
They really thought it was cute.
But what it is is it's unrecoverable,

1227
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,470
what's that word I wrote?
Everybody. Vocable vocable yeah.

1228
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,640
So once it goes down that
path, oh, I am teaching math.

1229
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,830
I tell mercy like when she takes a
shower, when she comes out, like,

1230
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,380
what did you wash your monkey? She'll look
at me. I go, did you wash your muffling?

1231
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,990
She'll say, yes, Daddy.
And she knows, right?

1232
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,670
I don't think she goes to school and
says, Hey, I washed my monkey yet.

1233
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,370
Even besides that, I'm no
fucking angel either. Yeah.

1234
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,890
But I don't curse around that.

1235
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,900
No. Well, listen, that's where I draw
the line. I, we don't drop f bombs.

1236
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:57,240
I don't say shit or go fuck yourself.
None like that.

1237
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:02,070
But I feel like dump is permissible.
It's not really a bad word. It's,

1238
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:06,900
it's crass. As my daughter would call
it. She say potty words that Heidi,

1239
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,363
she's sick.

1240
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:12,700
Bollywood's I'm like, what type
of words? You know, she won't say,

1241
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:17,890
she's heard me. I slept with a
shift from dying. It's impossible,

1242
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,060
but nothing else like that.
Nothing.

1243
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:25,790
Now I bet with your history of
being an animal and the coke days,

1244
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:30,430
you've been with some real
fucking animals yourself,

1245
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:35,290
chicks at are real fucking questionable.
Right. There's definitely been some,

1246
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,120
but I want to show you this clip of this

I mean you could tell by her
eyes that other just chicks off.

1250

She would leave you alone like you die.
She's a stalker. Look good. Look at it.

1251
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:13,320
Everybody molested her.
Her father, the neighbor.

1252
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:17,290
Look at it. Look in her eyes.

Everybody. Everybody. She bumped

Look at it.
She's fucking retarded.

1256
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,880
How the fuck are you going to lick

1262
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,590
You'd have to go to the doctor and they
got to put you in stirpes like they do

1263
01:21:55,591 --> 01:22:00,591
the women in open public camera put corn
starch powder in your ass because you

1264
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:07,830

That's a nasty bitch.

1265
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:11,730
Take that off. I'd rather see a
woman he shit or something like that.

1266
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:14,220
Don't make a fuck. Yes.
One of the nastiest things,

1267
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:20,490
I've never been with animals like I throw
them out or give them a lethal lethal

1268
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:24,770
doses optimally shut them the
fuck up for an hour. I mean,

1269
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:26,650
isn't that one of the
grossest things you seen?

1270
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,410

by the way, I respect her.

1272
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:33,930
I think she's just cool.

1273
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:36,760
What is the other respect?
Respecting Brown.

1274
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:39,770
That's who fucking the
owner of new English.

1275
01:22:39,771 --> 01:22:41,320
Who the fuck do you see a girl like that?

1276
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:45,970
You give a 10,000 she's gotta be retarded.
Something something to somebody.

1277
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:48,220
Her family's artistic substances.

1278
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,540
You give her 30 grand and you tell it
snapped. I fucking, I'm gonna kill you.

1279
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,460

1280
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,540
We'll drop you off on the one
70 you'll never find anybody.

1281
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:01,330
That's what you do with chicks like that.

1291
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,130
I don't want to go. No. I said
do the potlucks now, but boy,

1292
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:42,700

with the helicopter and the guy's like,

1293
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:45,850
I don't want to go. I
don't want to go there. Oh,

1294
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:49,390
they just come with the house over there
in China Ville or they pull you out.

1295
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,900
You got your fingers in the dirt. They're
pulling you by your legs like the Fag.

1296
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,070
It's fucking dark.

1297
01:23:57,071 --> 01:24:00,550
Goes the second season when they
buried him with a them with half of the

1298
01:24:00,551 --> 01:24:04,560
motorcycle. The two factors will make
an house swapping the spirit. Oh,

1299
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,540
how did he hit him in the head with
a bottle? They fucking toys. Huh?

1300
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,480
You guys are fucking crazy. Listen one
who gives a fuck? I don't give a fuck.

1301
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:22,240
[inaudible] think one question though.
What is she trying to show?

1302
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,920
How nasty she is?
She's just nasty.

1303
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,630
Really Nasty. Are just nasty.
She, that's her own quote there.

1304
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:32,740
It says if you're listening,

1305
01:24:32,741 --> 01:24:36,910
it says she captioned Blake
in the airplane toilet
because I'm gross like that.

1306
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:40,930
So yeah, she put it out there.
That was the flying too by the way.

1307
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:44,860
I would have her suck my ass hole.
Why?

1308
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:49,150
I stuck my phone guide toe and her
pussy is, it doesn't really matter.

1309
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:52,150
You know this guy and after that
a policy would look like, like,

1310
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:57,450
like it just like a fuck my whole Fred
Flinstone foot if the cat has got it.

1311
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,660
George,

1312
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,230

1313
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:10,180
I put cream on my feet and shit,
but I got a phone.

1314
01:25:10,181 --> 01:25:14,440
That toenail toenails are top down.
I Love Buffalo. It like once. Yeah,

1315
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:19,320

room. I got the whole, yes, I got the z.

1316
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,720
What the fuck did the Braider and
you see the dust just go flow.

1317
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:26,560
I save it and I put it together into
a circle, like a little volcano.

1318
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:27,394
When I smell it.

1319
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,060
Ah,

sprinkle in some of these fucking house.

01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:40,290
Oh Nasty. Joey Diaz. I cut the nails.

1323
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,620
Then you've got to go under the
nail and take the fun guy out. Yeah,

1324
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,270

scrape it. Oh clubs. I do.

1326
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,950
I was asking that.

1327
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,100
I do it like on a black piece
of paper and then I scrape.

1328
01:25:56,101 --> 01:25:59,930
Well it all up the travel with a black
piece of paper. Oh yeah. Well yeah.

1329
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:03,980
Listen to me. I got like an eight ball of
toad. Does that. We're Dale. What do you

1330
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,040
do with the care? Why? Just look at it
for a little while and then I rub it.

1331
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:12,040
I smell it. I fucking blow away and I
want to fuck you. I'm going to throw up.

1332
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:17,090
I got the machine that you buffed it nail
and then the powder falls all over my

1333
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:22,000
other toes. Anyway. I've seen you do this
shit now. You keep it from her. Yeah.

1334
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,970
That's nice of, I want you to, I want to,
I'm so cute. I've never met your wife.

1335
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:29,800
My wife is died opposite.
Married to Joey.

1336
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:34,390
He's the opposite of me. Completely
alien creatures. Podcasts.

1337
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:39,820
You want to know about her?
She was on Leanne's wife of the party.

1338
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:44,720
What it's like to be married to Joey Diaz.
She's cool as shit.

1339
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,070
I like my wife

1340
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:55,730
and she's cool as shit.
I live, so I'm grateful.

1341
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:57,820
I live with a really peaceful fucking now.

1342
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:03,100
Yeah. Yeah. Which is very rare where
I came from houses today, buddy. Yeah.

1343
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:07,940
Yelling and screaming and arguments.
People walk with two in the morning.

1344
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,333
Wow.

1345
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,820
Same Way.
I don't want any fucking drama and chaos

1346
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:19,310
of how I wanted to live and
I'm living in that that way.

1347
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:25,070
Peaceful. Yeah. I know my schedule. I'd
go out Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturday.

1348
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:29,420
Friday night's date night.
Oh, I can't get her out.

1349
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:34,730
She's got to talk to some adults. Yeah.
I think if a Cuban food is silver lake,

1350
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,870
you stop at a Starbucks. We're home by
nine 30 10 who always do early days.

1351
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,180
We tried to go somewhere like
some restaurant, some different,

1352
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:47,210
we went to the Italian joint,
got the meatball two weeks ago,

1353
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:50,120
so every Friday we do
something to Saturdays.

1354
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:53,450
You've got to do some comedy
somewhere. Yeah. You know you do it.

1355
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:58,480
Nine 15 at the store maybe jumped off the
belly room and then you split the same

1356
01:27:59,411 --> 01:28:03,860
way. I am home 20 years. What do you
want to talk about? We have call me,

1357
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:07,050
just call me.
I'm going to sit down there.

1358
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,990
It's very nice to go down there and see
people like on Tuesday nights when I'm

1359
01:28:11,991 --> 01:28:12,750
driving down there,

1360
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:17,470
I'm very excited to go down there
and watch Christine act either.

1361
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:18,680
I like to go down there,

1362
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:23,990
get high before I leave the house
and by the time I get down there,

1363
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:24,920
I'm really tuned up.

1364
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:29,600
I get a water and they sit in those back
chairs and I try to watch the four acts

1365
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:33,620
before me with nobody bothering me.
Just to see what you're up to.

1366
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:38,960
Bert Kreischer last week was
married Ali Wong and then me.

1367
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,410
I get to see. So you'll watch
different. Absolutely. Yeah, because

1368
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:46,850
I don't want to watch on TV.
I read a little watcher.

1369
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:47,860
Can I tell you something?

1370
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:52,050
I've known you for so long and you look
amazing right now. Thank you. I Dunno.

1371
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:56,020
What are you doing? Cause you look,
doesn't he look healthy? You Look

1372
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,100
Jujitsu. He's doing his
boxing. The biggest thing,
right? Learn from in the last

1373
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,400
10 years was the episode he
had about the guy, about sleep.

1374
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,100
I that I was thinking about
that episode yesterday. I was,

1375
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:11,760
that episode changed my life
and that book changed my life.

1376
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,230
What is it so people can get it,
uh,

1377
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:20,970
what's the book? Sleeping while
we sleep? Something weird.

1378
01:29:20,971 --> 01:29:23,340
I learned a lot from when
I had the sleep apnea,

1379
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:27,270
but now I've taken up to a level.
I got the same problem top man,

1380
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:33,180
you got home at 11 o'clock for the
comedy store. Eat an apple, eat a banana.

1381
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:34,140
You try to unwind.

1382
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:37,590
You're not just going to go in and kick
your shoes off and way down two spots at

1383
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:41,180
the store. You go down, you're going
to have a computer and look at Twitter,

1384
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:45,370
thanked them for coming to the store.
You look at your, I did good today.

1385
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,190
I got to change this joke around

1386
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:51,090
and then you have that low
and I'm the type of guy,

1387
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:55,290
if I go in the living room and
man on fires, yeah, that's it.

1388
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:58,720
I get up, get the fucking
cold cuts out. Yeah,

1389
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,460
I got a coke zero and I
watch the fucking movie.

1390
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:07,461
I go during commercial for our stop and
I go hit the bong and the things and now

1391
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:11,520
it's 10 to two and now we're at two
o'clock. Guess what's coming on.

1392
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,750
Smoke gave the man.

1393
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,880
Now I gotta sit here and watch this
fucking thing because how am I going to go

1394
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:18,661
to sleep now?

1395
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:23,220
How old are fucking my had to go lay down
while I'm fucking police in class died

1396
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,070

1397
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:28,170
that was going on that I wasn't
on the road and splash resigned,

1398
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:34,070
junk canvas best John Candy was just
brilliant and on the road you'll watch it

1399
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:37,370
until like four C I love,

1400
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:41,730
I love flying in Thursday.
Yeah.

1401
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:46,350
Doing that show Friday and then that
Friday you just tell people like,

1402
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,970
people were like,
what are you doing tomorrow?

1403
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,210
Do you want to do lunch at
a little? Listen, go away.

1404
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,640
I'll call you when I wake up because I'm
going to go back and I'm going to have

1405
01:30:56,641 --> 01:30:59,790
a film festival. Yeah, no,
I got a little bit of food.

1406
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:04,620
I get those protein bars and I put them
in my sax with those protein milkshakes.

1407
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:09,000
I put them in my sock and that's the
only night that I go off the reservation.

1408
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,860
You know, sometimes you get so fucking
high, like I don't do the vapor pens.

1409
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:17,040
At home. I only bring them on the roads.
So when I go on the road with them,

1410
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:21,840
I get high in my room, you
know, sometimes whatever.

1411
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:23,490
But when I'm home Jack,

1412
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:28,620
there's no 10 30 fucking main shows
from my world though. That shit,

1413
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:30,960
because that starts at 11 it next,
you know,

1414
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:35,580
I'm walking to my house at 1215
that meets to add in my house.

1415
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:39,150
You wake up at six 15 whether
you like it or not Friday.

1416
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:43,440
So in our position we got to get eight me.

1417
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:48,470
If I could do seven 1130 12 to seven
sometimes I'll sleep till seven get up,

1418
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:54,690
jump in the shower, I have a cup of
coffee, talk with her for 1520 minutes,

1419
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:58,230
and then maybe they go to
school and I write for an hour.

1420
01:31:58,231 --> 01:32:01,520
They're not going to kick at night.
I do that shit early.

1421
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:03,250
You get it out of the way,
you know?

1422
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,500
But the sleep has been
asleep is fucking huge.

1423
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:12,160
If you're dieting and you're not
sleeping, you know, losing weight.

1424
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:15,610
If you lift the weights and you're not
sleeping, you're not fucking retiring.

1425
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:20,490
It backup. So if anything, I
blame it on sleep. Yeah, that,
that episode, by the way,

1426
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,000
I don't know what it is,
but if you guys,

1427
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,470
if you just Google your rug and
sleep expert, this guy in the,

1428
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,080
in the first few minutes of that episode,

1429
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:34,420
that guy has you thinking about, is
that episode 1109? That's what it is.

1430
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:38,230
Yeah. It's jre 11 or nine, I forget.
I don't know what the guy's name.

1431
01:32:38,231 --> 01:32:42,940
He's a sleep expert and a
neuroscientist man. That, that dude,

1432
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:47,170
in the first few minutes he starts
explaining what happens to your brain and

1433
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:51,670
grabbing people without having great
sleep. Um, but that is asleep. Put dirty.

1434
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,760
Totally separate. Really for 27,
I did blow out what our own, uh,

1435
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,330
Chris, who's working here? That
was his professor in school.

1436
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:05,180
What's it really? Yeah, that was
definitely my professor Walker.

1437
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,510
Okay.
What's the name of the book?

1438
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:11,120
You know the name of the boat is the name
of the book. I didn't catch that. Um,

1439
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,690
sleep. Look Up Matt Walker. Yeah.

1440
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:18,130
So I got to watch everything
because if I drink too much water,

1441
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,670
then I'm up and down
as the base thing.

1442
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:27,130
So now if I go to bed 1130
while we sleep,

1443
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:30,220
I could sleep till six so I pee.

1444
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:34,990
I don't have nothing going for my
blog. I go back, close my eyes,

1445
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:37,240
and I try to get one more out.

1446
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:41,440
The last two nights I've slept so well
and I feel different. Yeah, that's,

1447
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:44,200
that's either you can eat well,
you could do everything.

1448
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,930
But if you'll remember when
I first started the podcast,

1449
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:52,190
I was doing it at 6:00 AM
I was telling Tom that,

1450
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:56,380
Christine, you want to be on my show, I'm
going to call you at 6:00 AM. I was like,

1451
01:33:56,410 --> 01:34:00,580
ah,
I don't wake up exam 45 I was getting up.

1452
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:04,060
So it was doing that.
I was getting up at four 45 Monday,

1453
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:08,740
four 45 Wednesday for Thursday,

1454
01:34:08,741 --> 01:34:12,280
the fly out and then Friday radio dude.

1455
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:16,530
And what time are you going
to bed? Usually? No, whatever.

1456
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,960
No restraint was tools
that flicks documentaries,

1457
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:27,430
this dat, you know, youtube concerts.

1458
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,560
Now everything gets shut down.

1459
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:32,960
But why were you waking up so
early if he didn't have to pick?

1460
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:37,420
Because I read the Howard stern book
years ago and he said that when he did

1461
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:40,150
radio,
he always wanted to get to you first.

1462
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,990
That's the reason why he did morning
radio was to get to you first.

1463
01:34:43,991 --> 01:34:47,890
I was trying to build a podcast,
so I want to get to you first. Oh,

1464
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:51,430
that's interesting. I never got a
reason why I was doing that for so long.

1465
01:34:51,431 --> 01:34:55,430
I wanted to get to you first. It
lasted about two years. We did it.

1466
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:59,080
I couldn't believe it. I
couldn't it. I did it once. I
called in and you were like,

1467
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,150
I'll call you at six. I was
like, I was like, fuck. It was,

1468
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:06,350
I started thinking about it and it was
too much. Like morning radio. Yeah.

1469
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:09,080
What I was trying to avoid,
I had become,

1470
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:14,240
so now like I consider a
podcast or why at the APP.

1471
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,080
My podcast should be a why at that.

1472
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:21,450
I see always people wasting valuable
time on a fucking podcast. I'm like golf.

1473
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:26,030
They play games, they do
this. They called his talk.

1474
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,940
People just want to hear why at that.
That's all we are,

1475
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:31,970
what we would say behind closed doors,
but they want to hear for sure.

1476
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,110
They want to hear, they don't
want to hear if you edit me out.

1477
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:39,800
Oh he said Chin Chin.
He says this.

1478
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,860
That's not what they want to fuck it here.

1479
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:45,940
They want to hit a wire tap where
they hear a fucking why for sure.

1480
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,390
A conversation between two fucking guys,
woman to what we were talking about.

1481
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,700
Yeah, it's true. It's
pretty fucking by the way.

1482
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,650
You have any interest and you kind of
just watched from the sidelines how things

1483
01:35:57,651 --> 01:35:59,870
are starting to gear up for 20,

1484
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:04,130
20 elections and all these
people are coming into the mix.

1485
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:08,510
Like different people are announcing
that they're going to right now the pool,

1486
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:13,400
I don't know if you've seen the democratic
pool. It is like, it's um, it's,

1487
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:14,510
it's huge,
right?

1488
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:19,430
Every day announcing like all these
different senators and former governors

1489
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:21,620
congresspeople.
But there's,

1490
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:25,160
there's other people that are announcing
that they're going to run for president

1491
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:29,060
to like, um, I don't know if you've
seen this guy right here. He's,

1492
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:29,990
he just announced,

1493
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:32,970
hi everyone.
Did she scream my co Ah,

1494
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:38,420
Taylor jr I am a retire e I am running
for president of United States.

1495
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:47,730
Good
fucking Brody hung up.

1496
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,990
So this guy still fucking
walking around telling people,

1497
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,560
here's the problem with him.
Oh, Brody rest his soul.

1498
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:56,120
And this guy wants to run for president.

1499
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,920
This guy can't get to the fucking store
without falling down two times and he

1500
01:37:00,921 --> 01:37:02,180
wants to run for president.

1501
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,740
And the fact that somebody taped him
and let it this fucking Moron get the

1502
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:09,730
platform. Like if this guy calls
you up and said, come over,

1503
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:13,430
I want you to tape me. And when
they run for president, yeah,

1504
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:14,480
I'll be there in two hours.

1505
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,810
I'd send the mental health people over
there like listened to go over there and

1506
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:18,770
just bandage him up.

1507
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:22,370
He's talking about killing themselves
and take him out of fucking Rovs.

1508
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:28,200
And then somebody had to
upload this to youtube. Listen,

1509
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:32,630
you know what the thing is, when I
came from Cuba, I looked at the prices.

1510
01:37:32,631 --> 01:37:37,460
You know, you had your Nixon's, you had
your, you had your fucking, uh, you know,

1511
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,310
I can't even remember for Reagan,
Reagan,

1512
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,290
Ford Hall look like presence.

1513
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:48,470
And then Clinton came along and he got
his dick sucked and something happened

1514
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:50,650
and that, that nobody
else got the Dixon. Yeah.

1515
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:55,410
He came along and it became
something else. Bushed it to have it.

1516
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:58,730
I think Bush had it, but
he did. Then the sun,

1517
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:02,490
they definitely didn't fucking habit.
We don't have precedence anymore.

1518
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:07,410
We got a bunch of jokesters. Yeah.
No, nobody in the pool was exciting.

1519
01:38:07,411 --> 01:38:09,870
Nobody's excited,
but nobody has a presence.

1520
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:15,090
Joe Biden has a presence is
2000 years old. Once a you,

1521
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:19,380
you hit him with a challenging, you
know, the Koreans are common. I can die.

1522
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,620
Would be,

1523
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:26,100
I never even had Korean food
over to Korea town bastard.

1524
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:30,840
So these guys, you know, I need a 55
year old with a strong top barrel.

1525
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:35,580
Yeah.
He'd come across a guy like John Paul,

1526
01:38:35,581 --> 01:38:39,980
like a throwback to like, uh, or like if
a madness actually ran, you know, the guy,

1527
01:38:39,981 --> 01:38:43,940
a general Maddis. I like that. Who's like,

1528
01:38:43,941 --> 01:38:47,550
we haven't had a general in a while. I
think that'd be, or you know, I want it.

1529
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,700
There was only, I don't
vote. I'm a felon. Yeah.

1530
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:55,010
But that wasn't one motherfucker
I would have ever voted for it.

1531
01:38:55,011 --> 01:38:57,560
His name was Ross Perot.
Oh yeah.

1532
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:04,070
I read the, I read his book. It was in

1533
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:08,420
prison and I was never more impressed
when you read his book on wings of Eagles

1534
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:11,930
is when, if you really,
really, really are an American,

1535
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:17,300
if you really believe that we should
fuck motherfuckers up when they slip.

1536
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,430
You know what I'm saying?
Fuck.

1537
01:39:19,431 --> 01:39:24,431
Motherfuckers up like parole was our
guy primrose claim to fame was he owned

1538
01:39:25,191 --> 01:39:25,761
this company.

1539
01:39:25,761 --> 01:39:30,600
I don't know what his people
got kidnapped and they uh,

1540
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:35,540
ran Iraq situation or something.
Correct me. I'm not a fucking historian.

1541
01:39:35,870 --> 01:39:40,870
And I read this book in [inaudible] 88
but he went to Kissinger and he went to

1542
01:39:41,301 --> 01:39:45,320
all the heads of state and they said they
really couldn't help him. And he said,

1543
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,420
okay. And he went to the
people's families and he goes,

1544
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:52,700
I'm going to have your
family back by Christmas Day.

1545
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,840
And he went and he searched
for the highest ranking
retired fucking killer that

1546
01:40:00,231 --> 01:40:04,250
the military ever have. Like you pay like
10 million. Give me the fucking coach.

1547
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:09,830
I want somebody who's killed a
thousand Jack. He's killed everybody.

1548
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,710
Cubans.
I want a guy with no conscious.

1549
01:40:12,711 --> 01:40:16,880
And he took that guy that was played by
the movie cause they did a movie about

1550
01:40:16,881 --> 01:40:17,420
it.

1551
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:22,420
He was played by a tough white
dude to train his employees.

1552
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:27,350
So think of you're an it guy.
Like can I come in and go get up,

1553
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:33,350
let's go shoot a fucking grenade
missile. He, she trained,

1554
01:40:33,351 --> 01:40:37,190
this guy says trends his own employees
because Ross Perot sold him on it.

1555
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:41,240
Those are your brothers over there.
Can you sit on that fucking basket?

1556
01:40:41,241 --> 01:40:43,430
Eight fucking crackers.
Let's go.

1557
01:40:43,431 --> 01:40:47,780
He trained them and Christmas Eve,
the 23rd around there,

1558
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:52,160
they went over there and they saved his
employees and he had the people back to

1559
01:40:52,161 --> 01:40:53,520
their families.
Shit.

1560
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:56,250
Something the government wouldn't even
do cause they don't want to cause bro.

1561
01:40:56,290 --> 01:41:01,010
Yeah. Wow. Parole got in some trouble
for it. So he had some backlash. Yeah.

1562
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:03,700
My world.
I want that backlash.

1563
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:07,990
Went to a family and
told them no matter what,

1564
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:13,600
even if I got to buy helicopters,
I will go over and take them myself.

1565
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,570
It takes a certain type of man to do that.
He was,

1566
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,300
he would have been a scary presence.
Yeah.

1567
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:21,860
They would've been like two
countries left. He was the president.

1568
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:26,560
He would have been like us. He would
have blown everybody else up. Africa,

1569
01:41:26,561 --> 01:41:30,840
I ran these real Railey's would still
be around and see where the team that

1570
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:34,660
we've got team up with Jews.
Every Jewish people know a thing or two.

1571
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:37,900
You know what I'm saying? I'm
Palestinians. Just take them out.

1572
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:43,060
They would just been parking lots all
over this fucking empty fucking places.

1573
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:44,700
Smoking.
I remember like those,

1574
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:48,740
he wasn't going to fuck around
Larry King and he was here.

1575
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:55,090
It sounded like someone's uncle,
you know, just shooting the shit.

1576
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,680
And then at the end of every
thing, he was going, by the way,

1577
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:03,640
American people dead paying
for this with your money.

1578
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:05,890
I'm paying for this money.

1579
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:11,380
I saw when he was making at one time guys,
it was just amazing.

1580
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:16,030
Yeah. I one time they broke down when he
was making a day. It's got to be insane.

1581
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:20,080
It was insane when he had that much
money and he's still alive. By the way,

1582
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:23,650
did this guy have some platform that he
was running on? Who? Ross Perot? No. No.

1583
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:27,280
The guy that announced his running for
press, the fucking mobile platform.

1584
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:31,980
What did he once he actually say,
who's this? Who's this? I don't know.

1585
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,100
Can you imagine the other four idiots
now who's going to be his vice president,

1586
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:39,430
guy with a hat with a propeller on
it. Then they sit there all day. Yeah,

1587
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:42,280
this is what I'm going to do.
Got The fuck out of here.

1588
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,080
You got to drive me crazy with this shit

1589
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:52,080
and freedom for freedom and I am

1590
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:59,800
taking the wall down. Oh,
he's taking the wall. Okay,

1591
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:04,720
so he's got an immigration policy.
That's interesting to know the wall.

1592
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:08,890
No need to be up and Masha cow,

1593
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:14,150
aeration dishes
America.

1594
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,830
You're going to hell Tom,
who's willing to have this guy?

1595
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:22,120
Can you imagine this poor bastard giving
this first beach and all the sudden you

1596
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:26,920
just hear it happens that fly off
and shit and he's still alive.

1597
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:33,610
I think we need a wall.
Let me tell you.

1598
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:38,020
So they can put up 20 walls.
Those Mexicans, they're
worse than the Vietnamese.

1599
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:42,850
Don't dig up though. They'll
dig it up, dog. You can't stop.

1600
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:46,450
You can't stop it. You
can't. You can't stop people.

1601
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:49,060
What they've been doing
for the last 200 years,

1602
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,480
they know shit about that fucking
born that we don't have a phone.

1603
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:56,790
You ever been to a checkpoint? Charlie
in Berlin ever go to Germany and Berlin.

1604
01:43:56,900 --> 01:44:01,220
Oh, you should have seen him
over there all the time. So I do.

1605
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:03,500
I go a little talk about
Jews with the Nazis

1606
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:10,610
got to go to for led by top.
Mother's the,

1607
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:13,590
when you think of those Jews
that fuck is wrong with you.

1608
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:18,700
End Up in Berlin.
You got see the checkpoint Charlie.

1609
01:44:18,701 --> 01:44:22,480
It's the place where you could cross
between east and West Berlin because they

1610
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:25,810
built a wall. That's what they fucking
did after the end of the war. Whatever.

1611
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,800
The crowds, the crowds. Yeah. Yeah.
And you would see it's a mute.

1612
01:44:29,801 --> 01:44:34,450
There's a museum right there and it shows
exactly how everybody fuck the wall.

1613
01:44:34,451 --> 01:44:36,280
Basically.
Like people would sneak in,

1614
01:44:36,281 --> 01:44:39,010
they build compartment secret
compartments and trunks.

1615
01:44:39,011 --> 01:44:43,480
They built secret compartments under cars
and carriages and people still fucking

1616
01:44:43,481 --> 01:44:47,890
snuck in. I mean there's museums dedicated
to it. So you can't stop anybody. No,

1617
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:50,770
it's never going to find that you can't,
you can't jump over and get shot.

1618
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,813
You won't fucking,

1619
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:56,400
we'll just do it. Did you watch that last
season of Narcos? Yeah. That's been it.

1620
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:59,960
Yeah. Yeah. Go Luna. Awesome.
Amazing. Just tremendous.

1621
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,980
But it tells you that
they didn't give a fuck.

1622
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:07,250
They'll build tunnels. Yeah,
man, don't go down the,

1623
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:11,100
they'll figure out some marines
that don't give a fuck. Yeah.

1624
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:16,040
It's such a, you got to pick your battles.
Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah.

1625
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,780
I have nothing against the wall.

1626
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,420
The wall that discriminant
but build the fuck on wall,

1627
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:24,260
but you're not going to stop it.
You're not going to stop you though.

1628
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:27,390
And that money? No, I don't
even like talking politics. No.

1629
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:31,400
Humans are so resilient. They'll
just figure out a way. Get through.

1630
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:35,120
My parents escaped from Hungary and
69 when the Russians were. Yeah.

1631
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:38,900
For all those Mexicans are built on a
hot air balloon as we speak right now.

1632
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:39,350
Horse.

1633
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:43,190
Do you think the fucking new flight with
a butane lighter like three Mexicans by

1634
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:44,024
themselves,

1635
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:48,200
a little fucking thing that pops after
the fucking an hour that just build this

1636
01:45:48,201 --> 01:45:50,870
shit already countering the wall.

1637
01:45:50,871 --> 01:45:55,040
They're already planning how the fuck
they gonna zipped a little war. Oh yeah.

1638
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,950
And by the way, the, you
know the way that people,

1639
01:45:57,951 --> 01:46:01,010
whenever somebody faces any Perrier
of something they want to do,

1640
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:03,660
there's always another, there's
always another way, man. Horse.

1641
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:05,310
It'd be another way you can,

1642
01:46:05,311 --> 01:46:09,320
you can put up a hundred foot wall
and then a new way. Just a new way in.

1643
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:13,600
Of course my parents figured out a way
to escape from communist Hungary where

1644
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:19,080
kids were ratting out their own parents
to the KGB and your fucking family would

1645
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:22,150
get taken away in the middle of
the night and thrown into prison.

1646
01:46:22,151 --> 01:46:26,260
And my parents were like, fuck this place.
We're Audi. How'd they get out of it?

1647
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:30,820
So they, uh, they took the train
to, took a train to Yugoslavia.

1648
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:34,510
They got caught,
they got deported setback.

1649
01:46:34,630 --> 01:46:37,960
And instead of getting on the
train and going back to Budapest,

1650
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:42,970
my parents were like, yeah, yeah, we'll go
back. And they got off at the first stop,

1651
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,650
you know what I'm saying?
So he took a train in Yugoslavia.

1652
01:46:44,651 --> 01:46:48,520
They get caught at the border. The
guy says go back. But they don't,

1653
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:53,550
they got at that first stop after and
then they pay a guys with the guineas.

1654
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:59,550
They find a guy in Yugoslavia, they
can get them to Italy. So they wait,

1655
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:01,710
they wait, they wait, meet this guy.

1656
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:06,600
The guy gets them over to Italy and then
they're in a camp in Italy for about a

1657
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:09,400
year and change until the Catholic
Church and determined camp until,

1658
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,990
oh and that the Americans came over to
my parents and I saw you guys were from

1659
01:47:12,991 --> 01:47:15,360
Hungary.
Tell us what the Russians are doing.

1660
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:18,540
Cause my dad was in the military
in Hungary and they said, uh,

1661
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:22,620
if you can show me a map of what the base
looks like, he goes, of course, yeah,

1662
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:26,280
here it is. Here's what the Russians
do. This is where there's today. And um,

1663
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:30,330
I think because my dad helped the
Americans and whatever, I don't know,

1664
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,690
somehow we got taken to Canada,
we got a pass to Canada.

1665
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:38,940
And a favorite part about that though, I
was born there, she was born in Canada.

1666
01:47:38,941 --> 01:47:41,910
And then one day he was just like,
America, I want to go to America.

1667
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:45,560
And then they just drove in.
And my parents, yeah, Noah,

1668
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:48,600
he got sponsorship to work
at a factory in Detroit.

1669
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:51,960
He was still supposed to go back to
Canada, right. And then one day he's like,

1670
01:47:51,961 --> 01:47:54,750
fuck that. But that's immigrants.
Does, dude, that's what Joey is

1671
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:58,140
a loophole and you're like,
fuck you.

1672
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:01,150
Mother went to a party
with her younger sister.

1673
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:07,840
My aunt was 13 Rosita and my mother was
about 1516 they went to a party with two

1674
01:48:10,611 --> 01:48:13,470
of the three of them brothers.
My

1675
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:20,170
mom was dancing and she lost sight
of the Rosie and she went outside.

1676
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:23,500
She went to rather thing as
some guy was raping my head,

1677
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,120
no taxi drivers in my wife.

1678
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:30,950
My mom broke the bottle and stab them
in the back and ripped his back apart.

1679
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,160
The guy died the middle of the night,
so they had to get my mother out of Cuba.

1680
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,700
So here's my mother,
1516 years old.

1681
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:42,680
In those days you just went through the
fucking airport and she went to Chicago

1682
01:48:42,681 --> 01:48:46,700
first. She labored in Miami, went
to Chicago to see your relatives.

1683
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:51,650
They didn't want to, she ended up in New
York. We have no like Hong Kong, New York.

1684
01:48:51,651 --> 01:48:54,950
And she stayed with, it caused me for a
few days and it was a fucking nightmare.

1685
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:57,140
And she met a Puerto Rican girl.

1686
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:02,200
They would go eat and they started running
numbers together when they were kids

1687
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,050
from neighborhood booky,
even,

1688
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:07,190
they both got together and opened up
like a little back and started making a

1689
01:49:07,191 --> 01:49:11,540
little money. But my mother wanted
to go back to Cuban. See are parents.

1690
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:16,580
So she looked back at the
Cuba with [inaudible] mothers,

1691
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:21,890
uh, identification. There was
no passports at that time.

1692
01:49:21,891 --> 01:49:24,320
Whatever the fuck they use,
I don't even know what those passports.

1693
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:28,970
So my mother entered Cuba with
the name of Sophia Cecilio,

1694
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:35,620
stayed in Cuba for four fucking had my
sister then had me stay in Cuba with that

1695
01:49:38,901 --> 01:49:39,860
fake fucking thing.

1696
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:45,650
And 1966 he came back into the states
as Sophia Cecilio and that name stuck.

1697
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:53,110
So she just went and got a social security
card. She lived the rest of her wife,

1698
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:56,730
like so free as a CELIAC. People
will call us or feel, you know,

1699
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:59,410
what are they calling yourself? Fear.
She goes, just mind your business.

1700
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,590
And what was your real name?
Denorah hilarious. Touro Valdez.

1701
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:07,900
I'm allowed that, but she switched
it to fucking Sophie to Cecilia.

1702
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:10,000
But the lab,
when my mother died,

1703
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:14,790
I couldn't collect social security
because my mom didn't work though.

1704
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:17,950
She worked enough quarters
but under a different name.

1705
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:23,530
That's why I want to apply for a passport
because I might get stopped and said,

1706
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:27,670
wait a second. Especially
now, especially with it you,

1707
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:32,680
you've never, you don't go to Canada
and nothing old gods at this point.

1708
01:50:32,681 --> 01:50:37,400
I don't want to do that.
Do you do a border Detroit Buffalo,

1709
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:42,700
but I don't go nowhere.
Just in case they do the paperwork.

1710
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:45,070
Next thing you know.
Yeah, I got some families.

1711
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:53,530
There are no dangerous. Even though I got
to pay the fines if I want a passport,

1712
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:57,490
but I really don't want a
passport to be sure I give a fuck.

1713
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,710
I'm never going back to the Seattle,
Idaho,

1714
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:04,390
so they want to come down and
get me be my guest. Jesus man.

1715
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:09,730
Unreal be my fucking guests.
The immigration world is a really,

1716
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:13,930
because you have to listen to two
sides of it. That's why you really,

1717
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,700
me being an immigrant,

1718
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:20,530
I have natural compassion for anybody.

1719
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:24,410
I, you know, look what's going
on down by the as well. You,

1720
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,990
you want your friends to be a part of
that. I mean you, you have lat time,

1721
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,190
you know,
this is our blood.

1722
01:51:30,191 --> 01:51:32,380
Look what's going on in the
bed as well as same conflicts.

1723
01:51:32,381 --> 01:51:37,150
There's some place in Syria they run
away from, you know, I can't imagine,

1724
01:51:38,110 --> 01:51:42,640
I can't imagine. And listen, we
have good and bad in every race.

1725
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:47,170
Sorry. You know, there's white people
that are fucking doing anything for you.

1726
01:51:47,171 --> 01:51:49,330
And then there's white people
to pay a half really docile.

1727
01:51:49,331 --> 01:51:52,530
They're retarded controller. I can
get into a fucking ivy league school.

1728
01:51:52,531 --> 01:51:55,720
So you've got to parties and
say my little miseries that USC,

1729
01:51:55,721 --> 01:52:00,370
she's a dumb as a box of fucking rocks.
She's dumb as fuck.

1730
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:05,140
But she said, you were say there's
some people were proud of that.

1731
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:10,240
And you know, you look at that
and when I see that, you know,

1732
01:52:10,241 --> 01:52:15,070
I feel fucking bad for saying it just
this way. So nobody gets offended.

1733
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:17,880
I feel bad for SPEC.
A little Nigga kids,

1734
01:52:17,881 --> 01:52:22,881
a little Chinese kids who worked fucking
hard do a thousand fucking things.

1735
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:28,330
And now somebody cuts and fucking line.
I feel bad for them.

1736
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:31,580
I feel bad for somebody
who really needs those.

1737
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:34,290
Somebody who came from fucking hungry,

1738
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,290
she just wants to fucking be an engineer.

1739
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,100
You don't remember when
you started comedy,

1740
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:43,810
how you would go back after your first
year and you wanted to do things and it

1741
01:52:43,811 --> 01:52:46,090
was frustrating and think
of of immigrants in mind.

1742
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:50,000
There's about what no matter what
and that Japan, China, Vietnam,

1743
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:54,080
they come here and they body American
dream and they just want to get into a

1744
01:52:54,081 --> 01:52:55,310
fucking college,

1745
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:00,880
any college and here comes fucking full
house with the fucking husband and may

1746
01:53:01,601 --> 01:53:06,601
see in his fucking cut wife and you know
for 15,000 to put her in a room to take

1747
01:53:07,341 --> 01:53:09,770
our sats. Let me tell
you something. You take,

1748
01:53:09,771 --> 01:53:13,010
you take a course to take your rest a day.
There's a course

1749
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:19,530
and you take it and they, you could take
it. How many times? Two or three year?

1750
01:53:19,531 --> 01:53:21,950
I say yes.
Then you pick the highest score.

1751
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:26,460
So for 15,000 you just threw away 15 four.

1752
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:31,500
So they had her in a room with a mentor
that give a bullshit thing is to the um,

1753
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:33,680
the people who did that,
the paid,

1754
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:38,420
they paid for their kids to
get like near perfect scores.

1755
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:42,080
I couldn't even sell it for like,
these are pretty good scores.

1756
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:45,170
They're like make it, what's
the perfect 6,000? Make It 1520.

1757
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:49,580
So now you're pretending that
the kids are fucking not smart,

1758
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:52,230
like genius level, you
know, it was like the,

1759
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:57,020
the boldness and the balls to have to be
it, to take it to that level, you know,

1760
01:53:57,021 --> 01:54:00,530
is it to me is like, I dunno. I think
you're going to play it cheat like that.

1761
01:54:00,531 --> 01:54:04,580
Smart. How did they cheat the grades?
Oh, sorry, I interrupted you. No, no, no.

1762
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,770
I don't know how they treated the
grades. I don't know. I know that they,

1763
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:09,170
there's different, they were,
these were different cheats.

1764
01:54:09,171 --> 01:54:14,171
One of them cheated the sat and the act
and then when the learning disability

1765
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,260
and that they need, Oh yeah, that was,

1766
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:20,570
that was one of the cheats is that if you
actually do have a learning disability,

1767
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:25,850
you can, you can get like a
solo extra time for the test.

1768
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,800
Proctor watches,

1769
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:32,960
they bribed that person to have a solo
room and then that guy corrected all the

1770
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:35,810
answers. The other one,
there was more levels to it.

1771
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,840
It was like a real conspiracy where they
were paying coaches and acceptors off

1772
01:54:42,221 --> 01:54:43,490
it,
like all kinds of shit.

1773
01:54:44,610 --> 01:54:47,990
He was,
see that 1.3 million bribe.

1774
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:53,120
She's doing 20 years. Yeah. There's
nobody who got around. That's 20 years.

1775
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:58,640
That's 10 years nonviolent.
They put you in a house in Pasadena.

1776
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:03,260
You can't have a bag
book no more. It's, it's,

1777
01:55:03,290 --> 01:55:06,200
it's, that's what breaks
my heart. Listen, when I,

1778
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:10,280
when I was doing my little scam at
the University of Colorado, yeah,

1779
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:14,030
I was a little,
I was a loser and I wanted a,

1780
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:18,050
I wanted an education and I fucked
around a little bit, but I did the war.

1781
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,310
Didn't really want it.

1782
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:23,360
It broke my heart after I got the
felony and I couldn't go back on campus.

1783
01:55:23,361 --> 01:55:25,880
It really did.
It would've meant a lot to me.

1784
01:55:25,881 --> 01:55:29,180
You know what if I could have got
a half a college degree, something,

1785
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,770
but I got to look at you guys
and tell you I'm a criminal.

1786
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:37,880
I've never cheated on a fucking test.
Maybe like in the sixth grade,

1787
01:55:37,881 --> 01:55:42,110
I wrote the answers on my
hand, but besides that I did
the fucking work. You know,

1788
01:55:42,111 --> 01:55:44,730
I quit high school,
but my senior year had to quit.

1789
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:46,610
There was no mommy and daddy had.

1790
01:55:46,611 --> 01:55:51,611
It broke my heart put me in a different
category mentally what it does to your

1791
01:55:51,871 --> 01:55:54,910
psyche. It was just horrible.
Where you working senior year,

1792
01:55:54,911 --> 01:55:59,370
I know I was doing whatever I had to do
to roll a truck, load a truck, you know,

1793
01:55:59,371 --> 01:56:03,540
fucking paint. Yeah. I was trying to do
things, work for a book. He, you know,

1794
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:07,770
but it broke my fucking heart.
That's why when I went to Aspen,

1795
01:56:07,771 --> 01:56:11,910
I tried to sign up for those Mike
Glasses and then when I got arrested they

1796
01:56:11,911 --> 01:56:15,600
forced me to take my GED
because if you have a GED,

1797
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:20,100
it counts against your sentence.
If you don't have a high school diploma,

1798
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:23,370
you have points. If there's
a point system, do you get,

1799
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:28,300
do you have a job when you got arrested,
did you have a high school diploma?

1800
01:56:28,301 --> 01:56:32,340
Are you married? There's all these
points systems. So when I got arrested,

1801
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,650
my point system was one and a half.

1802
01:56:34,651 --> 01:56:39,130
That automatically puts you in a halfway
house, but it had a four year sentence,

1803
01:56:39,131 --> 01:56:42,210
so you only eligible for a
halfway house at the 18 month boy.

1804
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:47,910
So I still had to do six months
to get it down to 18 months.

1805
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:51,120
I had already done two in county,
so that counts for,

1806
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:56,450
so I pretty much got the prison
I was before halfway house. Wow.

1807
01:56:56,850 --> 01:57:01,230
Because I had my GED, I was Rhett
working at the time of my arrest.

1808
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:05,880
There's all these different things
that you have to fill out to get you,

1809
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,560
you know, when you go to
prison. When you come out.

1810
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:09,840
I actually just signed
the box and been disabled.

1811
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:14,610
You do know that when you go to prison,
you come out of prison.

1812
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:19,770
You claimed disability.
Really? Yeah. Nobody's going
to hire me. Mental disability.

1813
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:24,690
I got 800 a month in a parking spot,
but the rest of your life,

1814
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,010
I didn't want to do that.
You know what I mean?

1815
01:57:26,011 --> 01:57:28,650
People do that a lot and
they get the food stamps.

1816
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:33,480
Then they get the other rate and they'll
walk out of prison with 1200 a month.

1817
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:34,051
That's all.

1818
01:57:34,051 --> 01:57:37,050
There'll be able to remake the rest
of the life of work off the books,

1819
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:41,130
but that's how easy it is.
I know an eight, he's eight.

1820
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:45,840
It was maybe now you got to Piss in a
bottle or whatever. They get welfare.

1821
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,180
You could milk it.
Once you got out of prison,

1822
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:50,670
you could say that you are disabled,
but you didn't want that.

1823
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,090
That was 30 years old.
Yeah.

1824
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:58,380
I wa I want it to never
have a ceiling over my head.

1825
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:02,460
Like I could never work for a salary.
I was always a salesman.

1826
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:05,850
You know this week we made 16
next week we'll make eight,

1827
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:08,460
but the week after the how I'll
come back with a $2,000 week.

1828
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:13,230
I never wanted the ceiling over my income.
That was very important to me,

1829
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,320
but I also knew I didn't
want a day job in. Yeah,

1830
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:18,450
I always knew I didn't want a day job.

1831
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:23,510
I wanted to be able to have a job that
one year I can make 60,000 and the second

1832
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:28,110
year I could make 90 and the third I
could make one 50 because I controlled

1833
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:32,190
myself. Did you, did you go to prison
by the, in Colorado it was, it was,

1834
01:58:32,191 --> 01:58:34,380
there was in Colorado,

1835
01:58:34,381 --> 01:58:39,381
a place called Canyon city for diagnostic
where they fucking tap into your head.

1836
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:44,260
They see going on in your head and they
do all these testing and then you go to

1837
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:46,950
a certain facility.
Was Your prison cause it was backed.

1838
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,280
I don't know if it was the same now is
that, was it all super segregated? Like,

1839
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:55,210
like you hear about now you want me
to whites over here. Latins over here.

1840
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:59,560
It's so weird. It was segregated,
but I broke that segregation.

1841
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:00,700
Really?

1842
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:05,700
You had made the guys that hung out
with me break that segregation like it's

1843
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:10,900
weird that I'm married to a Terry Clark
because my best best friend in prison

1844
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:15,250
was a guy named John
Clark who hated blacks.

1845
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:20,510
Trinks Spanish Jews.
You Hungarians.

1846
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,870
He,
he was white power.

1847
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,870
But when he hung with me and
hang out with three young pups,

1848
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:29,940
cause I ran with three black dudes
who I loved and gave my life full.

1849
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:33,580
So there was guy that looks
like Josh Parlor was librarian.

1850
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,820
He looked just like Josh bought
him. Yeah, he was the librarian.

1851
01:59:36,821 --> 01:59:41,380
He was from Buffalo, New York also. Jesus.
Yeah, he shot his wife and the mailman.

1852
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:45,490
Oh, that sounds like a potter then to the
fuck of the tenant to a federal. Yeah.

1853
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:49,150
So our crew was me, him, John Clark,

1854
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:53,260
who was like heavy duty white supremacy,
but not really.

1855
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:57,580
He went between the bikers and the
white guys. He had the tattoos and shit.

1856
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:02,770
Me and him had visitation together
because we both were supervisors in the

1857
02:00:02,771 --> 02:00:03,550
kitchen.

1858
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:07,210
So we wouldn't take visitation
on Saturday's and Sunday's
we'd take visitation

1859
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,540
when they thesis where I
could eat some pussy. Yeah.

1860
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:12,520
Because then I thought I'd make
my girlfriend at the time show up,

1861
02:00:12,521 --> 02:00:13,960
we'll address with no panties on.

1862
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,680
You and your wife would be
on the other side of the,

1863
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:20,950
it just be two of us took
visitations on the weekend.

1864
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:23,830
I got to sit next to somebody.
I can't finger my wife or nothing,

1865
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:28,810
but on Mondays and Tuesday I was
slinging Vic eat das, shooting the load,

1866
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:31,600
and then she would bring me
groceries and I go back to my thing.

1867
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,320
So me and John Type,

1868
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:37,090
but I was tight with a
guy named Spencer Antwan,

1869
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:39,670
a black dude who fucking,
uh,

1870
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:42,640
sliced the guy up and he
had a really good attorney.

1871
02:00:42,641 --> 02:00:46,240
So he had involuntary manslaughter.
He killed him at a party.

1872
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:51,430
He was tight with me. But the best Jude
that was my brother was this guy, Eci,

1873
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:55,840
he was a professional bank robber.
And if I think back about this,

1874
02:00:56,230 --> 02:00:58,890
he's the first guy that
talked to me about stand up.

1875
02:00:59,090 --> 02:01:03,100
Really like he taught me about throwing
your voice. This is a funny story.

1876
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:06,970
We were talking one that we couldn't do
drugs in that cause they drug test to

1877
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:08,500
yet,
but you could do acid.

1878
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:12,430
So we would do acid meet
at a certain bunker.

1879
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:17,620
Me The two black dudes. And we just
had with John Clark and the librarian,

1880
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:19,090
the librarian was a deep guy.

1881
02:01:19,091 --> 02:01:23,020
He liked doing acid and all this shit
and he would talk to you about Venus and

1882
02:01:23,021 --> 02:01:27,850
all this stuff. But one day we were
talking and this guy, Eci was his name,

1883
02:01:27,851 --> 02:01:32,680
he's like, man, my Mama, I been in
here for too motherfucking long.

1884
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:37,630
It's shit. My freezers are
slipping. I'm like freezer.

1885
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:42,400
And he goes, you my mother
fucker freezes and I don't know,

1886
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:43,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

1887
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:47,840
And he was telling me that when you
go into a bank or liquor store to rob

1888
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:52,310
somebody, when, how you say
freeze is very important.

1889
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:55,030
And it's got to be very like foodies,

1890
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,850
like it's gotta be very intimidated
because if you don't say it the right way,

1891
02:01:58,851 --> 02:02:02,540
people get kind of fucking tough. You know
what I'm saying? And he goes, one time,

1892
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:06,200
me and my brother went in to rob a bank
and my motherfucking brother had a cold

1893
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:08,060
and shit and he yelled,
freeze.

1894
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:11,150
But his voice cracked and the
motherfucker pulled out a gun and shit.

1895
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:13,820
I had to shoot him in the leg. I
mean, I looked at his police report,

1896
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:15,920
he had shot like 80 people.
This guy,

1897
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:19,310
this guy was a jail 80% of his life,

1898
02:02:19,311 --> 02:02:23,840
but he was hollow iron and my freezers
are slipping. So he would tell me, man,

1899
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:25,970
I got to work on my
mother fucking freezes.

1900
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:30,440
I'm getting out of here like six months.
It's shit. I gotta get back to work.

1901
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:35,090
So I go like, so what, what can
I do to help you? And he goes,

1902
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:40,820
let me know when people are gathered
and I could try my shit out on them.

1903
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:43,730
You know what I'm saying? It's like, oh
well we'll start in the cafeteria first.

1904
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:48,920
So he would come in and look at me and
I go and like everybody would be online

1905
02:02:48,921 --> 02:02:53,000
and getting that food and there'd be
people sitting here and he would kick the

1906
02:02:53,001 --> 02:02:57,590
door down and go freeze motherfuckers
and white people would duck and shit

1907
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:00,470
and he would come up to me.

1908
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,070
I told you I got to work on my
motherfucking freezes and shit.

1909
02:03:04,071 --> 02:03:08,450
That I would wait on Saturdays when
the black dudes or play dominoes in the

1910
02:03:08,451 --> 02:03:12,350
laundry room and they'd be listening.
Fucking who's Whitney Houston's husband,

1911
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:14,420
Bobby Brown. Brown. Don't be cruel.

1912
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:18,590
Like I was in prison with the album came
out and the brothers would be dancing

1913
02:03:18,591 --> 02:03:21,230
though, be cruel. And I
would run over the ECI, no,

1914
02:03:21,231 --> 02:03:23,210
actually I got like 20 brothers gathered.
He goes,

1915
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:27,320
what the fuck off and go there in the
laundry room and he would watch down there

1916
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:30,890
to the back door and I go in there
and the front be hanging out with the

1917
02:03:30,891 --> 02:03:35,480
brothers and all of sudden the door was
kicked open and he'd go freeze and all

1918
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:38,180
the black dudes or duck go,
you black motherfucker.

1919
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:42,140
You almost gave us a heart attack and
that she would put his arm around me and

1920
02:03:42,141 --> 02:03:45,490
he'd go, man, if you could scare
Niggas, you could scare anybody.

1921
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:50,420
And I used to go and see you killed me.

1922
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:55,790
And he'd run that drill every fucking
Saturday if white dudes or cook and he

1923
02:03:55,791 --> 02:03:59,690
kicked down the door,
freeze and then God dammit you again.

1924
02:04:00,170 --> 02:04:01,340
And then he would come up to me.
He's like,

1925
02:04:01,341 --> 02:04:03,400
I'm getting my freezers back up if she,

1926
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:06,550
that's one of my favorite stories
I've ever, oh my God. ECI,

1927
02:04:06,710 --> 02:04:11,620
I'm working on my freezes.
I'm working on my freezers and shit.

1928
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:16,010
By the way,
you know potter.

1929
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:21,280
Did you know that he can't come where
Josh Potter can you get it up and he kinda

1930
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:27,560
ejaculate with a girl. No. Tremendous.
That's even better. He wants to,

1931
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:29,240
who wants to come?
He wants to,

1932
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,570
I want to drill a hole near fucking
eyes and they can't take it no more.

1933
02:04:32,571 --> 02:04:33,404
You know what I'm saying?

1934
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:36,980
When you're fucking them and their one
eye balls hanging out and they're like,

1935
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:40,710
are you going to come and get it? Cause
I come quick. Yeah, I come in a minute.

1936
02:04:40,711 --> 02:04:42,750
So if I can come in right
there with you brother,

1937
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:46,590
if I could come in 20 minutes and just
keep giving it dick go from puffy,

1938
02:04:46,610 --> 02:04:51,500
the asphalt, the mouth back
to your fucking back to,

1939
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:54,300
yeah,
but that's my fantasy.

1940
02:04:54,301 --> 02:04:57,510
If I couldn't come for an hour
or hitting you in the face,

1941
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:01,200
making your socket popping it out,
hitting you, you're like confused.

1942
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,010
You don't know where you're going.
So He's never come. He's right.

1943
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:10,860
That's how it usually goes. By the way.
That's it. It's an hour of fucking speed,

1944
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:13,230
but he, he can only come up. He jerks off.

1945
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:17,970
Then when you want to come after the
chickens laying there like she got shot in

1946
02:05:17,971 --> 02:05:22,260
Vegas. Good. I'm saying like she's
laying there, the one leg is hanging,

1947
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:26,370
you know what I'm saying?
Her mouth was stretched out as asshole.

1948
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:30,090
It's still open like a dragon's mouth.
You know when you fuck him in the ass,

1949
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:35,190
he ass hole stays open and then just lay
that drinking milk trying to recoup and

1950
02:05:35,191 --> 02:05:37,350
shit.
You're given them like Gatorade.

1951
02:05:37,351 --> 02:05:40,860
Then you just drink off on the tits
and call it a night. There you go, man.

1952
02:05:40,861 --> 02:05:43,200
Why are we even trying to solve this dude?
I don't think it's a problem.

1953
02:05:43,201 --> 02:05:46,800
It's not a problem. Yeah,
that Joe convinced me.

1954
02:05:46,801 --> 02:05:51,420
I mean I want to just mangled three
checks that you couldn't come there.

1955
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:54,270
You can give him each day for an hour.

1956
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,900
You can get all through to show
up at once and just keep going.

1957
02:05:57,901 --> 02:06:00,600
Like Donna Emily style.
You ever read that book?

1958
02:06:00,601 --> 02:06:01,860
You wouldn't work in this town again.

1959
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:06,540
It came out in 98 about a hooker wrote
about her experiences and she wrote about

1960
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:08,540
Donna heavily that she would go to don,

1961
02:06:08,541 --> 02:06:12,960
Don Henley with all four bitches and he
would sit there and this table like this

1962
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:17,310
was this table and that's a fireplace.
He would make them, Ben don't, don't,

1963
02:06:17,311 --> 02:06:20,910
don't even look at me.
He wouldn't even let them look at them.

1964
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:23,460
Just look towards the
fireplace and bend over,

1965
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,790
do lines of coke and then get up,

1966
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:29,940
open up his robe and stick
it in here like four times.

1967
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,170
Then he sit back down again.

1968
02:06:31,670 --> 02:06:35,040
You can do a couple more lines and
he'd have to be there for eight hours.

1969
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:42,400
This could be your life, Josh. God, I
hope so that someday do it. Like when you,

1970
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:44,580
when I was younger and I did coke,

1971
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:49,860
oh there was dick for fucking four
hours. Yeah. You just give it out deck.

1972
02:06:49,861 --> 02:06:53,430
They're looking at you like what is this
gonna stop and then when you do come,

1973
02:06:53,431 --> 02:06:57,390
it's one of those long loads. Yeah. You
ever have those loads? Like I used to,

1974
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:01,800
I used to be on probation and there was
a dude that was like a Gi Joe Dude that

1975
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:05,670
failed the police task. But his
assistant was a good looking woman.

1976
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:09,460
Like she was Kinda cute if I was dirty,
she was byte dirty.

1977
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:14,640
Nobody talked to him boldly because she
got like a Woodlake leg was kinda like,

1978
02:07:14,641 --> 02:07:17,980
she had like that little limp.
But you could tell the bitch hack game.

1979
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,140
Like she could suck her cock.

1980
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:21,870
I would look at the eyes and I
could tell this bitch is deadly.

1981
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:25,380
But nobody talks though because of the
fucking wouldn't like or whatever the

1982
02:07:25,381 --> 02:07:27,030
fuck she's got.
You got shot in Vietnam.

1983
02:07:27,031 --> 02:07:30,150
I didn't know what happened
to her and she was very nice.

1984
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:32,550
I forget what her name was. I'd
see. I'd always flirt with her.

1985
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:34,810
But when I was doing and I wasn't on,

1986
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:39,450
I figured out how to fuck with
the Piss test among circumcised.

1987
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:41,920
I would take like fucking pool,

1988
02:07:41,921 --> 02:07:46,921
clean it and put it on my dick and then
pull the skin over it and put like a tab

1989
02:07:47,051 --> 02:07:50,740
over like a bread town, like
a, like a fucking rubber band.

1990
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:52,360
And then when I would go pee,

1991
02:07:52,361 --> 02:07:57,361
the guy would watch me and I would take
my thing out and just pee and then pull

1992
02:07:57,761 --> 02:08:02,170
the skin back and all the pool cleaner
will go into the fucking thing.

1993
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:05,140
And then that would zap the machine.
They would always say to me,

1994
02:08:05,141 --> 02:08:10,000
this mother fuckers up to
something. So he asked her, he goes,

1995
02:08:10,001 --> 02:08:12,970
maybe you could see what the
fuck he's doing. So I would,

1996
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,250
I knew when I would call and go,

1997
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:18,460
I'll be there at four cause they would
call you and then you had to call it

1998
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:20,860
machine that would tell
you what color was up.

1999
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,200
And if the color came up that your,

2000
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:26,120
let's say your color is maroon and
they go to, these colors are green,

2001
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:28,110
Maroon and black.
You have,

2002
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:31,060
I have to call him and tell
him what time you coming in.

2003
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:34,720
You had till five o'clock but you got
to make an appointment. Then she'd tell,

2004
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:38,350
you know, if he adds it, that means he
was a watch you while you're pissed.

2005
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:40,660
But with me,
they hadn't mirrors around me.

2006
02:08:40,661 --> 02:08:44,260
They couldn't figure out what I was doing.
So they sent her in.

2007
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:49,190
So before I would go and fucking do a
half a jerk in the car and get my Dick

2008
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:52,380
Nice and big and then I'd
sprinkle it, the fucking, uh,

2009
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:57,250
won't clean their pool cleaner.
I still got scars.

2010
02:08:57,251 --> 02:09:01,660
I got little holes in the my Dick
and Draino. I would grind it up,

2011
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:05,140
I would fucking put it under my
Dick and then pull the skin back.

2012
02:09:05,141 --> 02:09:08,950
And they would fall into the piss test
and Zap it. But before I would piss,

2013
02:09:08,951 --> 02:09:11,440
I would take the hammer out and show
it though. Like what do you think?

2014
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:12,671
What do you think?

2015
02:09:12,671 --> 02:09:16,410
There's something nice and she would look
at it and look around the room and not

2016
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:19,160
like I knew I was glad I
ended up asleep or whatever.

2017
02:09:19,190 --> 02:09:20,890
A swap and spirit cause I flirt with it.

2018
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:24,010
Nobody talked to the woman
because she got her fucked up leg.

2019
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:27,310
So I'm off probation,
I'm delivering Chinese food.

2020
02:09:27,311 --> 02:09:30,910
I'm slinging coke at the same time at the
Chinese restaurant. So I would have to,

2021
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:34,570
I will have you called the Chinese
restaurant and say, I talked to Joe. Yeah.

2022
02:09:34,571 --> 02:09:36,730
What's up? Oh you want to
even drop soup, whatever.

2023
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:40,210
The cocaine would be hidden under the
egg drop soup so that if I got in trouble

2024
02:09:40,211 --> 02:09:42,700
to train these people got in trouble.
I didn't put it in the bag.

2025
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:44,800
This was when I was out
already out of prison.

2026
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:50,800
When that I knock on the door and who
answers the door, it's her. And she goes,

2027
02:09:50,801 --> 02:09:54,520
oh my God, it's so great to see
you. How have you been like, oh,

2028
02:09:54,521 --> 02:09:55,780
it's quite to see you,
man.

2029
02:09:55,781 --> 02:09:58,930
I gave her a hug and I put
the Chinese down and she goes,

2030
02:09:58,931 --> 02:10:01,420
what are you doing with your life?
I got to know them getting divorced,

2031
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:06,280
but I got the standup comedy and I'm
trying to deliver food to make a living.

2032
02:10:06,281 --> 02:10:09,160
And she's like, oh that's so sweet
of you. You and her broke up.

2033
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:10,810
Oh you must need a hug.

2034
02:10:10,811 --> 02:10:14,650
And as I started hugging and we started
swapping spit and I touched a little

2035
02:10:14,651 --> 02:10:18,280
monkey and I could feel nobody had even
touched her monkey like that knee is

2036
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:24,030
themes started coming and I started
fingering that motherfucker like a savage

2037
02:10:24,490 --> 02:10:27,460
and spit with her.
And my hand was nice and what?

2038
02:10:27,461 --> 02:10:31,700
And I'm finger that I got
a pinky surrounded her
asshole and I'm working with

2039
02:10:31,701 --> 02:10:34,190
finally I put it down slowly and I pop

2040
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:37,220
up pants, I take a out,
she got one fucking town

2041
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:43,790
mum fucking slow figuring
out at the same time.

2042
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:46,880
So while I'm fingering,
I take a pants down and I go,

2043
02:10:46,881 --> 02:10:48,410
I don't want to see what the other leg is.

2044
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:53,510
So I took the leg off of a good leg and
I left the fucking bad leg carbon cause

2045
02:10:53,511 --> 02:10:56,320
I don't want to know one those.
If she's got like a pole on the day,

2046
02:10:56,321 --> 02:11:00,410
I one of those fucked up fee.
Let's see.

2047
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:04,200
That's why I picked up a
fucking leg or eat her pussy.

2048
02:11:04,201 --> 02:11:09,201
The clit flopping was huge on sucking
like a on like a piece of bubblegum.

2049
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:13,360
I look up and she's like this Christie,
like with her mouth open, I ain't go,

2050
02:11:13,361 --> 02:11:17,550
now's the time to put the helmet and
that fucking mouth. So I switched up,

2051
02:11:17,551 --> 02:11:20,340
I started to finger
Lucina and I went around.

2052
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:23,940
I put that fucking hammer them out
because she didn't know what it is.

2053
02:11:23,941 --> 02:11:24,774
She's like,

2054
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:30,200
well that was that time and at that time
I was trying to fucking live weights

2055
02:11:31,681 --> 02:11:35,580
and shit so I wasn't jerking off cause
somebody told me that the jerk off that

2056
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:36,360
your protein,

2057
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:41,220
I was retarded and when I came in
a mob it was one of those loads.

2058
02:11:41,221 --> 02:11:43,680
Christine that don't stop.
Yeah. One of those things,

2059
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:48,760
I know you're sucking it with your eyes
closed and then after a minute you open

2060
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:50,460
it up cause you're like,
what is this going to stop?

2061
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:55,350
I like to look at a swallow on it and it
was endless. It was fucking them list.

2062
02:11:55,351 --> 02:11:59,050
It was just a loaded deck. It was like
a month and a half and not covered.

2063
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:03,930
There was Valium in there and Xanax.
Hey Joey,

2064
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:08,860
thanks for stopping. I shot a load them
up and when I took my dick as you went.

2065
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:15,150
Okay. It was nice. He drank a gallon
of mountain dew. She looked at me,

2066
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,680
she started getting a little dizzy.

2067
02:12:19,570 --> 02:12:21,070
I was selling Valium at the time.

2068
02:12:21,071 --> 02:12:23,560
I was thinking like a hundred
milligrams of Valium at night.

2069
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:28,660
Well I shot in the mouth with a
religious rants. He was glassy eyed.

2070
02:12:28,930 --> 02:12:32,790
She gave me a $3 tip and I
left and I never saw her again.

2071
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:36,610
She was a tech Chinese for the
slept for a week. Oh my God.

2072
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:38,290
Oh you got any dates coming up?

2073
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:45,950
You can still Twitter handle. You can
still feel it. Not felt like I bet it was.

2074
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,860
I think it was like a
three minute wait a minute.

2075
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:52,220
You didn't even banger put
it in a regime. No, no.

2076
02:12:52,221 --> 02:12:55,490
That's proceed was
tremendous. Yeah. Oh, okay.

2077
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:59,480
I looked her eyes blacked out at
some point. I didn't listen close.

2078
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:01,580
Once I shoved my tongue in your ass,
you black out.

2079
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:04,780
It's like get 40 than Yonkers was too

2080
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:14,290
whack out and let it happen.
What's going to happen anyway?

2081
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:27,260
This is too good. Oh
Man. Take a shower. Uh,

2082
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:30,860
Joey Diaz. Edge of what's
happening now. Oof.

2083
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:32,460
He needs to go to church after that.

2084
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:36,600
You got to see him at the comedy store
going his dates. Where did your web,

2085
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,690

d is that in that you're the best.

You're the best. So are you going,
I love you so much Christine.

2087
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:44,610
You lived that load
when I was saying that.

2088
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:49,560
That's why I did not take it
back to college. Like what
time you got a badge yet?

2089
02:13:49,561 --> 02:13:53,940
You sat too hot. Yeah, it
was a 40 weekends. Yeah. You
got a bad batch of those.

2090
02:13:53,941 --> 02:13:56,870
PLOP. I meet those sperm where
you just kept walking. Swallowing.

2091
02:13:57,820 --> 02:14:00,670
This is the worst picnic.

hungry. Yeah. All right.

Our closing song by a car,
his bites, hard core fund. Um,
