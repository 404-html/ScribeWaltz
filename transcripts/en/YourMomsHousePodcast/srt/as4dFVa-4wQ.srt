1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,080
Christina.
Christina.

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,020
Ah,
I love nails

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,170
right away. Okay. All right.

5
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,580
Have you got one for you?

6
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,943
Whoa.

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,873
Hm.

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,340
Nolan [inaudible] grains or anything?

9
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,323
Love it.

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,633
Huh?

11
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,010
Hello?

12
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,510
Okay.
Hey,

13
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,650
there it is. You couldn't roll your
eyes enough during that song. Um,

14
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,970
that was struggles. It's really
funny. Keely. Pretty good, Huh?

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,110
I loved it. Yeah, it was really cute.

16
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:14,070
It was top dog as my dad losing
his mind over some funny jokes.

17
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,730
I like hearing him retell
the Polack jokes. Yeah.

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,570
Cory's like they buried their father,
it's c and they drown.

19
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,260
They drown digging the grave
and he loves it. He loves it.

20
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,210
He has a man. He has some of those just
in the chamber. Always ready to go. Yeah.

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,720
Yeah.

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,940
Well we should ask him the
next time they're going to
come to visit us and a few

23
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,270
months here,
we should ask them to prepare some more.

24
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:44,130
Maybe he could tell us some yeah, on
the show. Yeah. Bring him in here.

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,550
Oh, we just, yeah, we just need to read
some jokes. It'll definitely, yeah,

26
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,540
he'll definitely kill anything,
any street joke.

27
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,910
But especially blonde, blonde
of Polish. She likes, yeah,
dumb lane. Dumb. The dumber,

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,820
the better stupid people.
Right. Who wasn't there?

29
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,780
Who was a famous comic. Is that like a no,
that's, you know, you're a redneck one.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,380
Oh, Jeff Foxworthy. Yeah. People
like those lanes. You know,

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,270
some of those are really funny. Yeah. Oh
yeah. He gets thrown in that like, oh,

32
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:16,240
he's a redneck guy,
but like some of those are pretty funny.

33
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,570
I like all three of us or three of them.
Four of them.

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,940
They're all have something good,
you know? Yeah. I mean, yeah.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,780
Every comic has something funny
about saying in that lane,

36
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,150
you might be a redneck if some
of them are, you know, he,

37
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,160
he wrote probably a thousand of them. Some
of them are really fucking funny. Yeah.

38
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,510
Yeah. I like that. Ron White though. He's
my fav. Yeah, he's at the store a lot.

39
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,160
I call me tater salad. I like
that too. That impression. Again,

40
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,860
a calm day. You do shit. Why aren't
you doing more impressions? Really?

41
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,450
Well, why don't you do a Ron
White? Did you feel like,

42
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,510
oh well I'll have to get my glass.

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
My wife has a big girl and then he takes
a drink and they all start laughing.

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,500
Yeah. And now we go made up.
Yeah, I think we're good.

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,990
Let's move on to something else
completely. That was really good. Oh,

46
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,530
it was really trying. Can
I have a sip your sona? Uh,

47
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,040
I mean I have my beverages lined up if
we could go over them real quick. Yeah.

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
I have a glass of water and finally
I'm like four episodes. I have a Cvi,

49
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:27,860
which I'm a big fan of and I have a
coffee. Ice Coffee. I see that I have,

50
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,940
I'm reluctantly drinking.
Is Eva cause you stock the fridge full of,

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,870
do you want a sip of this one? Well I just
want yours. Tastes better all the time.

52
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,680
What are you talking about? It's the
same one. Yeah, but I like yours. Yours.

53
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:39,670
Are you serious right now?
Like was one of that one?

54
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,400
Well I don't like drinking my own.
Can I like to have sips of yours?

55
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,580
That's the whole point. I don't like my
own. Can I like sips of your kidding me,

56
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,440
but I like sips of Georgia. My own
drink. What is that? I don't know.

57
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,870
It's what I like doing.
I don't like drinking a whole can,

58
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,110
but I like to have a few sips of yours.
Maybe a quarter of it. That's yours.

59
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,600
Just backwash. I want to hear
or someone a little sub years.

60
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,670
Are you being serious? Yeah. Me
To open that give you that. Yes,

61
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,590
but then I want you to drink from it too.
I liked that.

62
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,110
We fluid bond in the same cup.
That is weird man.

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,790
I like to share at the soda with you.
I don't like to have my own sword.

64
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,190
I don't understand what's going on
cause I like to share. We're married.

65
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,610
Sharing is caring things.
There you go.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,650
See it tastes better when
it comes from someone else.

67
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,790
How angry would your mom get growing
up when you and I wrote him like that

68
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,770
please. And it never did
make me laugh. Of course.

69
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,210
It still makes me laugh. Burps and
farts. High Action makes me laugh.

70
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,170
Her upset makes me
laugh. Right. But for me,

71
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:48,171
I like your burps the best because I
feel like they always tell a story.

72
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,990
Thank you. The way that you like,
it's nice to be appreciated.

73
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,190
I love the, um, the, the
forcefulness. Think what I like,

74
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,790
what makes me laugh all the time. When
you belt, it's that you're so subdued.

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Like you're so chill and then your,
your burps are just violent rips. Yeah.

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,930
You're like, ah, but then you always
maintain, you're still composure.

77
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,940
Yeah.
That's the fast part is it?

78
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:17,420
You don't even let the hype get
to your own head. Thank you. Yeah.

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,650
I've always been good at,
you know, being modest. Yeah.

80
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,880
You just kind of let it go. You
just let it roll. Thank you.

81
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,710
And wait for people to acknowledge
how good you are. Thank you.

82
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,370
Speaking my language. I can't wait
for Ellis to start ripping up.

83
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,670
And then he smiled. He's like,
he likes them right now. Yeah.

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,140
We got him to go after he drinks.
That's super funny.

85
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,940
That is funny.
He learned that from you.

86
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,150
All right, let's, um, let's pull this
out far. These genes away. Ready?

87
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,500
Yeah, let's do it. Man.

88
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,210
You got three man that weigh
over 200 pounds a piece.

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,880
A woman that's a little plump girl and
a daughter who's 13 and you're going to

90
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:07,370
try to take 12 of trouble sausage and
a couple of dozen eggs and piggy back.

91
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,550
It ain't gonna work.

92
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,270
Don't bring in one loving to then

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,090
go to your mom's house.

94
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,143
Christina.

95
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,973
Yeah,

96
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,183
there you go.

97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,140
I love it. It's just for our people
with it following the audio saga.

98
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,630
Uh, I just hired an audio engineer. Did
they ain't gon fuck such so annoying.

99
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,303
Wow.

100
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,380
Um, wait a minute. Wait, you're
just going to let that roll.

101
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:25,840
You're not going to compliment me on that.
That was great.

102
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,520
That was a great burger.
First of all,

103
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:32,200
I held it in for a longer time just
to let it grow and build. Yeah,

104
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,640
I look, I restrained myself and then
I lie that a go. It was really good.

105
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,363
Not really.

106
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,580
Probably that's why about audio.
Oh shoot.

107
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,030
So this is actually the old,
old board.

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,410
I have it hooked up through a
direct box in there. Nothing.

109
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,620
I get like minimal sound. So can we
not play? Oh, those are just drops.

110
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:58,860
We can't play still. Yeah. It's
just, it's super frustrating.

111
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,730
I don't know what else to do. Well that's
why I hired someone and he's coming in.

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,870
Yeah. It's maybe by next week
it'll be fixed. Yeah. Maybe.

113
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Maybe speaking of holding in,
so you held it in that burp.

114
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,660
Do you remember what happened last week?
Yeah,

115
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,240
so I wrote it down so we
could discuss it today.

116
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,620
So you made, remember you all of a
sudden you got to kick in the, uh,

117
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,300
we'll,
we'll get to the sausages here anymore.

118
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,520
Of course we're going to get it done.
You got you in the middle of the day.

119
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,310
We were going to have something
for dinner and you're like,

120
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,550
I really want Mexican. Well,
there's a story to that too.

121
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,940
We'll get into that in the moment.
So, but we did it, you know,

122
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,430
somewhat healthy you style
because we didn't meet,

123
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,180
but we did a lettuce wraps
instead of shells. Right.

124
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:49,190
And then you have some
cheese and whatever. Yeah.

125
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,840
So that's our version, you
know, of Mexican. Anyways.

126
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,130
That meat though has a little bit of, you
know, it's meat. Has some grease to it.

127
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,850
And then we had moms sashes and evening
probably three or four hours after we

128
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,510
ate man.
Like as soon as I laid on that table,

129
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,770
I was like farts right at the door
too. Like they were like, excuse me,

130
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,630
like knocking on the door. And did you
actively clench your cheeks hard? Yeah,

131
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,220
I did.
And you know,

132
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,820
I remember really having to focus and
kind of feeling like you can't really

133
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,710
relax.
And then,

134
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,040
I mean I held them for awhile and
that they were fighting, you know,

135
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:34,041
they wanted to come out and then probably
about an hour into it I feel like wow,

136
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,060
they're totally gone.
And so,

137
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,880
but that's what happens is
they go up inside of you.

138
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,600
But here's the neat part of the story.

139
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,490
So it was it like, you know, after,

140
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,890
after it was over, everything was fine.
It didn't really have those farts anymore.

141
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,620
Wait,
you're saying so eventually you will,

142
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,550
you clenched you clients to clenched and
the farts went up inside of you and you

143
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:03,090
were able to relax through the rest
of your massage. But after, I mean,

144
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,740
I guess I cleanse for a while

145
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,360
and then all of a sudden we're back
at, you know, bedtime or laying around.

146
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:15,070
I have like one little fart and I'm
like, Oh, where, where are the farts?

147
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,530
That's the thing.
I don't know where they are.

148
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,310
And I'm curious because I could feel
that they were really there and you felt

149
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:24,540
them up inside of you. That's
right. So the next morning, but no,

150
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,500
I didn't really feel that anymore.
I can just go like there.

151
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,270
I don't know where it is. They're just
going. So the next morning though,

152
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,920
I have a early flight so I get up before
you're up. Oh, you are super early.

153
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,050
That day I remember that.
I go down in the kitchen,

154
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,620
I make myself a cup of coffee and I
start ripping like 15 seconds and I heard

155
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,740
them from upstairs.
They were like,

156
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,790
like really,
really good.

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,220
The neighbor was starting a motorcycle
or something. It was something

158
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,370
something was going on and I realize
those parts did I held 12 hours earlier or

159
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:04,660
whatever. We're finally finding their
way out. Wow. Isn't that something?

160
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:09,220
Wow. What a neat story. Thank you. I mean,

161
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:12,010
I'm thankful that they came out
in the house and not on the plane.

162
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,230
I just orient the airport or in the car
ride anywhere. They were for a while.

163
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,830
And did they smell worse cause
they had been fermenting in the,

164
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,620
I don't really think so.
They here,

165
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,020
you hear him in the
background a little bit.

166
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,500
It's so faint and I'm so
upset that I can't. Yeah,

167
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,110
you can't really hear him. That's
a problem with the, yeah. Yeah.

168
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,160
That's asked for it. Whereas I recognize
that part anywhere. Yeah, I know it.

169
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,440
Even when it's faint, like the, it's
like the distinct cry of your own baby.

170
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,520
I understand it. King up
was, there's like a son.

171
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,630
He's like a source.

172
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,460
Now it's interesting that you mentioned
the Mexican food because I too,

173
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,210
the reason,

174
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,160
well here's my story leading up to the
Mexican food is that I was making Brown's

175
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,600
every day,
every morning,

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,900
but they were small and they weren't
girthy and they weren't really what I'm

177
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,500
accustomed to and so I thought,
you know what I'm going to do?

178
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,790
What I normally do is I kind of
give myself a little diarrhea,

179
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,620
like not a lot, just a little to get
the system going, get the pipes out,

180
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,420
get the pipes cleaned and then move on.

181
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,330
And so what I normally do is I ordered
Thai food and I'll get like a Penang

182
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,340
curry or something and put some extra
Surratt Sri Registry Racha and there.

183
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,170
So I ate the Thai food and then I was
like, this is going to be at next morning.

184
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:41,380
Here it comes. No browns like
it was just like a normal brown.

185
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:46,381
So wait how constipated constantly like
I was making the browns but they were

186
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,430
kind of, is it for when they're a
little harder, lower down the scale,

187
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,620
like a six lower down the scale,
like a seven,

188
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,690
a three well three still pretty healthy.

189
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:05,920
I mean one and two are pretty hard. It
wasn't hard. Just not a lot came out.

190
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,500
Oh well balls,
but not a lot.

191
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
Not like pebbles when they're pebbles,
you're just dehydrated.

192
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:15,410
And I wouldn't even dream of being
dehydrated. It doesn't anymore.

193
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,730
So I got the tie and then I
thought, well, she really,

194
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:23,470
I got to amp this up to the next day.
I had Korean food that usually does it.

195
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,740
The soondubu soup.
Nothing really.

196
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm thinking I got to go
Mexican and that's when we
went to a whole farts and we

197
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:36,310
got all the stuff for Mexican and
I'll tell you what next morning,

198
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,440
big chocolate city, Brown everywhere.
And I think it's the salsa.

199
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,460
It's actually the salsa that
does it for me every time.

200
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,810
So you didn't have farts during
that mom's size? No. Really? No.

201
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,060
The mid, the next I felt like,
oh, I gotta shit pretty hard.

202
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:57,800
And I'd also had dino tying
Korean behind the Mexican.

203
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,610
So f a r k still got that one.

204
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,030
That's the best. That lady, she said.

205
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,500
She said if f a R T F A R t. O.
N. A nerd. Remember at the, uh,

206
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,840
at that tells that that national
thing though she was drunk.

207
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,680
She was like fucking yes,
correct. The hypocrite.

208
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,650
A R. T. Yeah. Yeah. Hypocrite. Yeah.

209
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,140
Um, Eh, eh,

210
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,390
that's really funny. Um, well
that was something, I mean,
I'm glad you were able to,

211
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,340
but what we also discovered
something else that we haven't had,

212
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,250
we haven't brought up.

213
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,600
What's that? Oh my God. Revelation. Yeah.

214
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,580
Have, um, we've had this,

215
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,610
your friend brought this to our
sources on the street. Yeah.

216
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,570
So everybody's always like, oh my God,
I'm dreaming of a double five class. Like,

217
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,630
when will it happen? Can I get one?
Does this count? And there's, you know,

218
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,090
I sneezed and I course
like, no, of course not. No.

219
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,040
So a double pipe classic
if you don't know,

220
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,170
is it an expression I
coined a very proud of that.

221
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,270
And it's when somebody burps
and farts at the same time, um,

222
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,240
it is, it's really quite
rare, uh, and, and really, uh,

223
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,600
a moment to celebrate.

224
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,990
And most people go quite some
time without experiencing it.

225
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,510
Sometimes years in between mine. Yeah.
I mean, I've met people, you know,

226
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,640
whenever I meet somebody and they have
the, the elbow classic shirt, I go,

227
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:19,474
did you earn it?

228
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,000
We'll say, yeah, that's what he will say.
No, I have it. And I go, wow. Leaving,

229
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,130
you know, you know, you know we should
do for those who have had one, yeah,

230
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,660
we should put like a, a gold
metal, like a gold star Gold Star.

231
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,620
And then if you haven't,
you just haven't earned your stripes yet.

232
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,490
You're like really good idea.
Yeah, we have to reproduce it. Oh,

233
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,850
and if you've had multiples,
it'll be like in the military,

234
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:45,970
like you get your stripes. Yeah. Like
you're a five star general. Yeah. Wow.

235
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,020
Maybe you're, imagine having a
five in a lifetime. Unheard of.

236
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,740
Unheard of. Really crazy. You can't do
that. Well I think I've had three or four.

237
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,780
So stops now you're just exaggerating.
You've been there for a couple.

238
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,460
So.
So anyways,

239
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:08,610
we're talking to one of your
sources who I think has her first.

240
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,670
She just had her first.
She has her first and she goes,

241
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,610
I think I might know the
secret to it. So we, you know,

242
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:17,460
we stop what we're doing with that.
Put the baby on the ground. Like what?

243
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,960
And she said he too.

244
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,220
It all might be to be constipated.
Right?

245
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,790
Wow.
Think about that for a moment.

246
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,360
I'm pondering it now for
if you're constipated,

247
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,800
you have that kind of
extra push. Yeah, no,

248
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,390
you have more gas kind
of floating in there. So

249
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,420
are like constantly kind of,
you know,

250
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,950
doing a little extra grunt. Right.
So maybe in the world of it.

251
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,210
So in a, in a, in a way here,
and I'm sorry to tell you this,

252
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,070
we're going to encourage
you to dehydrate yourself.

253
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,640
Go ahead and slow down your consumption.
Yeah.

254
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,760
And see if maybe you can get lucky.
Right?

255
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,380
Apparently dehydration is the key to
a successful double pipe. Classic.

256
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,850
[inaudible] wow. What an
interesting revelation. Neat story.

257
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,440
I know. I feel like we need
an x, a special sound for,
for something like that for,

258
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,910
do you have anything there? Not
much. Yes. A R t. There you go. Yeah.

259
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,710
That's the sound. Oh boy. What is that?

260
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,110
Still have that baby

261
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,650
that was like that little Dominican guy.
Remember?

262
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,420
He looks like a kid. He was a
really fired up. Oh, that's in here.

263
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,880
Can you turn, can you turn that audio
up? That, that sounds low to me.

264
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,590
I am a man Nigga. Oh yeah.
I remember that. Yeah.

265
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,220
Once you put that in order in there.
Yeah. Hmm. That's thanksgiving.

266
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,200
He's telling you there's no more
leftovers. Oh, remember? Yes I do. No,

267
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:53,790
I'd come here. Let me tickle
you. I don't like that one.

268
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,210
Well, let's go. Let's, let's talk
about this. Yeah, it looks good. Um,

269
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,780
my favorite part about
this is that this is real.

270
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,030
A guy called on the,

271
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,960
like the one 800 number for that.

272
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,700
You know the actor Jeffrey
Dean Morgan Sausages. Yes.
This is his sausage company.

273
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:19,560
This is Jeffrey Dean Morgan
Sausage. And he has a, you know,

274
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,280
a 800 number where I guess
people can leave a message.

275
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,060
This guy left a long message where he's
really upset if they change the size of

276
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,510
the sausages they sell.
Huh. And is a problem.

277
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,590
I don't know where the people come from.
I don't know. If you test your product,

278
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,890
your quality of your product,
your product, very delicious.

279
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,010
Love your sausage for 30 something here.

280
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,930
But I can't take and feed a family of
five on a little 12 ounce roll of voltage.

281
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,890
I don't mind paying you more money
for your 16 ounce roll of sausage,

282
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,340
but you don't have it anymore.
You've got a 12 ounce roll.

283
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,100
So apparently they changed
size of sounds like it.

284
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,140
It had a 16 going and then they change
the 12 but then they also sell a bigger,

285
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:12,511
but it's bigger than 16 so he's upset
because they've eliminated the perfect

286
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:15,850
size for his,
for his needs right now it sounds like.

287
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,910
Why doesn't he just get to hours?
It doesn't want to do that.

288
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,190
He wants to buy a 16 okay,

289
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,710
now he's got to spend more money
for two twelvers Oh, I see, I see.

290
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,990
So you've got three man that
weigh over 200 pounds a piece.

291
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,720
A woman that's a little plump girl and
a daughter who's 13 and you're going to

292
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:39,170
try to take a 12 pound proba sausage and
a couple of dozen eggs and piggy back.

293
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,420
It ain't gonna work.
Apple

294
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,320
a it. So he's got 24 eggs.
Why not do 24 rounds? Is it,

295
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,160
how many people are we talking about
here now, right it the 13 year olds,

296
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,630
three grown men, fat wife. You say three
grown men? I think you said three minutes

297
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,510
and you got three man that way.

298
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,680
So three guys that are 200 pounds.
Oh, losers are living with him.

299
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,120
The big lady and the girl. That's
five people. Five people have 24 eggs.

300
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,750
That's insane. Tour. How many
in between? Let's do the math.

301
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,780
524 that's like four and
a half each of eggs a day.

302
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,070
No, this is a meal we're talking
about, right? Right. So five people.

303
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,750
Five people each have three
eggs. It's 15 right? So He's,

304
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:25,530
but he's feeding them almost five eggs
per customer. This is a lot bananas. Yeah,

305
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:28,760
we don't even go through that much. Jesus.
Why would we go? What do you mean what?

306
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,080
We don't eat well because I do the grocery
shopping and we go through a ton of

307
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:36,860
eggs and a ton of bacon. I know, but
it's no baby jeans. You and myself.

308
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,590
And this is more people and
these are more fat people.

309
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,890
And as far as your 16 ounce and
label and Phage, I don't eat that.

310
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:46,110
I'm not fuck that man.

311
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,570
No north

312
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,260
sausage bothering people to eat with
the breakfast with the fried egg and a t

313
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:55,710
bone steak.
Oh,

314
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,720
okay. I didn't know that it was specific
to an area. Well that, what'd he say?

315
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:03,040
Maple and sage. That I,
that's in the north. Hi Nina.

316
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,600
Her mind I gotta tell you I don't
want that either. Fuck that shit too.

317
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,880
Cause I don't like that sage.
That's the thing.

318
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:11,650
I don't like an American
breakfast sausage. I hate
it. All the herbs and like,

319
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,670
I don't like it. Don't
like it. I like it either.

320
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:18,350
Playing like what this guy
is talking about, dude. Yeah.
I like a like a fancy one.

321
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,370
Yeah. You know, he's got a good one. Is
Ralph's good sausage, breakfast sausage.

322
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:24,330
They have it.
It's the kind that they make there.

323
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,440
I got it for you a while
back and I really liked it.

324
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,750
I'm going to try Jeffrey Dean Morgan
Sausage soon. Yeah. I want to try it

325
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,450
and I think the want to a
little 12 ounce package,

326
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,810
the feet or five people and I'm not going
to buy two of those 12 and where you

327
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,710
go because you won't bounce out
and charges thing and got damn pri.

328
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,430
He's real upset. Well look, if you
love your Jeffrey Dean sausages,

329
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,100
Morgan Jeopardy, Morgan sauces so much,
then pay the extra few bucks. Right? Yeah,

330
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,240
I agree. If you're hooked on the
flavors, you've got to evolve, dude,

331
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,250
but what is sure like you to go back
to your 16 ounce package on your record

332
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,370
often cause I'm not going
to buy it otherwise. Yeah.

333
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,910
I'll just have my own damn fault mate.
Like I used to years ago.

334
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,620
It's not tasty as yours yet,
but it'll work.

335
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,220
Okay. Yeah, man, it's quite a threat.

336
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,480
Do you think the people at Jeffrey
Dean Morgan Morgan were like,

337
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,330
we got to go back to doing
it because it is fun. Maybe.

338
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,420
Maybe they heard this one
message and they're like,
all right, I've got to be it.

339
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,600
I always wonder that when people
are leaving a message like that,

340
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,730
can you think they're going to say,
oh,

341
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,390
fucking Roger said the change our size.
Well,

342
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:39,440
if enough Rogers I guess leave
messages. Yeah, that's true. Critical,

343
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,580
critical mass.

344
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,460
No, no. 12 map. Goddamn roller.

345
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Call your brother and me and
you kind of found the man.

346
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,030
At least you get my point,

347
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,653
right.

348
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,620
I put it in that fucking pussy
role with ball throwing up a bitch.

349
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,370
Somebody need their ass kicked by Middle
Consumer Geek. Lord. Fuck this shit up.

350
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,450
Whoa. I like that. He
actually thought it was,

351
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,900
yeah, it was a good thing. Yeah. And then
he lost it at the end. Cause I like the,

352
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,580
the severity of it for him.

353
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,840
Like it was a real problem with this
guy had to take to the phone line.

354
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,480
Hold on. What's up? Hold on.
All right, we're back. Um,

355
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,510
no. I know the severity
of, of making that call,

356
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,820
it really bothers him so much that
he has to find the number and call.

357
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,820
I don't think I've ever done that
for like a product I really enjoyed.

358
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,510
I just take it. I'm like, oh, they changed
it. Oh well I guess they changed it.

359
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,200
People Change. People
Change. April changes, little
changes all the time. Yeah.

360
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:39,600
Right. When did you just kind of
roll with the change? Of course.

361
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,850
I don't know if I'd take to the phones.
Oh my Lord. How about wait, what does he,

362
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,400
he ends on this.
Let's see if we can get even more mad.

363
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,080
Z money. Save money. Save money.
Fuck, I'm gonna eat. Got Dennis.

364
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,490
Wow. Fuck. I'm gonna eat God damn it.

365
00:24:56,491 --> 00:25:00,090
See how it is interesting.
Don't you think that when you do,

366
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,010
when your message changes to that,

367
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,260
then they just probably
disregard your message? Well,

368
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:05,280
probably listening to his message.

369
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,530
Right? And he's like fucking pussies.
There you go. Then you lose credibility.

370
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,100
I think so.

371
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,760
Now what I've learned about white people
complaining what you do when you're

372
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:14,001
like,

373
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,570
it's spas are a nice hotels and you've
taught me this cause I used to go the

374
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:21,080
angry route and sometimes it does work.
Yeah,

375
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,550
but you've taught me that the
wider you go, the way you complain,

376
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,870
the more respect you get.

377
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,380
Well, here's what it's
about. I learned this too,

378
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:31,870
and I learned this from
doing it the other way.

379
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:37,230
You basically have to complain to the
people you're complaining about in the way

380
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,550
that they respond to Barry Go. So if
you're in a high end place, right,

381
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:46,480
you have to complain the way a high end,
like the way they would respond to them,

382
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,160
which means you have to keep your
composure. You can't curse, can't,

383
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,860
you can't get all ad,
they're not going to respond.

384
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,600
What they respond to in like a nice
hotel or a nice restaurant is if you

385
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,940
complain about you,
you tell them,

386
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm really disappointed in
my experience and here's why.

387
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:08,480
And you lay it out for them, then they,
that's the language of that world. Yeah.

388
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,160
So they reply, they can understand
that if you're, I dunno,

389
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,690
maybe on a shooting range
and fucking Arkansas, right.

390
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,210
I Dunno if doing that that way would
maybe there you got to be like,

391
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,320
I just fucking bullshit

392
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,890
man. And then, yeah. And
that's, that makes sense. Yeah.

393
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,710
But the people at Jeff Jeffrey,
Dean Morgan,

394
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,160
I don't know if they'd respond
to that. Yeah, I dunno. I Dunno.

395
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,560
That's a good, that's a good question.
But it is like people respond to their,

396
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,453
their language.

397
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,690
Yeah, that's true. Sometimes
they don't respond to enough.

398
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,780
Like I remember at the time we were
in Dr and the, I forget what they,

399
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,010
what did they done all, we went on some
thing and they promised it was going to

400
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,820
be great and it was terrible.
Yeah.

401
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,070
I feel like we had been robbed of a day
of our vacation cause they are like take

402
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:54,710
this tour and they ended up throwing
us on a bus. It was horrible. It was,

403
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,620
the whole thing was disappointed.
And I told the guy, I like, hey man,

404
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,890
you stole a day of our vacation.
Like you're,

405
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,350
you're supposed to vouch for this thing
being a good thing. And it was not,

406
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,070
and he was starting to blow me off. Okay,
well too bad. And I was like, no, no, no,

407
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:12,540
not too bad. You fucked up my vacation.
Yeah. And I used fucking everything.

408
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:16,770
And then we got some free massage and
that was the time that I worked together.

409
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:20,360
A lot of line. That's what Dominican's
respond to. You spoke their language.

410
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:20,880
There you go.

411
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,950
And that's the same place that they had
porno in every room on channel six, nine

412
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,400
hardcore pornography.
That place.

413
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,520
Yeah, but not, sorry, not every room
had it cause the dad boners the pool.

414
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,560
I saw it for a second. It was like
kind of came in and out and I was like,

415
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:44,790
we have it all the time.
He was like, what we did.

416
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,440
It was so ridiculous. It's crazy. Ooh,
Ooh. Speaking of, um, just went out.

417
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,680
You said complaints or how white people
complain you yesterday where the Oscars

418
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:59,240
the ultimate grant and last year,
you know,

419
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,960
Oscar's so white was trending.

420
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,250
It was a big thing about not having
people of color nominated. Oh yeah.

421
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,720
I remember this year, uh, not
only were there black winners,

422
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:15,090
a black bummer won best picture.
That's usually a white category.

423
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,710
Bummer of the year. And this
year was a black bummer. Well,

424
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,490
all black cast to be able to be fair.
Well,

425
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,640
no, no. Now it's different.

426
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,130
They did a team votes,

427
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,870
but I'm saying that it used to be not
only obviously what white people mostly

428
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:41,110
nominated,
all the academy members were mostly older.

429
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:45,180
And so now we switched out the academy
members of the academy. People of color.

430
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,014
Yeah.
So it's,

431
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,060
it's more diverse and a black
bummer is a rare category.

432
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,100
Won Best Picture. Moonlight. We have
it. By the way. We should watch.

433
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:01,060
I won't watch it. I want to see
it. Not because it's a bummer.

434
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,970
I can't,
I can't,

435
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,040
I don't want to see over white bummers.

436
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,830
I'd like to see that black
men were like this. I don't,

437
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,220
that guy's a really good actor too. I
like if he's on, he's on a house of farts.

438
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,450
He won
best actor.

439
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,473
He's got a

440
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,820
gay black came in. Like what it's
like to, this is what I've heard.

441
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,720
A gay black in inner city, Miami. Slu.

442
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,220
Or it's like in a place where like
that shit's not celebrate it like the,

443
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:46,600
you know,
the struggle of that.

444
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,920
Okay. What era? Eighties you say? No,
I didn't say era. Um, I don't know.

445
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,920
I think it's contemporary. Yeah,
no. Yeah, I think so. Well,
Miami, you're saying, yeah,

446
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,070
it takes place in Miami.
No,

447
00:29:56,071 --> 00:30:00,970
you were saying that in Miami they teach
them how to give blow jobs. I'm sorry,

448
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,820
I didn't, where'd she saying this?
That The may have sex much earlier.

449
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,110
They do the Puerto Rican.
Yes.

450
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,170
Well just the children,
but no, I have, you know,

451
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,900
I grew up a couple of hours. I say this
people lot of times or like you said,

452
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,410
you grew up in like all these
places. Yeah, I grew up in
a bunch of places. Yeah,

453
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,190
you moved around a lot.
When I,

454
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,630
I lived for a few years at most of what
my high school years were in a few hours

455
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:29,020
north of Miami and I've,
you know,

456
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:33,610
some friends from down there and lived
down there and they said they were overly

457
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,500
sexualized at a much younger age
because culturally it was just more,

458
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,620
hey mommy.
Yeah,

459
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:43,880
it's a super Latin hypersexual
hypersexual culture.

460
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,170
It is hypersexual. Yeah. I mean I remember
the Latin influenced, to be honest.

461
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,330
That's Latin. Well that's Puerto Rico.
I'll tell you why. Not just, well,

462
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,410
some of it because when I went, we went
to Puerto Rico member. We were, yeah,

463
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,930
we just wanted to cruise the manikins
by the way, are way more sway.

464
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,670
Way over sexy. Yes. But
in Puerto Rico I was like,

465
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,270
remember we docked and I was like,
I'm finally here. It's my motherland.

466
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:06,380
And I was so excited to finally,
yes, soak in my culture.

467
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:07,920
My people and I,

468
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,720
we went to like just the souvenir shops
right off the boat. Docking area. Yeah.

469
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,350
And every towel was like
naked chick naked guy.

470
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,200
Guy Handshake on top of each other.
Like super sexual culture.

471
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,240
Hypersexual

472
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,090
yeah.
I'll tell you this in a,

473
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:30,180
I talked to a former pro baseball player
and he said this is an open secret

474
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,240
baseball. Baseball has a huge
Latin professor. Dominican's right.

475
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,070
Has a huge Latin population.
Okay.

476
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,360
The Dominican's specifically
within major league baseball,

477
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,200
like the pro baseball league
in America. Yeah. They,

478
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,350
he said 99% of the time shower separately
from the rest of the players and it's,

479
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,740
it is a regular practice.

480
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,060
It is known amongst major league
players that you don't shower with the

481
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:00,800
Dominican,
the Dominican shower by themselves.

482
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:05,801
And the reason is because they
get overtly sexual to the point.

483
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:11,171
But like it's cool to like each other
but like Dick's lat but Dick's labs where

484
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:14,780
they think it's normal,
nobody else does.

485
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,880
And my knee slapping their dicks against
each other's ass and he said it's 100%

486
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,823
uh,

487
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:25,870
accepted thing and they know
that those guys aren't gay,

488
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:31,010
but nobody else is cool with their
shower behavior. So they let them,

489
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,060
they said that he said
like they all shower set.

490
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,190
This is like a guy who went into detail
about it. Yeah. And uh, you know,

491
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:39,960
I don't want to say his name,
but he, me, he was in the,

492
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,510
in the League for 10 seasons or you know,
and he played on a few different teams.

493
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:48,620
Is that every team the same way? The are
showering everybody else showers. Hey.

494
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,260
Yeah.

495
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,160
So at least they know what they like, you
know, resection come all over my face.

496
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,080
That is so funny. Yeah. So we
are, so my point being though,

497
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,880
if Miami is so open sexually,
I'm wondering why this boy,

498
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,773
the story of,

499
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,330
well, the story
specifically, kind of like,

500
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,490
I believe it's like a of
maybe like liberty city
really intersect like hardcore

501
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,740
Gotcha. Black, right, right,
right. Where you know,

502
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,980
it's a homophobic, yeah. More homophobic,

503
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:24,450
less accepted that to be like a
young gay black guy. So I mean,

504
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:28,380
but look, it just won best
picture, best supporting actor,

505
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,020
best original screenplay or
best adapted black bomber.

506
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,020
Best Black Bummer of the year.

507
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,370
I am glad that La la land didn't,
it did not win just because, well,

508
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,550
I hate musicals. I know. I
fucking hate him. And My, I was,

509
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,910
I wanted to see that movie and
12 seconds of the movie, right?

510
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:48,730
The plane yesterday, right?
Oh, you did. And it opens,

511
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,080
uh, at a traffic jam and a car
is like on, um, what's it called?

512
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,020
One of those, you know, where they
a moving shot where it's like,

513
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:01,100
it's going past all the cars and it stops
at this one car with his girl, like, ah,

514
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
over it,

515
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,720
uh, traffic, uh, La Orange.
The Cameron, she's like,

516
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,640
there is something happening now.

517
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,470
And she gets out of the car and
a musical starts and I go exit.

518
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,220
That's how much I want and I won't
watch it. I have no interest. Yeah.

519
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,480
Now here's the thing. You know how much I
love my Ryan Gosling? Yeah, he's in that.

520
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,890
I love him. And I love Emma. What's
her tits at? What's her name?

521
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:28,860
Emma Watson. Emma. Emma, Emma,

522
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,400
whatever. I really like her. She won.
Oh she did? She won. She's fantastic.

523
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:37,360
And I like the two of them together
and I won't go see the movie because I,

524
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:42,361
the the people singing a dialogue
to me it is not appealing.

525
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,120
I fuck it. It makes me crazy
to watch musicals. Yeah.

526
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,200
The only music movie I like is the
muppets. The muppet movie. Yeah.

527
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,110
The Rainbow Connection Song. You
know, that's cause it's the muppets.

528
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,130
I have no tolerance. Um,
can I so fucking boring.

529
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,630
I liked cats growing up. My mom took me to
see cats. Did you ever see that one? No.

530
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,400
Well that's cause they're all
in cat outfits and they're
pretending and cat. Oh,

531
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,970
it's fucking boring too. God
term it. That is boring. I don't,

532
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,690
I'm just not into them. I'm not,
I'm not cultured that way either.

533
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,840
My parents forced me to a lot.
Yeah. Like Swan, Swan Lake.

534
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,370
That's fucking boring too.
I don't want to see any of them right now,

535
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,930
but we have to pretend
that we're cultured people.

536
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:27,400
We have to take our son to
pretend like where culture.
Don't wait. No, no, no, no, no,

537
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,580
no. My parents did. No, no,
no, no. There Europeans.

538
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:33,310
I had to like learn all hold was like,
do you really want to go

539
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,850
kind of furrow brow?
You sure you want to go to that?

540
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,280
You want to go to a Laker game?
Maybe it was more fun.

541
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,290
We got to teach him that this stuff
exists. Right. I mean well your job. Yeah,

542
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,620
but I'll be like, I'll put a DVD or you'd
be like, doesn't that look terrible?

543
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,820
I'll try to encourage that
thought, you know? Um,

544
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,960
cause it is hard for a kid to watch that.

545
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,040
My parents used to take me
and I was so bored. Oh yeah.

546
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,440
He went every year to see the nutcracker
and I fucking hated it. I don't want,

547
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,050
I still don't want to sit through it and
I don't want, to me, it's fucking boring.

548
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm not a ballet fan.
I want to do this before I forget.

549
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,470
I have some added dates,
June. So let me pull this up.

550
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,290
Back. Hurts really

551
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,313
doesn't feel good.

552
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,240
I have some big added shows coming up,

553
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,640
so I figured I would let you know.
I'm going to,

Um, Foxwoods comedy club,

557
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:57,820

met the Fox was theater, um,

So who gives a shit? Can you
plug this in? It's fucking dying.

595
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,760
My batteries messed up on my iPhone.
It keeps the, the charge doesn't keep,

596
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,670
oh, listen to that to deep, Bro. Uh,

597
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,540
last week I interviewed an
actual nonbinary person. They,

598
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,720
they called in, it's their
name was Freddy. Yeah.

599
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,410
And we talked about that. It's
super cool. It's a fun show.

600
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,520
I did actually. Yeah, I did.
I did something right now.

601
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,390
Oh fuck.

602
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,340
It's hard to be fresh if you don't
have money or I can still pull it off.

603
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,310
You don't got no salads.
You Laos,

604
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,060
that's what's up. You understand that
you don't got no sauce, then you're lost.

605
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,570
But you also get lost in the
sauce. You can get, well,

606
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,620
how you get lost in the sauce bitch,
bitch you to get lost in the south.

607
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,510
I know you said,
man,

608
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,170
I don't,
I lost it

609
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,500
most breaking this out. Drop
it sounds right. Right, right.

610
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,370
Oh, but those, the sauce.

611
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,040
Okay.

612
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,590
No meat. Just so when you're born,
can you be born with sauce or do you

613
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,060
okay.

614
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,200
It's sauce.
You get the sauce season

615
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,280
out of the south quad is though.

616
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,550
So you know what's going on there.
No,

617
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:43,910
but I think it's my favorite conversation
I've ever heard. Pretty Great.

618
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,380
I love that guy so much. Who He is? No,
you don't know who that is. No clue.

619
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:53,300
But I like him a lot. His Gucci Mane.
Gucci Mane. Now that's before he, uh,

620
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,450
he lost a bunch of weight. I don't know
if you saw that. No, I didn't. Yeah,

621
00:40:56,451 --> 00:41:00,020
that's an old clip. He's, um, he looks
way different now. You will see. Yeah,

622
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:03,200
I like to see, okay. The Gucci
Mane. When does he sing? I guy.

623
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,380
Was he saying he sings? Um,
God bless America and uh,

624
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,470
but what's the song I would know because
I know you like Gucci Mane. 100%.

625
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,880
How dare you? I'm very
cool. I'm a Midwestern mom.

626
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,180
Let me show you. Moms
know everything. Cool.

627
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,970
So this is him right now.
Right here. Oh, he looks great.

628
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,860
Yeah. Okay. He's such good teeth. Yeah.
Damn. Look at those teeth are perfect.

629
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,100
He lost a bunch of weight. He's great. No

630
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:39,080
prison. I went to a program that'll
do it, but he's actually in the end.

631
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:43,030
He got, he got like off
the lane. Yeah. He, um,

632
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,980
so this is kind of like when
that video was, you know,

633
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,730
he's definitely chubbier he's got us,
he put too much sauce on stuff.

634
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,080
That's a problem. Yeah. And
then there's weight loss.
Yeah. Here's free prison. Okay.

635
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,310
So yeah,
he's a little filled out.

636
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:59,540
His face filled that filled out
and then out of prison. Wow.

637
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:03,020
Lots of prison diet. It looks good son. It
looks good. It looks good. This is good.

638
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,310
He looks great. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking
trap God doing this thing. Yeah.

639
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:11,990
I mean you could see like damn dude,
you got to go to prison.

640
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,880
I don't know if you have to, but yeah,
it definitely worked for him. His um,

641
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,150
Dan, he's definitely got it for
him. I liked the sauce. Yeah.

642
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,380
I wish I could, I'd have to listen
to that and really break it down to,

643
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,630
well that's what we do on premise.

644
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,180
And then in philosophy you have your
premise and then you're a and B's prep,

645
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,350
prep, prep positions, propositions.
So this is him syllogism Graham.

646
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,560
See, right. Always looks
good. Like he likes his,

647
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:47,090
uh, he likes his clothes. This
is lady. They're getting married.

648
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,110
No Shit. She stuck with them
when they, when he was in
prison. That's a real bitch.

649
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,500
There you go. I think that's what he
would say to. Yeah. Oh, she's cute. Yeah,

650
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,690
they look good. They look good together.
Yeah. What do you know her name? Uh,

651
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:04,550
I forgot it. I don't remember.
Yeah, I don't remember her
name. But I like it. Dude.

652
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,620
I like this guy. You like
Gucci? Ah, he loves the falcons.

653
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,690
I liked that she was ride or die like
that. Him and his girl. What's his name?

654
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,350
Kesha. Okay. Yeah.

655
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,350
Yeah. And they look cute. Yeah, they're
good couple. They are men. They remind me.

656
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,790
A lot of us now I'm not going to find
out that he like beats her song. Right?

657
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,730
I don't know that shit. What
was he in jail for? Oh No,

658
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:35,400
it was like weapons. Drugs. Yeah. Okay.

659
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,870
As long as it handle like
parole violations. Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,550
Well, yeah. So please, God dammit.

661
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,490
Just to have some flat. Now
let me have yours. I like yours

662
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,740
because yours tastes better.

663
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,270
It's Felicia. You understand what kind
of, what's going on there? It's sauce,

664
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,260
mean coolness.
Well,

665
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:11,000
I think you know better way to say it
would probably be the confidence spice,

666
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,170
right? Right. Confidence. Like he's
like, you're not born with that shit.

667
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:19,820
Like life has to season you a
little bit. Yeah, I agree with that.

668
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,080
Yeah.
Some kids are balling your quotes,

669
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,030
so how you can be born with seasoning.

670
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,710
It definitely saved.

671
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,470
No me just hours before
with sauce or do you

672
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,760
look so different now?
Now that you pointed that out?

673
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,220
I would not recognize that dude, if you
show me that picture before. No, no, no.

674
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,880
It looks so much better now. Way
Better. He's also like, like I said,

675
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:06,150
he's kind of off of like
every night smoking blunts,

676
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:10,630
drinking because his face is puffy from
all that I was getting fucked up and

677
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:14,610
it's probably not sleep well. Yeah.

678
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:18,500
I think he lost like 60 or
80 pounds, dude. Damn. Okay.

679
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,380
Now do you think black people
go nuts for black bomber movies?

680
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,420
White people that go nuts for all bummer
movies. Oh, that's interesting question.

681
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,310
Yeah. I really wonder is that
a good deal too? Who's the,

682
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,270
who's the audience besides white
people that really dig bummer?

683
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,090
I guess all people love a good
bummer, you know, to a degree. I mean,

684
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,870
I think that crosses all,
all races.

685
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,030
Not like to be bummed out at the movies.
Some people,

686
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,780
I mean that's just the type of person.
Regardless. You're right in that it's,

687
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,420
I feel like you do see a lot of
white people celebrating the bumper.

688
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,840
Generally the industry made
of white people who love
to applaud the bummer movie

689
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:07,890
as opposed to the like the Rob Reiner
film. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

690
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,870
Or I'm upset.

691
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:14,871
I get bummed out that we don't see a
comedy celebrated amongst ever best

692
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:20,460
screenplay. I mean a few, I guess I've
been screenplays, but best picture,

693
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,370
best actors, they never give them to a
comedic performances. And the part that,

694
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,090
that upsets me the most about that,
and I know it's been said before,

695
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:28,620
but it's very true,

696
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,040
is that a lot of times these iconic
comedic performances can only be done by

697
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:37,950
that one person.
Whereas the dramatic role,

698
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,230
there's like 10 guys that
could play that role.

699
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,080
There's 10 girls that could play that,
that dramatic role.

700
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,530
But how many people can play
Eddie Murphy in fucking movie?

701
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,860
Uh, what, what is it where
he plays all the characters,

702
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:56,580
but no one else can do that. Why
isn't that celebrated? Huge talent,

703
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,070
Jim Carrey in basically anything.

704
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,010
It's just nowhere else could do that.

705
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,730
Pet detective is one of the funniest
fucking movies. I loved that movie.

706
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,200
It is one of the only one of the funniest
movies and no one else could play that

707
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:11,940
role, but it could come close. Yeah,

708
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,310
and if you were to suggest that he get an
award for that, it wouldn't be like, oh,

709
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:16,144
you're fucking,

710
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:21,210
if you put him in a movie where he
has cancer and dies and he said, oh,

711
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,860
let's give it up fucking award.
Like the gave,

712
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,210
they nominated Bill Murray
for lost in translation,

713
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,980
which is a great movie and a great role,
but I think you could

714
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,570
nominate him for 10 other roles.

715
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:35,040
I think it comes down to the people
don't have respect for comics,

716
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,790
the whole thing and they don't realize
like ups are like the clowns of the

717
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:42,550
entertainment where the dog should
have of the entertainment world,

718
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,520
but we're also then fucking
marine corps of entertainment.

719
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,200
We're fucking writing it
hardcore traveling alone. Yes.

720
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,780
Motherfuckers soon as you see like
an Improv show or a play please.

721
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,440
Or even like acts where
there's two people on stage,

722
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,580
you have somebody else about
like you're not up there alone.

723
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,100
When you're alone, it's a totally
different thing. A guitar. Yeah.

724
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:09,130
Now they're like praying. It's something
that you can kind of put off. Oh yeah.

725
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,940
All of what's going on on. It's like it's
all of a sudden you have support, right.

726
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,050
I have this thing that
can play as you're doing.

727
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:19,120
It's not that it's not a skill
or a talent because it is,

728
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,540
but when you're alone with a microphone,
it's way more.

729
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,470
You're way more vulnerable. You're
way more vulnerable. It's all on you.

730
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:27,880
You can't blame anybody.
Yeah.

731
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,800
It is the fucking Marine
Corps of of entertainment
and we don't get the respect.

732
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:36,910
And by the way, a comedy actor can do
a serious role, but not vice versa.

733
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,800
Not necessarily.
Not necessarily.

734
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:41,650
It's very hard for us
serious actor to do comedy.

735
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:45,040
Now there's like your
deniros who can get away.

736
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:49,800
I think de Niro's funny is any like in
meet the Fockers and the parents and the,

737
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,340
I mean,
I think part of that is it,

738
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:53,980
that material is really
good at that particular one.

739
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,790
I don't think he's actually a funny guy.
I think he's a good actor. Yeah. Yeah,

740
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:59,560
you're right. You're right.
Maybe he's not so funny.

741
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:04,180
I'm trying to think of WHO's like
bright who can do both. I mean,

742
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:07,590
I know, I know Jim Carrey did man on
the moon. Remember when he can do both?

743
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,190
He did. Kaufman? Yeah. Robin Williams.
Mays. Yes. He was great at doing both,

744
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:16,750
actually. Dramatic actor. Eddie Murphy
is actually really, really good. He,

745
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,560
I think he did get nominated when
he played that dramatic role in the,

746
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,530
what was the,
it was like about Mo town or something.

747
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:28,590
He played a part in that
that got nominated for
something so fucking talented

748
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,150
date Kilis music and shit. You know,
he made his money and he had a family

749
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,260
last year,
but it was a more serious drama.

750
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,480
He's fucking talent. That guy,
God dammit. Yeah. Like Jamie Foxx.

751
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:48,580
He won an Oscar for playing
a serious role though.

752
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,810
Only serious give it to you for
comedic role, which is so silly.

753
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,900
I don't understand this.
Yeah, I'm surprised.

754
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:58,960
You know what white bomber didn't make
it did. Maybe it did. I just don't,

755
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,220
I didn't pay attention was the
one that we saw the arrival,

756
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,070
the one in the future and the alien
thing I got nominated. Oh yeah.

757
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,680
How's it going? One? Yeah.
Let's see. That was a good one.

758
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:17,020
Yeah. That's not what not a dis
drops tomorrow, right? Yeah.

759
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:20,830
What are you talking about? When does
this episode drought? Next week? No,

760
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,340
tomorrow night. Oh, so we can
still talk about Oscar Shit. We've,

761
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,430
we've been talking about Oscars.

762
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,340
Do we keep talking about it or are people
going to be sick of this by the time

763
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,530
this drops? That's what I'm
thinking. But I mean, we've, we're,

764
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,640
we're already into it.
Okay. Right? Yeah, I know.

765
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,620
Gosh. It just awesome.
How am I hateful? I just

766
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,940
what, what, what are you talking? Yeah,

767
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,520
we're going out for a romantic getaway
tomorrow night. Uh, arrival was nominated.

768
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:52,800
Oh, that's good. Yeah. Not bummer. He
enough though? Yeah. They had death in it,

769
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:57,420
but not enough. It was her
cancer, um, that she, oh,

770
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,970
but she didn't get it. She didn't get
a nomination for that role though,

771
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,310
for a rival. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah. And that girl's name
is Emma Stone. Emma Stone.

772
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,840
Yeah. She's great. I liked her on
sesame street too. She did balance.

773
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:11,040
That was her thing was cute.

774
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,200
That's the letter of the day.
It's a letter.

775
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,600
It's a letter is the letter of the day.
Hello?

776
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,130
She means new album.
I would love if he did sesame street.

777
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,290
He probably will. I can't
wait. You probably will. Yeah.

778
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,700
I wish they would have us on sesame
street. That would be like the dream.

779
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,910
They're like now from your mom's house,
podcasts,

780
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,470
everybody pull your
jeans up and then we met.

781
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,630
We liked Grover's fart
and then that's our scene.

782
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,140
You think it'd be a fun thing
to do? F is her fart. Yeah.

783
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,130
They totally would let us.
I don't think they would.

784
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,340
Maybe we put the call out there.
There's a fan that works on sesame street.

785
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,970
Let us know. I would love to do
sesame street. Are you kidding?

786
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,390
I don't give a fuck about anything,
but I would love to do sesame street.

787
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,230
Sesame Street would be amazing cause shit
probably have a little bit of a window

788
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:08,030
where it could happen in where like your
son can still see it. Ah, it's so cool.

789
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:11,490
Could you imagine your five years wash?
Oh,

790
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:18,830
it's easy. You like, hey
guys. Yeah, that's right.

791
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,970
The word of the day. Yeah. Wanting
to the word of the day. Yeah.

792
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,810
I want to the word of the
day. I like it all. I love.

793
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,850
I want to count something with account.
Have you rad?

794
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,180
Because we're talking about today. Have
account is like, Oh gee, sesame street.

795
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,580
Yeah. I love the count. I
love snuffle up a guess.

796
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:41,780
Um Oh. But Oscar the grouch by far is
the funniest character on sesame street.

797
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:46,190
He should so funny. He tells kids to
Scram all the time. It's the best. Great.

798
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,270
Now scram scram. So funny. That's great.

799
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,860
And he's always making people miserable.
Yeah. Sorry, we're having too much fun.

800
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:55,990
Is too high.

801
00:52:55,991 --> 00:53:00,910
Porosity of about 40 to 45% as a
response to the high water content of the

802
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,550
shales from here to here,

803
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:06,730
the neutron curve falls back
to about 30 ferocity units.

804
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,830
While the density curve remains at about
16% indicating relatively less shale,

805
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,370
there's owners interpreted it to
be a silky shale, possibly align.

806
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,740
Aisha says really boring.

807
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,890
The same body is indicated at
a depth of 12000% even a human.

808
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:26,820
The look at in the gamma ray
reading shit, Kamara. Yes,

809
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,040
that's a no,
it's bad.

810
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:33,630
There's not even a person put interval
of porosity is shown at the top where the

811
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:37,440
porosity curbs average about 23% for us.
What it felt like by the way,

812
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:39,820
for being just below roll marathon bed.
Yeah.

813
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:44,610
I mean several groups exhibit a marked
reversal and I see these people follow

814
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:47,280
this right now that's a
following or chemistry.

815
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:50,310
I took chemistry for like
a week in high school.

816
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,800
This is what chemistry sounded like to me.
Yeah,

817
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,640
I you understand any of that
show? It's so bad. God Damn. Hey,

818
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,390
Sagar wrote in about sink holes
where you read it. Yeah. Did you,

819
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,230
I texted it to you. It's on your phone.
My phone's dead. Um, sinkholes is a,

820
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:09,550
it's a real deal, dude. We
got into it last week and, um,

821
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,930
Holy Shit. You know what, just came
out over the news right now. Hmm?

822
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,800
That Elan Musk? Yeah.
Space x Tesla CEO. Yeah.

823
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:19,160
You're going to send to tourists
to the moon next year. Wow.

824
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:23,480
Oh yeah. Cool. I definitely would
not want that first ride. Would you

825
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:28,500
fuck that? Fuck No. But, um, I think
it would be fun to hear the, um, the,

826
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,570
the moon landing deniers.
Crazy ladder as people start talking more.

827
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,030
Yeah.
So that's a letter of the British guy.

828
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,190
So Adam wrote in hygiene
on the topic of sinkholes.

829
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,460
My house is half a mile from one
here in Michigan at swallowed up,

830
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,070
it opened up last month
and swallowed a house.

831
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,290
Repairs will take two years with
the major road closed and the entire

832
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:54,480
neighborhood smells like sewage every day.

833
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,770
Air Day. Yeah. Every day I'm
hustling. Horrible, horrible,

834
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,580
horrible. Has Real people. Yeah. And
there's nothing. You can do nothing.

835
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:04,800
And it comes out of the blue.
It's not like there's an alarm,

836
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:09,420
you can't call the uh, the city and
be like, I demand the earth opened up.

837
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,050
Do we have, um, insurance for that?
Like, is that part of your house?

838
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:15,510
Insurance is sinkhole insurance?
Good question.

839
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,980
But I want to put that one in here.
That one out. Yeah. Now, let's see here.

840
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:24,510
What did we not cover? Constipation
equals farts equals double pipe. Classic.

841
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,900
You're fart story.
Let's see.

842
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:31,190
I tried giving myself diarrhea
check. Oh, I didn't also,

843
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,980
I've got a story. Go ahead. Well,

844
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:37,910
this weekend I should say I was in
Canadia and I had a great time. Um,

845
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,670
I was in Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver,

846
00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:45,430
and in Calgary I hung
out with your old buddy

847
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,830
from road rules,
Shane Jane,

848
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,830
his lovely wife, Christie. And um,

849
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:55,420
there a sister in law and I had a
great time there. And then Vancouver,

850
00:55:55,421 --> 00:56:00,220
Vancouver was bananas, um, at
the, at the vogue. And you know,

851
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:02,320
one of the things it was,
it was so cool. It was like,

852
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,710
there's all the over a
thousand people there and,

853
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,590
and then they're coming up to me and
they're telling me how much fun they have.

854
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:11,890
But they're also saying that like
they watched a, they're like,

855
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,650
I'm watching the lighting guy,
the sound guy,

856
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,690
and seeing like how everybody kind of
works together and they're other tweeting

857
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,600
me that they are enjoying that. And I
was like, ah. They're like, you know,

858
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,040
those are as much of a

859
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,820
part of the show is Tom. Yeah.
Like even Tom, he's out there,

860
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:32,620
but he's just one element of what's going
on. It's such a, it's such a cool thing,

861
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,490
you know, that like everybody
was just like, ah, man,

862
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:41,260
this whole shows such an awesome,
neat thing and I just love, you know,

863
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:45,490
it was just love all the components
because really those guys are just as

864
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:50,470
important as time, if not
more. And without those guys,
there's no you, you know?

865
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,790
Yeah. And I'm just so thankful for the
lighting guys and those great, you know,

866
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:59,040
they're the real stars Tom, not you.
Even the guys that load in, you know,

867
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,750
they're just so important.
Yeah.

868
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:06,490
The guys a clean up after and even
like when I get off and they don't say

869
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:09,730
anything to me about the
show, I still go, wow,

870
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:14,560
you're so cool and important. Can I tell
you what that is? I feel like Garth,

871
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,570
that whole thing of like they're just
as there are the stars too. Like no,

872
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,010
they're not. No, they're not.

873
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:22,870
And here's why I'm not saying
that they're not important.

874
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,510
Not Everybody wants to be at the front
of the line or in front of the audience.

875
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:32,200
Some people enjoy being behind
the scenes and that's okay.

876
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:34,900
And that's what they want.
They assume people assume that,

877
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,480
that that guy looked at assumes
everyone wants to be out. Right.

878
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:42,660
He's assuming that he is better than
them and he's trying to elevate them so

879
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:45,940
that he doesn't look like a
Turd, but it's like, dude,

880
00:57:45,941 --> 00:57:48,880
maybe they want to be behind
maybe the fucking phony.

881
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,860
Maybe the lighting guy doesn't
want people watching him. Yeah.

882
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,340
If you thought of that,
like that's probably,

883
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:57,370
and of course they know they're
good at their job. I was doing it.

884
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:01,800
I was in Edmonton as the same time
as him. Oh my God. Did you know it?

885
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,700
I was done.
I sent him a tweet.

886
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,053
Um,

887
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,290
he did nine Rogers arena show bananas.

888
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,460
So he sold bananas hundred
and 80,000 tickets.

889
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,010
So you know how crazy that was to them.
So you know,

890
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:21,160
if you go to like for
instance, staple center, uh,

891
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:26,110
and you look on the ceiling,
they have banners of championships.

892
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:30,940
So it'll say that, you know, the 2002
Lakers, NBA world champions. Right.

893
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,190
So in, in Edmonton, at Rogers
arena, they have Oilers,

894
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:39,910
you know, Yemen snorers my dad liked
them. So I remember what hockey has,

895
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:44,050
championship banners. Right.
They added while he was there,

896
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,500
a Garth Brooks banner that says nine
sold out shows bananas with G J circle.

897
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:51,730
Yeah.

898
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:56,230
G and t G. Yeah. You know
what, and it happened while I
was there. I feel like that,

899
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,740
you know, well, you, you and I are the
Garth and Trisha of podcasting, TNC,

900
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:05,580
the comedy world, the TNC.
TNC. Yeah. Love Tea, love,

901
00:59:05,581 --> 00:59:10,350
see love g and t and now it's
Tennessee. Welcome to a studio G. Yeah.

902
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:16,140
Happen pretty goes happy birthday
to g two G two g his alter ego.

903
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,550
Yeah, Trish. Really? I think he starts,
he should start paying attention to Trish.

904
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,430
Oh, packed on the pounds and a really
short time. Oh well no, not that we did.

905
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:29,120
We all don't at some time, but I
think she, it happened fairly quickly.

906
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:34,040
So I'm wondering if Tricia's okay, maybe
she's depressed or sick or like what's,

907
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,120
what's going on?

908
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,520
I need some answers and if you guys could
ask him on the next studio jeans, Hey,

909
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:45,140
what's up with her weight gain?
Why is Trish so fat guys?

910
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:49,430
What's going on? And she's a pretty
looking girl. She's pretty, pretty wise.

911
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,700
Trousseau fat was just fat.

912
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,400
How can Chris looks like
bird phrase it that way.

913
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,090
Portray she is a very beautiful woman.

914
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:02,960
I just don't know what's going
on with her when, when I um,

915
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:09,130
I just want to thank the
grips and the lighting crabby.

916
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,840
Bert,
Bert.

917
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,760
Gee,
I'm going to start doing that now.

918
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:23,070
A lot of people tweeted me his
alter ego when he did that and I,

919
01:00:23,071 --> 01:00:27,350
and we've already covered that on your
show. Them. Chris Gaines, it says, yeah,

920
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:29,660
see that's the mental
illness I'm talking about.

921
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:33,420
That's the neat,

922
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,070
but that, that's what I'm talking
about. That, that weird, you know,

923
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:40,970
maybe you know what,

924
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,440
maybe it's just the pressure
of the country audience
that you have to be down to

925
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,430
earth and real.
I am,

926
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,230
because I learned this
listening to country music.

927
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,810
People talk about it before,
like, I forget where it was from,

928
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:57,320
but Dolly Parton's is kind like she'll
let people sleep in her backyard and

929
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,830
stuff just so that she's not
seen as as me. That's a big deal.

930
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:05,150
And that and the country community, if
you're seen as uppity or mean or snobby,

931
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,620
forget it.
Your career is dead.

932
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:10,400
That's why this guy has got to be like
5 million tickets. Soul. Thank you.

933
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:14,870
This is because he is because
you, you made me, you like,
he's like please fucking,

934
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,320
you know, don't let, don't let my asshole
personality come out. Cause if it does,

935
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:21,110
I'm screwed. Like if I'm going to
fucking Douche bag, it's out. It's over.

936
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,900
So I think he's really making
a plate to these fools.

937
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,480
Have you seen that? There's
a video of him. I found, um,

938
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,720
I think it was on Twitter where
he's like 5 million tickets sold.

939
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:37,470
It's all because of you guys. You
did this. Thank you so much. Um,

940
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,460
let's lie. You do videos. Why
aren't you thinking you're fan?

941
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,850
You should count the tickets
and then thank him profusely.

942
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:48,020
It every you guys did well, I
already told him like, you know,

943
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:52,190
I know that they love all the whole show.
Every aspect is so exciting.

944
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:56,200
I wish you would start
bringing your manager on your
social media and your eight

945
01:01:56,201 --> 01:01:59,870
and as my agent, he books all this stuff.
Agent genes is coming over. That's right.

946
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:02,540
He is. Maybe I'll do a video
with him. That's right. Yeah.

947
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,400
Well he's my agent to now know. So we
got to thank him so much. So I got,

948
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,230
I got an email, somebody wrote
in, they said, what the fuck?

949
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:17,270
Why do you keep saying amaze and excite
instead of amazing and exciting and I

950
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:18,170
guess you know,

951
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,440
this is probably a newer listener
realize that Kim and Kim Man,

952
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:31,170
yeah,
she is the reason that we do that.

953
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:32,820
And and uh,
in,

954
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,540
in this old video we played
were interviewed her,

955
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:37,920
she spoke like that.

956
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:42,921
What is amazing is amazing and
she has a very bizarre cadence.

957
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,150
Someone's sending a new video,

958
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:50,390
what is may her and I had gentlemen
wait long hod how'd you say Goc yeah,

959
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:00,390

want to hear it? I can't play video. Mom,

960
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:04,110
do you want to hear, I'm curious to see
what she's up to. How is our grandma,

961
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,390
she was on 60 minutes.

962
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:11,700
60 plus it's 60 press. No, it's not.

963
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,240
No,

964
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,370
Sweet little grandma and command.

965
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,530
No. You can see it on
your monitor. The shot.

01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,470
I'll try to help. I'll help
for this year. Yeah, go ahead.

967
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,950
A car hit that spot.

968
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,520
I like to share with you six.

969
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,600
Why did she say it like that?

970
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,950
I like to share with you ancient sex.

971
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:50,110

the head. Yes, yes, yes, yes,

973
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:59,600

Canine, we make fun of her.

974
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,170
This bitch, his body is better
than a lot of 20 year old girls.

975
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:07,230
I see now he's in shape.
She looks amazing and she's like,

976
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,260
she's getting fucked by a Willdabeast
right now and she's taking it,

977
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,470
take it and she's a real strong
performer. Let's talk performa. Yeah,

978
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,510
baby. Always fun. Hot.

979
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,040
Fuck hard.
Aren't we

980
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,753
six?

981
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,860
She said, I don't want
you to ejaculate. Oh Gee.

982
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:50,690
She's telling him to keep it in.
Okay, sure. That's a thing. I guess

983
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,910
don't stop.
Come

984
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,220
music is so specific.

985
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,700
I guess they have like one guy.
Yeah. One guy who does all the music.

986
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:11,180
Yeah. I don't think that
they know that for our show.

987
01:05:11,181 --> 01:05:15,830
We prefer them to do it without the music.
Can you guys Redo this trailer?

988
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:20,170
I'm glad to see that man's working
again. I didn't know she stopped. Yeah,

989
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:24,850
we just haven't seen her work lately,
but I'm really excited about that.

990
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:29,380
It is exciting. It is exciting. It
is amaze. Yeah. This guy was like,

991
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:33,910
what the fuck is that? Why do you say
it like that? We don't say it that way.

992
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:36,310
It's not our fault. It's
[inaudible] fault. Yeah.

993
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:41,260
And what we do it aren't
we? Um, I have a dad boner.

994
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,250
Oh yes. Crossing a bridge.
That's all I know about this.

995
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:48,670
I haven't seen him so excited. I love
these so much. Right. Here we go.

996
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,520
I'm going over the new bridge. Whoa.
Waiting for this for over three years.

997
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,970
Oh really? Oh, super excited.

998
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,080
Not the sound so sweet. I
know. It's drive over a bridge.

999
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,940
Did this guys stoked about a bridge?
Three years. That's a long time. Yeah.

1000
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:11,270
Scheduling rubber. Why? Here we go.

1001
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:13,303
Here we go.

1002
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,003
Okay.

1003
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,560
Darko.
Oh my God.

1004
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:29,843
Wow.

1005
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,020
Okay.

1006
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:35,750
Oh yeah. I was going to be
doing a dream now. Oh yeah.

1007
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,630
Seems like it might be mocking
someone who does this. No,

1008
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:43,340
that sounded real
legitimate. God, maybe he

1009
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:47,500
did you do it again? I don't even think
about what to do it again. Not Sweet.

1010
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,720
Awesome.
Oh yeah.

1011
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,980
Oh, I mean this is obviously the guys
doesn't have a lot going on in his life.

1012
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,540
Is that the only factor?

1013
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,510
But that's a real dad word is sweet.
That's like jam.

1014
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:13,950
I don't think I'll ever get this excited
about, uh, driving over a bridge.

1015
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,780
Now they're seeing a fucking solstice
or whatever. You know what I mean?

1016
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:23,910
These guys are out of their
minds. You mean, uh, a solar
eclipse, whatever it was.

1017
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:24,943
Yeah.

1018
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:31,110
I mean he must be a bridge and Susie
asked much like the train enthusiast,

1019
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,190
that guy was really out of his mind.
I go super stoked about that. Yeah.

1020
01:07:35,191 --> 01:07:39,360
I posted a video. Right. I could like
the train. Yeah, I know the foamer. Yeah.

1021
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,020
And Bunch of people were like,
well where'd you find this?

1022
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,940
One guy was like, am I crazy? Is this
guy actually sound like you? You know,

1023
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:52,020
cause I did it through my voice.
A little bit of screen.

1024
01:07:52,021 --> 01:07:54,600
Can't believe that people didn't know.
Oh yeah,

1025
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,770
maybe this guy has been like involved in
the building of the bridge or something.

1026
01:07:58,771 --> 01:07:59,220
I don't know.

1027
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,820
Maybe maybe just been watching it for
three years being constructed and,

1028
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,610
but I mean would you would be
that excited to drive on it?

1029
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,090
You saw that being constructed.
I Dunno. Wearing Canada,

1030
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,800
come on. I don't know where
in Canada this guy lives.

1031
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:15,630
Maybe it's a real remote part

1032
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:22,040
that's for a bridge driving on a bridge.

1033
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,310
That's a lot of rural parts of Canada,
you know.

1034
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:34,040
Well obviously the,

1035
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,020
the Dad Boehner level of excite is off
the charts there and dad boners being

1036
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:41,930
excited as something that we really
have been excited about here.

1037
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,670
So we had blow blue band throw
together blow band. That could be,

1038
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:50,780
it could be his born name below band
threw together a super cut of dad.

1039
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:55,700
Boners excited. I'm excited
about this. Here we go.

1040
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:07,653
Yes.

1041
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,220
Oh
God.

1042
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,660
Along
here.

1043
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:46,960
Oh my God. No. Stuck at the prominences.

1044
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:55,270
That's a three.
You gotta be kidding me.

1045
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:09,050
Let's blast myself.
We came up here.

1046
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,610
We've been slipping along.

1047
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,193
Huge battle.

1048
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,090
That was outstanding. Thank you. That
was amazing. God, I was so good. I guess.

1049
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:24,500
You know, it does feel good to take
here. Dad. Boners get that excited.

1050
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:28,780
It does, right? I mean it's nice. It
lifts your spirits, lifted my spirit.

1051
01:10:28,781 --> 01:10:32,360
You know what I think it is?
It is childlike enthusiasm.

1052
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,870
And the thing that's rare about that
is that you're seeing it in adult.

1053
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:39,020
Most adults don't ever have that low.

1054
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:44,021
And that's the nice part about the charm
of our show is we celebrate all things

1055
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,120
childlike. The burping, we also
market, but we also celebrate it.

1056
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:53,820
Yes, yes, we, we mocked the
burping. Well, we mocked the,

1057
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:57,920
the excitement and one that we want to
make them insecure and never do it again.

1058
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,710
But we also are taking a
moment to say it's nice.

1059
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,050
We also want to strip them of their joy.

1060
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,550
I genuinely get a thrill from Dad Boehner,
study by the pussy,

1061
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:12,620
a period stuff. Then you say
something about that before the show.

1062
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,130
Yeah.
So I was

1063
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,010
telling you the other day
about these period panties,

1064
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:22,011
you can buy that you don't have to wear
a Tampon or a pad and you just put on

1065
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:27,320
these panties and they absorb all the
blood, like you free ball on your period.

1066
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,540
How do you feel about that? Well, I
think, I feel like it's a fucking nasty.

1067
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,810
It sounds NASA was shit, throw away your
underwear, you know, it's when I'm away.

1068
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:37,740
So I guess the premise is these
panties can absorb all the blood. Yeah.

1069
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:42,330
Like two tampons worth. And then you
just wash the panties. But they're like,

1070
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:45,490
do you just throw the panties and
you're washing and your washer is not,

1071
01:11:45,491 --> 01:11:48,210
and that's what I'm asking. Nasty.
Like, you know what else you could do?

1072
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,350
You could wear nothing.
No.

1073
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,583
Hi.

1074
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:03,070
So why don't you explain what we're
seeing? I don't want no, it's a lady doing

1075
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:04,780
ah,

1076
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,380
on her period. Nothing. No.

1077
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:09,960
She's wearing white wearing
white white yoga pants.

1078
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:14,940
And her period is just floating out
really good at Yoga. Really fit.

1079
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,560
Yeah.
So she's just letting her,

1080
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:23,040
her blood. Yeah. Go everywhere
on the white pants. Yeah.

1081
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,790
Well her whole thing is like,
why should I feel bad about that?

1082
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,540
You shouldn't feel bad, but you should.
It's just a hygiene. I think it's a,

1083
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:33,220
it's unhygienic to just,
Oh,

1084
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,753
oh

1085
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,830
yeah, yeah. Mm hmm.

1086
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,760
I think it kind of ruined the
mood in here for a moment.

1087
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,630
Yeah, definitely. Made
me uncomfortable. Well,

1088
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,180
the thing is, it is, it is natural.
Yeah. And it shouldn't be ashamed of it.

1089
01:12:57,181 --> 01:13:00,300
It's a whatever. Yeah. But
I do think you should, uh,

1090
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,780
try to be hygienic about it.
That's just,

1091
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:06,990
probably doesn't feel very good either
to just have your blood kind of,

1092
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,830
you just sitting in your blood, you
know? Sure. That doesn't feel good.

1093
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,180
But that's my concern with these
panties is like, do it anyways.

1094
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:17,100
I ordered a pair today,
just so you know,

1095
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,310
I'm gonna give it a whirl
and I will let you know.

1096
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:24,420
I'll report back to everybody on these
panties. I just don't see how it can feel.

1097
01:13:24,421 --> 01:13:28,500
Okay. To sit in your own blood. They
swear it. They swear that you can,

1098
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,020
you can do it. She did it. She did
it. She did it for like a feminist,

1099
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:38,250
you know? Right. To make a point. Yes.
Yeah. There shouldn't be no shame. Right.

1100
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:40,260
Which I don't think there should be.
No,

1101
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:43,620
it's just blood coming out
of your blessing. Plus he's
bleeding right now. Ducks.

1102
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:48,810
Um, Cheryl sage, excuse me,

1103
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:51,630
sage. I rock. I see the
blood come in and say, right,

1104
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,690
what?
Oh sorry.

1105
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,750
I would say that to you. Yeah, but you
have seen everything come out of my pussy.

1106
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:04,980
That's true. But I would tell you if
you were laying around and I saw that,

1107
01:14:04,981 --> 01:14:05,950
I'd be like,
do you know your pussies?

1108
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:12,250
I'd want somebody to tell me you don't
want to bleed out on everybody's stuff.

1109
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,910
You know? Um, I remember I never
forget this one. I gave birth to Ellis.

1110
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:20,230
My favorite moment is I was like, hey
babe, what it looked like and you go,

1111
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,030
well the head,

1112
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,350
I saw the head and then Ellis came out
and then like a bunch of shit came out

1113
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:28,990
after.
That's true.

1114
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:34,330
But that's how he said it and then like
a bunch of shit and I'm just like, what?

1115
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,110
All kinds of fluid and stuff
came in. It was fine. Right.

1116
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:43,840
You don't care. I know you
don't care. I don't care either.

1117
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,510
I just think it's funny that
you called it a bunch of shit.

1118
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,650
I don't know who else to call it.

1119
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,170
It looked like somebody just opened like
a sewage line, just emptied out a hotel.

1120
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:58,680
I wish you would go to like a lamaze
class and lecture to all the man.

1121
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:02,380
Shit's going to come out of her post,
but don't be weirded out by it.

1122
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:07,860
But it's okay because the baby comes to
and then baby yours and you can do what

1123
01:15:08,741 --> 01:15:11,930
you want. He can marry your
mom. You remember we, uh,

1124
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:16,210
maybe later when he turns 18, Waa,
remember when we played the, this lady,

1125
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:25,200
she's on Lincolnton Lincoln dead.
Yeah.

1126
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:26,860
This is Sharice off Morgan.

1127
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:31,360
And I want to make a video to all these
guys that set up a linkedin profile just

1128
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:34,910
to look at my linkedin because
they have no followers or I dunno,

1129
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,690
they're just use linkedin
to spy on people.

1130
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:40,810
Sometimes I will accept,
um,

1131
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,840
request on linkedin because it seems
like maybe a good business connection for

1132
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:47,440
my work, my writing, my books.

1133
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:52,230
And then every once in a while some guy
at Luther guy will come along and think

1134
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,420
that he can ask me out.
Linked in is not a dating APP.

1135
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:57,280
Your losers stuff per queue.

1136
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,270
Don't use linkedin to connect with
him and then asked me to travel.

1137
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:09,070
Do you for date at this guy that said he
was going to be in palm springs and may

1138
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,970
wanted to know if I wanted to come up
there and meet him for some hikes and

1139
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:17,920
stuff. He was being nice, but a woman
does not travel to a man on a date,

1140
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:18,660
so fuck you.

1141
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,950
That's right. That's what's up. She's
right about that. Maybe John, maybe.

1142
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:26,760
I wonder what made him think to ask you,

1143
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:29,650
what date is it be that maybe
one of your videos is low?

1144
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,640
I have come all over my face.
Maybe that's the one, but again,

1145
01:16:35,641 --> 01:16:37,830
it's evidence that
Linkedin is not helpful.

1146
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,180
Linkedin is not helpful unless you're,
you know

1147
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:48,690
someone, someone else. Lincoln.
Dan is not for everybody.

1148
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,740
Fuck Lincoln.
Fugly tickling like that one.

1149
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:55,980
Why I don't like him.
I don't like what he does that I like him,

1150
01:16:55,981 --> 01:16:57,930
but I don't like when he does that.
Gross.

1151
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:01,980
What is your problem with
him and the Vegan Vagina guy?
It just, it's too creeps.

1152
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:03,780
It seems like you're all worked up.
I'm not

1153
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:10,130
the 34 rectifier,
which in my opinion,

1154
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,160
possibly the best rectifier over
put into a early a guitar amplifier.

1155
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,640
And I'm going to explain why a first off
the filament current through the heater

1156
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:27,770
filament is only 1.9 amps.
That's for an ampere rex.

1157
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:32,210
I assume that's the way it
is for all of them. Um, I

1158
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,530
didn't that cleanse the palate
of the thing you didn't like,

1159
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:38,750
don't you feel recently
actually erased my memory. Yeah.

1160
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,630
I just got focused on how fucking bored I
worry this was, yeah, that's neat. Yeah.

1161
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,630
Hmm. Well, people can't do that
and I just did that for you.

1162
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,560
Can I tell you what I like about you?
Yeah.

1163
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,390
This morning I learned how
to make for Tatas. Yeah.

1164
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:56,400
And I this a second time I made you
for Tata this morning and you get,

1165
01:17:56,401 --> 01:18:01,350
you are so into it. You liked it so
much that you lost your ability to hear.

1166
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,120
Yeah, I do that. Yeah.

1167
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,110
And a little jeans and I were talking
and laughing and we're like, right dad.

1168
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:12,240
And you were just like, if I like it,
yeah. To now like what I'm eating,

1169
01:18:12,241 --> 01:18:16,470
I tune out. Yeah. If I'm reading,
forget it. Oh, I know that one. Yeah.

1170
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,630
I can't hear a thing. Yeah.
If I read something, it's
over. If I eat and it's good.

1171
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,100
It was a really good, you won't even hear
that's true too. But what's going on?

1172
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:28,020
Focus level of focus.
Right.

1173
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:32,700
I'm so focused on the thing that
I'm doing are enjoying that.

1174
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:35,010
I don't hear anything else.
Yeah. You like that time,

1175
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,650
like a million years ago at my house,
you were frying bacon.

1176
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,960
I'm going to cut in and
talk to you because you were
too busy frying your bacon.

1177
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:44,010
That's why you use that expression.
No frying Bacon and Bacon.

1178
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:49,200
But I didn't know it was. I didn't, yeah,
I didn't know that it applied to eating.

1179
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,930
Yeah. Oh yeah. Definitely
applies to eating. So,

1180
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,420
but this means that the last
12 years have shared meals.

1181
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:59,580
You've likely not been listening to me
talk at all. No. Only as part of the time.

1182
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,610
Right? Part of the time. Okay.

1183
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:06,540
Because how often is the food that good
like that for Todd? It was so good. Yeah.

1184
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:11,190
That I always distracted, but you can
hear me if the food's like okay. Right.

1185
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:16,490
Okay. The worst the food, the more
I'm listening. Exactly. Yeah. Huh.

1186
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:20,880
We to go to like Shakey's
for dinner then shaky knees.

1187
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,640
You know I'm this hairdresser
that works with Allen.

1188
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:28,500
It was his 40th birthday when I was there
and he had it at Shakey's the one in

1189
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:32,610
Hollywood because apparently they'll put
your name up on the Shakey's billboard.

1190
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,000
Who looks over at me or him.
Who are who?

1191
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:39,690
Alan Guy that turned 40 oh the
guy that turned 40 it looks older.

1192
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,720
Yeah. Wow. Well I, I, I
asked you that question.

1193
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,580
I asked you that in an
a text the other day,

1194
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:48,960
cause you looked 40 when you were 30
so do people think that you look 50 now

1195
01:19:48,961 --> 01:19:52,980
that you're almost 40 yes,
I get into the forties for sure.

1196
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,210
Yeah. It's really nice. How
old do people think you are?

1197
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:02,370
I mean the most extreme that I've
heard is like 45 bullshit. Yeah. Dude,

1198
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:06,030
you don't look 45 but I think
people see the gray in the beard.

1199
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,893
I'm telling you that the,

1200
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:12,250
the beard being gray ages you about she
shaved her Sheila closer look closer.

1201
01:20:12,251 --> 01:20:15,600
No. Will you buy a box of Nice
and easy not going to do it? No.

1202
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:18,960
Like my stepfather would do is just
trim the Beardmore which I'm doing on

1203
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:22,200
Wednesday. It's too, it's
too thick. Alan will fix now.

1204
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,150
I told you my step father used to buy the,

1205
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:29,230
the jet black nice and easy and then he
would do his beard and the eyebrows and

1206
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:33,240
the hair and he was
about 50 like jet black,

1207
01:20:33,241 --> 01:20:37,500
Indian and he was an Indian guy. Sure. I
look really good. How good does it look?

1208
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:42,350
You can't go jet black, but
I think you should try. Yeah.

1209
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,170
Will you try jet black?
I will not try Jaguar.

1210
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:51,780
I wouldn't even make this totally.
If I would just ask him to,

1211
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,790
you know, sprinkle in color. I wouldn't
even do, not that I'm doing it.

1212
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:01,340
If I were doing it, I would do
a modest version. I like it.

1213
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,620
I like your silver whiskers.
I just love them.

1214
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,920
I like your silver bear look so verbatim.

1215
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,620
You know what else he
did with the Frittata,

1216
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:13,170
which really made me realize
what a savage you are,

1217
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,960
is that you like a bear.

1218
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,280
They've ever seen bears eating a honey
hive and there's all the bees swarming

1219
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:23,940
around the hive a bear.
Well,

1220
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:28,800
disregard the bees and keep chomping
on the hive and let the bee sting his

1221
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:33,150
mouth. That's something I've done a
long time. If it tastes good, it's hot.

1222
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:38,250
Keep eating because it tastes
good. Ear through burns. Yeah.

1223
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:41,220
You pushed past the hot,
the heat of the Frittata because it was,

1224
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,360
it was fresh out of the oven.

1225
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:50,460
Piping hot. I had the, Oh yeah, I had
to wait a good 10 minutes. But not you.

1226
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,800
You pushed past the burns.

1227
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,210
The third degree burns on your mouth.
They're appealing right now. Yeah.

1228
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:02,000
I have a skin peels right now.
I've done that so many times.

1229
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:03,023
So

1230
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:12,080
you just let the bee sting
you let them stay. Yeah. Um,

1231
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,550
all right. Genes. We should
wrap it up. All right, gene. Um,

1232
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:20,700
I have a great, thank you so much for
listening. Without you news like you got

1233

This is because of you.

1236

so proud of you guys.

1237
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,380
Love TNC. You post is bleed. No.

1238
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,760
A totality by DJ boy butter.

1239
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:47,740
Do you say boy butter did one
of our great songs recently? Um,

1240
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:52,800
I think he did just like the case. I
think the gays. So this is his new song.

1241
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:57,750
Totality. That's it. Thank you
for listening. Watching the show.

1242
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:58,590

I'm hoping

1245
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,280

for you in a few days. Uh,

1246
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,960
one of the live shows from Irvine.
Alright,

1247
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,600
bye Jean.

1248
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,360
Do you want to see the biggest
dad bought her a favor? Yeah,

1249
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,640
this big huge meadow
Cologne called the hill.
