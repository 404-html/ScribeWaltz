Oh, okay. I see.

123
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,770
Why are you copycatting?
I hired her

124
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,160
first. I came in with a full bottle.
There was already been decided by the way,

125
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,760
by the listeners and viewers of this
show that I'm the water champ. Bullshit.

126
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,720
Yeah. I saw a lot of posts. Nobody
said anything. Everybody said it.

127
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,340
Everybody says if you probably watch
the back episodes of your mom's house,

128
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,360
you'll notice that I drank so much more
water than my husband. I constantly,

129
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,750
I have multiple look multiple
containers next to me.

130
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,650
[inaudible] backup waters.
I point look was in the tiny fridge.

131
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,720

132
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,480

playing your honesty in a fee. Uh,

133
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,140
she questioned my water intake
one down.

134
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,810
It's stupid.
Second one.

135
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,430
That wasn't even yours. That was probably
the Dobbs. Who's that? Blue bands

136
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,260
native. And that's a trick.
That's a stunt water.

137
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,170
You can drill the hole in it
and there's a tube and drinking.

138
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,140
He's was a leader. I drink more
water than you. That's not true.

139
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,920
I sweat more than you. Not True. Not True.

140
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,080
Not True. Not true close.
Yup. I'm the water champion.

141
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,460
There you go. Hi. Bird is fat.

142
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,730
You know what? I bet if you and
I all the hello. Hey everybody.

143
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,000
Everybody says,
everyone says time you drink more water.

144
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,800
I bet if we went to urinate right now,

145
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:24,030
you and me and separate toilets and
look to mind will be clearer. Therefore,

146
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,650
denoting I drink more water than
you. Yours is dark brown. Well,

147
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,780
I bet if we both,
uh,

148
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,160
jumped on a broom and we went for a
flight that we could both see different

149
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,270
things and talk to it makes no sense
because mine is yours. No, it does.

150
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,990
I know this because I hydrate a lot,
but when you drink more water,

151
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:46,470
the clearer your everybody's dupes.
Everybody knows that.

152
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,910
You know that when you're four,

153
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,660
well then you don't know that because
your a is brown. No, it's like coffee,

154
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:55,450
like all the dirty coffee and your
teeth, Matt. Sure. Your liquidity.

155
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,640
You're so rude.
This lady in this video looks like Yo,

156
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,550
I love

157
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,430
[inaudible]

158
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,230
cause the best,

159
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,650
the reaction. Yeah, he's phenomenal.

160
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,030
Now what I love is that we had suck my
pussy, which was the wells Fargo Bank.

161
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,090
Ladies, I'm sorry. Kiss my pussy.

162
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,940
Happy you confuse those and now
suck my pussy on a bloody day.

163
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:36,350
Those are two really exciting,
very ordinary,

164
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,280
extraordinary public versions.
One in a bank

165
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,330
and one on the train. I like
that. I'm on kiss my pussy.

166
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,930
She goes, you beg of America,
you Chinese motherfucker.

167
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,220
Shit. She's the best. The
best part is she goes,

168
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,640
I got $1 million in this bank.
Half a million, half a million,

169
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,720
half a million is motherfucker.
As a matter of fact, we
don't have it queued up.

170
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,630
Why? How can black women are so
good at insults? What is that?

171
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,840
It's gotta be genetic.
I guess.

172
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,430
They're so good at that stuff, man.
They are all of them. Absolutely.

173
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,960
Black woman will crush you anytime
verbally. They're very good. That's true.

174
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,840
I went to public school in La.
I was on. This is not happening.

175
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:34,560
Look up the story in a trawl.
Yeah.

176
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,450
Rosina Johnson. She could spit some
shit like that too. Yeah, that's true.

177
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,130
I don't know man. I don't think maybe
you've experienced it more than I have.

178
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,830
Yeah. You mean black women haven't
yelled at you a lot? Not really.

179
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,450
That's a girl thing about black guys.

180
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,440
You got stories of you yelling black
dude. I've been, I've had some shit.

181
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:58,890
Talk to me for sure.
Public School in Milwaukee,

182
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,530
Florida. There's a lot of shit talking.
Yeah, just this part of the culture.

183
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,460
The best part of living in New York City
is that everything happens in public.

184
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,760
There is no private cause you just,
you have to do everything in public.

185
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,980
There's so many people that you see this
stuff every day. Of course. So good.

186
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,260
Are you finding kiss my pussy?
I think so. We'll see if we can.

187
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,813
We'll see

188
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,050

189
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,340
I got half a million in this motherfucker.

190
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,500
$40.

191
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,110
She's really scary.

192
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,500
I've got these keys on my waist to

193
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,640

194
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,910
Oh my God. Yeah. Suck my pussy
and kiss my pussy. Yeah. Good job.

195
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,170
Good job on a bloody day.

196
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Friday night and be back.
I Want my God.

197
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,820
Yeah,

198
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,220

Chinese mother fuckers.

200
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,230
None of it makes sense

201
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,010
up to the people in line that I got.

202
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,650
Why don't you love if this was
a commercial for Wells Fargo?

203
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,720
This would be the best
commercials all the time. No,

204
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,250
it would be like kiss my pussy.
He Chinese motherfuckers.

205
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Wells Fargo Kissing your pussy since
1946 US Chinese mother fuckers aren't

206
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,320

207
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,630
The stage coach slash gear plus the on

208

210
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,210
let's see. Chinese motherfucker.
Racist fucking kid. Wow.

211
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,570
That's the part people pick up on, Huh?
Yeah. Out of that whole thing. Yup.

212
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,420
The Chinese part. Huh? This
is wrong. Recording vertical.

213
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,300
Good. That's really fantastic. Yeah.

214
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,430
This is a real work of art too. I
like this. Yeah. And there's more.

215
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:15,900
Let's see what else. Let's see.
Yeah. Everything else is building up.

216
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,700
Building up to that.
Yeah.

217
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,993
Okay.

218
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,900
Yeah. This shit so terrifying. Every
time I hear black girls yelling,

219
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:39,100
it brings me right back to
Portola junior high school.

220
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,670
Like I feel you got hired. Starts in
palpitate a little. You got jumped.

221
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,910
I got Jack a few times.
Yeah. Really? Oh yeah.

222
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,493
Structure.

223
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,760
They laugh their ass off because there's
screaming back and forth and she goes,

224
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:10,770
you know what? I'm not even going to
argue with Ya. So everybody laughs.

225
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,190
That's what I understand is
happening. Right. They're like, what?

226
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,260
Yeah.

227
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,260
[inaudible]

228
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,610
[inaudible]

229
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,150
fucking so great. Now that the science of
this one, this happens to you in public,

230
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,210
is that you can't look like if you
notice nobody's doing the holy shit,

231
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,940
like you have to kind of subtly be like,
Oh shit.

232
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,690
Oh Shit. That's the hardest
part of witnessing something
like that. Remember our,

233
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,990
our buddy we're having dinner was saying
if you've watched the public thing and

234
00:18:57,991 --> 00:18:58,824
they were all like,

235
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,530
he was at work.
All right.

236
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,550
I have so many things happen in a day now.
I wake up too early in the morning.

237
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,550
No know there's so much
to cover right now.

238
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,390
I know what you're talking about and he
was like, we were all like staring at,

239
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,000
you can't look when, when cool.
Should have. It's like that.

240
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,600
That's the Harvard of life.
I ain't even talking about it.

241
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,190
I don't know where you want to start
with because there's so much to go. Much.

242
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,280
I guess we could even go to last week.
I'm sorry to do this,

243
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:38,910
but I have to urinate because I drank
so much water. I'm sorry. I got to pee.

244
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,710
I'm going to take, if I do, I'll take
a picture and show you how clear it is.

245
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,980
I don't take it. No, I'm being
serious. I really do have to urinate.

246
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:48,090
We just took so long getting
ready. Just hit pause. I'll
be right back. No, come on.

247
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,450
I swear to God I have to
pee anyway. I just paid.

248
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:58,460
Would you like to see it? No, I don't.
Just look how light the color is. No,

249
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,950
I'm serious.
Just take note and how white the color,

250
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,640
but I'm just showing you how much
more I hydrated. Let me say it.

251
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,870
Okay, let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready.

252
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,570
So I
just got to drink more.

253
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,273
You're the worst

254
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,530
last week. One of the best Persian
phone calls ever. The best actually.

255
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Or um, Sallie. May

256
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,000
mother fuckers
hope the boss.

257
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,760
Oh my God. Oh my God. For one month.
I mean it's some very, very up to

258
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,353
do.

259
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,130
Hmm. My friends Sleigh, um, sent me this.

260
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,160
He was listening to the Persian

261
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,920
is the time. You're right.
This is the best one.

262
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,560
She said.
Bolds do.

263
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,580
Said she is cussing a lot in Farsi
and it's explicit for an old lady.

264
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,470
So what she's saying is Salamay I
follow this, this block and Dennis,

265
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,400
he wrote question marks.
Yeah. Mother fucker. Thief.

266
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,760
That's what dose is,
I think.

267
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,510
And then close ghost case means slut,

268
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,450
but it's literal translation
is pussy stretcher.

269
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,500
So sees this motherfucker thief
pussy stretcher for one month,

270
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:30,430
since February has been stealing
motherfucker, I have a magazine,

271
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:32,050
I will give it to you.
Hold on to it.

272
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,910
The magazine has a list of attorneys
and real estate. So many attorneys,

273
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,290
you look fine,

274
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,190
an attorney interview one
for $150 and then get them.

275
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,480
But you need to look over the
attorney early, get so expensive. Uh,

276
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,490
those means thief. Ah, doors. Doors.

277
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah.
Salamay

278
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,060
uh, although I, as I recall,

279
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:05,590
she mentioned something
about Fry's electronics and
a video camera a while back.

280
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,980
Right. I may have heard her
say that Burke Chrysler's fat,

281
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,370
I'm not sure by the way.
She says in there,

282
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,790
in the beginning of that trickster Hogo
buzz or I don't know how to say it. Uh,

283
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,840
and God goes literal meaning his sister
fucker used as a very bad insult and

284
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:27,580
those a lot was just a thief.
So she goes off, you know,

285
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,950
wow, it's so amazing that seller
May, and the saga containment though,

286
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,780
we never call her back.

287
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,350
We try calling her back and we got her
voicemail and which was just meow, meow,

288
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:41,730
meow. And then when did this latest one
comes out? This one came a yesterday. Yes.

289
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:42,350
Yesterday.

290
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,360
So yesterday a new one came in.
Yeah.

291
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,900
From your mama ain't got time. You
call calling. I was at home depot.

292
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,390
We just had a phone call.
Yeah, a telephone call.

293
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,840
[inaudible] got home depot family talk
to the cause you telephone took Jason.

294
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,450
Why?
It's so funny how you,

295
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,560
um, other speakers, other
language speakers do that.

296
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:14,670
Like they'll throw in an occasional word
so that you feel like you kind of know

297
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:18,150
what's going on and occasional
what English one English
word that you understand

298
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,710
or like why would I talk
to you soon in English? Oh.

299
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,240
And I say that and you're a
little bit assimilated, right?

300
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,450
I'm just going to home depot.
You

301
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,990
both live here now. Kind of
thrown in some stuff, you know?

302
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,430
Can I talk to you soon? But yeah,
so the solid, now don't forget,

303
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,880
we called her back and it went to
voicemail. Yeah, yeah. Crazy. Yeah,

304
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,530
she's crazy.
But there's still,

305
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,190
there's still never ever interaction

306
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,660
back from south that we know of now. We've
tried calling her back to be like, hey,

307
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,220
we're getting these voicemails and I
just wanted to tell the reason I have

308
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,600
Solomon.
Well that's what you wanted to say.

309
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,390
What do you want to tell her? I
think Tommy's a guy, but I was okay,

310
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,610
fine. I'll have him. He's, he's in the
garage right now. What do you want?

311
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,243
What will you give me?

312
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,930
Like Richard Simmons, I want to do a
hostage situation. That's terrifying.

313
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,000
So I think tells me she will
not tolerate very upset.

314
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,440
She come over here. No
Way. Settlement, no way.

315
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,370
Soloman. Anyways, it
continues. The saga continues.

316
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,430
The Solow Mason never run
out of solid ways. No.

317
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,470
Very interesting.
In the non binary community,

318
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:46,610
apparently Dj dad mouth has been really
impacting legislation because nonbinary

319
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,580
is now a recognized gender
in Oregon and good work.

320
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,780
I also thank you,
first of all,

321
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,910
this is a personal victory.

322
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:04,911
I consider it for myself and for all the
other non-binary binary people in the

323
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,143
community,

324
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,740
people,
um,

325
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,710
that we've been wanting
to be recognized as such.

326
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,580
And if I'm going to,
if I could say so myself,

327
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:21,581
I'm happy to be recognized as probably

328
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,740
and binary. I'm proud to come
out as polyamorous than now.

329
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:29,080
I'm excited to share that
I'm bisexual and nonbinding.

330
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,460
I'm excited to share it.
Well,

331
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:37,380
I'm a little offended personally
because what about us? Astral genders,

332
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,040
you know what I mean? It's coming. Look,
it's going to be a long fight. Okay.

333
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,510
Just the fact that there are recognizing
some gender fluidity is what I'm happy

334
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:49,320
about.
That's the whole victory here.

335
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,470
But what about a,
I'm nonbinary.

336
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,070
My pronouns are not optional.
They them motherfucker. Yeah.

337
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,300
It's in my profile to my Twitter profile.

338
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,900
You have to be they them cause you
put it in parentheses, they them.

339
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,400
That's what you're supposed to
do. What? I'm binary. Well, okay,

340
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,080
you didn't know that I, I kind of
did. Yeah. I try not to know it.

341
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,880
Trying not to, trying not to
know, just too much information

342
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,970
in my head. Don't you think there's
only so much room in here? Yeah,

343
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,820
there's a, there's, there's
not a lot of room, so it's
true. It's tough to remember,

344
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:36,960
but I feel like I want to point
out that it's not a fucking option.

345
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
So if you ever want to talk
to me again or not an option,

346
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,550
they're not optional.

347
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,800
My very part of his video is that
he's wearing like a towel on his head,

348
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:54,970
like what your mom does when she gets
out of the shower, you know? Yeah.

349
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,310
My mother was always naked
as we discussed earlier,

350
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:02,960
and she'd come out of the shower and
she had these big Ol fucking milk tits,

351
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:07,610
like those deck, that cal thing. We,
Eric last week, you know, and has,

352
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:08,421
she had a Fryer,

353
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:12,470
crotch bright red cooch and she'd
always have her towel on her head.

354
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,330
And I just remember looking
at her body being like, God,

355
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:16,430
I hope I don't have a mom body like that.

356
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,550
And now I'm blessed with the same
exact figure. So that's neat.

357
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,910
I am too blessed to be serious.

358
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,380
I am too blessed to be stressed.
Where is the looking at Daddy?

359
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,000
I was looking at the very distracted.

360
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,990
I know.
Where's the appearance on as Dj Dad Mouth,

361
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:37,320
isn't it? Uh, your mom's
house you to page? Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:41,520
Go down to the unaired up playlists
section. Oh, there's a different section.

363
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,650
Yeah.
Like there should be a

364
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,480
okay

365
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,400
playlists. Yeah. Do you see
one that says I'm here? Yeah.

366
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,530
Yeah. That's where it
goes up there. Oh, okay.

367
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,240
So that's where big announcement is.

368
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,740
So I was looking at when I told
them I was non binary, you know,

369
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,980
I couldn't find a percent,

370
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,010
but it's still that that adds up the
male female binary and then I'm nonbinary

371
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,240
okay.

372
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,880
Well it was a big deal. It's
interesting. This is what,

373
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,090
this is why I don't like that.
She's laughing and you're,

374
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,220
you're bravely coming out.
It's like,

375
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,310
why don't you take his pro not wanting
to take their pronouns seriously?

376
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,100
What got this into Oregon's legislation.
Right.

377
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,250
You know, it's not a joke. It's not
funny. I don't like that. She's laughing.

378
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:30,810
Like I'm a busy guy, man. He said, hey,
announcement. I think announcement,

379
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:34,910
the big announcement, wanting to make
a, is it last year, you know, uh, uh,

380
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,690
I came out as poly and by, and
now I'm proud to say that, uh,

381
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm non binary, you know, there's a big
deal. It's a big deal. So brave of Utah.

382
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,850
They kind of launched the whole thing. I'm
so proud of you. First of all, I guess.

383
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:52,740
Thank you for that. I want to say you're
welcome to everybody in Oregon. You, yeah.

384
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,870
So I don't,
so I don't understand.

385
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:59,360
Do you think it's like now you can take
that off like it's illegal to legal,

386
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,880
gender, male, female,
and now non-binary. Yeah.

387
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,780
Which, you know, all I can
see is that being helpful.

388
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,100
That's the cool thing is that
it's finally, it's like, ah,

389
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,310
thanks for simplifying all our lives,

390
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,340
streamlining everything.
Well also where your man or your woman,

391
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,660
how about neither? Neither. Got It.
Got It. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also too,

392
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:24,210
the other genders now,
I mean there's so many other ones.

393
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:28,380
How come was kicking the door open?
We're excluding the astro genders,

394
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:33,381
the Demi genders and sec trolls
and the right just genders.

395
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:38,520
And horses, gender versus
gender is, but yeah, the dog
genders, the waffle gendered,

396
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,150
right. The, you know, earth
gendered. Yeah. Fairy gender,

397
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,080
whatever. It's a lot out there. I
mean, could there just be a box,

398
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:51,190
here's my preposition to you.
Okay, go ahead. Male, female.

399
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,870
And then just other like
all the other gender can,

400
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,940
I think would have actually what I mean,

401
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,780
probably the best way to write it in and
then that way everybody gets to have,

402
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:03,490
that's true.
I think that

403
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,380
just having the ability to go back and
forth from moment to moment is probably

404
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:12,381
the best solution so that you
could tell them right now in this,

405
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:16,390
but tomorrow I might not be right,
but then I might be again. Right.

406
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,150
And that would be like, okay, now,

407
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,290
now it's easy for us to
process all this information,

408
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,940
data statistics, you know,
we need to know this bureau.

409
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,470
All that would be like, you
know, right. Simplified fluid,

410
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:35,830
more fluid. Understood.
Understood. So anyways, yeah,

411
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,750
I was a proud to be an innovator or
pioneer in this, in this field. Yeah.

412
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,840
And I'm proud of myself. I'm proud
of myself. I'm proud of myself. Yeah.

413
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm so happy. Thank you very much. Um,

414
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,090
am I supposed to bring up,
is, is, uh, is there a video?

415
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,110
Is it blurred out the stuff that I'm not
supposed to show? Yeah, it is. Okay, cool.

416
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,910
Yeah, it's all just audio, but the video
stuff I can pull down. Screams. Oh,

417
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:07,320
youtube. Same. Okay, cool.
Oh, there's a whole bunch of
stuff. What is this? A Hitler.

418
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,400
Let me see. Oh God, let's keep
that going. Oh, that's the

419
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,160
Dany X. Oh, Yay.

420
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,680
Some of the Dany Ex, uh, out there.
I know. You guys listen to it.

421
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,610
There's a, they're everywhere. You know,

422
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,180
I didn't know there's
a, um, offended. Yeah.

423
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,870
Look, they're holding it down. Um,

424
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,670
we should also point out that big
news in the business world today.

425
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,170
I don't know if you pay attention to that.

426
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,480
Well,

427
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,590
I pay attention to Twitter and then
we'd been tweeted at it a thousand times

428
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:52,950
today about it, so, oh, so you're
all still, I've been made aware.

429
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah. Okay. Cause normally I bring up our,

430
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,510
uh, new stuff and you're like,
ah, I've, uh, I don't know.

431
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:06,910
Yeah, that's how I am. That wasn't
in Cosmopolitan magazine. Right.

432
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,370
Linkedin is helpful.

433
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,550
Microsoft has purchased,
Linkedin is helpful. I know.

434
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,820
$26 billion.
That is unreal.

435
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:23,530
He 6.2 actually unreal. Did you know
linkedin? Was that helpful? I didn't know,

436
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:27,960
but apparently somebody knew the
truth. Linkedin is helpful. It's not a

437
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,833
right,

438
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,020
I didn't realize that.
I don't need the help

439
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,870
fuck off. You know, you
know, sizing the puppies,

440
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,610
they just use serious videos.
Serious videos like massaging or puppies,

441
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:57,260
fast whole animal husbandry and put a
laugh track in the background. Like, oh,

442
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,930
isn't that funny?
Our laugh track,

443
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,930
he's eating his shit.
Okay,

444
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,960
well that's good for linkedin.
I mean, good luck. Good.

445
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,710
Congratulations to
Lincoln Den. And also, um,

446
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,160
don't invite me to link and
then you lose a fucking loser

447
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,850
loser.
So

448
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,250
it would, it's fucking phenomenal that
that's what happened to Lincoln Den.

449
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,750
Yeah. Wow. Imagine. But again,

450
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:32,350
I think that that also is directly
related to your mom's house. I mean,

451
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:35,500
we've been pushing Lincoln
Den. Yeah. This is,

452
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,760

your mom's house history. Um,

453
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,283

454
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:46,210
we just wanted to congratulate all the
link that helpful linkedin users and

455
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:50,530
especially Joey Diaz. He called
me, um, Saturday and said,

456
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,940
what's with the copy? Right infringement
cock sucker. I go, what? And he goes,

457
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,670
are you playing my video?

458
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:58,990
Yeah.

459
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,220
And I go, yeah, it was kind
of unavoidable. Can talk
about shitting in a tub.

460
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,000
He's like, that's, that's old me. I don't
do that though. I think it would. No,

461
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:09,880
I know. I remember your wife caught you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't do that no more.

462
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,350
I go, well, we couldn't avoid
playing it. Sorry. He was
like, no, it's all good. Yeah.

463
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,410
Yeah. The water would hit my ass. What?
I would just take a shit right there.

464
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,030
But on the log to the toilet,
oh my God.

465
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,950
Do you think that's true? Yes, it's
true. Yes. Yes. Yes. I think so too.

466
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,740
I do think it's true.
I think it's later then.

467
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,533
True.

468
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,550
Oh, dainty. Eric. We had a Damien. Yeah.
He said, oh, I didn't set up correctly.

469
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,980
So what we have here,

470
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,610

Oh, hello. I love you.

482
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,250
Let's recap. This was a, a shout out.

483
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:40,140
This one was an original oh gee to Hitler.

484
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,200
So Heather watches youtube.

485
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:50,850
We've established that and my friends
are on the shrimp scampi boats.

486
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,790
Actually Dany acts. So people
that, some two or fans,

487
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,000
they're turning in Lasagna.

488
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,350
And will you Hitler send a
rescue boat to save them?

489
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,220
I really need your help. I'm
serious. I, yes, of course.

490
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:11,960
I'm going to help your
daily Shrimp Scampi.

491
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,460
Last que te how was going to spend
this afternoon baking my favorite three

492
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,480
pastors and whatnot. That's ancillary.
I will rescuing y'all y'all last time.

493
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,353
Your friends

494
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,980
from the waters of the
shrimp Scampi. See, wow.

495
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,120
I wasn't drawing a bowl of
Muesli when I heard your message

496
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,690
of uh,
accidents and messages.

497
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,730
We have a Irish pub.

498
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,750
Oh my God. Thank God. I've been thinking
about those guys all week. What do,

499
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,980
I don't think a lot is happening in
that clip though. It, it doesn't.

500
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,720
So are the clips in here? Yeah, the
translation like matches up to the clubs.

501
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:55,850
Got You. Okay. Lincoln.

502
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,810
So let's see.
We have man,

503
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,530
last week we play the master
of accents is rarely stumped,

504
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:06,190
but good Lord.
Last week was really a challenge.

505
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,440
Luckily we had Kevin from Ireland.
Shout out to us.

506
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:16,360
Dear mom is shut out from land. Rick
Ireland. Huge fabric. Is it limerick?

507
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,820
Yeah, I dunno. I think, which one is it?

508
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,360
Limerick. L. I. M. E. R.
I. C. K. L. I. M. E. Yeah.

509
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,620
Yeah. Limerick. Okay.

510
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,490
Shut out from limerick. Oh. Hello.

511
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,930
Huge fan of the show. No, read
the whole thing in Irish dear bro.

512
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,840
Not I'll, I'll wait. I'm gonna
wait a second. Uh, he sure. Yeah.

513
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,220
Yeah.

514
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,750
A huge fan of the show in the standup
limerick is a county that borders Kerry

515
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:47,220
and Cork, which is where Gaddy and cure.
I wanted to help Tom with his impression.

516
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,490
He almost has a town that was doing an
awesome job I think with some translation

517
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,650
to what these gentlemen from carrier
are saying. He could nail it down.

518
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,500
I got most of it.
Um,

519
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,930
but this is because I have worked
in many bars here in Ireland.

520
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,080
It was still super hard to understand as
the guy that lives and works in bars in

521
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:11,820
Ireland from there. Is He, is he
a native? Yeah, he has trouble.

522
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,270
Oh boy. You're goes, all right,
let's see what we have here.

523
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,880
This was so fun. I actually,
it was amazing. Yeah. This
one was one of the hardest.

524
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,480
And what does [inaudible] mean to you?
Does it mean to play?

525
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,370
Because I ended up doing
with the last two years.

526
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,763
Okay.

527
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,100
He says, what does the a
relocation relocate of the pub mean

528
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,590
to you? And he says, God,

529
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,500
it means a pint because
I haven't had a drink.

530
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,500
Would lash two years,
which means,

531
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,430
cause I have not had a drink for the
last two years. Oh, bullshit. Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,500
Well that's his job. Yeah. Oh,
okay. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't,

533
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,230
I can't tell humor and thick.

534
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,180
Yeah, that means a player because I
ended up doing with the last two years.

535
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,380
How about a drink the last two years ago?

536
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,780
Are they, they're almost
depressing, right?

537
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,710
Almost like the Blues Traveler Guy.
Dude.

538
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,550
He is the best. Isn't that Joe? That's
the guy from the blues traveler.

539
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,330
Joe Is something else, man. Most chops.

540
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,820
They are really depressing, right?
Jeans. Oh my God. Yeah, of course.

541
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,550
This is a horrible life.
All you care about it. Yeah.

542
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,770
All right, cool. Well what,
wait, what about the blues
traveler guy is coming up. Oh,

543
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:39,604
okay.

544
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,560
What does it
mean to,

545
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:49,960
we keep up to
[inaudible] [inaudible]

546
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,200
that we have down to dealing with him.

547
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,570
Tangelos done.

548
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,230
[inaudible]

549
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,300
this well Eileen.

550
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,890
Okay. If I was raped though,
I give it a way we, all right.

551
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,820
We actually got a translation.
Oh wait, see this? Alright.

552
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,030
So interviewer asked again, what is the
opening in the pub mean to you? He goes,

553
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,100
well, and this is where it kind
of makes sense for a second.

554
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:40,960
Well it means a lot cause you keep up the
tradition of singing and the music and

555
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,280
everything like that.

556
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,480
So let's get to that real quick about
the tradition of fixing your teeth.

557
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,970
That's it. Not a tradition I adhere
to. So maybe we could start with that.

558
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,280
Cool. Me Too. But it means
we keep up to solution.

559
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,890
We really kill him.
Anything.

560
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,050
Well it means a lot because

561
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,330
so far I got it. I think. Yeah,

562
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,540
I think it just translate it
and I think we've got that.

563
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,390
We got singing and the music and
everything like that. And then he said,

564
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,860
then he put it in parentheses.

565
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,890
This was very hard to understand
something like there's a great dancer.

566
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,600
It was a great dance or darts,
beautiful old dance here,

567
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,610
Jig sets.
Um,

568
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
and then he goes Jig sets and tangos
then something laughs and foxtrots uh,

569
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:43,670
with things. Right. We're, we're
back to square one again. Okay.

570
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:48,440
Let's see if that hearing
that makes sense. Let's see
if that makes sense. Okay,

571
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,783
cool.

572
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Christ Tangelos

573
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,270
uh,
what was,

574
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:16,310
he was ready to give me a little
bag of tea and this letter, Wiley.

575
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,160
Holy Shit. I think he basically got
it. I think he basically got it. Yeah.

576
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,560
I Dunno how you fucking understood that.
But now it makes more sense.

577
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,130
And now for the master of accidents will
appear and give this a shot and listen

578

No,

583
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,490
I'm almost there.
I can't even watch it.

584
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:56,550
You need to be missing teeth to make
the sound good. Now you have any days

585
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,283
building

586
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,403

587
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,600
Yeah.

588

589
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,043
Okay.

590
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:12,920
Okay.

591
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,753
Okay.

592
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,180
Black stuff.

593
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,330
Okay.
Who is he in [inaudible]

594
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,910
every year square. Right. Again,

595
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,280
things are right.
We're back to square one again.

596
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,500
I wasn't even fucking says wasn't. I think
I want to be raped and square way, way,

597
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:42,563
way

598
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,780
back to God. Oof.

599
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,400
That is terrible.

600
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,700
Uh,

601
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,443
all right.

602
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,320
All right.
Really,

603
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,500
it's really that that footage that
doesn't look like a first world country.

604
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:13,430
That could have been Kyrgyzstan.
Yeah. I've been to curious, Dan,

605
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:14,360
that looks like shit.

606
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:18,530
Although sheep and I guess we're not doing
a live podcast and carry kids running

607
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,120
around in eastern bloc and tracks

608
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,040
when we add video.

609
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,280
Yes. Yeah. He translated it.
You Ready? The guy asks him,

610
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:45,020
God dammit, had you missed the pub when
it burnt down, you missed it badly.

611
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,490
I'd say,
and the guy says,

612
00:44:46,491 --> 00:44:50,300
we have where we're after
building up an awful lot of money.

613
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,140
We'll have to spend it now. That's the
biggest job. Now we can, we can spend it.

614
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,220
That's really what it says.
Yeah.

615
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:58,820
I never would have guessed that in a
million course who would have guessed it,

616
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,080
but hey,

617
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,640
burnt on you,
Mr [inaudible] idea.

618
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,670
Gary, have you beat me
up? You had your baby

619
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,570
just to be a week

620
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,863
zombies

621
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,490
and we can spin it.

622
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,080
Wow. I think you should be him for
Halloween. That would be an easy costume,

623
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,070
Joe Kelly.
Yeah,

624
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,150
and you just take a hammer
and not 17 of my teeth out.

625
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:36,210
She's but a scarecrow hat on
some fake mutton chops, man.

626
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,453
Oh,
it's depressing.

627
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,400
Tim. What, what's it like to have the pub

628
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,180
when we go on little one,
when we were able to visit and

629
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,500
I'm coming here, we'll have the news.
Depression. You'll have the crack.

630
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,483
The crack.

631
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,203
Sorry.

632
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,780
So that is, I don't know that we want
to know what they're saying this.

633
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,850
I'll just read it and then back in.
All right.

634
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,830
What's it like to have the pub open? It
sure is. It's great for meeting people.

635
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,380
We'd like, we'd meet, we'd be knowing
when we're out of it and you call it,

636
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:25,080
you have locals all the time coming,
you know the news of the place.

637
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:29,040
You have the crack and you have
the, he really did say it. Yeah.

638
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,590
You have to carry fellows
here and a cork man.

639
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:34,470
They're talking about cork and
Cary county. Gotcha. Um, yeah,

640
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,660
so everyone's thrilled
that the fucking bars open.

641
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:42,330
Yeah. Apparently the big news and
entire documentary bar. Huh. And

642
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:47,260
uh, but thank you so much Kevin
from Ireland for that translation.

643
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,790
It's amazing.
I always,

644
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,090
I've said this to Scottish people
and some Irish people and like,

645
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:56,770
do you realize that your speaking the
language the way it's supposed to be

646
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:57,460
spoken?

647
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,460
Like what I'm saying is actually
the pig fucking version of it.

648
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,550
Where the trailer trash.
Yeah.

649
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:08,050
English language and that I can't
understand that God cause they don't have

650
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:11,590
trouble understanding us. No, we
are the ones who were like wow,

651
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,020
they're speaking it more correctly.
Basically Queens, the Queens, English.

652
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,560
Unbelievable. I can't understand
English speaking people. Um,

653
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:29,110
so, oh, so this is the one to show
you, uh, are dear, dear friend.

654
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,243
Um,

655
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,090
Kim in,
she's back.

656
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,440
She is so bad.

657
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,880
Her how could you not miss her

658
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:46,540
to wait a long PainEase Oh yes.

659
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,560
Am I had to say back then

660
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,253
as hell.

661
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,420
I believe you.
What do you do?

662
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:04,330
Call the rectum to gentlemen,

663
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:09,150
Gentlemen. She um, oh boy. She really,

664
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,200
really goes to work on this one is,

665
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,510
Oh man,

666
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,740
let me just set this up.

667
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,100
Oh,
you're ready for the scene?

668
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,880
This guy is a savage boy,

669
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,920
basically should be playing
tight end in the NFL. And he, uh,

670
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,180
he really,

671
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,420
I didn't think you could say it's fair
to say it gets quite aggressive, right?

672
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,900
I mean. Yup. And, um, she's so old.

673
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,330
I'll forget that smell.

674
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,930
We do the scene.
We always fuck heart our way.

675
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,730
I like to share with you

676
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,530
ancient sex

677
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,490
judge Sachs. Ancient. Oh, I
think she meant to say secrets.

678
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,360
And instead she said
ancient, like, I want you to,

679
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,940
I'm going to show you my
ancient posey here in a second.

680
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:34,950
Rouse been study a lot
about this ancient secrets.

681
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,720
There you go.
Because I know that all of us,

682
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:42,110
our energies feel,

683
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:47,870
and what you need to do is
be mindful about your spine,

684
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,830
especially in the vagina,
your vagina.

685
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,150
That's a port of entry.

686
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,140
So this is what you need to do.

687
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,100
You need to stop judgment

688
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,180
from right or wrong,

689
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,700
and you need to listen
to me to listen to me

690
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,490
super hard.

691
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,250
They don't want you to eat checkers.

692
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,070
You to was that

693
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,610
mean? Yes. Do you think
he knows that Word Babe?

694
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,640
Ejaculate work. I want you to,
when you're a super hard no,

695
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:41,180
Jen command. Oh, did do it to her.

696
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,640
Um, well distracted by a rag to, oh wait,

697
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:47,474
can I ask her name?

698
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,130
You don't need to listen to me. You need
to where you agree. They said to me,

699
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,700
agrees. Okay. Okay. When you
really, really super hard,

700
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,900
you made a baby super high.
Eight until one.

701
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,040
You don't want you to you to hold a home.

702
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,940
There you go. A decade lay, she gets,

703
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,880
I like when she pluralizes
the wrong thing.

704
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,520
D spinals and energy.

705
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,670
Ancient Age and sex.
Okay.

706
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,580
Yeah. A sexy Shane. Shane Sanchez.

707
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,470
Yeah. It should be. I'm a
little different. I should
be ancient sex secrets,

708
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,680
I think. Yeah. Um,

709
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:43,450
but let's get,
is there a audio then over this?

710
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:47,890
It's just the isolations throughout
that conversation. Oh, really? Not the,

711
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,550
the, the picture there. It
should be a picture in that
folder. Oh, the Jujitsu? Yeah.

712
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,220
Okay. Look, this is from the scene. Oh No,

713
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,190
no. She's a grandma. I know,
but do you see what he's doing?

714
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,430
No. Nelson. So, oh, Jesus
Christ. Here's this.

715
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:13,540
But then he went under her legs and
then on the back of her head, oh,

716
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:18,360
I don't like that. Oh, you
shouldn't, it's not nice.

717
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:21,730
Her bones are brittle. She's
all, she's like, oh, whoa.

718
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,920
Not hit my ass house. It's, it's
way too aggressive. Like it. Yeah,

719
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,140
it's too, it's too much. So
grandma, yeah. I mean, he has,

720
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,580
he has a grandma and basically choke.
Yeah.

721
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:41,010
Like I demand more for Kim Man.
Oh,

722
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,070
she needs to raise her standards a
little bit. Yeah. Um, it's pretty,

723
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,310
pretty incredible. A lot
of people, by the way,

724
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,830
are moved motivated by the

725
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,790
virtus fat phenomenon that's taken over.
Yeah.

726
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:01,000
And he has,

727
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:07,650
uh, started to push back a
little bit. Yeah. He made some

728
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,800
videos and see if we have them
here. Oh yeah. Here this is him.

729
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:14,963
He posted this.

730
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:16,920
Okay.

731
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,753
It's supposed to be

732
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,253
okay.

733
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,250
That's good. Yeah. It was
pretty funny. That's, um,

734
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,750
that's me with faceswap. Yeah. Um,

735
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,610
of course the irony is that he actually
ate the ice cream, of course, to,

736
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,970
to make fun of me. Right.
Um, let's see if I can,

737
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:43,800
he made a great one that really made
me laugh and his hotel room, um,

738
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:49,170
where he faced swapped me on to him and,

739
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:53,790
uh, and made an apology. I think you can,

740
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,230
I'll see if I can pull up.

741
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,890
He was doing it apparently all
weekend on his snapchat. He was just,

742
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:03,890
he made a snapchat just for this.
Yeah. Just to do this. Yeah.

743
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:08,670
Because it's a very new
account. Yeah. He's done. He's
done really well by the way.

744
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:09,210
People are,

745
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,210
I've told us that they're going back to
the tattoo parlor to have roommate oh

746
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,173
eight.

747
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:20,250
Oh No. From, from that look.
Better late than never guys.

748
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,670
Um, there's a, there's a

749
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,140
bunch of birdies fat stuff though.
It's getting out of control. Yeah.

750
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,550
Um, why can't I find, here we go. Here's,

751
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,640
here's what Burt did right here.

752
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,210
See if this plays

753
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,810
okay guys,
it's a big Tom Square up.

754
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,760
Just want to apologize for starting
this whole big fat campaign on bird.

755
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,300
It's a really good,
yeah, it's funny. Yeah.

756
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,140
It's a not fair. I'm just so
much better than I know that.

757
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,110
No, I'm well aware of
it. So, uh, I'm sorry.

758
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,590
The best part about this is that
people were there. Like, Tom,

759
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:11,010
you really do look really fat here in
this photo right now that you're on birds

760
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:16,870
phase. You look really,
really fast. Oh man,

761
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,250
there was so many good ones. I think
it's motivating Bert to slim down a bit.

762
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:25,330
It's motivated everybody. I know that
it's motivated Bert to stop night eating.

763
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,870
I have a source, I won't, I won't
reveal my source. Yeah. In Chicago,

764
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:32,560
he's at the Improv and I got a text
message, hey Burt's here. Yeah.

765
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:36,670
And I go tell him he's fat.
Yeah. And my source when,

766
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,320
it's funny you mentioned that because he
wanted to eat late at night and he said,

767
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:43,480
I can't because too many
people are calling me fat.

768
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,000
So we're actually making a
dent in Burt's dieting plan.

769
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,590
The funny thing is his efforts
to push backers so much weaker.

770
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,050
Right. I got two tweets that
are clearly from people.

771
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,050
They were at the show that
he was doing like, um,

772
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,920
and like I'd look at the,
the where they are and they're in Chicago,

773
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:06,780
which is where he is. And they're like,
Tom, you're you're fucking fat or yeah,

774
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,250
I just saw bird. He's clearly
been working out. I'm like,

775
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:10,720
did he dictate this to you?
Yeah.

776
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,870
Um,
and then

777
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,520
I, we just see a hundred yeah.
To Burton or clearly winning.

778
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:21,060
It's a landslide victory. The bird is
clearly better than you know. I know.

779
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:24,120
Clearly fatter. There's,
there's no comparison. We

780
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:28,540
even have a,
a song somebody made a fucking song.

781
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,330
Is that in the folder?
No.

782
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,280
Uh, they actually might be. I think
it might be standalone. Standalone.

783
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,870
A MC. Yup. Here it is. Okay,

784

808
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,360
I'm keeping it so true.

809
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,280
So crazy to do some Skype punch is crazy

We haven't even addressed births baldness

813
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,530
overshadows yeah, but it is
true man. That is very true.

814
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,720
Wow. Yeah. Um, um, hold on. Oh,

815
00:58:55,721 --> 00:59:00,220

816
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,700
Brandon. Uri, yes. Yes. Uh,

817
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,820
lead singer of panic at the disco.
Is that how you say it? Well,

818
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:08,263
who's to say it?

819
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,450
Because he sent a message out that he's
officially changing the name to a mommy.

820
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,870
Right, right. And then I was like,
Hey, is that true when you said it's a,

821
00:59:20,871 --> 00:59:22,250
the is ongoing,

822
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:26,720
I wonder how the record label feels about
that change. Um, well he said, you know,

823
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,760
I don't care.
My priorities are what they are.

824
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,140
He's gonna throw his career in
the toilet for your mom's house.

825
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:37,010
He said that he's actually putting it
on a pedestal by doing that. So, right.

826
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,370
I know that it's going
to take a while to come,

827
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:43,820
but he said the website's going to be
changing and all the material is going to

828
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:47,420
be changing very soon. Yeah. Wow. Uh, wow.

829
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,480
I did a real mommy. Yeah. And He, uh,

830
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,980
he messaged us this video that he,
you said,

831
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:59,390
I put this up and I didn't realize
that I was a profit. Um, unbelievable.

832
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,160
It's really unreal that this is a

833
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,170
oh no.

834
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:09,843
Ah,

835
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,523
right.

836
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:31,000
So now there's just gaping hole.

837
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:34,893
It is.

838
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,740
Okay.
I love his commitment.

839
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,413
Yes.

840
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:58,783
Hello?

841
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,500
Eh,

842
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:14,890
you guys got some funny kind of
a reason. There are a big deal,

843
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:19,630
Huh? Yeah. Cheese, cheese. But isn't that
crazy that he wrote that song? I mean,

844
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:23,740
before even your mom's house.
Yes. Incredible. Amazing. Yeah.

845
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,380
That guy's really got an amazing voice.
Talk about, yeah. Talent. Holy Shit.

846
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,790
Yeah. Jesus Christ. So
funny. Yeah. She retaliated.

847
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:38,560
I just thought of it because of his
voice also has a Bo Burnham. Oh,

848
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,300
I haven't watched his special,
if you watched it. I haven't
seen it. Is it really?

849
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:47,320
That's your age demographic. He's
fucking that kids. So talented. Yeah,

850
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,060
I'm watching it. I will. Yeah. It's
called like make happy. Yes. The new one.

851
01:01:52,061 --> 01:01:52,800
I've got a few.

852
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,080
I think that's why I won't click on it
because I'm such a miserable fuck that

853
01:01:56,081 --> 01:01:58,860
I'm like, I don't want to
be happy. Let's get this.

854
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:03,890
Let's watch Anthony Bourdain again. I
think your assessment is correct. No,

855
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,430
let's get snarky. But he's one of
those guys that you, if you get,

856
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:10,900
when you watch it, you'll just
be like in all of that's amazing.

857
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,320
Talented that guy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

858
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:17,800
He's just like that guy when the natural
man, I mean, how old is Brendan Urie?

859
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:22,190
That guy looks like he's 12 years
old and he's like a major deal. 20th.

860
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,400
That's crazy. But how do you, what do
you start when you're like magic box?

861
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:30,120
They may start at such a young age.
God,

862
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:35,470
he is 29. Oh my God. So good.

863
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,580
And uh, let's see. So amaze

864
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,370
25. Oh my God. Get your life

865
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:48,320
has at least two specials,
right?

866
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:52,400
He did. Um, yeah,

867
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:57,380
he did a comedy central thing. One called
Bo Burnham, one called words words,

868
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:02,410
words one called what we called make happy
one, two, three, four, five specialties.

869
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,990
And he wrote that television show.
Zak Stone is going to be famous.

870
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:10,790
That was really, really celebrated even
though it didn't last that long. Wow.

871
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,610
Yeah. Thursday. He's just one
of those like super, you know,

872
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:15,330

Yeah.

873
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:20,260
Now I don't know if you've been keeping
up with Garth Brooks lately, uh,

874
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,820
speaking of musicians, but if you want
to take a gander at his Facebook page,

875
01:03:24,821 --> 01:03:28,500
there's some choice videos.
I, I often look up, uh,

876
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:32,440
Garth's social media. Yeah. Yeah.

877
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,210
He doesn't really,

878
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,620
I don't feel like he really grasps how
to handle social media and Google stuff.

879
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:43,050
Slick stuff. Neat stuff. Yeah.
Okay. He's such a dad does,

880
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,420
it doesn't sound right,
but

881
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,280
just pull up his Facebook page
if you, if you would. And okay.

882
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:55,930
I gotta you gotta look at the his beard
situation that he's got going. Okay.

883
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:58,870
It's not good. Really. It's not good.

884
01:03:58,871 --> 01:04:02,650
And I know you as a beard
Aficionado, uh, there's,

885
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:07,651
there's an art to how you style the beard
to keep your face from looking weird,

886
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:10,150
right? Yeah. So look at his videos.

887
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:16,310
Okay. That he's posted. Slick
stuff. Neat stuff. Okay.

888
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,280
Oh my God. It's so embarrassing.
Wasn't it? Go down.

889
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,020
You got to do it from the corner.
Oh Dad.

890
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,073
But it won't,

891
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,780
Oh, dad moved the moved over. There
it is. That's the video. Yeah.

892
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:34,320
Andover. Live it to the rent a little
bit. There you go. Now try it. Okay. Um,

893
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,260
dad,
that's the video.

894
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:40,760
Just like this is a video up for
there and under the about. Oh,

895
01:04:40,761 --> 01:04:45,250
just click on that. Oh God.
I know. Look at his beard.

896
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:46,350
You're going love it.

897
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:53,470
So creepy. Right? Opening night
live. Here we are in Saskatoon.

898
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,610
Actually.

899
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:58,210
That's terrible. That's terrible.
Right? Well it's a, it's,

900
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:00,750
he has a fully clean face.
Yeah.

901
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:05,930
And he has what would be a goatee
except there's no side connector and no

902
01:05:06,071 --> 01:05:10,700
mustache. And it's not a, it's
not a little soul patch. No.

903
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:15,400
The the Chin only and it's fun.
It's, it's like five day stubble.

904
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,670
It's horrific. Yeah. A just a chin patch.

905
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,920
It looks like an old man
when you shut off for like,

906
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:26,140
everybody's really excited about getting
back. And I can tell you right now,

907
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:28,690
we have a lot of cute
stuff on this one here.

908
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,420
Actually for the first
time to get Aaron in here.

909
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:33,790
He's the guy that opened the whole show.
Karen is about to go on.

910
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,360
So we gotta make this quick because
they're doing the turnaround right now and

911
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:38,920
that keep people kind of in the arena.

912
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,870
He's gotta be insufferable.

913
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,760
Right direction 40 quick. She just
will be kind of short tonight. Okay.

914
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,520
I want to make sure to say hey to
everybody back in music fest in Nashville.

915
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,710
Huh? It's a 10 minute video. It's so low.

916
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,290
What do you guys look?
Everything's going well.

917
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:57,880
There are in the greatest city on planet
man that tunes the greatest city on the

918
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:00,130
planet. Should we love
you guys? This you guys.

919
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:02,380
But I cannot tell you how
happy is in Saskatoon. Yeah.

920
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,280
Said I thought he was saying you in the
greatest on the planet to the people

921
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:09,990
back wherever. Oh, okay.
Certainly not Saskatoon.

922
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,570
Yup. Loud tonight. So real
excited. Okay, first thing,

923
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:16,250
let's just kick the here I got here.
No,

924
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,660
we're somewhere fair

925
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,040
cowboy.
This one you guys,

926
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,580
he's so tiny.
No

927
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,860
loud enough for you.
You got to help me.

928
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:34,150
But I hear Bon Jovi.

929
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:46,980
Oh Man. So this is like some
just natural. It's boring, right?

930
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:52,100
Let's go on for 10 minutes. I'm saying,
I just don't think he gets how it works.

931
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,900
Shorter is better.

932
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:58,250
It's going to be the funnest train wreck.
Dude says hi Garth.

933
01:06:58,251 --> 01:07:02,540
Where's Tricia? Tricia is in the
Glam squad right now. She's a,

934
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,620
she's a getting made up and get
ready for her part of the shelf.

935
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:09,310
One thing I will say, Trish was
his girl. She's a, that's his,

936
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:14,490
is she a musician? But before
he met him, she's the real deal.

937
01:07:14,491 --> 01:07:16,200
A real deal.
But um,

938
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:21,480
I do like that he's talking about her
getting glammed up and then he always

939
01:07:21,481 --> 01:07:24,900
looks like he's just like
going to seven 11, you know,

940
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:29,880
like he always has just like a hat
sweatshirt. Really like dads it down.

941
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,360
By the way, speaking of Dads, did you,

942
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:38,400
did you pick up on these uh,
uh, Steph curry sneakers?

943
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:42,360
The curry to Lowe's home.
Sorry. All right. So,

944
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,830
I know you're not really into
sneaker culture, but you know,

945
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:52,070
ever since Jordan exploded and for
people that don't know and you know,

946
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,230
he's still the most dominant shoe brand,

947
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,830
like as far as every basketball player,

948
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:03,660
the big thing is to not just get signed
by Nike or Adidas, but then your shoe,

949
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:08,700
your shoe. Yeah. So it's like these
are the Colbys, these are the Lebrons,

950
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,960
you know, so and then every year it
will be like, here's a new release.

951
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,880
It's the new Lebron, right? So
it's, and then shoe collectors,

952
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,920
it's like a whole thing.
Like, you know, they get into,

953
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:23,150
I got the new lebrons or I got the
new kobies. Steph curry is the,

954
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:26,630
like the hottest thing in basketball
right now. It's, you know,

955
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:31,631
people are arguing whether he's the guy
that's overtaking that top spot from

956
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:37,220
Lebron, you can make a big
case that, you know, I mean,

957
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:39,650
he's the best shooter we've
ever seen in NBA history.

958
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,160
He plays for Golden State
and they're playing against,

959
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,430
Lebron is California,
Oakland.

960
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,800
So they're playing against Lebron right
now in the finals. But to simplify, look,

961
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,420
the main thing is that he's,
he's a huge, huge star. Um,

962
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,410
arguably the biggest star currently.

963
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,390
And so his new sneaker came out
and it's current. It's the curry.

964
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:05,690
I think the curry too low.
Let me see.

965
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:10,910
Curry two shoes. Here we go. Um,

966
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:16,540
and they have been just been
getting assassinated because they,

967
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,150
everyone's saying they
look like dad shoes.

968
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:25,460
Oh, that's funny. But I mean
they got matched one is it,

969
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:28,820
I'm trying to find the
good picture of them,

970
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:32,290
but they got absolutely
massacre. I know. Um,

971
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,810
I think when this loads correctly,
you'll see,

972
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:38,183
uh,

973
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,360
cause he's been defending them.

974
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:45,800
But people are saying like the curry two
loads do not look like stability and a

975
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:50,750
700 credit score in the shoe. Like
this year. I get it. Yeah, yeah,

976
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:55,460
yeah. It's just like they just got
massacred with dad jokes, you know,

977
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,370
like just horrific dad jokes.

978
01:09:58,371 --> 01:10:02,570
And as you can see with our
awesome internet situation,

979
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:09,710
so we have like a thousand
different internet connections,

980
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:10,670
two lines.

981
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:13,443
It's in here.

982
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:16,670
The routers in here in a certain
hard line and your computer into it.

983
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:20,060
How that's a good idea. Okay. Just, uh,

984
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,920
I now see in red,

985
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,550
I'm ready to fucking throw
this thing through a window,

986
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:31,590
but I'm gonna keep going.

987
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,290
All right, now we're back. So now you
can see them. Those are horrible, right?

988
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:42,700
Those are such dad sneaks.
Oh my God.

989
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,030
You look like stability and
a to have a hundred credit.

990
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,360
There's such Obama's right.
Cops are on their way. Three

991
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:57,370
horror. Let me speak to your manager.
Fives. Hilarious. Yes. Officer right here.

992
01:10:57,371 --> 01:10:59,710
I saw everything.
Seven amazing.

993
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:00,743
Uh,

994
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:06,070
Beyonce formation is disrespectful to
police officers and 11, so hilarious.

995
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,570
Yeah. And so, and then he's of
course make America great. Yeah.

996
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:13,980
Huh. Uh, I

997
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,070
was told by apple care.
Great.

998
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,380
And then he of course is the very thing,

999
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:25,530
he's defending his shoes,
obviously multimillion dollar contract,

1000
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:30,630
but they look straight up like dad shoes
right now. Those are terrible. These are,

1001
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:33,810
I've resigned, terrible,
terrible. Don't touch my penis.

1002
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:38,030
And then he can say that all he
wants, you know, and people say, uh,

1003
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,790
under fired their head of design.
Yeah.

1004
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:46,050
It's task through this backlash and they
rehired. They're old head of design.

1005
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:50,060
Who had gone to Nike and came back. Oh
Wow. Yeah. It was because of this. Yeah.

1006
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,200
I mean not, and that's not
cool at all. And I'm not,

1007
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:56,740
I don't know shit about cool snakes,
but those aren't terrible. Yeah. Um,

1008
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:00,520
I'll tell you who does wear it.
Like Garth is like, I'm mad,

1009
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,570
I'm Jim knew south courage to
Lowe's isn't fucking dope man.

1010
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:08,030
Really. Somebody who hasn't seen this
show. It breaks my heart to say this.

1011
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:09,650
And I also say what's the most pride?

1012
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,570
Because she knows the
highlight of the show.

1013
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,570
I cry every time and I know I
shouldn't be used to it by now,

1014
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:19,270
but just love that woman lover challenge,
pleased and very thankful.

1015
01:12:19,271 --> 01:12:20,840
We're very lucky to be jury.

1016
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,690
Throw up all their obs is
the best part of the show.

1017
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,290
Can you believe that bullshit?
No. I mean, look, you and I,

1018
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,370
we support each other in
comedy, but we never, I,

1019
01:12:33,371 --> 01:12:35,230
I really feel like it's so weird.

1020
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:36,463
G

1021
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,320
double handling.

1022
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:43,090
Don't you think it's so I'm forced to do
that shit with your spouse all the time.

1023
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:47,040
Like Eric, I mean, we
are so in love Maine.

1024
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,250
Tricia a picture right there.
She's the best.

1025
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,860
She steals the show
though. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1026
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:59,180
Right. Oh, there they are buying
tickets to see Trish. Yeah.

1027
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,000
Or Garcelle girl. They would,
so they would buy tickets
to see her if she's okay.

1028
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:07,190
I just don't know that world.
But he's definitely a bigger
name. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1029
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,730
That's so funny. Yeah. He
now I love her so much.

1030
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,840
We got to declare our love more
publicly, Tom. That means it's real.

1031
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:20,610
Let me see if this came through.
I um, did that night go through.

1032
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:24,780
God dammit. What are you
going to do? Who's Dick?

1033
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,670
You got to suck to make
this shit work around here.

1034
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:34,260
You know what's wrong then? I'm looking
for this, a email to come through.

1035
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:39,050
It always gets kicked out of my me thing,
you know? Yeah. Go ahead and take a look.

1036
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:39,893
Go to the next thing.

1037
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:44,560
Um, okay. Well it kind
of involves you go ahead.

1038
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:49,630
So we were playing with baby jeans this
weekend and you were doing airplane with

1039
01:13:50,481 --> 01:13:55,481
him and there's so many times I've wanted
to show you videos online of babies.

1040
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,750
When you hold them over your head,

1041
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:04,040
you've got to be careful because they
will vomit and it'll hit your face.

1042
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:07,980
And I've always been like shy,
show them those videos na and

1043
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:12,080
it happened to you.
Vomited into my mouth, into

1044
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,780
my mouth so warm so much.

1045
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:21,160
It was horrifying for me cause
you know I'm a vomit. Oh yeah.

1046
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:25,870
I think the whole, the whole world
knows me. And that was like, we all,

1047
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,240
everybody froze except
for the baby obviously.

1048
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:33,310
And I ran and I got a burp cloth
and wiped you off and you were like,

1049
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:36,020
I tasted in my mouth, toys, his word.

1050
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,303
Come on.

1051
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:48,210
Yeah, it was like that.
It was like that. And um,

1052
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:54,220
it was pretty incredible men.
Um, a couple of things stood out.

1053
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:59,170
First of all, I didn't even flinch.
Right. I didn't even flinch. He just went,

1054
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,300
we were like this and he
went black and you're like,

1055
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:06,310
I just sat him on my chest.
Yeah. Frozen. I was like,

1056
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,770
I just stayed looking
at him and I was like,

1057
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,240
help me out here and you
got a blanket or a wipe.

1058
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,070
Oh my God, it's all in your beard tail.
Oh, it was so much. I had to shower.

1059
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:22,030
I could taste it.
I could smell it

1060
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,520
later because the smell is
really, you're like, Huh.

1061
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:29,290
It's crazy how that's the
thing about having a kid.

1062
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,490
It doesn't even really bother you.
Yeah, it's not, it wasn't that gross.

1063
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,610
I don't know if I would've
reacted as well as you did,

1064
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,390
cause I don't mind cleaning up his shit.
He could shit on me and I'd be like,

1065
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:43,870
yeah, I can't wait for him
to Puke in your face. Wow.

1066
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:47,800
That's literally my biggest dream
right now is for him to Puke.

1067
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,880
I'm terrified of it. Of course
he's going to, I don't want it.

1068
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,400
Anyway. I thought that was
really funny. Absolutely.

1069
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,400
My 40th birthday is on Saturday.
Holy Shit. Are you going to,

1070
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,320
what are you going to do for me?

1071
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,310
Please send Christina happy
63rd birthday messages.

1072
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,890
It's really amazing, Huh? I know.

1073
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,300
I feel like we're so much more
juvenile than our parents were. Right.

1074
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,720
I like horse thinking.

1075
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,460
I can actually remember my dad's 40th
birthday a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

1076
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,880
Because they had a surprise party for him.

1077
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:27,020
So it's like slapping my mind a little
bit, but he's such like a, I dunno,

1078
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,790
just so much more of a
grownup. I felt like, you know?

1079
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,250
Yeah. Cause they had more
responsibility earlier.

1080
01:16:32,251 --> 01:16:34,170
We didn't get this much responsibility.

1081
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,260
I'd have a kid until I was like 39
so we didn't really, um, you know,

1082
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,980
people are always like, I feel like I'm 20
still. Like I don't, I feel like I'm 60.

1083
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:48,810
I do feel, I don't think I've ever
felt young. I like getting older.

1084
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,320
That's the other thing. People are always
fighting it and I'm like, it's great.

1085
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:56,250
It's great. I do, I
like it. I like it too.

1086
01:16:56,251 --> 01:17:00,450
I don't like so much happening
around and getting closer to death,

1087
01:17:00,451 --> 01:17:03,530
but every other other part of it's
fine with me. Yeah, I agree. I don't,

1088
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:07,590
not too traumatized by it. I mean,
look, I live in La. When the time comes,

1089
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:10,010
I get the surgery on my face.
Fix whatever's

1090
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,240
fallen. Yeah. Are you going to do that?
Pull it up, pull it back? Yeah. Oh yeah.

1091
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:16,120
That's what, when it's when it's, I need,

1092
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:20,810
I think 10 more years on a few things
and not get these eye bags done and I get

1093
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:25,380
my tits hoisted back up and to some
reasonable place. Yeah. Uh, maybe I'll,

1094
01:17:25,381 --> 01:17:26,570
I'll do that,
but I'm,

1095
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,350
I don't want to get like big Kim
Mans those look too hard on her body.

1096
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:35,120
Is there a way just to get normal looking
tits? Like to get them high. Higher,

1097
01:17:35,121 --> 01:17:40,030
but like not hard and weird. I can
they make them look like for her tits.

1098
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:42,830
I think command got them in Bangkok,
so that's why you look like that.

1099
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:46,790
But they're full of heroin these days.
You can go to,

1100
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,300
you can go to Beverly Hills, man. Yeah,

1101
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:53,600
the SUPERNAP Supernet
it'd be look bigger shows.

1102
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,330
You can tell him I'm tired
of these big tits fart and

1103
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:03,170
I want you to de gas them. And they'll
be like, hey, no problem. Thank you.

1104
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,640
There's so hanging. Hey, can we talk about
my new favorite show on Netflix? Yeah.

1105
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:10,330
Um, let me get this plug in
real quick. Oh yeah. I, uh,

1106
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:13,820
I did charge it to the game
again. Uh, this time, ah,

1107
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,770
a j Hawk was,

1108
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:19,790
I'm in studio and it's really interesting.

1109
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,860
We talk about all kinds of stuff,
um,

1110
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:28,430
from every aspect of his career too.
You know,

1111
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:32,750
just regular, it's like such a good
podcast. We talked just comedy, fun stuff.

1112
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:37,670
He's a great talker. Yeah. And I think
smart guy, I think I had this clip set up.

1113
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,230
He's a guy who,

1114
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:44,680
who actually won a national championship
in college and a super bowl as a pro

1115
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,250
and there's not that amazing.
I mean, it's been done,

1116
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:54,251
but not that many people win championships
at the two highest levels in American

1117
01:18:57,081 --> 01:19:01,700
football. It's pretty, we had him
over at the Mommy Dome, if, I mean,

1118
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:04,400
can I say that? Am I allowed? Yeah.
I don't think he'll mind. I made,

1119
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,480
I made a shake and bake and
macaroni and cheese. Yeah.

1120
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:12,710
And we had dinner with him and he's
so down to earth for someone that's

1121
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:16,100
accomplished so much. You wouldn't know.
He's so humble. Pie would think he is.

1122
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,241
I asked him like,

1123
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:21,560
what's the normal thing he ever purchase
with all his NFL money? He's like, Oh,

1124
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:26,350
I love the I and a nice house. One time.
He was like, is that it? Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:19:26,351 --> 01:19:31,280
I so sweet. Yeah. Um, let's see.
Uh, can I play this file here?

1126
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:35,750
I Dunno if I can, I'm trying to
play you this really cool thing.

1127
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,710
Cool stuff is real except for neat stuff.
So yeah.

1128
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,060
I mean you've one of the few guys,

1129
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:43,880
you won a Superbowl in
a national championship.

1130
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,790
Is there anything that is like similar,

1131
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,540
consistent on championship
teams like that?

1132
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,390
Like an outlook from
the players or the team?

1133
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:56,490
Yeah, I mean the culture in the
locker rooms, crazy clothes.

1134
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,050
I think everyone really gets along,

1135
01:19:58,051 --> 01:20:01,050
hangs out and just really
wants to be around each other.

1136
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:04,200
And then we had that a common thing,
that common core,

1137
01:20:04,201 --> 01:20:06,480
that thread that ran through. It was
like everyone was always wondering like,

1138
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:08,160
why is burned Chrysler

1139
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,993
so fat?

1140
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:19,070
It's pretty great. Right? I mean even an
NFL locker rooms are talking about, wow,

1141
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:23,410
wow. Charge it to the game. That's great.

1142
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:28,280
Please subscribe. Listen, it's
on iTunes. It's on stitcher.

1143

Pretty Great. Listen, I

1146

She sent it to us on Twitter

1147
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:52,460
this is supposed to be,
it could be our son in a few years.

1148
01:20:52,461 --> 01:20:55,650
Is that what that's been
Alice set up, Chris. So

1149

today I'm going to be
listening to Melody Martinez.

1151
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,950
Second single off her new home,

1152
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:16,870
crowded me coming out August
14th and it's called soap. Um,

1153
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,560
apparently here's the confirmed
and recorded track list,

1154
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,110
but might not be the actual track list.

1155
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,450
It's just the ones that
she's confirmed in recording.

1156
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:31,700
So he's definitely like a southern
boy. Yeah, you can definitely hear it.

1157
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,420
He might be a Carolina kid.
He's Melanie Martinez,

1158
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,640
some Teeny dos

1159
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:43,620
alphabet boy dos halfhearted.
Still haven't heard. Pity party

1160
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:49,610
trying to, we'll still haven't
heard soap about to here. Um,

1161
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,930
haunted.
Still haven't heard.

1162
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:56,400
See because I haven't heard sippy
cup to her songs for babies.

1163
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:59,070
Haven't heard bump on Monday. I haven't
heard a teddy bear or haven't heard.

1164
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:04,350
I'll toss that had our y'all a
thousand words haven't heard home too,

1165
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:10,940
so.
Gotcha.

1166
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:17,110
I'm going to look up who the hell Melanie
Martinez is as he's listening to this

1167
01:22:17,111 --> 01:22:21,040
song that we don't want to get
flagged on youtubes with. Um,

1168
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:26,310
but Melanie, Tina's, yeah,

1169
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:31,350
the titles. Those songs sounded really
babyish. Like Citi Taiwan cookies.

1170
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:35,380
Yeah. Child. Yeah.

1171
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:40,300
American singer songwriter. Oh, she
was on the voice. The poor girl.

1172
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:44,590
Other girl got killed this weekend.
A ball. Um, please watch him dance.

1173
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:49,210
So please tell him. Look
at him. Yeah. I honestly,

1174
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,850
he did a version of this.
Of course you did.

1175
01:22:51,851 --> 01:22:55,200
We all did this shit when you were 13.
Thank God there was no,

1176
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,600
I'm saying I'm still doing something like
this. When you listen to your Rihanna.

1177
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,060
Yes. See, listen to where
I, where I basically do.

1178
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,490
Yes. This is how you dance. Absolutely.
Show me was kids feeling it, man. Show me.

1179
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,580
I get up. Look how he, he
really goes, you something.

1180
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,733
Okay.

1181
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:19,070
I just feel alive in life.
Very nice.

1182
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,460
Some new mommy at the disco.
There he goes,

1183
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,740
damn.
Ooh.

1184
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,950
Oh

1185
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,263
so cute.

1186
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,720
You loved it. Last verdict. My conclusion,

1187
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,320
like you just tasted
some food right there.

1188
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:01,540
Could you imagine if
there was at this age,

1189
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:06,600
how much dumb shit you and out of so
many videos that would be mortified by?

1190
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:09,790
I would have been like super goth,
put up golf videos,

1191
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:15,850
so embarrassed. Just thinking about what
I would do. I would have had a lot. Yeah.

1192
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:20,410
Well, what'd you talk about at that
age? I would have thought that,

1193
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,470
I don't know.
Every time I talked shit to somebody,

1194
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:26,220
I would think it's funny and you know,
I probably would have walked.

1195
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,480
I remember walking around a party,
went through the camera,

1196
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:33,280
just clowning people in it. I probably
would uploaded that and oh my God, it was,

1197
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:37,630
I'm sure just terrible.
You know, it makes me,

1198
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,740
it makes me cringe inside
me to think about it. Yeah.

1199
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:47,100
Are you thinking about yourself doing
it? Yeah. Cause we got a cam quarter,

1200
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,060
you know,

1201
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:53,060
in 1988 or something like that where I
was 12 or 11 I just remember like hours

1202
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:58,420
in front of that thing doing commercials
for fake products and singing like I

1203
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:02,650
was, you know the singer,
whatever. Oh that's embarrassing.

1204
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,783
By the way,

1205
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:09,830
can we get a mom and wondering what
you think if I should give this a shot,

1206
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:11,960
I don't know. Would you rather to, okay.

1207
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,340
Hi,
I'm Elena Pagosa and while I'm a wrestler,

1208
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:18,720
so I usually try to do one
deep tissue massage a month.

1209
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:23,490
I heard about Dr and she has this
thing called the bite massage.

1210
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,740
Yeah.

1211
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:29,200
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Alina.

1212
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,820
So what is the bite massage consist of?

1213
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:40,170
Cause I usually extraditing
well but is it usually extra?

1214
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,030
Do you call it? Do you add an
additional cost if they want that? No,

1215
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:45,841
no.

1216
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:48,870
I started out the massage with that before
we put all the messy creams and oils.

1217
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,460
Do you wipe them down?
You don't wipe your clients down,

1218
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:55,800
don't you get grossed out?
No, you are grossed out.

1219
01:25:55,801 --> 01:26:00,070
You should not be massage therapists. I've
seen it all and smells it all. Oh God,

1220
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,460
I've seen it all. Smelled the nervous
about the bite massage because I don't,

1221
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:12,890
it's a different technique, so no,

1222
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,360
I'm open to it and get over
it. Yeah, it feels good.

1223
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:22,210
Don't be afraid. I started doing this
when I was five years old and my mom,

1224
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,980
because she wanted me to massage her,

1225
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:27,100
but my hands weren't strong enough so
she just kept saying, bite me, bite me.

1226
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:31,300
So I've been doing this my whole life.
It sounds strange and unconventional,

1227
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:34,300
but it's to die for. Okay. Okay.

1228
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:39,310
Hopefully all day it won't hurt no
more. Okay, here we go. Why? Why?

1229
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:47,410
I told ya? I don't know. I don't
know. It's all inviting your back.

1230
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,340
There's literally no other way to
explain it, but it feels really good.

1231
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:56,590
Sometimes they do. People
buttocks, right? Knowing on it.

1232
01:26:56,670 --> 01:27:00,340
She's subsiding pervert. It looks like
a little rat. This is her thing. Wait,

1233
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:03,940
but wait til you hear why. The reason
why my clients are mostly celebrities,

1234
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:07,930
it's a simple reason. I wanted to get in
free to see concerts when I was little.

1235
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,770
I wanted to meet the people on stage who
write the lyrics that I hold so close

1236
01:27:11,771 --> 01:27:15,220
to my heart and therefore I thought,
hm, I'm very good at massages.

1237
01:27:15,221 --> 01:27:17,080
So how about if I try to barter?

1238
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:20,210
Basically?
Yeah.

1239
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:21,241
It feels good.
Right?

1240
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:26,170
It's almost like getting beat out of
you when you come to me. You know,

1241
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:31,380
she gave her client list at one
point and it was David Bowie.

1242
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:33,270
Uh,
wow.

1243
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:39,600
I had on the list on the cheat
sheet. It's on there. Yeah. Wow.

1244
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,320
And she bit David Bowie?
Yes.

1245
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:47,950
[inaudible] oasis. They got their
first massage ever from no love. No,

1246
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:52,200
they'd never had massage was kind of
like those too. And she bit there.

1247
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,620
They're buttholes and yeah.
About your ball bag.

1248
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:59,670
I think she does do that exact same thing.
Well, if it's like staying and stuff,

1249
01:27:59,671 --> 01:28:02,910
she was a groupie. Yeah. Yeah. Well
that's what it sounds like. She's saying.

1250
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:07,300
That's how I got started in this, you
know? Yeah. Just by index and stuff. Yeah.

1251
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:11,460
How'd you like the, the bite massage
you think? No, I don't want that.

1252
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:14,340
I want that either. I don't
need her to do that. No.

1253
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,980
Stick to the elbows and
fingers. Yeah, I agree.

1254
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:24,150
So crowding. It sounds a little. Yeah.
I mean, I do like this. She does not,

1255
01:28:24,151 --> 01:28:28,800
she's not bothered by smells.
Wow. It's only smells very much.

1256
01:28:28,801 --> 01:28:32,610
Only smell. What do you think your
asshole smells like when you go in? Uh,

1257
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:36,120
I try to be nice about it and
wash it, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

1258
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,630
He had a lot of brown this morning.
Yes.

1259
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:42,570
I think something happened yesterday.

1260
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,360
We had those Sandy's and I
think it messed me up too,

1261
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:49,080
because I took two dabs today. Yeah.
And the second one wasn't healthy.

1262
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:53,250
It wasn't good. Well, um,
it was painful and hot.

1263
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:58,640
It was, um, were ready to
get into this. You got your,

1264
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,990
your, yeah. Okay. I

1265
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,560
have to pee again.
Hydrated so much.

1266
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:10,780
The top layer.
Did you

1267
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,383
chunk

1268
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:21,120
the urine? Homeless? Am I

1269
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,930
have sex with your sister?
They gave the face.

1270
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,100
Grandmother walks in on you masturbating.

1271
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,710
Never have another orgasm.

1272
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:37,060
It's time to play.
Would you rather

1273
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,423

Nate builds ships. Oh, in,

1278
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,690
he tries to see how far they'll
go without thinking. And,

1279
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:04,030
and a lot of times he doesn't get far,
he says,

1280
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:08,890
but he just keeps building them and
he's lost. Um, one leg in one finger.

1281

1294
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:11,350
I have to put it in a blender and puree
it first like baby food and you have to

1295
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:15,340
eat that. That's how you eat for
the rest of your life. Question.

1296
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:21,140
Yeah. [inaudible] sure.
Hey, my fucking food man.

1297
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:22,670
But I'm hearing pizza.

1298
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:26,810
I'm pure Ria and cheeseburgers
all never like it ever again.

1299
01:31:26,811 --> 01:31:27,830
You'll never enjoy eating.

1300
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:34,070
I have total care. I'll take the puree.
My eyes are watering. Thinking about it.

1301
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,460
I feel like it's vomit or something like
that. My diaper know about the purees.

1302
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:41,550
I was water weight. But
you take that. Yeah.

1303
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:44,430
I don't want to fucking
change your diaper. You're,

1304
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:47,730
I smell what comes out of
you and I want to see it. Oh,

1305
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:50,080
I'm calling you and then like,
hey babe,

1306
01:31:50,081 --> 01:31:51,690
you want to have sex and
we take your diaper off.

1307
01:31:51,691 --> 01:31:54,930
Make sure you haven't
shit in it. No. Yeah,

1308
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:58,560
I'm just like one of those fetish people.
Like I'm a big baby.

1309
01:31:58,561 --> 01:32:00,820
You have to change my diet. I, and Oh,

1310
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:05,260
you want me to puree all your food
forever. Hundred thousand percent. Okay.

1311
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:10,330
What about you? What would you choose? Um,
I would change your diaper. I feel like,

1312
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:16,180
I feel like the same thing I've already
smelled and seeing everything. Who Cares?

1313
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:18,820
Like, I'm already changing
shit diapers every day.

1314
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,570
I enjoy eating too much
to puree everything

1315
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:28,070
you would do it. What wouldn't
you change? My Dad died.

1316
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:31,710
No, I'm saying I would change
your diet. Oh, you would? Yeah,

1317
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,920
I'm saying I would prefer that to pureeing
everything I ever eat cause I enjoy

1318
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,890
eating too much. Your Shits are
disgusting and Sword Ellis'.

1319
01:32:40,891 --> 01:32:45,000
I just wipe it up and move on. I have
to get a much bigger diaper. Genie.

1320
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,240
You probably start trimming
the hair back there too,

1321
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,940
because it makes it clean up way alone.
Trimming your hair.

1322
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,890
Change my trimming my butthole hair. Yeah,
that's true. I never thought of that.

1323
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,610
We're going to have to get you waxed
for sure and then I would put it off.

1324
01:32:58,611 --> 01:33:01,700
I haven't done it. I know. Now we'll
just make sure that you do that.

1325
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:06,410
We do want to hear some submitted
ones. The came, Nick said,

1326
01:33:06,411 --> 01:33:07,460
would you rather have horrendous,

1327
01:33:07,461 --> 01:33:10,790
nasty sewer mouth that everyone around
you can smell where whenever they're

1328
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:14,990
around you or everyone around
you has putrid, wicked,

1329
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,300
bad breath.
It only you can smell.

1330
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:21,650
So either everyone's smelling bad breath
or you're smelling everyone else's bad

1331
01:33:21,651 --> 01:33:25,640
breath. I'd rather smell everyone else's
and be the source of misery. Oh man,

1332
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:29,930
that's rough. I just had an
Uber ride and I sat up front.

1333
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:32,030
I was with my cousin and her husband.

1334
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,650
And have you ever had that where you could
smell the driver's breath from across

1335
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:39,130
the other seat and you're
like, Jesus man. Yeah,

1336
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,760
I feel like someone shit in your mouth.

1337
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:45,830
They know wafts over every fear
is not crack the window just to,

1338
01:33:45,921 --> 01:33:47,970
and I leaned my head out just a brief.

1339
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,470
I kind of like feels
shitty smelly dog mount.

1340
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:56,900
Like it smells like a fish market,
but I kinda like it. I don't know why.

1341
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:59,120
Cause he's just so sweet.

1342
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:01,880
What would you choose?

1343
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,810
I think I would have to just be shit
mouth. You'd be the ship mouth? Yeah.

1344
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:10,520
Oh,

1345
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,570
but then what about us and our
marriage? We you don't care. No, I do.

1346
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,870
But you just fight through
it, man. I have to suffer.

1347
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:22,490
You're basically saying that I have to
suffer. I don't suffer. It's terrible.

1348
01:34:22,491 --> 01:34:25,430
You don't choose me over you suffering.
That's not love.

1349
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,450
What do you mean this though?

1350
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:30,910
I'm choosing to smell everyone else's so
that I don't make other people suffer.

1351
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,890
You're choosing to make
other people suffer by being
the source of their misery.

1352
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:34,650
No, no, no, no, no.

1353
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:38,310
Oh, that's not true. I'm just,
I just don't want to smell
anyone else's bad breath.

1354
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:43,110
They'll be so harsh
about it. Selfish. Yeah.

1355
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,440
Here's one other one that
came in that one, by the way,

1356
01:34:46,441 --> 01:34:49,650
that I say who was from that
was from nick. This is a,

1357
01:34:49,651 --> 01:34:51,030
would you rather have a 10 inch painter,

1358
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:56,160
but you can only have sex
once a year or for 30 days.

1359
01:34:56,161 --> 01:34:58,010
You have to shit out of

1360
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,140
10 inch.
Super from log once an hour.

1361
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:04,900
That's 24 10 inch shifts a day for 30
days. Jesus. So many variables in years.

1362
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,810
It's, um, I don't, I can't follow it.
That was Greg too complicated. Okay.

1363
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:12,890
Can I do mine? Yeah. A professional.
Would you rather? Okay. Okay.

1364
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:17,010
You Ready? I'm listening.
And this is tailored to you,

1365
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:20,580
so you need to pay attention
to this. Okay. Watch. Okay.

1366
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:26,450
Would you rather have to listen to your
dad's stories over and over and he tells

1367
01:35:29,491 --> 01:35:32,110
the same five. Okay. And then, yeah,

1368
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,620
I'd tell you about the
time and I'm really ready.

1369
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:41,320
I think a kind of ready to dial it back.
Okay.

1370
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:45,440
Getting ready to retire. Okay. Yeah.

1371
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:48,190
So you have to listen to your dad,
tell the stories,

1372
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:52,720
the same stories or you
have to tell the same jokes.

1373
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:57,340
Oh, well I just going to
reality for the next 10 years.

1374
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:01,060
Three Allity is already number one.
Yeah.

1375
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:04,930
Reality is I'm living in that.
There's not a thing like, hey,

1376
01:36:04,931 --> 01:36:08,770
what would it be like if my dad told
the same stories? That's what happened.

1377
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,320
But I mean, you're all all day, every day.

1378
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:15,550
Your option is the only communication you
have with somebody is with your father

1379
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,350
and he tells you the same stories.

1380
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:22,000
I'm getting better at
processing my emotions when
he does tell the same stories.

1381
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:26,600
So I would do that because I know I can't
do the same job for 10 years, you know,

1382
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:31,000
it's torn them over about
horrible, whatever, every 16
months. I just did it done.

1383
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:34,120
How do you think these poor musicians
have to staff to sing the same?

1384
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:37,180
Goddamn do Margaritaville and you're like,

1385
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:42,520
I think it's kind of more fun for them to
perform songs. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Okay.

1386
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:47,110
Well let those thoughts what I have.
That's good genes. That's good. I like it.

1387
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:51,880
Not It, um, anything else? No. All right.

1388
01:36:51,881 --> 01:36:56,450
We have a, uh, a closing
song that came in sound.

1389

blue band here. Put that down.

got the brains teased about that. Fr.

1406
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:36,360
Bron Tj, dad, Bob says to the stem,
