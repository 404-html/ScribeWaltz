00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:29,420
There's a guy in the audience who was
crazy and we ended up talking to him after

and he goes, he, he, he knowledged
us. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

He wasn't crazy though, right? It was,

71
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,840
it was just funny cause he held onto it
for so long. It's really funny actually.

72
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:41,330
I think, um, if it's not

If wish you were here right now so he

86
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm going to get this movie here.
This movie's getting me all wet.

87
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,140
This pussy pussy juices
dripping down my fucking legs.

88
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,030
[inaudible]

89
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,370
those
guys.

90
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,290
I came over that

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,220
we went on a weekend getaway
with baby jeans. Oof. Yeah.

92
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,870
Not, nothing funner. More fun than
travel with an eight month old.

93
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,530
She's a staycation. Jesus Christ.
Yeah. Yeah. We, we drove there,

94
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,390
but um, it's, you would,

95
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,420
you would get me a glass of penal grease
every night and every day you always do

96
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,730
this. Whenever I go like I want
to go get something, you go.

97
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,480
Wouldn't it be crazy if you said you
were going to the bar but you were really

98
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,070
just going to meet someone.
I was like,

99
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,060
like a guy in the bushes and you're like,

100
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,270
well yeah because what if that
that's really what's going on.

101
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,890
If that's a crazy scenario.

102
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,070
I know I am crazy by the way are also a
real serial killer because she laughed

103
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:39,580
maniacally at the thought
of killing a squirrel.

104
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,560
That was so funny. I was like
I only as much. It was like

105
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,230
no cause you were like, cause there
was a, it wasn't a scrolls, a rabbit.

106
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,630
The rabbit that's,
we were sitting outside and we saw it.

107
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:57,330
Adorable little rabbit just stayed there
and stayed there and eating and you're

108
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:01,290
like, how would I kill that? And I go,
you probably should snap it's neck,

109
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,390
trap it and then snap it's neck. And I
was like, no trap a rabbit. Just sure. No,

110
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,010
because at first I go,
what should I go?

111
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:12,180
I wish I had a 22 so I could
to bed too much. Fire Him. No.

112
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,250
For a rabbit that's true. Is a
fucking BB gun to kill a rabbit. Well,

113
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,820
I mean the 22 is not much more than that.
That's my point.

114
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:21,000
So I go at 22 and I was like, Oh,
I wish I had a rock right now.

115
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,170
Then I started just laugh,

116
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,000
just imagining my mother being there
because I was upset. She would be like,

117
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,980
you have a rock to kill us.

118
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,060
And also to ask her,
do you have a rock?

119
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,830
Like here's a thinking of the dumbest ways
to kill that, Randy. Like first of all,

120
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:40,380
why would you kill the rabbit meat?
There's not a lot of meat.

121
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,310
It's like eating a pigeon.

122
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,340
But what made you laugh the most was
the idea of throwing a rock to stun the

123
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,330
rabbit and then running over
there and snapping. Yeah.

124
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,960
Was like,
I'm crazy.

125
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,870
I'm a maniac.
Yeah.

126
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,820
But that's why I laugh at that stuff.

127
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,430
Like that guy talking about,

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,290
see that's Henry Portrait
of a serial killer,

129
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,910
but that wasn't a, that was a person's
neck. It's a movie. It's not real guy.

130
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,820
He's with the hooker and he gets it.
And then the guy goes

131
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,110
Henry,
because he just snapped.

132
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,580
You don't want to snap a rabbit's neck.
Let's pull up that,

133
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:37,560
you know for fuck's sake. No.
To, what about your grandma here?

134
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,580
Oh yeah.
We'll get to her in a scene.

135
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,660
What it is fucked up to even
thinking about killing a rabbit.

136
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,000
There's no reason the
meat's not that good.

137
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:49,920
You gotta be real desperate to
kill a rabbit. Jeez. And then,

138
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,490
and then we ordered room service
for breakfast and then we didn't,

139
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,280
we forgot to have them
clear it and we ate outside.

140
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,000
So there was all our food outside and
then we're sitting out there and we saw

141
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,680
our raccoons coming and we're like,
oh,

142
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,220
these motherfuckers are going to eat
all our food. And then we came back.

143
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,960
It was gone. It was like
shitty hard potatoes and stuff.

144
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,740
Where's the funny scene? What's
growing potatoes that the rabbit too.

145
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,930
It ate it and liked it.
Is this the scene here now for

146
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,020
we don't know. Yeah, here we go.
Oh, I just got it. It's the funny,

147
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,770
it's not funny.
It's the funniest fucking thing ever.

148
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,700
So at Henry's in here, go with his
buddy and they each have a hooker.

149
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,390
Tell me that his friend's
reaction isn't fun. Okay.

150
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,820
[inaudible]

151
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,930
what's going on?

152
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,760
Oh,
that we're going to keep her quiet.

153
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,260
What is snaps her neck?
You don't think it's funny

154
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,850
what? Rabid person? Killing a heart.

155
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,830
A little cute rabbits to me is just,

156
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:23,270
it's hilarious cause you outweigh it and
you're so much bigger than was. Yeah.

157
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,180
There's no reason to like snap his neck.
I'd rather snap 20 hookers. Not Correct.

158
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,890
But then a rabbit I would too. They're
so cute. Rabbits were super cute. Okay.

159
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,350
Does grow on trees, right? Yeah.
Right. Yeah. Are you with me? Hi You.

160
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,184
Where are you with me?

161
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,913
Oh

162
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,460
anyways,
so my grandma,

163
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,980
we opened with a clip of her doing
her thing and stuff like that. And um,

164
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,210
I'm here. She is, she's
great. She is great. Um,

165
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,400
so this is like, cause this is
always the thing you didn't know,

166
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,740
but remember when you first sent
out as a kid and not even as a kid,

167
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,390
I think it's a little bit older.

168
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:04,770
You hear about sex lines and
then I never actually called one.

169
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,640
I just heard recordings of them, you
know, like, cause they're super expensive.

170
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,100
Yeah. It's like, I once
had a roommate in college.

171
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:14,520
We lived with one guy and it was like
four of us girls and we all went for

172
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:19,290
Christmas vacation and he stayed
behind. We came home, he spent $600,

173
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,330
no phone, sex, phone, sex. And he paid it.
But we were like, really? Dude, really?

174
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,090
It's a lot. It's a lot. But back in
the late nineties, that's how you,

175
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,760
you jacked it was that or print.

176
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,590
And then you find out that there's call
centers and that nobody would you speak

177
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,570
to ever. It looks like what
you think they look like.

178
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,430
That was the big rub about these.
So they have a, yeah, this,

179
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,980
she looks like Mrs Kuhner
is my first grade teacher.

180
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,000
That is Mrs [inaudible] didn't look
so good. Why don't you just drive her?

181
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,990
Yeah. Uh, well, number one,
there's definitely teeth missing.

182
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,730
I don't think she has any.
Yeah,

183
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,470
she's got the big Ted Bundy glasses from
the fuzzy glass. They have big glasses.

184
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,130
Oh. Um, no Stevie, maybe Stevie. Stevie,

185
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:07,131
definitely the glasses and then like
a real feminine kind of cool haircut.

186
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,190
Soccer player. Yeah.
Tennis player, haircut.

187
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,980
They kind of the kind of cut
that says it's shut down.

188
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,330
I would say it's really shut down. Don't
touch my vagina. Soccer, tennis player.

189
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,950
Russia. Sirica 87 88 yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,830
Santana, sweetie. Bye. Hey Baby.

191
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,820
Yeah,
so this is kind of stepping in her.

192
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,340
Well it looks like she does it from her
home and that she checks in with the car

193
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,410
like so they patch her in and
then calls are routed to her.

194
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,350
You know what a cool job I think you make.

195
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Hi, it's me. I'm getting ready
to launch the APP. Okay, thanks.

196
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,510
Well now this is web cam from bitch.

197
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,980
That was bitch. Are you? Are

198
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,390
you touching that?
If right now,

199
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,700
I mean look at this right here. Imagine
this is what you're jacking off to. Yeah.

200
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,250
Oh, this is what my grandma
used to urinate in this bed pan.

201
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,090
I don't even, that's a bed pan that, you
know what? That was so traumatizing me.

202
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,000
You told me that. That I've
actually blocked it out. Yeah.

203
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,780
Why wouldn't you walk over to the toilet?
Because this is old country. This is,

204
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,420
this is how they did it back in the
old country. Yeah. But during the day,

205
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,870
she saw how awesome the toilet was.
Right. But at night the thinking is,

206
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,740
I'm so tired.

207
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:26,120
I don't want to lose my sleepiness by
getting up and going to the toilet.

208
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh, I just put the pad next to me.
I piss in the pot. Wait, what's,

209
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:34,160
tell me like the real mechanics
of it though, is it on the floor?

210
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,360
She kept it under the bed, so she
would like urinate in it, but I mean,

211
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,610
in the middle of the night.
And so what would share the bed?

212
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:44,180
So let's say she gets, she
would stand up obviously. Yeah.

213
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,070
And then you just squat
down. I'm guessing. I never,
I never slept next to her,

214
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:53,270
so I don't know. But she liked the
bed pad and then she would dump it.

215
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:57,350
My Dad would just beg her to stop doing
it and she, she wouldn't, she sold school.

216
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,980
But that, that, that does look like a
bedpan. Yeah. Yep. She's just, you know,

217
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,340
she looks like, to me it's
just looks like, uh, I mean,

218
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,290
and I apologize for ever this offense.
There's like a white trash piece of shit

219
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,890
she loves. She has that to
get that real scumbag smoker.

220
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,490
Smokers looked to her like really?
You know,

221
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,010
really just really looks like shit.
There's no real like,

222
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:26,390
you know how Chloe Savini seven Yay.
Can play white trash.

223
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,940
Perfect Sol in bloodline,
right?

224
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:32,690
Like she's such trailer trash and
then she kind of looks like bloodline.

225
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,140
It's Chloe's mother like
she's, yes. Just the eggs.

226
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,710
The exemplary piece of shit. Like
trashing. Yeah. This lady has got,

227
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:42,100
if you were an actor should get an award.
That's right.

228
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,210
He's really looking like it.
Right.

229
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,700
She's not here. God Damn fucking
asshole. If you're pressing oh boy. Yeah.

230
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,320
I want to take this God damn fucking
Dick and I'm going to read it straight up

231
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,440
tomorrow.
Okay.

232
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,020
Wow. I bet she got a lot of guys
off back in her. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,470
There's some dude isn't, can you know what
I like about this though? She is a vet.

234
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,011
You can tell.

235
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:11,080
She knows like if you're comfortable
enough to be describing drinking coffee.

236
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,850
Drinking coffee. Yeah, laying back. She's
reclining in her house. She's not nervous.

237
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,630
It's just got the bad parent next door.
She knows that. Oh, this is old school.

238
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,470
Yeah,

239
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,220
15 years. Funny Shit. She's
doing jigsaw puzzle right now.

240
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,800
I'll tell you one thing for God damn
fucking shirt that you can know,

241
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,370
like that guy gave him fucking shit.
That's our,

242
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,560
we'll have you suck his dick.

243
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,570
I love her. She pretty great. It's
her name. Do we have a name or

244
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,300
hey inches long. Oh my. She's knitting.

245
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,180
Yes. Oh No, I don't
think I should catch it

246
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,491
plays all the different,

247
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:51,150
I know she's a sweet grand and
a shower and that's about it.

248
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,120
No, I didn't have, he would have my
things right before another camp.

249
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,290
Campex not nap.

250
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,860
If you don't meet my back door here,

251
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,310
she can play submissive or she can be,
this is a real talent.

252
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,630
I mean, I could never do
this. It's probably depends on
the call. Right? Right away.

253
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,380
She knows if it's from this
number of that line, like the dom,

254
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,880
the missive, the granted that call like
I'm logging in. They're probably like,

255
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:23,350
this is a dollar number. Right.
When she's like, you're assholes,

256
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,480
your pussy and like I'm going to fuck
you in it know. It's so fascinating.

257
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,230
Now do you think that they gave
her scripts and then she memorized?

258
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,360
Probably back in the
day somebody was like,

259
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:37,361
how this is how you do it when she started
back in the 20s now just note back on

260
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,880
the Oud phonograph or

261
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,690
are you coming?
Are you coming?

262
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,040
Yeah.

263
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,730
Yeah.
I tell you one thing for sure baby.

264
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,310
I wish she were here right now so you
could see me. I think that Pussy Lips,

265
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,790
this got me pretty worked up
getting me all wet.

266
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,770
His eyebrows either. It's troubling now.
She has no eyebrows. It's rather there.

267
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,980
Is that a choice or covered by the
glass? The glass glass or a large, yeah,

268
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,740
it's really hot. Crazy neck
too. Interesting a lot.

269
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,280
But if you were desperate, this would
be 100% option for funding to pay bills.

270
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,250
And they were like, just talk to
people and talk shit. I tell you what,

271
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,870
I think this is way more
dignified than that thing we saw.

272
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,540
That was just an ass
with the two holes in it.

273
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Remember that plastic guy showed us where
he reviewed it and you fuck fucking in

274
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:43,070
here. You put it all together, clean out
the chamber is and you're like, Whoa,

275
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,300
wait, what do you mean more dignified?
Dignified on whose end? The man. Oh,

276
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,170
I mean I'd rather you call it if it
was you, let's say. Yeah, I'd be like,

277
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,070
please call granny.

278
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,690
Versus like us having to conceal
this look at her and still call.

279
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,770
I mean there's no percentage,
but you mean just call phone sex people.

280
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,780
That's just more dignified.
Why, why versus fucking that
thing. Fucking that thing.

281
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,110
Okay, so here's the thing. All it
is, but that thing we're discussing,

282
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,280
it's like a woman's ass and her thigh.
So it's like a chopped up women,

283
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,440
which you like already.
I know this is fun.

284
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,560
And then it's an asshole and
a vagina and there's clean up.

285
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,320
So where are you going to clean that?

286
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,960
You're going to put that in the
dishwasher with all the other crap.

287
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,440
I guess you could leave it
in the shower and the shower.

288
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:32,340
So when I'm showering I'm going to
fucking step on your girlfriend.

289
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,810
Well I mean I could, I could matter to
the wall or something. That's disgusting.

290
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:39,900
It's so undignified.
So people understand it's a,

291
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,270
it's a toy to sex toys like a fleshlight,

292
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,780
but it's actually sculpted to
look like a woman's ass bitch.

293
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,750
And it's called, I think it's called
like fuck my ass or something. Yeah.

294
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,540
And then they made a black one so he
knows where the fuck my big black ass.

295
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,570
And the guy was looking at the difference
between the fuck my ass in the fuck.

296
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:06,100
My big black ass. It's
just color tone. Well,

297
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,490
I mean I'm all for like the flashlight.

298
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,690
I think that's more dignified
than the asshole cut up.

299
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,610
It looks weird and look at it. Keep it
under the bed, like your mom's bed pan.

300
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,940
And then where do you keep it?
We've got a kid.

301
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,860
How are you going to conceal that thing?
You know,

302
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:24,830
walk in and he's just like fingering
boat. It's a neat toy. My buddy.

303
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,740
And most people don't do that
until they're much older.

304
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,460
Oh yeah.

305
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,410
That him and I do it together.
We're tag teaming it

306
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,760
like which told you want
pal? I think. I think for me,

307
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,550
just the cleanup sounds disgusting.
Whatever. One of those things. Yeah.

308
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,610
How the fuck do you clean out something?

309
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:49,420
You just didn't like that he
said you just, they're connected.

310
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:53,750
So you flushed with water and the
one guy's going to do that. No, I,

311
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,720
I imagine a lot of loads stay
in there. Yeah, of course.

312
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,100
Just the coagulated mess
that is pretty raw. Yeah,

313
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,760
I did imagine sharing it with nut,
like sharing it.

314
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,290
You're all just like, Bro,
just happening right now.

315
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,020
Come
due.

316
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,750
There's dude sharing one of those things
right now. They're probably already,

317
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,480
you have to share it. Fleshlight
right out there are 100% gnarly.

318
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,070
It's normally when you see it in the
movies. What do you mean? In the movies?

319
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,980
There's movies where guys share
flashlights not flesh. I probably,

320
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,770
they're probably, yes, the probably
are movies that share that,

321
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:36,520
but there's movies where they share women,

322
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,540
they'll dump inside to get a little
more natural. To me it's more natural,

323
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,510
but it's kind of grody.
Right. It's not cool.

324
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,620
I don't know.

325
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:52,360
Like a guy finishes and then another guy
goes right in there and he's like, ah.

326
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,860
And then another guy and another
guy. Yeah. It's a lot of com.

327
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,490
That is a lot of time and that's a real,
that's pretty gnarly.

328
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:04,250
Like you're super green,
you're in a special class after that,

329
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,260
you're in a very, uh, does that
excite you at all though? That idea,

330
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,670
having a just miscellaneous loads
in me. Yeah, of course. Of course.

331
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,440
The more the merrier.
Right.

332
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,280
I picture a lot of guys kind of waiting
behind us a lot of times, you know,

333
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,990
excuse me,
picture like 20 guys waiting their turn,

334
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,690
you know, I don't know.
That's not a thing.

335
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,720
I can't wrap my brain
around to think for me.

336
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,511
I really,

337
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:42,770
because I never even had like one night
stands because of that because I don't,

338
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:46,680
I don't like the idea of just some,
some stranger ejaculating.

339
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,900
You picture like a prison group though.
Not like, oh, I guess like duct tape,

340
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,330
duct tapes back there. He's talking
a lot of shit. Stevie and yeah, yeah,

341
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,660
yeah. Areas has turned. It's
duct tapes. Yeah. Who's up next?

342
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,890
All right man.
Go ahead.

343
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,010
No boy.
I tell you one thing for sure.

344
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,960
They do not play with

345
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,410
you like your [inaudible].

346
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,850
My name is [inaudible]. I like to
do to call with my he really hard.

347
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,830
I didn't know that was coming.
How do you say

348
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,700
that was pretty gnarly, man.
Good one for her. Hey man,

349
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:42,040
she's making a living though.
You know she is.

350
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,950
She making people happy and it's not
televised, which is great. Yeah, right.

351
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,090
She doesn't have to do porn so her,
her life is intact. It's nice of,

352
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,570
they showed us her taking a week.
She did a mocking Asian voice.

353
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,420
Pay, pay, pay pee now.
Thank you very much.

354
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,110
You think you're going to drink all that
got a mother fucker to come straight out

355
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,820
chocolate together.
She's taking it on.

356
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,390
It's not on my stuff and Nasty
dos and you're going set.
Come on, God. Demo bucket.

357
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,930
Nasty ass bitch.

358
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,390
Oh, I love it. She's
doing house chores, man.

359
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,860
Basically the most veteran
vet all, yeah. Oh yeah.

360
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,980
She doesn't even blink while she teaches.
The others had to do it. This Brian.

361
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,180
Yeah. Good for her. Good.
Wow. I wish I could really,

362
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,480
I would love to hear her story. Oh, it's
probably a great curious. I wonder what,

363
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:36,950
how'd she know that we've called
her such trash and shit back?

364
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,370
He feels like a pretty nice lady.

365
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,310
Old. I don't think she's alive
anymore. I'm going to throw up.

366
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,760
Can we, can we move it
along? Okay. Okay. I do baby.

367
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,450
Oh yeah. Your accent. Oh No. Black men
don't have anything. Adixen white men.

368
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,150
The only difference is the
Goddamn the fucking cal and baby.

369
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,370
I can promise you that fucking shit.

370
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,890
Reading a book and doing it.
That's how good she is.

371
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:05,180
So fucking it really hard for
you honey. Okay. Black. Really?

372
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,920
Wow. Holy Moly. Wow. What a
smarty, what a smarty smarty pants.

373
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,330
She sure I'd be. Would you ever
do that for a living? Yeah. Yeah,

374
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,790
I would give us a taste. What
of your phone? Sex style. Oh,

375
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:26,680
what type of color is it?
Okay. Um, I'm just a shy girl.

376
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,080
Okay. So I've never done
anything before. You say bitch,

377
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,460
you shy? Yeah, I'm scared of it. Kind of
tits. You got, what's your debt situation?

378
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,210
Hanky low hanging. Hello? Yeah.
You like having your tense,

379
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,880
your tits pinched at all, Huh? You like,

380
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,930

don't you ever have your,

381
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,780
this is like the first time we did
it this way. Grab your tits slice

382
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,450
and see really good job. Thanks for coming
in. Oh wait, I was just getting more

383
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,330
cause they will validate your parking.
I was getting excited. That was fun.

384
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,310
You slice those tits up. Yeah, that's how
you do. You'd be like slice your tits.

385
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,560
What if I, what if I cut your nipples
off and let them bleed all over the desk?

386
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,540
Why don't you in the pussy
right now? Exactly. What if I,

387
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,230
what if I put two thumbs on your
butt hole and then pull them apart?

388
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,270
That is kind of how I
start ripped her anus.

389
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,890
That's how I started every
lovemaking session. Well
with, you know, my whole life.

390
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,640
Yeah. That's really how, that
was my move to the button

391
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,000
and then as soon as I heard it,
I would come.

392
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,490
I can throw a,
uh,

393
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,000
it was fun. That was fun.
Uh, we have some break.

394
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,130
It's major news.
Had chips in a bowl in a long time.

395
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,270
Well, you, um,

396
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,580
fif is really looking at this deck.

397
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,820
You said,
she says that this was news,

398
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:14,910
right?
It appears

399
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,980
that's pure free flicking his
boss. So. Wow. Yeah. Geez.

400
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:23,470
He doesn't have bolded the
deck. It appears that, um,

401
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,270
the legends is back. That's right. Yeah.

402
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:32,271
We just received a news this morning
that our beloved is returned to work.

403
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,360
The most talented actor of all time,

404
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,150
who we thought retired actor is adult.

405
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,790
Officially back

406
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,520
my ass.
My ass.

407
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,970
I thought he was retired for good. I
mean he made quite a statement, but,

408
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,460
but it's like Jay z when he always says
he's retiring and then he makes another

409
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:59,740
album. It's like they can't
stay away. Listen, when you're
good at something. Yeah.

410
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,990
The God works through you. You're
not doing the work, you know?

411
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,650
And he felt inspired and he
went back to work. Well he, um,

412
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,260
I shouldn't put this on the screen,
but yeah, it looks like because we,

413
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,990
how can we play the grandma? I guess
that's, that was on youtube community.

414
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,040
I wonder if I can dare just
no insertion this video.

415
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,430
Thank God there was an assertion
with grandma this a night.

416
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,730
This is pretty intense. Okay. Um, I'm
trying to see if I can play any of it,

417
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:33,710
but how about just the audio? Okay. I
don't need to see it cause anyone else.

418
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,660
Yeah, I think I would be really heavy on
the porn today. It's very porny today.

419
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:42,530
Yeah. Yeah. Let's, uh, maybe we
should maybe not listen out loud

420
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,430
in your cubicle
Max security alert.

421
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,090
Immediate life
one eight.

422
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,600
What

423
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,890
is that? That is a Mac
alert going off. It's like,

424
00:29:57,891 --> 00:30:02,480
cause you're watching porn. Oh yeah.

425
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,870
It's a virus and knows all
about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,330
All right. Okay. So, uh, yeah. Oh,

427
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:15,680
it's the whole scene here. I didn't
want to see the whole theme, so yeah.

428
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,260
Rocco's definitely back
though. Well, I thought,

429
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:20,030
I thought it was just
like a little trailer.

430
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,530
I didn't think I was being
sent the whole thing. Yeah.

431
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,530
Um, well it's neat that he's
bad. God dammit. Why is this?

432
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,170
God Damn you guys hear the news listening.

433
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,010
We got an email from a listener.

434
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,840
Yeah, Rocco. Yeah, he's back.

435
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,040
He's back. I the world of porn. There's
just not enough people doing it, you know?

436
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,780
No one's doing it anymore,

437
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,520
so it's good to have somebody
who's committed to the game. Um,

438
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,330
poor guy.

439
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,740
It looks like he's just as
committed and aggressive as ever.

440
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,880
His films, I don't like that.
He's so rough sometimes.

441
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,690
He's got a big hog on him.
I like his attitude.

442
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:19,160
I like his enthusiasm. You know,
he married a Hungarian lady,

443
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,120
Kevin with that. Yeah. I mean,
is that Your Hall Pass Guy?

444
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,980
My Hall Pass Guy. Rocco's yeah. Everyone
has a hall pass. Right? You're like, ah,

445
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,310
that, that Land Ryan Gosling. Really?

446
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,120
He's your hall pass. So who
is your hall pass? I Dunno.

447
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,520
Probably Rocco. Stop it. What?

448
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,510
Megan Fox before her face got all weird.
What happened to her face?

449
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,830
She's too much plastic surgery, but she
didn't need, plus she was perfect before.

450
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:49,790
She did not need that.

451
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,590
She looked like somebody actually
drew her and she was pretty weird.

452
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,430
Um, Charlise tear on. No, but I like
her. I think she's great. Charlie.

453
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,460
Charlie's Tehran is great. She
speaks Afrikaans. No. Yeah,

454
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,810
she's real smart. She's real
smart. She's real smart. Uh,

455
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,660
so anyways, this is, fuck man,

456
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,280
this is fucked up my whole computer
watching on now. Yeah. All right.

457
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:18,470
I'll get out of it. That's why you got to
watch it on your phone right now. Okay.

458
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:22,670
Here's a good shot I can show. I think.
I think I can show this. All right. Uh,

459
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,410
right there. Can you see that during the
movie? There's some saliva right there.

460
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,940
Oh Gosh. Okay. All right.

461
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,970
Okay. Yeah. So do you think he's a little
old to be doing a little, yeah, no,

462
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:41,870
he's way old to be doing. And it's
Ron, Jeremy retired. He doesn't know.

463
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:46,550
He still does it. Oh, gross. And he
needed, yeah, he said stop. Yeah,

464
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,020
it's a, but again, he was
always kind of a regular body,

465
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,160
if you know what I mean. Ron.
Jeremy. Yeah. That was his thing.

466
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,520
He's like a regular body.
Rocco is 52. Wow. Yeah.

467
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,670
So as of 2011, he has
started in 1300 films. 1,350,

468
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:05,504
2011

469
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,313
man.

470
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,060
Yeah. I just, I wonder,

471
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,620
okay.

472
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,070
I mean I have, we've asked this
question before when we had jewels,

473
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,890
Ventura in here,
how it affects your personal life.

474
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:21,880
Like you fuck for a living and then you
come home and doesn't that kind of ruin

475
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:24,790
it for you and you're just,
you know, it's like Cami,

476
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,920
you and I don't watch sitcoms.

477
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,260
We don't watch comedies cause
that's what you do for a living.

478
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:32,800
You've pride rather vomit than
watch. I agree. So who knows?

479
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,280
They have member at the uh, um,
take a joke. What's it called?

480
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,710
Can we take a joke and we take a drug
from here, the guy who I was like, oh,

481
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:41,544
that guy

482
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,590
who asked the question. Yeah, that's
him. Oh. So we did a Q and a for,

483
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,400
can we take a joke premiere?
And this guy had a question for me.

484
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,780
I guess what the for us, look what he
found it. He's the founder of evil angel.

485
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,550
He had a second amendment question.
Yeah. Oh, that's so interesting.

486
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,030
And I'm not a huge fan of evil as a brand.

487
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:06,900
I'm just not interested in
like [inaudible] crap. Oh he's,

488
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,710
he's also known as black man. It says,
oh, I know, but man, the button man,

489
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,410
I'm thinking of Fart man.
Nevermind. Well he did for him. He,

490
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,940
he also used to, I guess employee
are good. Betty Yoshi. That's right.

491
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,500
Who's been on your lot and Yoshi does not
like them anymore for sure. Oh God, no.

492
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,050
Well, here's, here's why he's so
big on that. In the end, 2008,

493
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:31,410
he was indicted on federal
obscenity charges, um,

494
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,800
by a federal grand jury in DC.
Hmm.

495
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,870
And he launched a website then all about,
you know,

496
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:39,510
that and then a federal trial
began with him as a defendant,

497
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:44,130
but all charges were dismissed. So
he's a very, um, you know, proac

498
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,680
he's, he's really at the
center of all that kind of
exactly. Debate. Wow. So yeah,

499
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,200
he was, he was at that
premiere. Wow. I know.

500
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:54,020
Cause right away it's
interesting how you know who the,

501
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:58,240
the famous porno people
immediately, you're like, I
know that guy. He's in Cornell.

502
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,950
Yeah, of course you do. He's
behind. He's an owner though. Yeah.

503
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,130
But that guy is so he does a lot of press.
He does interviews all the time.

504
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,290
He's not a performer. I pro stock
performer by stone. Oh yeah.

505
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:13,490
He can get hot anywhere. That's what
Yoshi upset it. But what about him?

506
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,460
But I tried to bait him in to that.
The guy is like,

507
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,130
he can get hot and wet as this big thing.
Yeah.

508
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,620
That guy can fucking any
condition and strong performer.

509
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,920
That's what they're always looking for.
[inaudible] it's hot out. That's it.

510
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,660
Get hard. It's hard, I guess.
Yeah. I mean difficult.

511
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:33,140
We should say it like that is probably
the most difficult thing. Yeah.

512
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:36,350
Cause you have to block out all
the other stuff. The cameras,

513
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,430
the lighting pressure to come.

514
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,280
Okay now come like that's,

515
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,930
that is a talent that is
really a talent Molly. Wow.

516
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,150
Things got really dirty today. Yeah.
I that happened dad. It's your fault.

517
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,800
My fault. You open with that. No, I
did an old lady. I love that lady.

518
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,720
She was a sweet lady.
Um,

519
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,200
this kid, have you seen this? I
wanted to show you this, this kid.

520
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,440
Well actually I want to tell the
story first about, about, um,

521
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,200
cause this happens sometimes.
What happened when I went
to the bar last night.

522
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,520
So that did, yeah. Before I
met that dude. So this guy,

523
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,730
uh, I walked up to the
bar and he goes, hey,

524
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,050
I know you and I go, yeah.
And so I got to tell you,

525
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,440
I never want to presume that somebody
like that definitely knows who I am.

526
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,920
Like I don't think like that. Like
this guy probably really does know me.

527
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,830
Cause sometimes people don't know you
and they think they know you. Right.

528
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,210
But still, this dude was adamant
that he knew me. Right. So he goes,

529
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,290
I definitely recognize, you know, it was,

530
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:47,190
it was funnier than that though. He goes,
I definitely recognize you. And I go,

531
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:51,210
yeah. And he goes, where do I know
you from? And I said, I don't know,

532
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,140
because I don't want to assume
that it's what I think, you know,

533
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,800
and you can't be a Douche bag and be
like, have, I'm a famous comedian. No,

534
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:02,760
it's so gay. So it is, and you, it
would program. Sorry. It was, yeah,

535
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:07,260
you shouldn't say that. You're
so non-binary. So he goes, um,

536
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,760
he goes, did you play college
football? I got like such an erection.

537
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,180
I wish that's what you knew me
from. You know, it was like, God,

538
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,930
why can't that be true? So I go like,
world's biggest cock. And I know

539
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,110
he was called trouble. And I go, no.
And he goes, did I paint your hot rod?

540
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,820
And I go, no. And he goes,
did I pave your driveway?

541
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,920
I go, oopsie yeah. I'm
like, no, sir. And he goes,

542
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,830
uh, we play the poker
league together. Nope.

543
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,580
Very colorful life. And he goes,
are you a marine? And I go, no.

544
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,600
He goes, shit man thought was
one of those five. I guess not.

545
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,390
Yeah, I'm pretty amazed. And
then I, I still didn't go,

546
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,040
well I'll volunteer. What I think he goes,
he just stayed there and he goes, God,

547
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:03,610
I fucking recognize you.
And I go, no man, that's,

548
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,900
that's, I, I don't,

549
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,760
he goes and have you ever been down to
like you spend a lot of time in Long

550
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Beach? And I go, no.
And I saw it like that.

551
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:15,960
He was really trying and obviously
he tried all those, you know,

552
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,930
that his different guesses.
So then I kind of go like,

553
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:22,110
cause sometimes you just go like, all
right, and you just walk. I go, I go,

554
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:25,840
all right. He, cause he kept looking
at me. I go, uh, I don't know.

555
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,110
Did you have to have Netflix? And he goes,
yeah. I go, well I have, uh, a couple,

556
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,140
uh, stand up specials on Netflix.
And he goes, Nah, that's not it.

557
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,380
I go, okay. He goes, it's gotta
be something else. I go, I mean,

558
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,060
I guess it could be something else,

559
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:45,910
but that would be the biggest
exposure I've ever had.

560
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:49,540
Nobody believes you when you tell them
where they know you from for the longest

561
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:54,130
time. But I know you and I'm like, it's
from road rules 1999 that's not it.

562
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm like, Eh, it trust me.

563
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,670
I know we didn't go to high
school together as soon as
I said that. And he goes,

564
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,180
that's not, he goes, I go, you sure?
And he goes, I've met you personally.

565
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,580
And then I go,
then probably the Marine Corps.

566
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,530
I wish you guys did go to. And then did
you blow him behind the Bush or after?

567
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,760
After that 21 minutes.
Yeah,

568
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,850
we pounded some booze. I got
blackout and you know, anyways,

569
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,050
there's to do that on the down
low on family vacations. They,

570
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:30,160
naughty boys do that. They cruise and
they look for other dudes. Yup. To blow.

571
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,300
And then they blow him. Really?
Naughty boys really dad it out.

572
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,350
We went to the pool, we took our
little jeans to a swimming pool.

573
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,510
I'm going to post the
picture on Instagram. Um,

574
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,680
it's so funny you put sunblock on your
face but you forgot to do under your

575
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,370
eyes. So it, it was like
caked on white, white, white,

576
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,640
and then just your eyes and your under
eye circles were like perfectly cut out

577
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:57,940
of it.

578
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,510
Like you look like a raccoon and you're
such a dad and that was so white and

579
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:06,270
creamy. Like you hadn't even rubbed it
in and all it can even try soundbites.

580
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,040
Sankin burned bad. I
want to get a burn. Uh,

581
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,770
so cute. It's so hot out. How can you,

582
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:19,771
but you didn't think to like rub it in
and that's how far I rubbed it in to that

583
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:24,640
level. Yeah, I didn't care. That's
what happens when you're a kid.

584
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:29,410
You don't care. Yeah. And then I feel like
you should acknowledge me for my fart.

585
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,250
God, there was so obscene
that you did that. I mean,

586
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,000
there was so many nice people
just enjoying their day.

587
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:43,140
Christina walks up and she just goes like,

588
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,180
it's like five feet from
these people at the,

589
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,530
they're eating lunch by the pool and
I'm like, he's us. And she's like, well,

590
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,580
fucking deal with it. Did not say,
well, deal with it. She goes, smelter,

591
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,740
bat like that, and I was like, Whoa,
no, I blamed it on you. I went, Tom.

592
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,050
Yeah, Dad. It was really not cool.

593
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,710
It was really gross and I was
wearing a wet bathing suit,

594
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:12,820
so it had that special kind of snap to it.
Little pop.

595
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,910
He did it twice.
Then another one,

596
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,930
I know you did it this morning too,
right? I've been fighting a lot,

597
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:23,410
but whenever I eat in restaurants and
I eat a lot of meats at restaurants,

598
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:28,180
I flirt. Yeah, it's pretty neat.
You don't see it all the time,

599
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,410
but then sometimes you do.

600
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,190
What was that stupid movie you were
watching last night? Oh my God.

601
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,230
First of all, for the guys that I meet
out in the, in the parks and in the,

602
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,660
just wanted to show this.
Oh,

603
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,070
the Senate certainly can bring about a
censure resolution and it's a slap on the

604
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:47,980
wrist. It's a bad boy. Bill
Clinton. You're a naughty boy.

605
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,840
The American people already know that
Bill Clinton is a bad boy. A naughty boy.

606
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,430
I'm going to speak out for the citizens
of my state who in the majority think

607
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,600
that Bill Clinton is probably
even a nasty, bad naughty boy.

608
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,600
It's the weirdest, the greatest
thing ever. And then of course,

609
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:11,601
he famously was trying to get a B Jessel's
in the Minneapolis airport and he was

610
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:18,840
arrested Bj's, Bj's, blowjob. Yes.

611
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,680
So he was tapping his foot
under the stone. That's him.

612
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,570
Disgraced senator. Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:30,810
That's what they say. Those who call
out the other ones or I like, oh,

614
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:35,130
and here's the two pastors
that do it. It's the worst.

615
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:38,880
They're always like that. Ted Haggard
was homophobic, hating the gaze,

616
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:39,930
and then he was doing the same shit.

617
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:49,440
I watched 13 hours last night, or most
of it, I think that's what it's called.

618
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,900
It sounded like it's equivalent of a
chick flick for dudes where it's all just

619
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:57,390
like talk and macho.

620
00:42:57,391 --> 00:43:01,710
It's about a horrific and terrible
thing. You know, it's the,

621
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:06,320
the attack on the, um, on
Bengazi, right. The, the,

622
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,160
the attack that happened in 2012 a bunch
of people died. Embassy, right? Yeah.

623
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:16,380
Um, and I hate it. Didn't do well.

624
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,260
Uh, it was bad. It was,

625
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,800
it was weird thing was
they took this real story,

626
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,900
but they laid a blueprint of a,
just a regular action flick around it.

627
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,853
In other words,

628
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,160
you've seen a million action movies
that there's no reality to it. I said,

629
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:33,960
but this time they go,
this is about Benghazi,

630
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,600
but we're going to make it like a fun
Bro Action Movie. And it's a battle,

631
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:42,270
a real thing. And they all had,
um, the Afghanistan beards,

632
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,610
like they were out in the shed, the,
uh, special ops beards and they,

633
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:51,960
you know what the guy shows up
who's not part of the inner circle,

634
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,540
who are you? And he's like, we're fuckery
Taylor. They'd be seal. And he's like,

635
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,610
he's a good one. Fuck that guy. And
like all that stuff. And then, um, yeah.

636
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,600
And then, uh, it was also
throughout the film, uh,

637
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,270
an on again, off again,
commercial for Mercedes,

638
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:14,700
five different new Mercedes model cars
in Libya post post revolution Kadafi fall

639
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:20,700
into a brand new, uh, g five 15.

640
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,090
Yeah. Okay. All these new Mercedes. And
it was to the point where you're like,

641
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:30,180
this is a Mercedes commercial, like
this is getting uncomfortable, you know,

642
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:34,020
like they wouldn't even swap out.
I have some different cars. Um,

643
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,720
and they said fuck a lot. Like
very superfluous use. Yes,

644
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,630
he's fucking windows. You can't
see fucking shit out of here. Like,

645
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,160
why did you even need to say fuck?

646
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:49,210
And my fifth establishing scene was main
character facetiming back to the house

647
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,000
boy. And his wife was like, hey baby.
And he's like, how are the girls?

648
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,570
And the girls were like, Hi
Daddy, he's looking at miss.

649
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,510
You guys really miss you guys. And then
you see him in danger and he's like,

650
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm just my girls, he's making a video to
send back to me. This is all I fucking,

651
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:09,360
then the wife was pregnant, I
was pregnant, I was pregnant.

652
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:13,980
And the guy's like, oh my God, I'm a
dad too. And like, it's just so dumb.

653
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,120
And you realize, I don't know,
once you've seen, you know,

654
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:20,640
movies for 30 years like I have,

655
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,810
I feel like when you see the blueprint,
like when you see how it's done,

656
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:26,760
you're like,
this is just the same fucking,

657
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,440
why would anyone feel entertained by
this if it's dummies? Just the formula.

658
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,350
So Warren,
the same reason sitcoms over and over,

659
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:38,220
people like just formula according to
this, I don't know if it's 100% true.

660
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:40,350
It says the movie was made for 45 million.

661
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,680
That sounds really low as a small budget
for a Michael Bay movie that says box

662
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:50,770
office was 69, so that's not good.
That's not good. $20 million.

663
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:51,990
I just,

664
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,550
I saw one scene before I went to sleep
where they're checking out the embassy

665
00:45:56,551 --> 00:46:01,050
security and the guy's like,
he's fucking breaches in these walls.

666
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,080
There's not enough.
We're sitting fucking ducks right here.

667
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,940
It's a lot of like macho deck slaps.
It's really dumb.

668
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,350
It's a really dumb make. Slappers
um, he and all his movies,

669
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,700
he did Pearl Harbor. That was the same
kind of thing. Even facetime and that,

670
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:20,490
you know, God damn it.
That's right. It's like 1940

671
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,770
this isn't working so good. Cause I got
bad was I love you too. Fluffy Jacks.

672
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,450
Yeah. That's awesome. Speaking
of awesome movies. Yeah,

673
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,190
let's check out the new
C

674
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,500
[inaudible].

675
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,640
You see what they do now for him

676
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,370
is that they,

677
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,660
they cut in lieu of showing him moving.

678
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,870
That was an action sequence,
right? It was, instead of
showing him doing the thing,

679
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,580
there were like six cuts.

680
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,450
So you don't see his enormous body
trying to do this complicated.

681
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,570
Yes. They fake movement with
other people. Moving. One, two,

682
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,430
three, four, five, six,
six cuts. Yeah. Wow.

683
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,720
Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, and they're
like, he just kicked that guy's ass.

684
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:23,070
I saw it in six different frames.

685
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,740
[inaudible] I throw blows
comes in small black dress.

686
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,680
I have vocal fries and tends
to man, that's, by the way,

687
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:45,570
he's a million years old
and the girl's like 19 yeah,

688
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,600
it's a million years. That's not the,
that's not the girl for you, Bro.

689
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,340
That's not the girl for you to travel.

690
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,340
Always gives in a little blade here
that you're of course paying attention.

691
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,520
That vocal fry. Uh, Joe, uh,

692
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,570
come to the black.

693
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,800
The black

694
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,040
sure blowers comes small.
Black dress. Nice. Huh?

695
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,460
Sorry.
Much a boyfriend.

696
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,990
His eyes were swollen. Shut so
much sausage the night before.

697
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:28,950
Filming Beer. Whose boyfriend?
That is just the clothing.

698
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,070
That's just bloat. Yup. Check. Do we have
his yellow sunglasses? All right here.

699
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,380
Actions.
Barney had a lot of money.

700
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:41,480
Of course, a sea gal is famous for
the entire film being in the trailer.

701
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,490
Could you get it for me?

702
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,790
$2 million

703
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,070
that bad. Technically it's
not stealing. Kindness

704
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,750
can make this happen. You
don't have the time. Do you?

705
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,260
Don't get the money.

706
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,530
It's always bad guys too.

707
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:09,670
He's always fighting the bad guys to
see how little he was emoting in that

708
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:10,190
statement,

709
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,800
that plan to get that
money is bad guy like that.

710
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:18,820
Like there's nothing behind those eyes.
There's no emotion.

711
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,650
No dead for me. It do you have a plan?
Do you have a plan? Steven Sea Gal?

712
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,000
Don't get the money.

713
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,740
Go get them. Go get the
money. He got a little,

714
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:34,150
it might as well ask the grip
to read the learns, you know?

715
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,620
Do you think that was Asiany? Yeah. Plan
to get the money. I don't. Or Latin.

716
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:42,240
Maybe you get the money like a Cholo.
He does like that.

717
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,560
He blacks it up a little
one. Oh, he does that.

718
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,950
So he put the black on the end
of that one. Get the money.

719
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,760
Don't get the money. No, that's
Asia. Sorry. How's this concrete?

720
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,280
Yeah, we're rich. Yeah.

721
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,330
Now it comes to the problem here.
Yeah. Got The money. Let me guess.

722
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:05,600
The gangsters are going to come after
them for stealing the money. My money.

723
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,970
My money. One way or another. Yes sir.

724
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,420
I'm looking for a man and a woman.
She looks like a cop.

725
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:20,670
She looks like a stripper.
She looks like like a

726
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,980
cop. She looks like a,
he said she right, right.

727
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,010
You think they would take that line again?
I mean we got to

728
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,120
roll guys. Maybe Caresa clearly. Right?

729
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:36,520
She looks like a cop. She,
let's see. Yes. Makes it

730
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,730
for a man and a woman. She looks like
a cop. She looks like this trooper,

731
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,130
why would you,
why would you leave that in the trailer?

732
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,120
This is a major thousand
dollars production. You're
not going to shoot the lines,

733
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:53,580
right? Or place the audio afterwards
in post or something. That's a quick,

734
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,990
that's because the girls editing
this himself on his iPhone.

735
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:02,260
I'm looking for a man and she,
she looks like a cop.

736
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,990
She looks like a stripper.
Oh my goodness. Unreal.

737
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,150
On real.
I cannot believe that that

738
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,730
good for a man and a woman. She looks
like a cop. She looks like this stripper.

739
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,230
Okay.
Yeah.

740
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,490
Do you think when he's in the,
this is clearly in Europe, right?

741
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,270
Shooting in foreign countries.
This is for sure. Oh yeah.

742
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,160
This was a Middle East actually to
no, come here and look. Oh, right.

743
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:41,080
That was supposed to be, yeah,
that's probably right. Yeah.

744
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,220
So when he's there that people think,
oh,

745
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:49,930
this is a major production,
this is a huge movie. And then,

746
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,860
then he's like, no, we're
making this for like $30,000.

747
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,190
But I mean,
to his credit,

748
00:51:57,191 --> 00:52:01,180
he comes out with a movie every five
months or something. More than that. Yeah.

749
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,240
Every three months he comes out
with a new movie. Absolutely.

750
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,250
It's similar in structure.
Money. All right. Now

751
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,250
like kill me.

752
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,850
Isn't this the exact premise
for the last year that we watch?

753
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:20,830
That's what I'm saying. It's all the
same. I mean, exactly. Exactly the right.

754
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,280
There's some girl and,
but he didn't do Kung Fu with her yet.

755
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:27,600
He hasn't had the scene where he's like,
oh, he fingered. Yeah, they fingered.

756
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,500
That's why they're attacking.

757
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,143
Sure.

758
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:41,210
Hello there. How can up, I know,
but will they do Kung Fu together?

759
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,520
Oh, shutting seems like this as time. So

760
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,720
you think it's creepy to shoot a
sexy with him? He's old as fuck

761
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,570
ain't even cute. We still get to
that up. I bet that widow's peak. Oh,

762
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:59,660
it takes away Agra.
Just all black ink.

763
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,150
Do you think he comes black ink?

764
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,920
Because it is so it is now and stuff.
Yeah.

765
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,453
Do you think

766
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,000
could have walked through
where we the money

767
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,580
you'll pick up balls. Sense.

768
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:31,890
Thank you for noticing. Wait,
if he's about the honor,

769
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:35,970
why would he steal 2 million in the
first place? Does it makes no sense.

770
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:40,050
There's no trying to break down
our fucking premise to this.

771
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:44,590
Just roll with it. Okay. He got Lionsgate
though. That's pretty good. Theaters,

772
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,780
theaters, production value on this
one is definitely, it is much better.

773
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,800
It is way better. There's a lot better
to, somebody stepped up on this one.

774
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,200
Maybe they saw our last podcast about
what if a, they're like, oh shit,

775
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,810
this house is on us.
Um,

776
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:09,580
I wonder how many movies he's in
pre production on 37 a movie a week.

777
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,920
Well actually you know how many came
out in 2016 we're in 2016 yeah, right.

778
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,670
2016 there's one, two,
three, four, five, six. Wow.

779
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,500
Six wow. And next movies. That's
a movie a month. Killing Salazar.

780
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,750
Sniper. Special ops code
of honor in connection with
the Asian connection. Yeah.

781
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:35,810
End of a gun contract to kill his filming
and attrition is in preproduction for

782
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:39,970
next year. What did, but he is just,

783
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:43,840
she found some investors and he has crank
and then which ones did we just watch

784
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,610
a gun? You know what? I bet they did.

785
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:51,900
Cause I think Lionsgate gate picked up
Tyler Perry's first few movies as well.

786
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,830
They bought like 10 Tyler Perry
movies for like a million each.

787
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:00,210
Bundling them.
And that's how he became so well known.

788
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,230
And then this guy at this point,

789
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,760
you take your guys like him
take it off the top right.

790
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,610
So what happens is a studio will go like,
oh,

791
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:11,400
we're going to only gonna give you
like $2 million to make this movie.

792
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,570
And he goes, my fees a million. Right?
And then he may have to make the move.

793
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,890
Makes it for $10,000 the whole movie,

794
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:22,600
my fee is $1,000,989 yeah.

795
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,280
But he's smart. He's doing it. He's
maintaining his own career with these,

796
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,190
you understand that there's a,
there's a demand.

797
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,900
And then I've always loved
his imdv bio Stevens,

798
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,730
a gauzy strikingly and
somewhat boyishly handsome,

799
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,450
often with a ponytail action star

800
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,940
tense. Right. He definitely wrote
that Shit, man. Of course he did.

801
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,540
Of course. He was like, let me see

802
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,150
was the most beautiful way.

803
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,290
Striking. Yeah. Shit. I'm striking.

804
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,290
They speaking a Kung Fu.

805
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,900
Speaking of

806
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:12,000
teeth people we've talked about,

807
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:16,790
talked about a frosting with,
uh,

808
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,720
and how there's a whole push again, push.
I know, but there's some new information.

809
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,000
Now you might be wondering
what is oil pulling?

810
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,220
Oil pulling is a very simple thing.

811
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:31,120
It became in a high quality vegetable oil.

812
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,240
I prefer coconut oil because
it's other healing qualities.

813
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,080
Taking it about a tablespoon of it,
swishing it around in your mouth.

814
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,960
And as you're swishing
around this raw fat,

815
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,440
the enzymes in the fat
literally pull bacteria,

816
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:46,540
pass and toxins from your body.

817
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,670
What's Your Pronoun? Uh, like, uh, uh,

818
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,730
I'll be like, hey, what's your product?
What's wrong? What's her pronoun?

819
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,330
What's its prolean? I don't think
it's a straight hair. Zoom. Zoom.

820
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,970
Which Brent in the fuck
is she talking about?

821
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,030
I think it makes sense.
What does Zim talking about?

822
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,510
Got To wash your two
fees with animal fats.

823
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,140
So let me show you real quickly how
you do it. Oh, please do. Here's why.

824
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,920
Coconut oil, coconut oil, coconut oil.

825
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:27,410
I'm going to vomit already. Put
it in your mouth. Fuck off shores.

826
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,530
You're swishing around.

827
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:32,160
Do not swallow it because you'll be
in basically adjusting the toxins that

828
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:36,570
you're pulling. So there we go. Put
it in your mouth. Five to 15 minutes.

829
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,240
Five to 15 minutes.
And that's on the low end.

830
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,740
I've been saying some that say 20 minutes.

831
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,250
Can you just swish it around your mouth
for 20 full minutes or just switching

832
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:45,084
stop

833
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,070
or you can just floss.
No stupid.

834
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:54,680
Can't just floss.
Fucking idiot.

835
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,120
I love all these urine therapy.
Coffee enemas.

836
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:01,160
Swishing coconut oil.
Why?

837
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:05,120
Why do we need these alternatives to
systems we already have in place that are

838
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:06,440
working pretty damn good.

839
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,960
Last works.
Cold medicine works.

840
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,190
There's a knock on,
on your whole floss though.

841
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,070
People are saying it's bullshit.
Yeah,

842
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:20,520
but what about just getting food particles
out of your teeth like after you eat

843
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:23,060
statements though? True, true. Um,

844
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,660
a lot of people were so gross, so, so,

845
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:32,050
so in love with top dog. Oh Em. Gee,

846
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,940
his last joke.
Oh Man.

847
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,180
Let's revisit some of the highlights
because it's so funny. Yes. I've,

848
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,080
I've spent time just reminiscing over that
just alone, you know, just hanging out,

849
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,260
thinking about how epic it was.

850
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,570
Hey Buddy, stop dog Kate, buddy.

851
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,650
Stop Dog. Take Buddy. Stop. Doc.

852
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,990
Do you need to wipe down the top dog?

853
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,330
Um,

854
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,050
he really goes such a good call
with a top dog was on the phone.

855
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:11,710
We called and we just, I know that he
loves street jokes. So we started reading.

856
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:14,890
I'm blonde jokes.
Oh my God.

857
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,570
He lost his mind.
He lost his mind.

858
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:25,040
He laughed.
So he said stuff that was so just him,

859
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,890
you know what I mean? Like, it
was so genuine to who it was.

860
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:31,530
So authentic on that call Tom Bride.
Okay.

861
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,140
Loved it down broad blind Joe.
Yeah.

862
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,730
Ah, I love blonde jokes, by the way.

863
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,340
Yeah. And he laughed so
hard in this so hard. Yeah.

864
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,133
Love it.

865
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:56,930
His laugh is the best. Love those
jokes. Oh, I got a little pod junk

866
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,950
for the easiest, just simple as broke. He
said, do you remember? He's on that call.

867
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:08,290
He goes, sometimes I'll just say a
joke like that to myself and laugh.

868
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,820
And I'm like,
what?

869
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:13,810
He uh, he really likes telling him too.
He kind of stretched them out a bit.

870
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,600
Like he adds more detailed than you need.
Yeah.

871
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,870
Cause that's how much he enjoys
telling him. I think he wants to talk.

872
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,440
I mean I've never had

873
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,173
money.

874
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,570
One job when I went out,
the only time I heard him laugh like this

875
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:40,090
was when we went out to, we went
out to a uh, a breakfast I met,

876
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,540
I went with him and a 90 year old man,

877
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,190
I'm like 90 years old.

878
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,630
Those two were telling each other street
jokes and my dad was laughing this

879
01:00:49,631 --> 01:00:52,270
heart and by the way,
the 90 year old man was too.

880
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,630
I thought I was going to watch him die in
front of us. I've never seen something.

881
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,990
He was like, oh like shaking. And
then he was like, now you do one.

882
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,370
To me that was the old guy who I was like,
I don't have jokes like that.

883
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:05,620
And he was like, why? He didn't understand

884
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,651
comedians don't,

885
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:09,310
when you ask them to tell a joke it's
cause we don't tell street jokes. Right,

886
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:12,740
right, right. That's from like the old
time Shecky Greene and shit like that.

887
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,010
Exactly. Red Button. Yeah.

888
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,833
Oh I got

889
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,160
you thought that was really funny.
You know

890
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,750
that's really funny.

891
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,150
Are such corn cornball jugs too.

892
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,490
I told her that only
coaches going to London.

893
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:47,170
How are they against? Hilarious.

894
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,640
Yeah.
Good Rod.

895
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:58,500
That broad as really dates
as you know who he is.

896
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,453
Yeah.

897
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,990
That's my favorite part of that joke
cause it's some dumb broad would find that

898
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:04,830
really tickles him.

899
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:09,530
That really when women are dumb
really gets is get some broad. Yeah.

900
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,270
Like,
like when your mom does something silly,

901
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,510
he just loves to report
the news back to us. Yeah.

902
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,700
You know what your mom did today. Bribes
are different. He says that to me.

903
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:19,860
Sometimes you don't if
you're talking like, yeah,

904
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,790
you know my sister did it and he's
like, Tommy brands are different. Yeah.

905
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,550
That's like his loves that Shit.
I love that expression

906
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,270
and the blinds. So did I, but I
thought you might change his mind.

907
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:42,970
How does it answer? It's hard. I
think that's hilarious. Oh my God.

908
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,873
Wait,

909
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,830
that's so funny.

910
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:55,040
And the thing is,
he's told these jokes and countless times,

911
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:59,060
this is not the first time that your
dad's regaled us with these blonde jokes.

912
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,420
He tells me that he's been telling me
these for you and he still laughs this

913
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:06,260
hard steel screws up. Usually the
setup and the punchline. Yeah.

914
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:10,940
Then they got the guy, he wants to know
he the other guy. The other guy came in,

915
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,570
I'm like, it's over. You already
fucked it up. And he's like, Huh, that.

916
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,680
It's really funny.
I can't remember how it goes.

917
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,130
What episode is the full conversation
and blue band that people can listen?

918
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,430
The 59 yeah. Is it? Yeah. The last one.

919
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,550
It's not in three 58 [inaudible]
59 actually, no. Yeah,

920
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,230
you're right through 58 three 15 okay,

921
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,020
so if you guys want to hear
the whole conversation,

922
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:32,060
listen to episode three 58 he also,
you can hear the,

923
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:37,080
the horrible jokes that were telling him
didn't understand the concept of these

924
01:03:39,201 --> 01:03:43,730
are set up punch jokes. So I would say
set up and you just got to go like what?

925
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:47,660
It's like the knock knock who's there.
That's all you gotta do.

926
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,370
I would ask him,

927
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:54,500
I would do the set up and then he would
try to logically figure out the answer.

928
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:57,740
So I asked them like this Polish joke,
you know,

929
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,810
how do you know if you're in
front of a Polish firing squad?

930
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,420
That's true.
You spoke about how

931
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:11,560
the guns are faith. If the guy, dad sad,

932
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,520
do you not understand
how these jokes work?

933
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,860
You're not supposed to actually try it.
Yeah,

934
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,840
answer them
any and he did it multiple times.

935
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:24,390
Like right after that he does
it again. I know, I know.

936
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,260
He has to guess the punchline.

937
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:31,290
You can't let the biggest revelation was
him thinking that this is my act now.

938
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,040
Right. You thought you were asking
like 10 jokes into this and he's like,

939
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,830
these are good.
Like I don't know if you should do these,

940
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:45,720
but these are shooting my way. What? Like
you think this is how I do stand up now,

941
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,020
but do you think your dad laughs
this hard at your acne? No. No.

942
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,270
Never laughed as hard at math.

943
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:56,220
This is, you don't give any one liners
like this for, this is good stuff here,

944
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:57,054
buddy.

945
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,270
What would you please? Oh my
God. It would kill your career.

946
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,350
I heard that one before. Yeah,
that's a funny one actually. Yeah.

947
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,780
That's crazy,
right?

948
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:15,963
Hey,

949
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,640
he's laughing so hard.

950
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,960
Corny jokes. He corny Blonde
Joe. Straight up joke,

951
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:29,240
but just the loves them, man.
Yeah, it's a different time.

952
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:33,560
I guess they used to love, I mean, that's
how people would do. Take my wife please.

953
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,380
Here you see the people just fucking
fallen out of their seats. Yeah.

954
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:42,320
They're killing. Crushing
with that Shit. Unreal man.

955
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:46,880
How times have changed, haven't they
have? I've remembered a Polack joke.

956
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:50,750
I'm gonna. I'm going to tell her
that's pretty offensive. I'm a pole.

957
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,510
Like I can tell those jokes.
Okay. You can say it. Tell me,

958
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,910
how do you know a Polish girl is on her
period? Oh, she's only wearing one sock.

959
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:04,030
Oh,
that's funny.

960
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:12,030
Got Anymore. Let only think
about it. Okay. I don't know.

961
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:16,560
Okay. I know you got some racial
ones floating around in your head.

962
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,220
Of course. I rememorized the truly
tasteless joke book, but they're just,

963
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,460
they just feel mean now.
They don't even think two different times.

964
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,840
They don't feel funny. Yeah.
You know, we're in a new era.

965
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,520
Yeah, man. All my life I was born
in that. This always be a man,

966
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,250
but I don't understand that binary.
You're just man or woman.

967
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:42,300
People say about being nonbinary via
you're complicating things so much.

968
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,870
It's really not that complicated.
Why don't you just pick a gender?

969
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,720
Did you pick a gender?
You can't just make up words.

970
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,620
Do you think where it says grow on trees,
all words are made up so you're gay,

971
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:58,190
right? My sexual orientation has nothing
to do with my gender expression. God,

972
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,240
which bathroom do you use?

973
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,150
Probably the one that I'm less
likely to get harassed him.

974
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,830
But you wear suits but you wear dresses.
Yes.

975
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,340
But you put on makeup while spotted.
Why did you transition then?

976
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,010
Why are you so ignorant? But
what does it say on your id? Oh,

977
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:19,840
and that has none of your business so
vital to pick agenda. There you go.

978
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,800
And why do I agree with
all the shit people are?

979
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,500
Cause I watched it and I was like,
I agree with everything.

980
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:32,560
My impression of the 80 year
old third world. Yeah. What,

981
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:36,250
why are you complicating stuff? I totally
agree. But you're born a man, right?

982
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:41,500
You wear suits. Here's a news
flash. You're a fucking man.

983
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:46,810
We can't. And we gotta be real careful
with Ellis. We have to call him baby self.

984
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:51,520
Yeah. Maybe cause he can't choose his
gender and we're in it's child abuse.

985
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:56,260
Tom. I know. If we dress
him in blue, I gotta be real
cognizant of it. Yeah, I know.

986
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:01,750
Maybe self, toddler, so very um,

987
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,850
non gender specific clothing and colors.
What does toys?

988
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,610
No, no, definitely no gender toys.

989
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:15,100
I just give him plastic balls and
sticks that are yellow or green.

990
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,070
Well you know, I get him. Everything
I do, I get him stuffed animals.

991
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:23,450
I get them trains, I in books.
I don't know. Yeah, I really do.

992
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:27,190
I even see gender and I don't know,
I was at the store,

993
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,820
we went to buy buy baby to
get a new stroller. Yeah.

994
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,020
And the girls section
is terrifying though,

995
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:37,430
cause it's all like easy bake oven, how
to cook things. And then there's like,

996
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,510
it's a toy mop so you could start
cleaning sooner. The girl's section was,

997
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:45,660
it's really gender and the boys,
the boys too. I'm sorry. Yeah.

998
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,810
See, oh, game. And the girls is
like, how did keep a house clean?

999
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,140
How to blow the CEO, right?
Yeah, it was, it was really bad.

1000
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,270
The girl stuff is pretty
appalling. Yeah. Yeah. Dump rods.

1001
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:02,510
I can you press pause? I gotta get the
groceries. Yeah, sure. Oh, I dunno.

1002
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,920
Anyways, so hydrated.
Uh, did you get the food?

1003
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:07,941
I did.

1004
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:12,941
I have groceries delivered so I don't
waste my life at the grocery store and I

1005
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,550
guess I'm so lazy.
I get them to leave them out front.

1006
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:21,380
Um, and so we pick them
up. We got to pick him up.

1007
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:27,110
Listen farts. Yes. No. How to,

1008
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:32,030
do you want a fart? Can you
really fart? Do you want to Fart?

1009
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,210
Bark. Bark with me. You
think of this kid? We,

1010
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:41,830
uh, this was, did you discover this
kid or is it, was he sent in? Um,

1011
01:09:41,831 --> 01:09:45,670
I think someone send a man. Okay. The
Fo this kid is kind of interesting.

1012
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,440
It's not always the,
the,

1013
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:53,970
the physically strongest
who wins the battle. No.

1014
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,800
And it's not always the fastest. Right.

1015
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,240
Or the smartest.
Right.

1016
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:05,220
Sometimes it's the person
with the most stand Hima

1017
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,390
yeah. You know, that's the
stand on my guys. Yup. Wow.

1018
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:15,520
It's generations. Do you think
so? Yeah. I think with the, um,

1019
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,660
like I said,
I don't know if I mentioned this,

1020
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:21,150
I was a top spelling bee champion
in the state of California to,

1021
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,630
you've actually mentioned it quite a few,
top 10.

1022
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:28,790
And part of the problem
is this shorthand texting.

1023
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,540
I, I'm guilty. Do you have it? I don't
write out the word your anymore. I write.

1024
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:35,400
You are, you know, Idk. I don't know

1025
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:43,850
that was an accident, but it's
still like, this is great.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
01:10:43,851 --> 01:10:48,350
I think it's a, it's because
kids don't read as much anymore,

1027
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:52,340
I'm assuming. Right. Well what, um,
what gave you that clue? Dan Anima.

1028
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,640
The Anima. Let's see,
what about that? Again,

1029
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:59,300
I've mispronounced words that I've
seen written for years, you know?

1030
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:05,300
Yeah. He does not remember I, what's
the word I fucked up on our show?

1031
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:09,620
Pretty recent.
Con Con.

1032
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,460
It was a, yeah. Sounded like that. Oh,

1033
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,680
combative. Combative. Right. You're like,

1034
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:21,180
I've been reading that in my head is
combatitive. Yeah, it's combative, right?

1035
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,500
Yeah.

1036
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:27,500
But then my mother would mispronounce
words and I heard her wrong for years.

1037
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:32,010
Children of a foreign English speakers,

1038
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,930
foreign accent syndrome.
So we get it.

1039
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,960
We get it bad cause it's
your developmental area and
you're hearing all these

1040
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:43,940
things set incorrectly and your case
by both parents. Both of them. Yeah.

1041
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,790
The what
tomorrow.

1042
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,100
Yeah. Pretty great stuff. Good words.

1043
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:00,410
Sometimes it's winning a battle map.

1044
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Part of it is to get your rest and get
your energy and your stand up going

1045
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:09,480
before wait,

1046
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,020
before you enter the ring,

1047
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,030
the ring called real life.

1048
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:18,270
You're not going to win in real
life if you're standing was so low.

1049
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,720
He sounds like he almost got it right.
Stamp Stammer

1050
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,760
when in real life if you're
standing was so low closed.

1051
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:29,503
What's interesting

1052
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,040
is that we shame people like him.

1053
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,420
No shame for all these other dumb things,

1054
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,590
but we don't shame people for
just being straight stupid. Right.

1055
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,880
If we started a stupid shaming campaign,

1056
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,350
I think it would look cool with that.

1057
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,060
I'm cool shaming a this kid over,

1058
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,800
since Stan Stan stand up.

1059
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,450
That's how he's going to learn
that word when in real life,

1060
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,200
if your standards are so low,
if you shame him enough,

1061
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:04,350
he'll learn how to say it correctly for
the rest of his life. It is interesting.

1062
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:08,450
The idea too
much more.

1063
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:12,850
I don't know why we stopped shaming.
No shame is a,

1064
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:17,040
is a good instrument for
change. I agree. You should be.

1065
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,040
She had to write this down.

1066
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:23,150
Testing how this guy is doing
kind of self help stuff.

1067
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,150
Interesting. Like Tony Robbins,
but look at him. You know,

1068
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,300
it's kind of interesting.
It needs the help. Yeah.

1069
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:36,360
It looks like he should maybe
read more of those books.

1070
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,950
That's why rest is
important. Right. Important.

1071
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:45,150
So if you want feel like taking a nap,
you should take a nap. Yeah. Gloves.

1072
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:49,710
Oh, you should stay down
until you get better. Yeah.

1073
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,930
See that's it's always a sign of
intelligence is fingerless gloves.

1074
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:59,420
It's just a, I think it's just a side
of really hard time taking a nap bad.

1075
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,930
You should stay down until you get better.

1076
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:08,820
That's good advice that
you'll win the bet. Match Mat

1077
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,440
or how about this? Like if you, if
you stammer through your video, yeah,

1078
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:22,150
maybe recorded again. Right.
Make it better. Nope, you
don't have time for that.

1079
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,550
This guy doesn't,
he's a guru.

1080
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:29,830
Stop worrying about losing all these
fake girls because you know why?

1081
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,770
Why, why they're diamond doesn't
true. What one real woman,

1082
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:39,010
one real woman that's going to love you
and respect you to the Anton is worth

1083
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:42,410
habit.
Maybe sometimes it's best to wait it out.

1084
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,560
That was good advice. Good advice.
Yeah, that's actually good advice.

1085
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,870
Yeah,

1086
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:50,300
that was good. Here's what I want to
know. Are you talking to yourself?

1087
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:52,363
Okay.

1088
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:59,630
How old is this kid? He's never had
a real woman I know. Talking about.

1089
01:14:59,631 --> 01:15:03,430
So come and dock. Dave
should hang out. Okay.

1090
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:07,540
Say you win this girl shop at hot
topic and you find some similar item.

1091
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,520
You Buy Similac.

1092
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:14,740
You know something interesting to talk
about his girl shop at hot topic and you

1093
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:17,410
find some similar item.
You find a flannel,

1094
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,330
you know there's something interesting
to talk about. Yeah. You know,

1095
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,290
wearing the same shirt.
I assume Ila item a similar,

1096
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:30,110
I tell him in La,
maybe his parents were foreign.

1097
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,440
Look, I'm not a pickup artist. Huh?

1098
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:37,400
I'm just some wait a mirrored
who knows the lighting?

1099
01:15:37,401 --> 01:15:41,420
Who knows a little bit about gay?
Okay. Oh, I'm going to know who guy.

1100
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,540
I'm just a regular ass.
Do you? Okay, bad boy.

1101
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,410
Get your bracelets.
You know what?

1102
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:50,840
I always think about the brain
and I know his comicon and, and,

1103
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:55,700
and you know geek girls and I'm gonna
tell you a geek girls have the same run

1104
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:59,760
the same way as other
girls do. Yeah, yeah.

1105
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:05,450
Right there at the
friendship. Yeah. That is a,

1106
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,970
a friendship did to get your bad
boy bracelets. Yup. Yup. Yup. Tom,

1107
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:11,980
have you been working on
your bad boy accessories?

1108
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:16,600
Are you a fucking bad boy
or not? Yeah, I think so.

1109
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,980
Get the bracelets.
They up.

1110
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:25,090
The stay on and all this shit's
jumping on different screens.

1111
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,750
Yeah. They should really start shaming
people for misspellings and uh, you know,

1112
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:34,660
and saying things wrong medically
incorrect things and uh,

1113
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:39,190
like intelligence things. People should
be shamed for their lack of intelligence.

1114
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,070
I think so. Absolutely. Because are you
can kind of control only if you're trying.

1115
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,100
I think you should be shamed if you're
trying to tell somebody what's up,

1116
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:52,690
what's up and then you're the dog. In the
case of these videos, he's the preacher,

1117
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,150
right? He's informing them,
telling you how to live.

1118
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:59,530
You're allowing us to up our stand on
up stand alone. Yeah. I don't know.

1119
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:00,760
I think across the board,

1120
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:05,970
which just started shaming campaign and
here's the most important thing ever.

1121
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,823
Respect.

1122
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,780
Don't let someone take advantage of you
or make you spend all their money on

1123
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:18,240
them and just act like a little bitch boy.
Okay.

1124
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,000
Think he's done that. Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:25,840
Now you realize that these videos are
for himself. Well, yeah, of course.

1126
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:29,540
Of course. Yeah. Poor guy.
I understand his money.

1127
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,060
Just remember to follow you on advice.

1128
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:35,010
You're not going to win in real life
if you're standing was so low. True.

1129
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:36,643
Get out there.

1130
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,120
You have the Dan Umma Stat.

1131
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,530
Stamats Stan, Emma, my nose. Um,

1132
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:50,790
a lot of people really impressed that
your mom's house was featured on 60

1133
01:17:52,091 --> 01:17:57,091
minutes and it's not every day that a
show of that caliber features a podcast.

1134
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:04,000
Um, but with us it happens and
we were very proud of it. Um,

1135
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:07,330
if you didn't catch the
little segment they did, um,

1136
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:12,360
it was on the anniversary of the
Cincinnati Fart and it really was pretty

1137
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:17,530
substantial. It was surprised that
Morley safer covered the piece.

1138
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:21,400
Yeah. I didn't think they'd send
him. Is it because he's dead?

1139
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:29,140
Exactly right. Yeah. Well, he came
back from the dead to do this.

1140
01:18:29,141 --> 01:18:32,540
Do the piece. I know. Yeah. No, he,

1141
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:35,410
they did one thing about
morally, it's that he, he,

1142
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:40,440
he really does have that shaver and his
face was melting off of his skull and he

1143
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,850
died the moment after he

1144
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,550
retired
and I met him at the door

1145
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,810
and then it happened.
It shut the room.

1146
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:56,590
I've never been around anything like
that before. It's a little loud.

1147
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,710
I got a dad that really far.
It's good afternoon.

1148
01:18:59,711 --> 01:19:01,900
Thank you for just coming to
Venice on Cincinnati downtown.

1149
01:19:01,901 --> 01:19:05,980
How may I direct your call? Hi Ya.
Um, do you get to consume one book,

1150
01:19:05,981 --> 01:19:10,030
a room to commemorate this Cincinnati
Fart that happened last year

1151
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,440
to commemorate what? I'm
sorry, could you repeat that?

1152
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:18,820
The Cincinnati fart anonymous
caller at our hotel.

1153
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,660
There's

1154
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,660
something called the Cincinnati Fart.
Right?

1155
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:25,800
It sounds like you're familiar with
it a little bit. Yeah. Well, I,

1156
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,880
I went on this river cruise and they
had a really big buffet and I was six

1157
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:34,910
months pregnant. So like I ate
way more than I normally would.

1158
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:40,040
Lasagna, chicken, pork, Broccoli, garlic,

1159
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:44,540
mashed potatoes, two helpings of
bread. I had four desserts that day.

1160
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:47,290
And then I took a nap
right after. Yeah. I mean,

1161
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,980
after dinner I went back
to the room and you know,

1162
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,270
she greeted me and I was just
expecting to have a normal night,

1163
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,260
but it was anything but normal.
What did it sound like?

1164
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:03,380
Oh,

1165
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,333
by the way,

1166
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:10,860
Caitrin wasn't that good and that's why
I farted so big. The food was garbage.

1167
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:16,710
It was like a garbage buffet and I eat
every piece of garbage on the table.

1168
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:20,430
True. I mean me, look at me. I really
had some great farts in my life,

1169
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:23,730
but nothing like the
Cincinnati Fart is legendary.

1170
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:29,910
The longest fart I ever
had in my entire life.

1171
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:35,350
And it was amazing. I mean the, the
carpets changed color in that room.

1172
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:40,350
Painting started appeal. It
was really, really disgusting.

1173
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,500
Oh my God, you guys are so
disgusting. This isn't any far.

1174
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,290
It was a legit 25 second plus Fart.

1175
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:52,830
I think the room was still smells.
I'd be surprised if it didn't. Yeah,

1176
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,880
that room does have this,
but they do make me do my drains,

1177
01:20:56,881 --> 01:20:58,890
but it still comes back.
Not sure what it is.

1178
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,480
It was like garbage on top
of vomit and on top of shit.

1179
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:08,410
Worst thing I've ever smelled. People
ask me, Christina, how can I fart?

1180
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,160
Like you eat bad food.
It's just that simple.

1181
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,390
I'm not your Fart Guru, but I can tell
you what you can do to help yourself.

1182
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,300
You can eat

1183
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:21,110
bad today. Let us not only
remember our fallen soldiers,

1184
01:21:21,111 --> 01:21:23,720
but let us also remember
the Cincinnati Fart.

1185
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:27,260
What was so special about that room?
The Cincinnati Fart.

1186
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,200
Could you spell that for me?
Yeah.

1187
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:34,300
F A r t like passing gas.

1188
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,920
Um, can I put you on a
brief hold? Sure. Yeah.

1189
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:42,170
Thank you. Yes. Good work. Wow.

1190
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,140
Blue Band band did that working with 60
minutes. Yeah. Was that fun to work with?

1191
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:50,770
That whole crew and Morley's
dead body SEL pros do is real.

1192
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:55,510
It's real cool to learn. Yeah.
Wow. Really Neat. I'm proud of us.

1193
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,710
I am worthy chamber

1194
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:04,480
and there's the smell when you
enter the city of Cincinnati,

1195
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:09,430
that cannot be explained,
but we may have found the answer.

1196
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:13,660
Vague droopy dog eyes. Droopy dog.
No woman like that's on Tele. No,

1197
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:18,960
they never let it run on TV looking
that Shitty fucking only dudes. Um,

1198
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,740
all right. We got, we gotta run genes.
Okay. Thank you guys for listening.

1199
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:29,200
Uh, here is the closing song.
It's now I'm in your ass. Yeah.

1200
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:34,720
The street justice remix. Is that Oh yeah,

1201
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:39,580
I think you'll like it. Okay. Oh,
okay. Um, Oh God, we love you.

1202
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:44,260
I love you.
Blah hall at mom's house.

1203
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:49,410
Bye Bye. Dot. Seriously.

1204
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:53,423
No

1205
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,123
Bet.

1206

Yeah.

1207
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,340
Whoa.
