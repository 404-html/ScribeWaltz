111
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,920
he's in the game is in the
game. Yeah. And um, you know,

112
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:38,780
he's in the shadow came he's a,
he's a rapper also. I didn't know.

113
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:42,230
I didn't know that. Yeah.
But he wraps a lot. Um,

114
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,310
and then he, uh, you know, I just,

115
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,700
I basically put this out
there so that he could,

116
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,830
uh, see it. And then maybe if
you wanted to do that fight for,

117
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,300
because I, you know,
I um, you know, right.

118
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,820
Every day shadow he's got punches,

119
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,260
man. I just wanted to give you a challenge
video, you know, why don't you and I

120
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,690
step in the brain and shit and you
could show me some of your moves.

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,310
We can sell tickets, we could donate
them to charity. Uh, we could, uh,

122
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,280
winter it takes on that because one
of the things, I know you're there,

123
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,190
I noticed that he, uh, he
does know how to throw a jab.

124
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,910
He knows how to throw a hook.
Right. He throws an uppercut,

125
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,240
but then he does really unusual Skype
hunches were like, he goes through,

126
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,680
you know, so I figured if I am
going to step in the ring with him,

127
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,840
I have to kind of get my Skype punch
game down at the end of this video.

128
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:47,520
I just do, I train for um,
weighted Skype punches.

129
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,440
They're called scribe punches.
Yeah.

130
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,120
That is right.

131
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Then inspire but crazy
low CEC kettlebells,

132
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,630
but not yet,

133
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,480
but I'm not doing, I don't
consider myself doing kettle bells.

134
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,950
I think I'm just doing weighted Skype
line. I see you're saying. Yeah.

135
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,520
Because it's kind of the same
movement. Yup. You know? Yeah. I know.

136
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm talking about, I'm
filming what I'm saying. Um,

137
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,960
I mean if you want to get a better
idea of what I'm talking about,

138
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,440
you can look at, um, these right here.

139
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,990
These are what I would say are like his,

140
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,040
probably what he's best known for.
Um,

141
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,150
oh right.
You can see,

142
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,170

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,240
Crazy. Crazy. Maybe that's why
they call him crazy loads. Yeah.

146
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,190
That's his signature move.
Yeah. Damn. Damn boy,

147

lot of speed dude. I,

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
I don't know how you're going to
fight this guy. He's got yeah.

149
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,010
All the moves. Yeah, I
know. It's pretty real.

150
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,520
It is pretty real. Um, and I gotta be,
I gotta make sure that I'm ready for it.

151
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,370
You know, you're not afraid,
but I wouldn't say that,

152
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,210
but I'm ready to,
you know,

153
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,900
see where this takes me.
Yeah. Um, I was brought,

154
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:19,430
it was brought to my attention that
there are some other crazy load things we

155
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:21,470
could, we should check out. Okay. Um,

156
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,390
one of course is his rap rapping prowess.
Um,

157
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,450
okay. This is a, this is a
crazy load. This one here.

158
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,843
Um,

159
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,000
oh, you really are in love with crazy
looks right now. It's really normal.

160
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,600
What's the fascination with him so much?
Why do,

161
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,250
why down the crazy looks rabbit
hole? I don't know, man. I mean,

162
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,230
he just is interesting to me,
you know.

163
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,350
What about his style
appeals to you the most?

164
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,710
Um,
probably

165
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,673
okay.

166
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,200
Just that he doesn't give a fuck.
I kind of really,

167
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,500
I was like that about people when
they're like, I don't give a fuck man.

168
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,110
He's really himself. Um, and I
like, you know, I like fighters.

169
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,333
Here's a

170
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,250
bitch.
You better quit

171
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,080
right now.

172
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,280
Take care of it.

173
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,830
Shit like that.
Right?

174
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,020
What are you sure you want to be this guy?
I don't know it.

175
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,850
That's why I'm starting to train harder.
Yeah.

176
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
I don't know if I'm,
I have experienced,

177
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,570
I'm not sure. You want to, oh wait,
look at the header on that. Which one?

178
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:06,170
Crazy little scroll up.
I want to see up. Uh,

179
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,550
higher up. Look at that
crazy face. He's crazy legs.

180
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,620
I don't know, Babe. I kind of don't
want you fighting this guy now.

181
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,410
I Dunno if he's stable enough. You know,
you don't think he's stable. Wow. Scary.

182
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,500
Well,
this is like a lot of the fighting stuff,

183
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,900
but for a long time, uh,
it was about rapping.

184
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:31,734
You know?

185
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,930
He was really right here. Shot
Jimmy here. How here it will be.

186
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:42,540
This is not new. It's awesome. She
me to say it straight up though.

187
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,590
Shovels out all the homies.
You all say

188
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,460
gas to keep pushing with this
Sam the Shin with this dream.

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,270
Chris and lows ain't fear then.
Yes. You know what I mean? Yes.

190
00:13:56,271 --> 00:14:00,660
And d Chris Willow Street, brain state
heat. Chris loss has gone a pastor Mike.

191
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,210
So this home you can do it right?

192
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,110
Yeah. Oh yeah. You know? Yeah.

193
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,920
There's different levels. There's so much
happening with crazy lugs. Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,270
It's like, you know, there's like people
who are like, I'm a writer, director,

195
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,890
producer, act like he's that guy. He's
that guy that can wear so many hats.

196
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,590
Yeah, he does. He's so talented. Yeah.

197
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,240
You can't contain that kind of talent,
homie.

198
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,930
Yeah. This is a freestyle.
Looks like right here.

199
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,000
Crazy slopes up in here.
We all say it shall goes out.

200
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,370
Some Doug's pushing his game. Close
loans. Don't give a fuck about Oh shit.

201
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,870
Oh, keep pushing. Like
ain't no thang, you know,

202
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,220
saying straight up though, Chris Los
is going to spit. They'll feel bored.

203
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,410
I said a straight do I burn a kid?
I spray do it from the brain.

204
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,230
And those gaming APP pretty
play. No playing. What I Gus

205
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,200
to say Chris Lowe, sal about GIM
paid all about his dog for Shell.

206
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,280
Some of the yard did nub with our rep
to be a yeah, it's not that good. So,

207
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,530
um, he only moves his mouth too.
Everything else is perfectly still.

208
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,420
Have you noticed that? Yeah,
no blinking. Just Kinda,

209
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,600
well I gotta say I was getting really
into preparing for the fight and you know,

210
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,550
I was watching a lot of his
boxing video budding. Yes.

211
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,440
That didn't seem like, what
does my opponent, you know,

212
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,160
doing cause then that video that I put
out, obviously I'm challenging him. Yeah.

213
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,270
Turns out crazy loans
might not even be well.

214
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,250
Yeah. What do you mean?
Well wait a minute.

215
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,300
Not Well,
how like he has a cold or something worse.

216
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,763
Yeah.

217
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,820
Brain not well, what a
shocker. You're kidding. Well,

218
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,040
I mean, here's a, um, that's a weird,

219
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,820
here's an email we got from a listener
who also teaches a w people with special

220
00:15:56,491 --> 00:16:00,410
needs. Um, he says, hi
Hitler. Mommies. Yeah.

221
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,720
Work with special needs kids.
I'm on spring break,

222
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,750
so I had some extra time on my hands
and I think I can fill in the blanks

223
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,420
a bit on crazy lows that watch youtube
videos such as this wonderful wrap

224
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:17,220
classic cop car.

225
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,973
Okay.

226
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,890
Um, that's the one we just saw it. Right.

227
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,700
I know he was robbing next to a cop cart.

228
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,250
It's all syndicate.
He never

229
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,980
did this. Never always pay me. Sure.

230
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,300
Okay. We get the idea.
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Anyways,

231
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,310
so he says,
judging from his somewhat slurred,

232
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,490
repetitive speech and wide set eyes.

233
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,430
I wanted to at first say
fetal alcohol syndrome,

234
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,530
but I think that crazy lokes yeah.

235
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:13,590
More than likely is on the autism spectrum
and probably to the more severe end

236
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,080
of it at that.
Yeah.

237
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,190
His occasional speech disfluency and
intense non blinking eye patterns make me

238
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:26,200
think this seriously. He doesn't
blink, surefire sign right there.

239
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:30,700
He also has some delusions of grandeur
and a general detachment from reality,

240
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:34,060
which are also signs. He's
a bit touched, as you'd say.

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,460
Also watching him spar and his movements
and his rap video lead me to believe he

242
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:43,120
has some form of Dyspraxia,
dyspraxia. How do you say that?

243
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,580
I'm not a medical professional time.

244
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,800
Another symptom of the spectrum which
can manifest itself with difficulties,

245
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,230
understanding movement patterns,
punches directly outputs,

246
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:56,490
ports in this case or things
like handwriting in school,

247
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,990
issues with motor skills, shuffling feet.
Well, spire, sparring, poor balance,

248
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,200
miss time movements,
general flailing about.

249
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,750
This is just one man's opinion, which is
legit to say. Yeah. Any way you slice it.

250
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:14,700
This dude is pretty fucked up of the show.
Keep those genes way up high and tight

251
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,040
by Hitler.
Um,

252
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,780
s I'd rather be retarded.

253
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,290
It's not so bad. Retarded people can
be happy and have good lives. You know,

254
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,830
I take that over GRANDPA's Dick in my
mouth today. Even with the funnel cake.

255
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,010
Yeah, but your GRANDPA's not, he's
not his Dick's. Not In your mouth.

256
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:41,300
In that scenario. He just jacking
you off. Oh right. Yeah, that's true.

257
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,570
That is a little less severe
than second way less severe.

258
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,900
Lowing your grandfather versus just
getting like a nice hand job from him.

259
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,050
Plus his hands are kind of old and softer
to try to do it unless he did a lot of

260
00:18:55,731 --> 00:19:00,110
manual labor and then his hands would
be really hard and it could be calloused

261
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,220
and cross the hands.

262
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,680
But still it's soon as your
grants granddad's hands
like they were nice. So you,

263
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:10,520
we get a nice softy. Hmm. Yeah.
He never had final down ever.

264
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,000
I Dunno. Never brought it
up. Never brought it up. So
this is kind of depressing.

265
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,960
Yeah. It's another funny, funny background
story to a clip that you presented.

266
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:25,730
Thank you. Well, I'm saying,

267
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,660
oh glad I know this.

268
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,050
The depression for me now is that
I don't think I can fight him. No,

269
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,390
but you maybe you can rap battle him

270
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,283
that

271
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,060
it's really good idea, right? Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:43,050
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. All
people out there doing like, well no,

273
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:47,250
not if he's severely mentally affected.

274
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,470
It doesn't, it doesn't mean that it can't
be a good rapper. You don't think so. No.

275
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:53,910
It's just, it just affects
his stop. Remember that kid?

276
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:58,200
The Hay did the rap battle and he was
like, you're like, um, Rosie O'Donnell.

277
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,420
Adda bisexual baby shower.
That guy,

278
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,240
he actually was really good at rapping.
Right? It doesn't mean the clown.

279
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:09,300
I'm going everything. Yeah. But he was
really good. So, yeah. We don't know.

280
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,270
Crazy looks. Could surprise
you. True. He could.

281
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,480
You know what's happened to some creative
at place that you don't know about

282
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,000
because of his autism.
What do you want to bet on it?

283
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,760
It's like a back rub.
My back rub.

284
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,910
You think it will be good? [inaudible]
crazy legs. You don't know. Uh,

285
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,970
speaking of rap battles. Yeah.
Sorry. We got sidetracked.

286
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,620
You sidetrack the hell out of me. This
guy, you know, I thought you have to do,

287
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,740
don't you put grills on when
your teeth are kind of bad?

288
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:44,790
This guy's got great teeth.
He doesn't need to have bad teeth.

289
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,760
Covered a bad teeth or
something like that. Insurance
through like gold ventures.

290
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,470
He's about that life
right now. Oh, okay. Okay.

291
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,620
He did booty booty in the west.

292
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,460
I eat that booty in the
hood. I eat that booty booty.

293
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,350
If a to smell. I don't give a mother
fucking hell. I eat that booty.

294
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,810
He'll definitely eat that booty anywhere.

295
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,880
I like it. It's good, right? Yeah. He's
actually really, it's kind of Nice.

296
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,860
It's charming. He's got,
um, got good stage presence.

297
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,060
I let him be my buddy.
Really? Yeah. Why not? Okay.

298
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,420
I didn't think you were like that.
I'm really not,

299
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:28,980
but I like his enthusiasm and I might
let him just because of it. Jesus. Well,

300
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:32,960
this was submitted by David Camp. Thank
you, David from Twitter. You know what?

301
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:37,961
I'm looking at this Bristol stool chart
today and I think I had a type two

302
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,820
sausage shaped but lumpy.
It was a little lumpy.

303
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,530
What was yours are harder.
You know, they're harder. Oh,

304
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,100
I was definitely like a five or
six because they're a travel.

305
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah. I mean this is, this has
been a bad 24. I know, I know.

306
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:57,990
I've been living with you. You came home
and you started farting. It was just

307
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,870
horrendous. And then he farted in
the bedroom. I couldn't go in there.

308
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:08,640
It was just bad. It was really bad. What
do you think did that to you? I Dunno man.

309
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,860
Just living, you know, um,

310
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,410
probably wasn't the best final day
of eating the org evening, you know,

311
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,880
all that say, see that. But I asked
her yesterday and you're like,

312
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,060
I just had had some chicken
breasts on the plane and uh,

313
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,120
he didn't mention bad eating at the club
the night before the truth comes out

314
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,670
because you said, what did
you eat today? I didn't. Okay,

315
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,230
well Brown lock is on the case,

316
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:38,010
so let's go back in time and
see what caused the nice look

317
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,280
or I left Seattle Tacoma,

318
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,820
uh, which by the way, many, many
thanks to everybody that came there.

319
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,040
Always a good time.
I had a girl came there,

320
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,840
they all came all over me and I had a
great time. They bring in their ges.

321
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,450
Um,
anyways,

322
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,860
it was a great shows the last night,

323
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:06,600
Saturday night I um,
between the second,

324
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,230
the first and second show,
I did have some chicken fingers.

325
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,410
[inaudible] what kind of
dipping sauces they gave you?

326
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,090
Three for me, I think the dipping
sauces as it's what pushes like the,

327
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:20,440
all the mixtures of those strong,

328
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:24,370
tall though they do a different
style chicken breasts. There are two,

329
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,670
one clinic to comb the comedy club.
They don't do

330
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,210
the prepackaged frozen chicken finger.
You're used to,

331
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,830
they take actual like chicken breasts
and so you get like a massive breasts and

332
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:42,710
they, they flower it up and
so it's not as crazy. Yeah.

333
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,130
So I had that and then I had,

334
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,900
um, probably around one 30
in the morning, half of a,

335
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:54,710
an Italian sandwich. Um, and then,

336
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,200
and how many different kinds
of Salamis and there's more,

337
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,380
no, no, that was it for Saturday night.

338
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,860
The next morning I woke up and I was like,
I think I could,

339
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,450
I needed to take a shit, but I, I'm not
quite though. You can feel like, oh,

340
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,170
this feels bad inside of me.
And then I was running late.

341
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,940
So what I did was I just carried that to
the airport and then I didn't even have

342
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:25,520
time to ship before the flight. So
I shit on the plane first. Oh No.

343
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,630
Horrific. Now Walk me through
now you were in first class.

344
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,640
Obviously I'm not a diamond medallion
and were there a lot with our line of

345
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,600
people waiting cause
I'm those short flight,

346
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:41,510
sometimes people stand in
line and it's horrible. Um,

347
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,430
did you feel the pressure
is what I'm saying?

348
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,760
Just take that shit of hurrying through
the shit, which is why I don't show.

349
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,901
I saw this,

350
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:52,460
this lady go up in there and she
was in there while fucking bench.

351
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,330
She was a big bitch too. Like I knew
she was taking a fucking mean growler.

352
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,500
But yeah, by the time she was
done I finally got in there,

353
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,990
um, and it was like, I'm so
big for that size bathroom.

354
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,340
My shoulders touch the wall and like,
and the sink,

355
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,450
I can barely move around in there.
I went to wife and I got shit on my thumb.

356
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,750
So upsetting.
It's so upsetting.

357
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,190
And I'm the worst.
I tried to clean it.

358
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,770
Was it like diarrhea? Yeah,
just pool. So I'm like,

359
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,740
fuck some, you're sitting there
and washing it in the sink.

360
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,730
And then when I pick up my wife and I
do it again, so I'm like, God damn it,

361
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,020
I can grow. So I'm like
cleaning my hand anyways.

362
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:42,890
Then I spend like 10 minutes washing
my hands after that I go back.

363
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,330
But I just don't feel, I don't feel sick,
but I just don't feel great, you know?

364
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:50,030
And also you didn't have your
big day and it's an every day.

365
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,170
So hard to shit now without,
oh, I forgot to mention,

366
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,320
I probably had a couple of drinks too.
Like hard alcohol or beer. Hard alcohol.

367
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,750
Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. Because
I'm going to drink a ton. Yeah,

368
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,480
that'll slap up your shit
real quick. Yeah. And then,

369
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,200
and then so I get off the flight
and I get a coffee. Oh. And then I,

370
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,230
I fucking crazy lugs.
What are you doing? Uh,

371
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,560
you can't do that.
No.

372
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:20,561
So then I get back here
and it's just fart.

373
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,720
Cities are ready to come.
I know I smelled them all.

374
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,040
And then I made you eat pizza. We
ordered a pizza. Yeah. And you that was,

375
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,440
and I was like,
son just got home and you're like,

376
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:32,270
let's eat pizza cause
I don't want to cook.

377
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,720
And it was Sunday and he treats
you well then the far, the far,

378
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,100
it's just came out even more.

379
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,480
And then how he showed up this morning
like five times already twice today. God.

380
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,010
So, but the, here's what I've had today

381
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,350
though,
Kinda of flipped up the game a little bit.

382
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,760
I had some Greek yogurt
just start today. Yeah. Um,

383
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,060
some coffee and then you made a delicious
healthy egg scramble with mushrooms

384
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:02,790
and tomatoes and a piece of, was it
a plum? Yeah. It's delicious. Yeah.

385
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,370
So, so far today doing good.
Never not shitting. Never know.

386
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:10,680
That's your Twitter handle.
Yeah.

387
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,330
You're always shitting. That's not
true. Every time I talked to you,

388
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:18,300
we're having a nice moment.
We're cuddling with the kid or the dog,

389
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,200
like we're having a nice family moment
and you're always like, I gotta Shit.

390
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,850
I gotta I gotta go, I gotta take a shit.
People Shit. Yeah, but not as much as you.

391
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,590
Lately, I feel like you've been shitting
a lot more than most people. I don't shit

392
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,120
more than most people. I think so. Um,

393
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,270
I kind of feel like I got a,

394
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,260
uh,

395
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,800
I feel like I got to pull back
when had crazy looks challenge.

396
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,640
I can't stop thinking about it. Yeah. I
don't think it'd be safe to fight him.

397
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,430
Well, like I said, I mean
maybe a rap battle instead.

398
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
All right.

399
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,640
Maybe. Maybe it might be,
it might be too intense.

400
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,130
He got really mad at that guy in
that video. He got really mad. Yeah.

401
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,550
That's somebody that's not stable,
Tom. And that's the guy that knows him,

402
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,940
you know? Yeah. Okay.
Um, speaking of poop.

403
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,350
Okay.

404
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,730
Oh,
look who's there.

405
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,540
Look who it is. Yeah. Look who it is

406
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,860
alive and well in Argentina.
Answering blogs,

407
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,350
answering Vlogs,

408
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,780
like ending the rumors.

409
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,640
Now did he invent that mustache
or was that a mustache? No,

410
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,280
at the time it was a fight for them. No,
I think my grandfather had a mustache.

411
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:40,010
Like I read it

412
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,000
about the mustache. You did. Why
it and why he initially went to it.

413
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,900
Because in a, when he was in the army, um,

414
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,450
I guess leading up
through World War One a,

415
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,500
they had to have gas masks and he had a
bushy mustache and it wouldn't allow the

416
00:28:57,951 --> 00:29:02,670
mask to seal so trimmed it. Gotcha.
A lot of guys done did it. Oh,

417
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:07,120
okay. Yeah. All right. And
then you, now you've got this
really cool mustache. Yeah.

418
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,060
It's fashion forward.
Yeah. So, um, you know,

419
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,960
yeah. Don't, don't be, don't be
quick to judge this guy down.

420
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:20,190
Hey Hillary. So turns
out, look, look jeans.

421
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,720
I know,
I see.

422
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,880
Our man was in the pool.

423
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,520
That's what they say. Uh, turns

424
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,450
out there's these stories coming
out that he had a micro penis,

425
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,620
which I don't know how I discovered this,
but on top of that,

426
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:41,621
he was a fan of hoop and women
or women to stand over him while

427
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,330
he was lying on the floor and have
them defecate on him. He believed that.

428
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,170
You know what though,
I've also read things where a lot of,

429
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,370
they always want to do this with a
unpopular figures in history is make them

430
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:57,790
insane. It's like, it's
like it stops, it comes out.

431
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:01,030
It's not necessarily true is when I was
saying to demonize further demonize the

432
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:04,600
shitty person, you know,
you can say anything about
Heller. Nobody's gonna be like,

433
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:08,030
wait a minute, I know the guy and
he's not into that stuff. You know?

434
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,470
It's like I would just a way to
go. Can we take it easy guys?

435
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,710
You're being too rough on me.

436
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,910
Can I just keep hearing all these
mean things said about this guy? Um,

437
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,910
so you know, and this is the same document
where they describe his micro penis.

438
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,510
I don't know.
I said this,

439
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,970
the practice of this perversion represents
the lowest depth of degradation.

440
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,360
I guess. You really, you really are.
The piggy is peg of all. I think so.

441
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:44,500
I think Scott stuff is the
weirdest in my opinion. You know,

442
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,220
it does do anything.
I don't think it needs to be just,

443
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,530
I don't think you need to
qualify it in my opinion.

444
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,450
You're the foulest motherfucker.
Shit, it's wrong. It's taboo.

445
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,660
Yeah. So right here you can
actually picture her dumping on him.

446
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,580
Ava Bond. Yeah. I don't know.
I don't, I don't think so.

447
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:08,720
I don't think he was in all of that.

448
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:13,160
I think he was into killing Jews and
that's it. That's it. I don't know.

449
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,640
I believe that he was upset
with him. I do, I believe.

450
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,710
What do you think? He's into
me kind of. Hey, not poop.

451
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,980
Like I really sweats himself. Oof.
Maddie mcconaughey loves himself son.

452
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:31,340
Matthew mcconaughey. Yeah. But he, he
definitely, he sweats himself pretty hard.

453
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:35,570
He masturbates to himself a lot. I think
so, yeah. In the Lincoln and the Lincoln.

454
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,580
I just like these cars.
I've been,

455
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,700
I've been into these Lincolns
since before they paid me too.

456
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,610
I was jerking off in my Lincoln.
He is so fucking into math and Kona.

457
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,900
Hey. Yeah, I know. And, and
Lincoln's. No, and I'd say,

458
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,110
I do believe that he loves
his Lincoln. Um, yeah.

459
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,030
Yeah. So would you do what I was
going, well, I did some shows.

460
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,830
I went, uh, I did the ice
house. I did the comedy store.

461
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:09,300
I did full pairs, had lunch with
Sarah Burns who's been on the show.

462
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,620
We had Mexican food. That
was pretty interesting. Yeah.
And hung out with the kid.

463
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:18,300
Man. You know, he's, he's a
full time Gig. Three month old.

464
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,160
Oh, our kid, that one. Oh
yeah. Yeah. He's Super Rad.

465
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
My Dad came over with my
uncle Steve and that was fun.

466
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,760
What was your, what'd your dad say? Nice
House. This is nice. You know, you know,

467
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,310
they don't really, my family's not
very effusive. Nice. This is good.

468
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:40,190
As it's going to get them.
Yeah.

469
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,630
Yeah. But he's really into ls boy.
My Dad. Really no good. This kid,

470
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,540
this kid wants to move.
This kid is going to be walking soon.

471
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,720
Kind of curious to see your dad like that.
It's so rare.

472
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,530
He never is that adoring ever.
He wasn't like,

473
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,850
he's not like one of these guy got
Google guys. No, but it's cool to see.

474
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,240
I think when your dad's become
grandparents, they tend to chill. Yeah. I,

475
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:06,680
they become a little bit softer, which
is cool to see. You should get softer,

476
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,660
you know, as you get older. Yeah. Nothing
more terrifying than somebody that,

477
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,000
that doesn't get softer
now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,990
And he is happening to him. Yeah. It's
nice to see. Yeah, it's really cute.

479
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:25,550
He's really in, in our, our son. Yeah.
It's nice. Yeah. This is the good kid.

480
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,950
Good kid. Some boy. Nice.

481
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,160
Everybody on my family thinks that the
kid looks like you and everybody in your

482
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:35,380
family think the kid looks like me. No.
Weird. Yeah. I don't know why that is. Um,

483
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,730
by the way, uh, uh, do
you remember of course,

484
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:44,900
this clip from a,
uh,

485
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,550
a while back in the show?

486
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,140
A shock you on Chinese?

487
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,710
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, that was really
loud. I don't know why that's so loud.

488
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,900
I shock you. Like Chinese. Me. Oh,

489
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,360
and if you don't remember,
we did a whole episode on this guy.

490
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Turns out he was kind of a crazy
person and he was known for,

491
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:08,220
I'm going to restaurants and I
think this is Melbourne, Australia,

492
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,230
and eating elaborate meals and then
being like, I don't have any money,

493
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,880
like my drug that I like to do.

494
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,370
He would get arrested.
So this was, you know,

495
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,380
a clear from that we were sent a video,

496
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,660
a remix of his arrest to
music. No, that's always fun.

497
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,140
Yeah. I think it's actually,
oh yeah, it's back there.

498
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,180
Here it is here. Um, so this guy, yeah,

499
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:41,980
it was [inaudible]. This was like one
of the best clips ever on the show.

500
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,560
And somebody made a
song. Hi. So remix song.

501
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,010
Does this guy,
do you remember it actually of Hungarian

502
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,930
descent? Of course it does. Of course.
Crazy. And it was a chess master. Oh,

503
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,460
okay. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

504
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,690
The Hungarians are great at chess and
polo water polo and acting crazy and crazy

505
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,310
shit. Yeah. We don't give a fuck. Yeah.

506
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,950
And then he told them here he
was telling the news cameras.

507
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,750
I had to suck your led Chinese man.

508
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,260
Get y'all hand off my penis.

509
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,030
It was submitted by Tony Mcfadden fall.

510
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,340
It's on his youtube channel.

511
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,870
Well,
Mondo Judo,

512
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,840
Chinese Kudo,
Josh Bullock.

513
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,733
Kudos.

514
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,200
Kudos.
Fantastic.

515
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,820
That's really good song actually. Good
job, dude. That's how my dad said.

516
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,250
I showed him the bid
day. He's like, oh good.

517
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,340
I'm going to come over here
to shit now. Oh, he did? Yeah.

518
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,830
Because he lives closer now. He's like,
well, I'm pulling me minutes away.

519
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:44,750
I can save my shed for your
house and like, thank you. Yeah.

520
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:49,751
It's so funny is how cold my family is
compared to like how we are with our kid.

521
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,680
I was watching my uncle and my dad
yesterday just sitting on our couch.

522
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:57,370
Just ice cold gangster. His
Hungarian style. Eastern bloc.

523
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,610
Fucking hardcore. Yeah. Dude. Like my,

524
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:04,520
our son's never gonna know
that sweethearts. No. Yeah,

525
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,990
the killer. Nice. Yeah. Yeah.
Nice. Good place called. That's it.

526
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah. Such gangsters. Yeah.

527
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,280
Remember when you met my ex mom? She's
Hungarian too. You were like Ice Queen.

528
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,760
Yeah, but that's not, she's
not like, that's how they all,

529
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,340
that's pretty Hungarian. That's just
standard dude. Because if you smile,

530
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:31,360
they see it as a sign of weakness. Like
eastern blockers. If you're like, hi,

531
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:33,880
I'm Christina. And they're like,
this girl is a fucking retarded.

532
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,920
They think you're retarded and
weak. That's so sad. Horrible. Yeah.

533
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,860
Well, if you look at Putin, like
if you watch how it's this. Yeah.

534
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,480
The Russians similar. Yeah. They
think you're just a week pussy.

535
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,380
If you show any kind of vulnerable
valuation for your stupid yeah,

536
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,820
like whenever we go to restaurants and
a waitress would be kind like high faux

537
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:58,630
can I,
what is faux fuck you don't call me Fox.

538
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,390
Like they're just so upset

539
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,770
and like they get super
mad and like did you um,

540
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,010
leave any room for dessert or like when
they ask you that question like, oh,

541
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,330
like there's so offended by it.
So funny.

542
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,950
I guess in Hungary they will ask you that.
Yeah.

543
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,320
I mean it's just all about
how you're raised. Right.

544
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:21,760
So I mean really your reaction to things
is it's based on your own environment

545
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:25,240
and culture. Yeah. That's a
pretty hard culture. Hard.

546
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:28,090
I didn't realize it until I had
been with you for the last 11 years.

547
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,650
I was a baby. Yeah, he's cute.

548
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:36,030
Good looking baby. This is a
good look to move. And your uncle

549
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,810
okay. Cut. Yeah,

550
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,780
he's a little softer because he travels
and he's like kind of more hippy leaning

551
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:43,230
a little.

552
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,450
Yeah. I think, you know, he's a little,

553
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:50,050
he goes to India and he went
to go on like yeah, you know.

554
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,600
But no,

555
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,360
my dad's all about the neon track suits
and those who are so funny together.

556
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,390
Ice Cold. I like seeing your,
your dad and your uncle together.

557
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,120
Such a trap man.

558
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,720
Especially hanging out with your family
where you guys are a little more normal

559
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,780
and Americanized. Like I didn't
realize how cold my family was.

560
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,330
Just like ice.
We would probably be colder.

561
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,900
We're probably a little warmer because
of my mom's side of the family cause

562
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,390
they're really,
that's the other end of the spectrum.

563
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:23,290
And now for sure Latins in the best.
Yeah. They're always like hug and kiss.

564
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,920
I love it up at all.
I know.

565
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,830
Yeah. All that stuff. Like

566
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,253
that's cute.

567
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,720
Latin soul into lobbying everything.
He's four

568
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,800
so love culture, man. It's,
you know, it's tied into,

569
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:50,801
I think it's some of the root is in
how much they adore their mothers.

570
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,450
That's that Virgin Mary
Catholic maternal a society.

571
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,740
It's very virgin Mary. That's
absolutely true. Yeah, for sure.

572
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,800
So it's always, you
know, the virgin money.

573
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,290
And then there's just very affectionate.
It's a very affectionate, you know,

574
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:07,610
you greet people with kisses.

575
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,380
Oh yeah. Hungarians do too.
So by that theory we should
be sweeter, but we're not,

576
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,740
you know, she kisses and all that. Yeah.

577
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,740
Yeah. I don't know if men, I don't
think men do that to men though.

578
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,770
It's considered kind of gay. Right. Do an
origin. Tina. Thank you, Amanda to men,

579
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:24,870
which is really weird to me and aren't,

580
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,740
were Hitler lives like Hillary
will do it when he says hi to you,

581
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:34,050
like if you see Hitler and
you say hi, he'll give you a
kiss on the cheek. But, um,

582
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,940
I didn't experience it anywhere else
with men, just Argentina. I'm never,

583
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,000
never improved. Never. And um,

584
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,120
definitely never in Spain it
was always just the women.

585
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,650
I just had this vision of like, when
you go to Peru and they grab your Dick,

586
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,440
is that what they do? Yeah.
That's the common thing. Like
if you're a painter, yeah.

587
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,370
They go, hello. And they all
law and grab your deck. Yeah.

588
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,680
And then if they know you, they'll blow
you. That's what I heard. And Yeah.

589
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,820
You know what's neat about my country
of origin is hungry is like the porno

590
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:11,200
capital. It is the world. I don't
know. I married a Hungarian woman.

591
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,830
My favorite, my best friend in the
whole would have been married to him.

592
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,640
Think about it. He married a, been
married. He married a Hungarian.

593
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,180
I'm not living in Hungary though,
but I'm saying like,

594
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,850
let's say your parents hadn't left
Hungary and you were born there.

595
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,980
You could be married to Rocco.
Right. Okay. Yeah. That's
okay. That's a possibility.

596
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,500
You know,
I heard the porno industry happened there.

597
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,810
It's because the Russian mafia,
once a communism ended,

598
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:39,730
the Russians came in and just started
doing all that business there.

599
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,120
They took over. He's so legendary.
The Rocco. Yeah, I know. Well,

600
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:47,630
he's out of retirement now. He's back in
the game. Right. I thought I heard that.

601
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,860
No, just behind the scenes. He's
done. He left his mark. Yeah.

602
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,950
Can I tell you a funny story
about Red Ban? Red Band?
Yeah. It just reminded me, um,

603
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,470
I was at the comedy store there at night
and apparently Jerry Seinfeld stopped

604
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:05,420
in to do a spot and he did like a Q
and a session. It was pretty crazy.

605
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:05,781
First of all.

606
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:10,100
So people know that Seinfeld was a
normally drop in and in that way, no.

607
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,620
You know it's not a common
everyone else does but not,

608
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,780
and I had heard also just to make,

609
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,420
to make the point of how
big of a deal this was.

610
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,140
He hasn't been to the store since like 79.

611
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,110
That's what they were saying.
So not a lot of that.

612
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,470
Yeah there's a lot of drama between the
Improv and the comedy store back in that

613
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,890
era about being a paid regular at one
club wouldn't let you do the other.

614
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,620
And then what happened
to the comedy store?

615
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,770
Some crazy booker was holding the reins
to that place and like wouldn't let

616
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,060
major acts do drop ins cause they weren't
quote passed by Mitzi who's the owner

617
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:41,900
of the comedy store.

618
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,500
So like you'd have like Sarah Silverman
wanting to come and do drop ins at the

619
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:48,800
comedy store 10 years ago and this
book or we'll be like, no you can't.

620
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,160
And so that guy, you know, he,

621
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:54,620
he's gone now and the doors have open
so now it's like become a better place.

622
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:59,120
But anyways, so Seinfeld was there,
which was a huge deal. Huge deal.

623
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,810
And he's doing like this Q and a with
the comics afterwards in the audience I

624
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:03,644
guess.

625
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,660
And our friend Brian Red Ban
raised his hand and goes,

626
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,950
I have a question.
Do you wipe standing up or sitting down?

627
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,870
Hilarious. I think it's so funny. I
apparently not in a lot of people. Agreed.

628
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,210
Yeah. And people can see, I think he
walked Seinfeld then he was like cyber,

629
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,020
all the answered it and it was like,
all right, I gotta go. That was the last

630
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,490
good job. Good job. It was really,
I thought it was really funny.

631
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,240
I would have been like a,
I have a question.

632
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:44,300
Do you jerk off to your portion in
them are just looking at them? Yeah.

633
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,040
Seriously. How much money does
that guy have? Um, I mean, he has,

634
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,750
I don't know. There's, there's
different, you know, uh, accounts,

635
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:58,751
but I think he's probably in
the high nine figures for sure.

636
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,170
And Jay Leno. Yeah. Supercars too.

637
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:09,350
He loves his cars. I haven't touched
any of way tonight. Show money.

638
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,750
It's been my standard line. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, they love cars,

639
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:22,120
man. Yeah. So just, uh, he just
sold some cars this weekend,
so I felt it was needed.

640
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,900
He auctioned off some of
his, uh, Porsche's. Aww.

641
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,160
Good for him for a lot of
money. Wow. Yeah, he has like,

642
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,280
he needs the collector.

643
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,150
Well, he said he was, he wanted to put
them back into circulation. He goes,

644
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,380
I've enjoyed them. It's time
that I respect that too.
It seems like a nice dude.

645
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,200
I don't think there's anything wrong
with that guy. No, I don't either.

646
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,800
And I think, I believe that he's
probably like, I've had these a while,

647
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,390
he's probably just put it back out there.
So all of them.

648
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,390
But I love that Bryan asked that question.
Sorry.

649
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,960
Do you wipe sitting down or standing up?

650
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,290
And he answered it right and he
answered it, I think like, all right,

651
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,650
that's enough assholes. Did they?
They walked him, which is Brian.

652
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,120
People are mad.
People weren't happy about that.

653
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,650
Other comics were upset with Brian.
That's really funny. I liked it.

654
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,850
I liked it a lot.
That's hilarious.

655
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:17,160
You know you were watching
that documentary on twins.

656
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,830
It was twins that didn't know
that they had a twin sister.

657
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,820
It's called twin stars.
And then Lex, this um,

658
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,940
came in here,
let's see who,

659
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,260
who sent this twins were swimming by

660
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,800
a whole bunch of people. Okay.
It's kind of just weird. These,

661
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,870
these are two identical twins,

662
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,430
but the kind that barely
ever leave each other's side.

663
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,440
It's so gray gardens.
Yeah. It's really, really,

664
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,340
it's kind of just odd to
watch their act and speed.

665
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,433
This kind of shit.

666
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,720
Yeah.
32 and they've hardly ever been apart.

667
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,880
It's just one time when they were 17,

668
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,400
one of the swearing hospital
getting now appendix out.

669
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,550
But Bridget used to come every
visiting hours when I could,

670
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,510
but if I was allowed to sleep there,
I would have, they talk funny.

671
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,470
Yeah. Can accent is that master
of accent is all the heirs are,

672
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,570
oh, Jay could by news Aylien oh
yeah. It could be. Don't know.

673
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,150
It's hard to tell the Kiwi and the
Aussie. Um, well no, I can, you can.

674
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,720
Sorry. Master of accents.
There are so creepy. A retard.

675
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,550
Maybe not retard able to,
yeah, I mean, Crepe is, that's,

676
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,870
you know, this is more than I can
Sklar brothers handle, you know?

677
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,680
I mean there really are not just,

678
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,360
they're not just finishing
each other's sentences,

679
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:58,380
they're just talking over it and it's the
same. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Yeah.

680
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,900
I liked,
I liked watching them bicycle tandem.

681
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:05,520
Do you think they rub 'em out together
the same day, but that's so rude.

682
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,990
Yes.
I think they do,

683
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,580
but it's an impossible date.
One of these girls, you can't,

684
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,810
no way they're going to,

685
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,400
they're going to be tethered to each
other until they're on our deathbeds.

686
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,210
These two, they're going to ruin
their own lives. They would do,

687
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:23,130
if one of them did meet somebody
and talk to him,

688
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,040
she would say, well, you have
to have a friend. Oh yeah.

689
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,160
You know,
these two are going to be old

690
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,210
and together. It's adorable. It is

691
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:33,980
children.

692
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,510
They resisted efforts to price them
apart apparently when we were little,

693
00:47:38,511 --> 00:47:40,280
mom did separators as one rent.

694
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:45,290
Little total is one state
at an [inaudible] and we
just just stopped swearing

695
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,580
and that's when we were little
by ladies in of screaming.

696
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,660
And then when they put us back
with ticket, we are happy.

697
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,290
Wow. That's so cool. By
creepiest shit. Crazy.

698
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,040
They're like, what is that
movie Jack Nicholson in the
shining. The shining twins

699
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:13,250
girls. Little creepy. Yeah.
Well that's so crazy. I know.

700
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,100
I like that. This lady looks
like you. I like your haircut.

701
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:22,760
I'm going to get that. I love the front
swirl. That's the mom cut for sure.

702
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,860
Has Your expression, and you guys
have the same now my favorite,

703
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:31,820
just the back hair here is really nice
and I think my father has his haircut.

704
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,640
Well to me it just says lady,
this is Eastern European tennis player.

705
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,430
This is Ethan Lendl. Right. Then Lendl
have this just to your hair differently.

706
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:48,230
Right. And whenever I see that, I'm like,
you're just doing this to yourself. Well,

707
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:52,700
she's fully resigned to mom hood.
You can see here she's wearing the Hoodie,

708
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,590
but she's still tying it. It's weird.
It doesn't want anyone to know sex.

709
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,550
This is a look that says, do not come
near me with a penis. Ever. Ever, ever.

710
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,330
You know, I figured out why
mom's dress frumpy, mom fashion.

711
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,620
Especially if you're a breastfeeding,

712
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:10,670
it's because you have to access your
boobs all the time and there's not no cute

713
00:49:10,671 --> 00:49:13,850
stuff,
but she's given up for sure.

714
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,690
She doesn't need her boobs to come out
anymore. No, no, no, no, no. This is,

715
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:20,510
she's almost the dude at this point.
It's really close.

716
00:49:20,511 --> 00:49:24,200
She might be transitioning. You don't
know because I haven't played the

717
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,520
game on my [inaudible] took place.

718
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:37,550
Well, I'm happy to put your
mind. Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

719
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,770
It's really, it's really bad.
And here's the thing, okay. Okay.

720
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,960
You don't have to be a
supermom as saying that.

721
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:49,100
And I'm not shitting on her for like, I'm
shitting. Here's what I'm shitting on.

722
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,540
Just try all it is. Work with
what God gave you. You know,

723
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,370
just try a little man. If you want to be
a woman, if you want to be heterosexual,

724
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,060
I don't know if she, why don't you
tell everybody about your dream?

725
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,370
I dreamt that some other guy busted nuts
in me and I didn't know who it was and

726
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,890
then I got pregnant again and I was like,
oh,

727
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:11,630
I have to tell Tom and I'm pregnant again.

728
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,630
It's a dream vein. Well, let's
see what she, what she has to say.

729
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,250
What does this nice man

730
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:24,090
at school, they teach us,
couldn't believe it was school.

731
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,450
We're sitting at the same table and
they accused you of cheating because I

732
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,350
thought we were all looking at
one another and sailing. Now he's

733
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,550
questions. No, we rub the die and cheap.

734
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,840
So they split us up and they gave,

735
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,540
is it different for not,
not be exactly the same questions,

736
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:52,541
what we hadn't before and where we came
out with the same answers and questions

737
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:59,890
and, and I would just
shop together and I said,

738
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,733
sorry.

739
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,550
Oh my God, it's so weird. So weird.

740
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,630
They didn't really let that guy talk
at the beginning of [inaudible].

741
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,850
Gentleman was going to
say something again.

742
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,480
How do you think his tennis game is?
This guy doesn't even speak.

743
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,520
Holy Shit.
Some parts of the Midwest.

744
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:25,480
This is the norm. Where do
you think this chick? A Guy,

745
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,770
what do you think it is?

746
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,840
Nice human gets their haircut and
what did they say when they walk in?

747
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,790
Do you know what to do? Waiting. They
say it's gimme the tennis player.

748
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,530
Give me the tennis player.
Yeah.

749
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,810
Gimme a ATP top five 1989 rock it out.

750
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,780
That is an egg in 89 90 haircut.
Of course,

751
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,780
Jesus. It's all as a Midwesterner.
There's a lot of ladies in the Midwest.

752
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:01,180
Oh yeah. Here we go. Sam
Kennison lookalike women. Oh No,

753
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:05,620
the last, Jesus Christ.
I don't know. Again,

754
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:08,470
I'm not knocking her,
but all of a sudden this still,

755
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,690
this still is more a feminine,

756
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:16,300
you know it's also a little lady di
circuit nuts. He know what it is.

757
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:21,250
I think she was going for Lady Diana
at 1980 and you know it looks dated.

758
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,880
It's a little dated. Is it? No, it's
very dated. What I'm saying is though,

759
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:30,220
as far as the stills go,
this one is more dude,

760
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,490
and this one is before she transitioned.
This is a woman

761
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,150
because here's,
here's what would fix this.

762
00:52:37,151 --> 00:52:40,210
I'm just saying grow the hair
out just a little more. Yeah.

763
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,820
I need to cut my ears out
so that I can hear. Well,

764
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,280
when you see my hair fall over,

765
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:51,560
my ears cut them out so that
could hear stuff that is so much.

766
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,880
Otherwise I don't hear anything. That's
what it is. Because being a woman,

767
00:52:57,881 --> 00:53:00,910
there's not a lot of utility in our
clothing and there was no utility in our

768
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,390
hair. There's no utility and wearing
makeup. Right. So when a woman gives up,

769
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:08,860
she's going all function over form
function for sure. Fuck you. Fuck.

770
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,040
There's hear nothing.
Yeah.

771
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,660
It's all function at her, at her
appointment. I guess a terrible haircut.

772
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,090
It's actually the only thing really.
She needs to it to try with it.

773
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:25,380
Just get a fucking haircut. The haircut,
it's bad. It's really bad. But then, okay,

774
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,010
she's Ozzy

775
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,270
and you can afford it. You
got a nice microwave. Yeah,

776
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,500
we're have a friend that can do it for
you. Yeah. Just grow it out a little,

777
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,510
but a lot. Ozzie women, I hate to say this
too, I've seen a lot of stuff they, yeah,

778
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,280
yeah. They got this haircut,
the outback steakhouse

779
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:48,420
and half back. We don't need long.
Huh? This is not an Ozzy cut though.

780
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,550
Yeah.
You just said it's a Midwestern guy.

781
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,250
It's a Midwest then it's Australia
because there's a lot of parts of their

782
00:53:53,251 --> 00:53:57,810
remote in Australia, like the
Midwest, so basically and uh,

783
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,640
in remote locations,

784
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,910
Indiana and Illinois and Australia.

785
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,360
Path path. Yeah. I Ayers rock hits
where you're going to see it as kind of,

786
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,230
uh, I think crocodile dundees hair
was like this still hasn't it done?

787
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,850
Dundee had a nice custom feathers.
Yeah. It says the feathery look. Yeah.

788
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:23,700
This is the ultimate,
I don't want to touch a dig ever.

789
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:28,730
Let's see if she's anything between
stream of married life together.

790
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:31,090
Well,

791
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:36,090
my plan is probably just next door to
one another and have the exactly same

792
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,740
identical house.

793
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,360
Even now furniture probably
being the same spots

794
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,070
or by a creation.

795
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,950
Helpful to have a real huge
be combing or live together.

796
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,660
Aw, wonder, would it be like
to double team them? Yeah.

797
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:58,440
He should ask. Well, I mean, I can't
ask him. We can just talk about it.

798
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,780
Like I wonder if they do the same,

799
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,870
but I want you to ask them that
question and just see. I'd love to,

800
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,820
but I wonder if like,
if,

801
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,930
if like she starts eating your
booty and then she's like,

802
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,630
she knows what to do or does she
wait her turn, you know, like, no,

803
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:13,980
they think it's simultaneous.

804
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,440
So you think she tries to do at
the same time or no, it was like,

805
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:19,650
I got to get on the balls and cock
right now. Oh my God. I don't know Tom.

806
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,840
It's a really interesting question
now I really thought provoking me.

807
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,860
Fund the Double Dip.
Let's do it on nasty, Bro.

808
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:29,520
Let's talk about it to move from one to
the other. Boop, boop. And they're like,

809
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:34,440
yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and in
unison. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

810
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:38,530
yeah, yeah, yeah. Right in there. Right in
that right. And that right there, right?

811
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:39,364
Yeah.

812
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,640
Okay.
Um,

813
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,070
yeah,
they're cute.

814
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:49,130
They're going to live together for the
rest of their lives and then one of them

815
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:51,410
dies and it's going to be horrendous.
Yeah.

816
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:55,820
And then the other one will be like done.
Yeah. Done. It must be nice to have,

817
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,420
but it must be nice to have like someone
that you're so as a coach to them for

818
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:03,920
Titus 25 years.

819
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,863
Okay.

820
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,220
Australia's premier tennies
players. They're all so
identical. Twins. Same Becky.

821
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,063
And

822
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,580
she doesn't say anything. That's one.
They both both serve pretty nice.

823
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,960
Have a nice set of

824
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:33,490
it's bad. Yeah, it's bad.
Boy, I'm gonna say Minnesota.

825
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,610
This is a Minnesota look.
Not Everybody. Right.

826
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,880
But basically if you leave Minneapolis,
this is the state here.

827
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,800
It definitely is.
And I know this from the airports,

828
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:50,560
like when I've been hanging out, I lived
in Minnesota. You're not that wrong.

829
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,350
Wisconsin, Nebraska. I've seen
this in a couple of packers games.

830
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,380
Yup. What do you, hey, here's
what we're going to play.

831
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,130
What kind of footwear is she
wearing? Oh Man. It's real sensible.

832
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,940
And like you said,
really nothing acute going on down there.

833
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,550
Um, she's probably either
wearing burkin stocks,

834
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,320
toe shoes,

835
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,140
or like really pat like
heavy orthopedic tenant,

836
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,380
orthopedic mother, the
straps, the many layers.

837
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,910
Think about the Velcro is
easy on,

838
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,720
easy off. Yeah. What do you
think your panties look like?

839
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:39,100
They're sensible. They're big.
They're not a pretty color.

840
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:43,270
They're not like pink or fun happening.
She's got, I got chocolate brown.

841
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,640
Does that matches my dicky? Whoa. A year.

842
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:52,420
Me. Shouldn't we be getting a call
from those guys bringing our TV?

843
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,880
Now you know what people
have been asking us.

844
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,780
Why haven't you covered
the Downton series finale?

845
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:00,250
Why haven't you covered how so far?

846
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:03,610
It's one way we don't have our TV's
hooked up yet. We just moved in.

847
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:07,900
So it's going to be a minute. Hopefully
today. Yeah. I supposed to be today.

848
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,160
We don't have TVS.
We haven't seen the Downton.

849
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:16,850
We haven't seen house of farts. I know
he's been out for 10 days, so bummed out.

850
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,220
I'm so mad. It took a lot of
resistance to not, you know,

851
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,910
jump online and watch. Oh,
right. A lot. Uh, you know, uh,

852
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,610
discipline, discipline. So
not to resist watching it. I'm
so glad he did. Yeah. Yeah.

853
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,470
Cause I want to watch it on the
big, on the big stream maybe. Yeah.

854
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,970
I want the baby jeans goes to sleep. We
can catch one episode night and catch up.

855
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:41,130
That'd be fun. Oh my God. It's tremendous.
Railey and wondering what Claire Is.

856
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:43,690
Bud Hall smells like this season.
It's got to get better.

857
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:47,170
It gets better with every year. Yeah.
And there's probably scenes of her,

858
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,370
I'm sure they incorporated that
into the story where she's like,

859
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,940
oh I'm the president's wife.
Presidential ass smells.

860
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,810
It makes people come up the
stairs and Neil remember orange.

861
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:04,700
You see they had orgies in the other
seasons already. Not Orgy three ways,

862
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,190
like the first season. She's like,
you need this. And then they do it.

863
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,070
They did it with one of their secret
service guys. Dude. Cause he's leans,

864
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:18,080
he's ACDC is my dad says
suit about cock double cock.

865
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,440
Yeah. Do you think we could get
into that kind of lifestyle? Yeah.

866
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:32,150
Yeah. I'm Paulina by of course.
What about her? Could she join in?

867
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,820
I think that'd be like one for you to
test drive and then, you know, here,

868
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,510
I'd like to hear the report afterwards.

869
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,790
Didn't you get offered to go
to some BDSM clubs? Yes I did.

870
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:48,360
I met really cool couple.
Um,

871
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,330
it's like everyone had left except for
six, eight people after the show Friday.

872
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:57,490
Yeah. And this couple was talking
and then I was there with a,

873
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:59,540
a comic named Amy Miller.
Really funny.

874
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:04,610
And she was talking to the lady and
somehow through their conversation,

875
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:09,260
uh, led to, they're like, oh yeah, we do
porn. And I was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa,

876
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:15,560
Whoa, wow. Washed is bullshit. And then we
just started talking and they were like,

877
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:18,890
of course the most,
um,

878
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,540
like laid back, cool,
warm, all always made,

879
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,880
no big kind of thing of it.
And then they're like, oh,

880
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:29,870
we're hosting this a BDSM party tomorrow.
You guys want to come?

881
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,350
And I was like, that would be a lot of
fun. And they were like, oh, swing by.

882
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:37,760
I'm like, I dunno man. I
go, I got a late show here.

883
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:42,080
I'm going to be showing up at like 2:00
AM what am I going to do at a BDSM part

884
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:46,070
is like, it's just fun to watch.
I don't know. It's kind of like,

885
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:48,590
I remember in first year in
college in San Francisco,

886
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:51,170
they have this thing called
the exotic erotic ball,

887
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:55,900
which is like their version of
that around Halloween. And uh,

888
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,550
my friends and I were like, we're
going to go, we bought tickets.

889
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,640
And if you're not really
participating in something like that,

890
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:05,890
it's so fucking uncomfortable cause it,
the room just smells like a hot diaper.

891
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:10,790
I look so gross. I would like to
go, people watched at that thing.

892
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:15,540
But the thing is, I think if, if
you're a non participant and you're,

893
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,680
and you're watching people, then they're
like, whoa, what the fuck are you doing?

894
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,910
That's rude. You just be like,
Nah, I'm watching you be weird.

895
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,630
Yeah. So I'm not against doing
it. They were super nice.

896
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:29,360
So I really do appreciate the invite.
Very nice.

897
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,540
I wish it would go to a BDSM party.
Yeah.

898
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:37,510
And then use all of a sudden you're just
scrolling online and you see me, uh,

899
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,700
strapped and leather hanging from a, from
a ceiling, Tom. And you're like, what,

900
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,980
where, when did you do this?
I'm like, Oh yeah, I forgot
I did that. Like all casual,

901
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:49,760
you know, that was a while ago.
How long ago? Like three weeks ago.

902
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,470
You know how many people will
be in you? I think so. I did.

903
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,350
The bear community are huge
in that community already.

904
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,170
Huge and huge in that
community. I'm no Maca SF. Oh,

905
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,130
that guy was the best. We were supposed
to have him on the show. Mac. Yeah.

906
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,730
In San Francisco.
I think we want it.

907
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:11,620
We invited him out because his
boyfriend was was right. Yeah.

908
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,640
We got to get back with that.
Yeah.

909
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,100
Four years later we definitely should
reach out again. He was great. The number

910
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,690
that the boyfriend sent, um,
some clips we were like, whoa.

911
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,170
He's intense.
Yeah.

912
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:31,171
He's real intense scenes and like
bathrooms with four dudes and yeah,

913
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,940
it's really beefy and a lot of,
you know,

914
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,610
you share a lot of that stuff.
A lot of that stuff. This is

915
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,130
actually from a Mac. I
sat right here. This is,

916
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:42,603
oh,

917
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,250
wrap your head around
that sound for a second.

918
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,470
That's not Mac.
That's the other thing.

919
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,243
Yeah.

920
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:56,040
You've never heard that sound and
your own personal life, right?

921
01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:00,110
Oh,
I mean that is eh and S.

922
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:09,460
Yes sir. That is Mac. SF.
Yeah, that's the other guy.

923
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:12,920
Yeah, look at it. Sure. M a. C. K. S.

924
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,740
If even if you want to see some real shit,
it's intense.

925
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,550
It is not like a, you know, novice level.

926
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,470
It's a really fucking, yeah.
It was gnarly. This is,

927
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,260
this is the pros man. This fear, if
you're into the amateur stuff, don't.

928
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,723
Nah,

929
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,933
no.

930
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:37,603
Oh Geez.
Scott.

931
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:43,700
Yeah. Yep. Just put it in there.

932
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,890
It makes you think you're
really missing out in life.

933
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:48,590
You know when you listen to those clips.
Yeah. Like what have I been doing?

934
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:52,400
And now that, yeah, that no one's, no
one's talked to me like that before.

935
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:00,830
Wow. I eat the ass and busy all the
time. I got nothing. There you go.

936
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,650
Excellent. Yoshi too. I
ran into him last week.

937
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,740
I'm in a black woman in Yoshi last
week series. Tell your story first.

938
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,070
I just saw how many came out from the
Middle East. He had some crazy stories.

939
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:14,600
So hooker stories of course,
I'm sure. Um, I was at Fedex.

940
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,070
Fedex,
yes.

941
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:20,580
And, um, I'm looking
at the woman across me,

942
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:22,230
a black woman working behind the counter.
I'm,

943
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:27,300
the light is reflecting off of her name
badge. Kind of oddly like, you know,

944
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,560
you go like,
I can't really make out the letters.

945
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:34,440
There's like a shiny name badge and I,
and then I go like, this can't be right.

946
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,360
I go, you is your name of Yoshi? And
she goes, yeah. And I go, Oh really?

947
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:45,090
And she goes, yeah, I go where you would,
you have a military parent? And she goes,

948
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:50,220
oh, cause he was stationed in Okinawa.
So that's why they named me Yoshi. I go,

949
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,450
I have a Japanese friend named
Yoshi. And she goes, yeah, yeah.

950
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,980
People always trying to figure it out.
But no, my name's Yoshi. That's my real,

951
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,040
you think as a man's name is weird.
Oh fuck. I don't know. What do I know?

952
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:07,250
I liked it and gave it to
her. Oh, look at you. Yeah,

953
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,853
sure.

954
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:13,730
So shout out to fed ex
and what not and whatnot,

955
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,340
you know, say for real though. I'm
like God. Okay. Alright, I'll write.

956
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,190
You know what I'm saying? God is
good. God is good all the time. Yeah.

957
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,740
Wow. Good. I keep pushing.

958
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,640
Did you get to sleep at all while
you were away? Lucky one night. Yeah.

959
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:39,390
That was a dude notes Friday morning.
Yeah. I would ask how that goes,

960
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,440
but I can't really talk about,
no, I know, but I had to like,

961
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:46,060
so people know that means I had a
phone call with agents and networks.

962
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:49,010
Like here's what's wrong
with what you wrote. So that

963
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:54,010
there wasn't so bad.
It was just that I had to get up to do it.

964
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:57,700
I was like I never one day a week,
one day I know that I could sleep.

965
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:01,120
I had to get up fucking socks and then I
was up cause it was an hour phone call.

966
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,100
It's the worse. I know what
happened last night. Um,

967
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:08,290
there were these two girls from Alabama
sitting in the audience and they were

968
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:11,890
young and like hip looking and I'm like,
you guys are definitely from here.

969
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:15,760
And they're like, no, we just moved here
from Birmingham. I'm like, good for you.

970
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:19,860
Good. That is huge. You know we have
like one listener in Birmingham. No,

971
01:06:19,861 --> 01:06:24,340
we don't play monk, but he's
not the only one. Yeah, no.

972
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,870
How five others? No, it's more than
that. It's not that, it's not that small.

973
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,220
Birmingham's got like a tiny city and
when we went there and you order like five

974
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:36,430
different thousand chicken wings,
all of the show,

975
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,810
we did a show at the uh,

976
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:43,560
whatever dome started and then Whoa man,

977
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,630
fucking phone of your phone.
Yeah. Yay. Then the um,

978
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,230
we went to a wing place. It was like a
popular wing place. What is it called?

979
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:57,520
Buffalo Wings are wildly, I think
while wings. And then I was like,

980
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:00,400
I don't know which one is like the
one to get, you know, when you go,

981
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:02,110
like what's the good one though?
Like, oh, people like this.

982
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,710
So I walk out and you're like,
what'd you get? And I go,

983
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,590
I think I got like 40 or 50 wings,
no more than that. Even get so many.

984
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,330
And then we sit in there in the,
in the hotel, it's like five,

985
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,740
10 wings. And it's like, I feel pretty
good. I'm like, well, just so you know,

986
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:22,500
I have 45 more weeks.
We literally had like 10 boxes.

987
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:25,630
I'm like, baby, what did you do?
Dude did. Yeah, it's a little,

988
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:29,610
I did like a Sushi order with
wings. Good Roll Tad. Well

989
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:34,510
some nights, Tyro, Tyro,
Tyro tower. So weird.

990
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,980
And they're friendly to you in the south.
Hey y'all.

991
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,250
Hey y'all roll tide route happy.
It was really,

992
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:46,080
that was a good trip. Yeah, I did actually
enjoy it. We drove through the south.

993
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:50,110
Remember some of it was really pretty.
We did Nashville. Yup. Did we do Atlanta?

994
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,670
I don't remember. No, no, no. We
did. We did. We did. Yeah. Yeah,

995
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,460
we drove through Tennessee. I
remember, you know what I'm saying?

996
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:02,320
And talking about, you know,
God is good. God is good

997
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:08,260
though, by the way. So
speaking of the south,

998
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:11,860
thanks guys for keeping a
Trump alive in the polls.

999
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,190
I'm an embarrassment. That
is, it's pretty wild, right?

1000
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,850
Can't really, Wayne County. Yes you can.

1001
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,690
Um,
but we thought,

1002
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:26,250
why not bring out another candidate who,

1003
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,810
you know, maybe you could
rival, uh, Donald Trump,

1004
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,860
so we have a clip of another
candidate to consider.

1005
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,060
Well, of course I believe that I
paved the way for Donald Trump.

1006
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,050
I brought ridiculousness of politics and
he saw an opening and he jumped on in

1007
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:46,950
there. So I think there is,
I think I drove my own base.

1008
01:08:46,951 --> 01:08:51,900
I played towards my own constituency.
You know, I have my own people, so yeah,

1009
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,540
there's plenty of room for me
in this mass for sure. In fact,

1010
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:58,230
I am on the ballot here in New Hampshire.
I won the Democratic primary ballot.

1011
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,940
It's vermin supreme. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1012
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,420
So, you know, I'm just thinking that if
you are considering voting for Trump,

1013
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:11,720
why not consider voting for vermin
supreme? Okay. He has a lot of ideas. Um,

1014
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,750
if you want to take a look for are people
that aren't watching our youtube bay.

1015
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,560
Um,
could you describe what you see?

1016
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,910
Yeah.
Is that a helmet,

1017
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,030
like a GG Allen helmet or is it a s?
I can't tell.

1018
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:30,330
I think it's more like a wizard.
A wizard. Yeah. He looks like a,

1019
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:34,500
like a hippie wizard full gray beard.

1020
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:38,640
He's got an American flag embedded in
the beard. Is there a broom? It does.

1021
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:42,600
You have a Bruin? Is Is, oh, I can see
that. Yeah. He's cleaning up the streets.

1022
01:09:42,601 --> 01:09:47,130
I think that's what that metaphor
is. Um, he's got supporters,

1023
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,880
guys was rainbows and Unicorns behind him.

1024
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,440
It's all kinds of cray cray.

1025
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,740
Well I've known for for a basic
platform planks do my platform,

1026
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:59,470
the hours falls of course
Zombie preparedness.

1027
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:01,450
The only caters with the
Zombie Preparedness Plan.

1028
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:05,140
And I'm going to a harness the zombies
for energy sources by utilizing the

1029
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:07,900
latest and giant hamster wheel technology.

1030
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:11,680
We will have lots of zombies and we'll
just sort of dangle brains in front of

1031
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:15,310
them and then they will turn the
giant turbines creating energy. Yeah,

1032
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,900
that makes sense. It makes
more sense. And Trump,

1033
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,580
I think he makes a lot more
sense than Trump. Um, and the,

1034
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:25,500
the whole,
uh,

1035
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:30,420
I tell you the idea that I didn't know
there were that many stupid people.

1036
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:33,690
I knew that there was a lot
of stupid people. I didn't
know there were that many.

1037
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:37,460
Yeah. It's really appalling that people
are into, I think it's such a, well,

1038
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:40,920
my family or even into
trial and really very bad.

1039
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,780
Who can't sell? You want to tell
you off the air, off the air.

1040
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:52,890
It's intense. Right? It's so
dumb. It's so fucking dumb now.

1041
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:57,690
He's the dumbest buffoon ever. I
mean, he's a failed businessman.

1042
01:10:57,691 --> 01:10:58,524
He's a,

1043
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:03,860
he's just a complete failure as a
megalomaniac personality disorders.

1044
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,520
We're talking about a guy that just has
filed bankruptcy fucking five times and

1045
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,050
you know, he just licenses his
names out the place. It's the only,

1046
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,070
he's not even like a

1047
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:18,570
really savvy businessman and
he's a big ad pretty openly.

1048
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,180
It's kind of crazy.
So fucking annoying.

1049
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:26,100
I actually feel bad for conservative
people because he's not one of you.

1050
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,380
You know, he's not a conservative,
doesn't really give a shit. I know.

1051
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:30,870
He's just like, whatever.
What are you doing? I Dunno.

1052
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,420
I feel like you were selling my shit.
Oh. Oh. So I don't know. I just ate.

1053
01:11:37,421 --> 01:11:39,720
It's horrible. This guy has got
some, so that's what I'm saying.

1054
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:40,650
This guy's got ideas.

1055
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,190
That's the other thing is Trump actually
doesn't know any policy stuff. Yeah.

1056
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,140
If you,
if you bring up any point,

1057
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,560
well what are you going
to do about immigration?

1058
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:52,620
You're going to see lot of things
are going to be different. Uh,

1059
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:55,650
what about terrorism? It's going to
be way different when I get in there.

1060
01:11:55,890 --> 01:12:00,540
You'll see I'm not gonna I'm not going
to get pushed around anymore. Oh,

1061
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,900
okay. Great. That's really good.

1062
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:08,070
Cool. Number two, of course. Time travel
research. I, we'll go back in time.

1063
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:13,530
Kill Baby Hitler with my bare
hands before he said Bush. Well,

1064
01:12:13,531 --> 01:12:17,230
once again, Jeb Bush said he
would kill Baby Hitler. Hell yeah.

1065
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,990
Would I say I've got it.

1066
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,960
He's promising he's going to go
and kill Baby Hitler. That's huge.

1067
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,640
Wow. I mean huge. Your politician
nowadays will make such bold claims,

1068
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:33,520
but a lot the wizard.
Wow, that's awesome. And

1069
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:40,340
the thing that I want to know is
how will that affect this drop?

1070
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,450
I mean, you realize if he actually
does what he says is going to do,

1071
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:49,450
when I go to press that button, there'll
be nothing there. Nothing to Ah,

1072
01:12:49,451 --> 01:12:52,470
you're right. Yeah. Time travel. Wow.

1073
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:54,480
That's kind of ruins a
few episodes of our show.

1074
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:59,850
We're going to have to write into this
guy. Yeah, Dude. Um, maybe could, I dunno.

1075
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,420
Maybe it was. Yeah. So now,

1076
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,180
now you're seeing somebody who's
out of the box, but makes sense.

1077
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:11,060
I'm not like Trump. He does make more
sense than Donald Trump. You do it.

1078
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,730
And then of course,
mandatory tooth brushing laws.

1079
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:19,620
This has been eroding the gum line of
this great nation of ours who were too

1080
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:23,250
long and this great country has been
suffering a great moral in oral decay in

1081
01:13:23,251 --> 01:13:28,251
spirit and incisors are country's future
depends on its ability to fight back.

1082
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,580
We can no longer be a nation. Indentured
are very salivation is at stake.

1083
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:34,410
What does mandatory to request
your law is really about,

1084
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:37,740
is strong team for a strong America.
May we become a sea of shining, smiling,

1085
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:39,780
shiny, smiling, shiny, smiling,
smiling, smiling, smiling,

1086
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:43,980
shining faces from sea to shining sea.
Thank you. I've referenced the brave.

1087
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,850
Wow.

1088
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,660
This is a lot of stuff
that's tapped into the show.

1089
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:54,710
Did a dental updates. He's into, hey,
Hitler's and all of it, man. Wow. Yeah.

1090
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,210
But I will say that he was a son.

1091
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:02,430
Feels like he wants to stop
saying hey, littler. But you know,

1092
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:06,810
I would say that in this case.
That makes sense. Yeah. You know?

1093
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,620
But he definitely likes dental updates
to clearly and again, those, that,

1094
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,250
the little

1095
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,930
bit we've seen here, much more policies
savvy than Donald Trump actually has.

1096
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:19,780
Tangible ideas. Yeah.
Real ideas. Real plans.

1097
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:23,270
Oh, one, two and four. What about
number three? Oh, number three of card,

1098
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:29,120
three ponies for all Americans. It is of
course a job stimulus creation program.

1099
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:33,140
And it is a federal pony identification
program when you have to raise taxes for

1100
01:14:33,141 --> 01:14:34,380
that. No, they're free.

1101
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,080
Tony's. That's it guys. Great.
Yeah. Is he in San Francisco?

1102
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:41,620
I Dunno. This seems like a San
Francisco kind of guy. I don't know.

1103
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:45,980
But he's really, I don't know. I'm a big
fan. I'm a huge fan too. Vermin supreme.

1104
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:46,620
All right.

1105
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:50,040
So, um, I dunno, uh,
if you're a Trump guy,

1106
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,720
maybe reconsider you start thinking
about what is he running under vermin?

1107
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,480
Uh, I'm assuming an independent, uh,

1108
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,490
we got to wrap this up pretty soon.
Oh,

1109
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,870
do you want to see this real quick?
Cause we've been really high on ours.

1110
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,980
Second Chinese male and a lot of people
have been asking you about it on the

1111
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:14,040
show. Here is a, um,

1112
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,400
well I'll let you just see what shows

1113
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,490
you wouldn't use a dry paper
towel to wash a dirty car.

1114
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,760
So why use dry toilet paper
to clean up in the bathroom,

1115
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:30,450
the water to get clean yet prove your
bathroom routine and get completely clean

1116
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:35,770
with a new good day, buddy.
Look, traditional toilet
paper is rough and scratchy,

1117
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,580
but the day buddy Sprague
gently washes your clean paper,

1118
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:43,780
gets messy paper and can be expensive.
But with the bid day buddy,

1119
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:45,010
you don't have to worry about any of that.

1120
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,940
Wait a minute. Well, you still have
to use paper. You dummy. Well, yeah,

1121
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:51,070
but I all I could think about in this ad.

1122
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:54,280
It's just thinking of this
woman taking a shit. Me Too.

1123
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,760
Everybody that speaks in this,
I'm like just picturing them shitting.

1124
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:58,990
I picturing her wiping,

1125
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:02,860
not shaming and I love the argument is
you just don't want to waste toilet paper.

1126
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,550
Yeah. Instead of like,
Hey, it feels nicer there.

1127
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:08,680
She also said like you ran out of
paper like, no, you don't like,

1128
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:12,750
it's a big problem in every household.
You're always out of paper. Yeah.

1129
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,580
It's an efficiency. Save money. Yeah.

1130
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,920
A picture of me taking a shit right now.
You wouldn't,

1131
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:24,210
not even in this nice blonde lady
takes shits or the fatigue shirts. Yes.

1132
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:27,260
I never would've thought that. Listen
to this lady, but then she does.

1133
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,130
Eve how clean you feel after
you go to the bathroom?

1134
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:34,200
Don't now I picture her with like the
sweetest, cleanest little ass hole.

1135
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:39,580
It sounds like a pink waxed. Okay.
Just super plain asshole. Relax.

1136
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,930
You just want to eat
up the boot and relax.

1137
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,440
I only go to the bathroom.

1138
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:47,290
She should just say it's specifically
for shitting this product.

1139
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,420
I've literally never
felt like this before.

1140
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:53,950
Water toilet paper just pushes the wipes.

1141
01:16:53,951 --> 01:16:56,980
Leave residue behind. Yeah, it's true.

1142
01:16:56,981 --> 01:17:01,480
I tell you buddy uses fresh water to
rinse. You clean leaving nothing behind.

1143
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,950
Now why didn't they use Brown
stuff for this? This is like a,

1144
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,890
that purple purple is an
interesting color choice.

1145
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,200
Make it brown so we know
what you're talking about.

1146
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:16,910
Or black or red because of the deep,
deep blood red.

1147
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,490
You're probably used to
seeing a lot of blood.

1148
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:23,450
When you go to the bathroom with the day
buddy, all that blood gets washed away.

1149
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,460
If
you're used to,

1150
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:33,050
pulls a blood leaving you when you sit
down to go potty. Now with the day buddy,

1151
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,030
all that blood gets flushed away.

1152
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,670
Read a book and you can adjust the water.
Right?

1153
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,010
Oh,
you're perfect for kids.

1154
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,160
She high five them and she's like,

1155
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,300
you could wash your little ass
hole and you high five drinks.

1156
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,250
I like the firm setting
sounded really from, yeah, that
sounded like a hose. Yeah.

1157
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,130
I don't know if you wanted
that hard on your asphalt.

1158
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:59,300
Happy she is at her son's has a
clean asshole. Yeah. You took a shit

1159
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,540
at parents do
hemorrhoids or IBS

1160
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:08,760
and he's so happy. He's like, he's got
a newspaper under his arm. Right. Him.

1161
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,000
It's like my daddy's going
to come over and use her day.

1162
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,940
My grandson clean is the asshole
in my old ass holes. Clean too.

1163
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:20,110
Needs of the day, buddy. I'm
a truck driver. I sit all day.

1164
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,690
You know he could take a shit. Yeah, and
that's what, that's what he's saying.

1165
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:26,290
He's like, I'm a truck driver
so you know I can shit. Yeah.

1166
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,930
Nothing queens like the day
buddy. I just love it. It's just,

1167
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,630
it's just easy and toilet paper,
you know, it's not as cool.

1168
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,343
Okay.

1169
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,443
No,
it's fine.

1170
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:40,350
They're making this sound like you bid
day as opposed to using the toilet paper.

1171
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,780
Yeah.
It should be in conjunction.

1172
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:47,700
In addition to water on
your ass hall. Yeah. Wow.

1173
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:51,480
What a neat commercial. Thank
you. Yeah, man. Pretty good stuff.

1174
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:56,220
Oh God. We've got to get going. Yeah,
that was a lot of fun though. Yeah.

1175
01:18:56,730 --> 01:19:00,530
God, I thought I was fat and
that picture. All right, great.

1176
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:06,760
All right, the day buddy,
I'm sick of wiping. We got,

1177
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:12,120
I could just stop wiping during the
show. Thanks for watching on Youtube. Uh,

1178
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:15,720
your mom's house, podcast.com. Make sure
you check it out. Bye guys. Bye now.

1179
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:20,780
Right?
Cause the toilet,

1180
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,243
the water

1181
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,490
everywhere are on the ground.

1182
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,220
Yeah. I thought it was panic

1183
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:49,420
on the ground.

1184
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:01,370
I heard you on the ground,
on the ground

1185
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:10,070
back up and out. Oh my
God. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
