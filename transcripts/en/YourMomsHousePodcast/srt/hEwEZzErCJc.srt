1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:01,950
Wow.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,300
Well,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,310

Christina.

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,080
Alright,

That's great. Is that where
you got to work? Work,

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,153

Right.
Vic submitted this song.

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,090
Take a real real song.
Now he made this himself.

13
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:15,040
He didn't use a famous djs
music and just remixed it.

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,530
Apparently that happened last week.
Oh No, this is good. I like this.

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,050
I'm surprised you didn't know that. Being
a DJ as well. Community is very tight,

16
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,670
but there's a lot of, you know
imposters out there. It's no Rihanna.

17
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:40,740

00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,870
I think it's better than ball sack

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,703

Cincinnati, but sure it's liberty.

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,200
All right, let's move it along. Um, no,

70
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,120
it's good. I'm saying it's
good. Let me hear you sing it.

71
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,460
If you haven't picked up Rihanna,
his new album,

72
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:49,230
it's been playing in the Sigora house
all weekend. A couple of months old. Oh,

73
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,064
is it?
Yeah.

74
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,580
Terry had the musical taste,
the 12 year old girl, whatever.

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Rihanna, I guarantee you
we talked about this thing.

76
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,860
She didn't write those lyrics that was
written by a fat old music producer

77
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,710
record guy. The record
labels like, you know what?

78
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:14,090
You should do a song about fucking you
soul mate. I've always wanted to fuck you.

79
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,400
One second.
I saw you.

80
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,970
I saw those thin light chocolate frame.

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,140
Then I wanted to break it in half and
you're going to sing a song about how

82
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:27,140
great it is to fucking cause
there's no woman is like,

83
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,650
I'm going to write a song called sex
with me is so amazing. And then she just,

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,600
is this what you wrote? Yeah. Alright,
let's go cause it sags with me.

85
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:40,250
So how much am I getting paid
on this deal? Okay. Yeah,

86
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,650
it's amazing. Fuck him.
He's amazing. It's crazy.

87
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,990
Women don'ts and also like it's clunky.
She's like stay above my Instagram.

88
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,670
There's so temptation.
It's cause the guy's like,

89
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,671
I look at your Instagram every day and
I took off all over my house for sure.

90
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,290
There's no rhyming in that Rihanna album.

91
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,960
Numero Uno. Is it in any weeks
in a row? Wow. That was dog shit.

92
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,020
That is pure shit. Really? You
don't like that? I like it.

93
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,133
No,

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,630
it's like a,
it's like a 12 year old girls.

95
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:20,490
Listen to that shit in you and my
husband and my 48 year old husband until,

96
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,150
yeah.
Nice.

97
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,520
Sound sad. Are we ready?
Dad is already to go.

98
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,140
Farts. Farts. Farts. Are
you ready to start the show?

99
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,660
Let's do it. Let me get this here. Uh, by
the way, a lot of people were asking like,

100
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:42,210
Tom, when are you going to get a mouse?
Here it is. Couldn't get it to work.

101
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,330
We've got to get another one.
So what?

102
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Dads don't always know how to use tech
thing is I turned it on and then a blue

103
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,720
tooth didn't wears glasses
on for this year, blue tooth.

104
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,110
And I
danced as it should be.

105
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,560
That's never know how stuff works.
They need Hell No. All right,

106
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,180
let me see here.

107
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,730
I feel you.
I know how you're feeling right now.

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
How much do you want to sex with Rihanna?
Have you thought about it? Um, yeah,

109
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,030
I want to have sex with her bed.
Do you go to her Instagram?

110
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,990
Like she says in the song.
Here we go. More bullshit.

111
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,850
All right, here we go. Here we
go. Let's start the show. Hot 97

112
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,150
and pawn was his hype man and Paul would
always wanna use my cell phone and I'll

113
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:34,040
be like,
I got a call radio,

114
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,160
I've got to call retail and
we'd have like $60 relative.

115
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,040
He was like $60 to eat with
two fattenings per diem. Yeah.

116
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,930
Christina visits in person.

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,913
Yeah.

118
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,070
Ooh,

119
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,640
big words for him.

120
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,380
I want to use those big words at
that station very casually to like,

121
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,600
he always says that you
recognize Steve Lubell here? No,

122
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,530
he was on an episode of
millionaire matchmaker. What
was he talking like? This?

123
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,140
Yeah, he was mad show, yeah.
Member. And she was like, okay,

124
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:57,460
what is your deal more?
He's a manager.

125
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Um, what's the lot of big hip
hop acts? He's been around for,

126
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,750
you know, probably 30 years. Right.

127
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:08,560
And so he picks up the expectations of
the rappers and what he's like in New

128
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,470
York. You know, dude from just a
black guy. Yeah. Yeah. He's just,

129
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,410
he's just this other black guy with
the wrong fucking skin tone. Um,

130
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,070
and upon was his hype man.

131
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,530
And Paul would always want to use
my cell phone and I'll be like,

132
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:24,340
I got a call radio, I got a call
retail and we'd have like $60 relative.

133
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,940
He was like $60 to eat with two
fattening per diem. Yeah. And,

134
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,620
and wait, who's into, he was interviewing.
It doesn't sound like a black guy, right?

135
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,870
Well, yeah. Well they get into it
actually, you know, and the, the,

136
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:40,871
the big words and words are actually
big this weekend because Larry Wilmore,

137
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:44,170
the host of the,
the nightly show on comedy central,

138
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,000
he did the White House
correspondence dinner, you know,

139
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,680
a set where you go up and you basically
light the, you know, the journalists,

140
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,740
sometimes the administration on fire.
He crushed it. I mean, he was just,

141
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,060
he was no holds barred. Just lighting
it up in that room was not into it.

142
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,160
They didn't have,
like you said,

143
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:07,161
one time I did a set at the journalism
awards here in Los Angeles and I have

144
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:12,550
never eaten shit harder. I mean, and I,
this was like two or three years ago.

145
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,240
So I've been doing standup for a minute.
Yeah.

146
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,930
And events like that are very difficult.
I mean,

147
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:19,270
they dropped the dessert
just as I was going on,

148
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:23,890
but I would have eaten shit otherwise
there are real nerds at this, a dinner,

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,780
you know? Yeah. And the thing
is that, that's a room full
of like real world leads.

150
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,960
Yeah. Not just the press.
Right. But that's usually, it
has their senators. There's,

151
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,110
you know,
it's like the hosting the Oscars.

152
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,950
It's just like super elite people
who take themselves too seriously.

153
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,060
And when you have someone like Wilmore
who is digging into you really,

154
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,250
really lighting people up,
there you go.

155
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:49,110
This isn't poor taste because if they
don't feel like it's nice, you know, um,

156
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,260
and they get their feelings
hurt. But, but he ended, I mean,

157
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,040
let me see if I can pull up, tie
this all together. He ended, um,

158
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,830
thank you mister president. When I
met Larry Wilmore earlier this month,

159
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:08,430
he told me it's his dream come true to
follow the president at the White House

160
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:09,220
for a spot

161
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,480
president.
That doesn't make sense

162
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,880
here and now to live in your time,
Mr. Prince.

163
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:20,950
This is how we ended the son. A black
man can lead the entire free world.

164
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,610
[inaudible] when they pan to
the people that are black.

165
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,540
Yeah,
they always did it.

166
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,840
Words alone do me no
justice. Um, so Mr President,

167
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm going to keep it a hundred.
You'll bury. You did it my Nigga.

168
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,560
Oh, why you liked it?
Obama laughed. It's cool.

169
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,310
There was backlash even from
a lot of people, a lot of
black people. Oh, it fell,

170
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,340
it was very disrespectful to say that to
the president of United shore anyways.

171
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,820
I didn't, I mean I'm white, but I didn't
know, but I, cause I thought it was,

172
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,400
it was done with a lot of affection.
I thought he, you know, it wasn't,

173
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,150
I mean I realize you're saying
it to the president, but, right.

174
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,930
But as with everything in comedy,

175
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,590
I think the intent is really what counts
as a black man saying it to another

176
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:25,830
black man. And he wasn't saying it the
way that other guy, I like the way.

177
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,810
So let's go back to, yeah, that's
a different, totally different. Um,

178
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,460
Steve Lowe Bell. Uh, if I'm saying, Oh,

179
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,640
I thought that guy was the guy
that the body guard from a,

180
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,640
no, we found the kid man.
50. I feel like money

181
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,790
guys. Steve Wilkos, uh,

182
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,840
Steve Wilkos looks a little bit
about Kevin's hill. Here. We got it.

183
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,900
Why do people stress?

184
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:51,220
Look at the president ain't
sweating the n bomb then who cares?

185
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:55,750
He was the one and only matters to make
him the president took it that way.

186
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,470
That this is coming from a place of
affection. Oh. And a comedian too.

187
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,670
We didn't hire median, but whatever,
people have the right to be forever.

188
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,360
But this is, this is different. This is
a little different here. So he's still,

189
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,720
he's doing the interview here
and he just Kinda keeps going.

190
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,520
No, we found a kid, man. I
made a record with 50. I feel
like money buzzing. Buzzing.

191
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,300
So that's been in la getting niggas
jewelry bag, holding niggas down,

192
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,230
discovering people, consultant people,
helping people in those real top.

193
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,250
You see it today,
laugh after

194
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,200
they're like, okay, okay.

195
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,850
I don't know how I'd feel to hearing him
say that stuff when I got to be like,

196
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:38,070
what? Wait. Can we pause on this? Uh,
yeah. He's, he keeps rolling. Hilly.

197
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:42,350
It's no big deal. I just dropping
bombs like his normal God. Yeah.

198
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,710
Yeah. He's really good at dropping
the lender Nigga a pencil. Right.

199
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,950
So He um,
he continues,

200
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,050
I think they must have obviously
at some point asked him like,

201
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,540
what is up with you doing this,
you know,

202
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,430
or why are you so part of the community?
Right.

203
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,470
Well I think the thing is that he
considers them, but it's a good point.

204
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,780
I think he does consider
himself part of that community.

205
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,160
I don't think he thinks that he's not,
but I don't think you're,

206
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:12,620
you're allowed really in until you meet
a certain criteria in which is being

207
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:17,210
black. Well that would be the thought
of a lot of people, but not this guy.

208
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,060
They just know you as like little CV.
Right? If you were in New York person,

209
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:24,630
like this is the problem. I live in La,
right. And Ami Girls. And they be like,

210
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,630
why do you act like Dan? Why do you
talk like that and dress like that?

211
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:31,110
Like you must have never been in New York
doing because the white are just like

212
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:35,970
me and he'd probably got tats and fight,
go to Riker's on all that.

213
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,560
Well I remember I told you this.

214
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,860
I Dunno. I mean, he's
just, he's saying like

215
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,910
this fucking guy.

216
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,780
I love when white people try to sweat
the plight the same way black people

217
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,520
haven't like no dude, no bro, trust
me, you're still not a Hee Hee Hee.

218
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,880
You're causing yourself problems at this
point. You know also implying that uh,

219
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,110
white people from New York or like
black people, they go to jail a lot.

220
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,510
That's what he just said.
Five minutes on Rikers island

221
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,680
and then that guy, this is what it must
be when he defended his use of it. Right.

222
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,610
So here it goes.

223
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,860
I'll walk into a room your way.
People, Russell, Russell Simmons.

224
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:20,500
So what's up my Nigga in the,
like Russell, he's, he's wife Joe.

225
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,360
Just so you know how to explain that
some Nigga doesn't mean a black person to

226
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:29,340
me and is a slave. Does
Mexican slaves, Jewish slaves,
black slaves, white sleeves.

227
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,490
I grew up, Nigga, Nigga,
Nigga. That's my Nigga in La.

228
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,330
Once a blood dude said to
me, Yo, you said that word.

229
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,120
And I was around sugar at the time and
I was in the studio without laws and

230
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,680
stuff.
It was a lot of guns.

231
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:43,140
It was a lot of craziness because
a lot of executives who are white,

232
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,050
they don't want to be around the
Hennessy to guns and the dogs.

233
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,160
They don't be on the tour buses.

234
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,070
They just want to come around to the
certain things and take the credit after

235
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:53,370
the fact and he's like, Yo, you need to
go to bank. No, you owe me 15,000 saying,

236
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,410
Nigga, my Nigga, you're
going to kill me right now.

237
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,290
And no one extorting me white niggers.

238
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,710
So yeah.

239
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,950
Do you think there's a reason that the
white executives don't come around when

240
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:07,640
there's guns and Hennessy involved?
He obviously wants to be there for that.

241
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,190
That's what I like.
Maybe it's not a white thing name.

242
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,370
It's just a thing that the
person wants to stay alive.

243
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,150
It doesn't hang out with Shugg
and those people. No sugars.

244
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,930
It is a death sentence. I want to
die, hang out with Shugg night,

245
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,650
even in prison and be like,
don't hang out with that dude.

246
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,800
We're not going to be bros.

247
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,330
I've seen a lot of white there in my time,

248
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,610
this guy.

249
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,250
But I love when he's trying to convince
them like I can use the word because

250
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,410
Russell Simmons said it to
me once and I want to be,

251
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,680
and then all of you were, you know, quite

252
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,700
a big words.
I just,

253
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,400
I just kills me when
you're born a white guy,

254
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,090
which is like top of the food
chain in America. Big words. Yeah.

255
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:56,550
Motherfucker like you're at the
top. Why? What are you doing?

256
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,570
You have it pretty dumb prick.
Just be a white guy. I enjoy it.

257
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:04,500
Stopped feeling guilty and weird about it.
You won the cosmic lottery asshole,

258
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,080
the easiest position and you're
making life hard for, you know,

259
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:12,110
saying I used to comb it.
I liked it when the,

260
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,550
he says that this is still again

261
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,540
cause he goes, he says he's hanging
out in that studio and some blood.

262
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,730
So some gang banger from and go to the
bank and get me $15,000 for saying that

263
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,880
word. Right. And then in
his version of the story,

264
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,730
he says it again to that
guy. Do you understand? Yes.

265
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,790
So his,

266
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,320
his version of a dude who just
a gang member who was just like,

267
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,680
go to the bank and get me money is that
he told that guy you're going to have to

268
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:50,700
extort me. But he used the word, but I'm
going to say it again. It's all buses.

269
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,300
They just want to come around. Does he
owe me 15,000 San Diego? So my Nigga,

270
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,020
you gonna kill it right in my, so the
guy just said, hey man, you can't stay.

271
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:01,260
They go get me money and that I'm
going to respond. I'm saying, Nigga,

272
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:04,470
I'll send my Nigga, you're going to kill
me right now. And no one extorting me.

273
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:05,850
You didn't see it did not.

274
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,190
Steve will goes to not say that Steve
Wilkos was with Jerry Springer every day.

275
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:13,831
He would never,

276
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,330
he was too busy gardening such a
psycho ridiculous shift from that guy.

277
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,590
But I'll finish off, finish
the yard, done. Uh, but to,

278
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:26,190
to the further the point of Larry Wilmore,

279
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,800
I think people, most people, I think
we're pretty okay with it, you know?

280
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,920
Yeah, yeah. With him saying it's comedian,

281
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,490
like whenever you hire a comedian
to do a job, don't get offended.

282
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm just a comedian.
But I think more than a comedian,

283
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,410
it's a black man saying it to
another blend. Different, different,

284

same strokes for everybody. We all
finished. Are Y'all done? Yeah,

285
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:54,660

really worth getting clowned. So hard.

286
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,250
So hard spec on my name that I
could hear the tremble in the voice.

287
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,770
Put some respect on my name.
He's going to cry.

288
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,800
It is my favorite thing
of the last few months.

289
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,120
We've been saying this for the last
week now and that run in the house.

290
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:13,400
It's great. We all are. We all finished?
Are Y'all done? We're done. Um,

The occupier loans. Yeah.

293
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,950
These guys are on the tour bus
and they just like improvise a,

294
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,400
a song based on that interview.

295
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,680
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

296
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,660
These guys just on binary or non binding.
These guys I think are binary. Yeah.

297
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,650
What'd you do? My hair
just went out. Yup. Yup.

298
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,800
What's going on? We're good.
We're back. Okay. Oh, guys
are binary. These are buying.

299
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,330
I don't, I only listened
to nonbinary means, okay,

300
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,700
this will be a challenge for you.

301
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,190
I want you to bloody out Australia.

302
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't listen when you say my name on it.

303
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,230
I ain't gonna say it. And I will say
no. Listen, I'm going to pull it up,

304
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,850
but that ain't

305
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,843
no,

306
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,030
I'll be finished

307
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,403

308
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,100
and I will say no.

309
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,510
Unbelievable. That's amazing. Wow.

310
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,600
They were so good. That was so good. I
thought that was Hugh more for a second.

311
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,850
Yeah. Right. And it looks like him.
I haven't seen that guy around.

312
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,810
I don't see that in a minute, but he's
hilarious. Yeah. That's so good, man.

313
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,793
Wow.

314
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,840
Put his bag, man. Put
some respect on my name.

315
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,630
He is going to cry like a bitch. What do
you think his wig his room like? Correct.

316
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,290
I hope he gets a window.

317
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:15,291
You saying that we care about how is
he gonna come in here now and I didn't

318
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:16,840

319
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,470
Okay.

320
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,310
Bitch SPEC.

321
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,430
It isn't gonna roll in here with seven
to his homies and your mom's done came in

322
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:25,264
into your mouth.

323
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,200
She could have came up to the
cabinet stove thanks to oh no.

324
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,760
Yo House, Christina. Bulimics key.

325
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,760
All right. All right. Sorry. I'm sorry
bird didn't put respect on your name.

326
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,630
Respect, respect it or SPEC. Oh shit man.

327
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,770
Like I got clown pretty fucking
hard. Oof. Yeah. Still getting clown.

328
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,570
It's still happening. Yeah.
He's got a clown by us again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure,

329
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:57,560
man. Or Guy. He, he'll be all right.
Believe me. He'll be thinking, so yeah.

330
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,440
How do you recover from it?
That's become like an internet.

331
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,480
He's worth $150 million. Yeah, he's
fine. He's fine. He's not gonna.

332
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,100
He'll be chilling. Oh, why
bother? I think that get,

333
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,850
what gets me is that he bothered to come
in to the radio show and then he didn't

334
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,060
have,

335
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,060
there's also a level of of what he
did that even though there's no direct

336
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,290
threat, there's a perceived threat
and then that's what he's company.

337
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,230
He knows that when he looked at,
well, he was walking out of there,

338
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,120
that those people were at least
like Jesus. Oh, right. And that's,

339
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,380
and then you could tell even Charlemagne
afterwards, like, you know what,

340
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:33,010
I'm good at. Charlemagne.
I don't need any more. Uh,

341
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,610
I don't need to interview him again.
We're all good. Everything's good. It's,

342
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,360
it's a way to say like, I'm not
fucking with you. All right. Right.

343
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:42,590
Like we're good man. No, Charlemagne, you
mean the medieval King Charlemagne, right.

344
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,550
I meant the God that was sitting at the
breakfast club. Oh, okay. Charlemagne,

345
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,200
yeah. Not As unconquered. Right hand.

346
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,930
Different guide from the
medieval renaissance period.

347
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,070
South Carolina born and got
you. Yep. Okay. Anyways,

348
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,530
so fucking jacked up, dude.
It's been a great week. Um,

349
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,760
we got a lot of positive
feedback on, um, uh,

350
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,790
Tom and I discussing the
shower that we took together.

351
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,430
There's been multiple
showers before and after now,

352
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,020
but I was at the store and I'm red
band came up to me and was like, oh,

353
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:19,670
what a great episode. He goes, but
I have to ask you, are you serious?

354
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,850
When you say that Tom Spreads his butt
cheeks and puts it up against the water.

355
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,980
And I'm like, yeah,
no, that's a real move.

356
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,850
And then my friend Eric texted
me the same thing. Like, wow,

357
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:36,050
that is a bear marking his territory. It
sounds like he's trying to dominate you.

358
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,370
Yeah.
Which by the way,

359
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm used to it being your word. I'd
never heard that. No, it's not a real,

360
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,240
it's a talking a loogie and I know that.

361
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,910
So don't fucking email me and tell me
what I'm doing wrong. I say it's hawking.

362
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,630
It just sounds,
that's a better word for me.

363
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:00,080
That one makes me want to vomit and
Snowdonia snot rockets. Not Ross.

364
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,220
It's really nice in your beard.
And then I peed on us. That's,

365
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,420
but that's so standard issue.

366
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,050
I thought that was what everybody
in any relationship. Well Brian,

367
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,850
when his friend who's name
I can't remember, sorry, but
she, she was saying that,

368
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,790
is that true that he pees on Youtube?
I go, yeah man, is it that crazy?

369
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,870
And she's like, I've never been pinned
on. I'm like, won't come over to my House,

370
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,090
my pee on you two lady.

371
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,600
I feel like that standard issue
in a really thought that was,

372
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,340
I thought that everybody does everyone,

373
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,330
but actually you're the first boyfriend
that ever peed on me in the shower,

374
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,150
so I wasn't dating savages know you
were dating some nonbinary people.

375
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,760
Can I tell you that? But before
I dated you, I was the man.

376
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:45,230
Like people thought I was gross.

377
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:48,290
Like all my boyfriends would have
to tell me to stop picking my nose,

378
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,390
stop farting and burping like my last
boyfriend before you. Zero tolerance,

379
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,750
zero tolerance for it towards the end to
really fucking hated it when I wake her

380
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:57,560
up and fall.

381
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,590
When someone doesn't love you anymore
and you're burping and farting,

382
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,040
you think that she goes over? No. Oh
my God, you guys are so disgusting.

383
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,490
You're lucky.
I love you as much.

384
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,300
But you set the bar so low for disgusting
behavior low or has a high high that I

385
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,910
never have to strive Trump to grocer.

386
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,850
Are you really asking me that question?
Yeah, no, I know. I know. I know,

387
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,590
I know. I totally know. Do you know
how disgusting you are? Not really.

388
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:34,070
I just feel like it's normal.
When we started dating,

389
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,490
you had no soap in your shower and
shampoo and you use that on everywhere.

390
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,040
Just everything. But you can use
shampoo. Suds is soap. Why can you not?

391
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,510
You can.
Most people choose not to.

392
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,990
What am I do go to the store.
Buy Soap too.

393
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,000
Most people do. No, that's fine. Did you,

394
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,000
when I asked you to buy
soap in your shower,

395
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,450
were you blown away or are you
like this bitch? I was just like,

396
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
I don't understand why you're
not using all the shampoo I got.

397
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,660
I got all the shampoo and the best part
is to like the cap was loose on that

398
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:21,350
shampoo bottle, so water would go
into it and dilute it. So it was like,

399
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,310
but that memory can last longer. You
get more, more shampoo, more soap.

400
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,460
I'm really going to get my ass wax.

401
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:32,760
I've been talking to you about a
savage I know or maybe lasered, right?

402
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,720
Didn't we talk about that?

403
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,470
Cause I don't do either to my
junks I would say go for laser.

404
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:42,090
Why not? Why? Why keep
going back to get it waxed?

405
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,540
Like just bite the bullet and just
really had some breakthroughs, you know,

406
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,650
thinking about how much more of
my life I could get back with it.

407
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,960
And it's talking about asshole.

408
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,020
Well I just feel like there's just so
much time spent and people have told me,

409
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,650
you know they waxed their asses and it's
like one wife to wipes. They're done.

410
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:02,490
That's when my world is something now
at the big day it's even less. Yeah.

411
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:07,000
Well I sit there now. Oh Shit.
Hit the bid day on. You didn't,

412
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,120
you didn't hit the button. Nobody knows
what's what segment that says Oh yeah.

413
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,890
Fused and like what's going on.

414
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,703
Right.

415
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,730
You look like booker at the
belching contests right now.

416
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,140
You're so proud of yourself. So
sorry, let's go back to the topic.

417
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,300
Yeah.
Now I just,

418
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,800
I hit the water and I just let that
spray sit there but I'll let it spray for

419
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,490
a minute. I hear you. I know. Yeah. No,

420
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:44,520
I literally hear you and living
room cause that turtle it,

421
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,660
I can hear what happens in there.

422
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,070
That's what it really neat blessing in
all our homes is that I've always been in

423
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:53,280
close proximity to where you
shit so I can hear everything.

424
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,690
You hear the bedroom one? No, no, just
that downstairs. The downstairs one. Yeah.

425
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,450
So I hear the water going for a long time.
Yeah.

426
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,570
And then you always come out and you go,
whew.

427
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,400
And then and then when I ignore you,
you go, you're not going to ask me.

428
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,910
You're going to, you're not going to
ask me. And I go, how is your shit?

429
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,370
You say the same kind of thing to me
though. You'll be like, I don't want,

430
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:20,400
you want to know what happened?
And you play coy.

431
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,743
Oops.

432
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,770
You're wearing your oopsies around the
house to they with mood nannies here.

433
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,580
Those fell down.
Oopsies I don't think so.

434
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,440
She wants to Skygen Bald. She goes,
what? I'm serious though. Gee,

435
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,620
do you really want to get your ass wax?
Are you being serious? Being serious?

436
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:44,890
Because I've been thinking about seriously
how much time I spend or like when

437
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:49,540
I'm not home. Oh my God,
I'm not home and fucking,

438
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,500
I mean like,
you know,

439
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:55,100
public airport got disaster,
man.

440
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:59,320
Just mad in there and it gets into the
hand and your smear, when you wipe,

441
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:03,640
you're smashing it into the Harris.
So gross it as though the hairy ass.

442
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,990
What does the hair for? Why does
it even grow them? I don't know.

443
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,730
Because the women don't have
hair. I mean some I don't. Yeah,

444
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,840
but for you, if you're a hunter to
gather and you're out in the wilderness,

445
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,870
you got to cover your
asshole like naked humans.

446
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm saying primitive man who
was out hunting and gathering.

447
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,200
Women don't need it because we're
with the babies and the cave.

448
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,080
But you're out there with
leopards chasing you.

449
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,290
You could sit down on a rock and a snake
could crawl right up your ass and lay

450
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,760
eggs. This is probably to
cover. Okay, so this is,

451
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,840
this is a real explanation I'm offering.

452
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,220
Know I saw this on Nat Geo.

453
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,100
Why does Tom Cigarettes asshole
have hair on the next episode? Well,

454
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,780
I'm going to go reverse.
I think you should.

455
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,250
So is your butthole hair like your beard
because at that full the whole hair

456
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:58,240
isn't so crazy. It's the
inside the crack. She cared.

457
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,850
You know like the cheeks aren't that Harry
when it's like you spread the sheikhs

458
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,280
and I've seen it. Forest. Yeah, you've
seen it. Well everyone's like it's a nice,

459
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:10,290
isn't that it's hot.
It's so hot as anything.

460
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,930
I've heard that it really
makes it a lot less hot.

461
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,530
Sexy, high. I know it's
going to stay sexy,

462
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,990
but temperature was well cause when we
did Nikki glazers show not safe and we're

463
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:25,330
talking about pegging and she's like,
do you even put your finger up there?

464
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:30,100
And I'm like, so hot is hot
and steamy and hairy and scary.

465
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:34,050
It's a gross place.
Had a lot of diarrhea today and

466
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,180
you really did.

467
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,740
The nice thing about diarrhea with that
per day is that you hit that water and

468
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,010
you go with paper later. There's nothing
left. There's nothing there. I know,

469
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,490
cause I had some loose ones
too. I say I have a, I had like,

470
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,790
I have like a five. Yeah.
The day cleans it right up.

471
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,750
You was you as total seven.

472
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,640
I had about a 6.5649999999999995.
It was pretty bad.

473
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,700
It was pretty much blew. Really loose,
loose meat sandwich all the way. Yeah.

474
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,060
It kind of made you sit there and go,
you know,

475
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,780
I just liked, I just liked
playing that come in those balls.

476
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,940
Why am I so low? I feel like I'm a
child and you're an adult. Go. You are

477
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,130
so gross
and you'd grow up.

478
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,360
Shut up. I grow. When I
look at you, I throw up.

479
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,070
You just want to fuck me and
then go to your mom's house.

480
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,060
Wow. She sounds binary though. She does.

481
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,953
They,

482
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,310
I prefer prefer them to be non binary.

483
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,310
I only watched nonbinary pornography,

484
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,680
so anyway. Yeah, a lot of
positive feedback on your,

485
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,170
on the shower that we took together.

486
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,750
You and I took a little time together
this week and we went to the Getty Museum

487
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,420
and that was nice to spend
time with you like that.

488
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:17,110
We never really get to do things
like that. I know it was a,

489
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,870
it was thoroughly enjoyable.
We just walked around the Getty.

490
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:23,540
If you ever come to Los
Angeles and you want, you know,

491
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,600
cities have their leave their mark right
with their cultural stamp of hey we,

492
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:35,440
you know, we invest in, in making
these arts destination. Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,800
And the Getty is really impressive.
There's actually two Getty's in La.

494
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,080
The more prominent one is right off
the four oh five and it's massive

495
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,590
multibillion dollar museum
that has gardens and you know,

496
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,770
as it's one of the
world's great art museums.

497
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,590
It does have food if you want to eat
while you're at the museum. I mean,

498
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:00,560
the leading thing that they,
that they promote is their food,

499
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,700
but it also has [inaudible] and you can
get one. Yeah, you can get wine, coffee,

500
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,460
you can get coffee and you can
go to the bathroom. And then, um,

501
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,081
which is really pretty,

502
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:13,430
or you can see they're
world class art sculptures,

503
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:16,520
paintings,
just they have a rotating works of art.

504
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,940
They had a photography exhibit
that we saw, a photography,

505
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,040
photography and they have pictures there,

506
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,880
pitchers and pitchers that a photographer
took and they're framed and hanging on

507
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:30,120
the wall. How many people say photographer
constantly. I hear it all the time.

508
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,970
I heard my sister when she was out here
say x specially really hit it hard.

509
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,220
You know what I mean?
Like especially,

510
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,190
especially, yeah, she does. I've
heard of those. I just let it go.

511
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,870
K Express. Okay. Hitler. Uh,

512
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
but I love the Getty.

513
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:55,601
We saw Robert Maplethorpe exhibit the
explain for Koller explain who that is.

514
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,930
So Mabel Thorpe was the
photographer, photographer,
famous in the late seventies,

515
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:06,020
eighties took portraits of famous people,

516
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,830
most notably like Patti Smith for the
cover of horses, which is a huge album.

517
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,900
And the, and, and, and then he
took other types of photos. Yeah.

518
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,040
Well, you know, he was, uh,

519
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,320
he was pretty binary
and he was actually by,

520
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:24,680
for a while.
Patty Smith is a woman.

521
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:29,540
And then later he decided, he was
like, Nah, I like the other stuff more.

522
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,840
And then he died of Lecia. But, um,

523
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,870
but some of those photographs or,
uh,

524
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,920
provocative, Ooh. Say for instance,

525
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:45,921
there was one where you walk into a room
at the Getty and then you see just kind

526
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:50,190
of torso, mid torso down. Um,

527
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,450
a man in a suit,

528
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,350
but it's flies open and you won't
believe what's hanging out of his fly.

529
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,950
It's a massive, I would
say semi erect. Right.

530
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,040
Lack on circumcise.
Mm.

531
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,270
And uh, yeah, if everyone's just
walking around salivating and you know,

532
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,340
trying to put their saliva
back in their mouth.

533
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,380
But there was some provocative photos
but you pointed out to me that his most

534
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,480
controversial and provocative photos,

535
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:22,380
we're not in the know and I'm a little
disappointed in the Getty that they

536
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,610
didn't Kinda, they didn't go go
there. Yeah. They one JV squad. Yeah.

537
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,530
Cause I worked at a bookstore in the 90s
when I was in college and if you wanted

538
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:34,380
to see Maplethorpe's books,
the book of work,

539
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,880
you had to show id that you were over
18 and it was behind the counter. Yeah.

540
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,130
And immediately off. Right then
you couldn't drop off right there.

541
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,230
You had to buy it and take it home.
Yeah.

542
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,910
But I remember being like whatever this
book is, I'm on board cause no one,

543
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,230
the anarchist cookbook was behind the
counter and I'm able for book and those

544
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:55,260
are my two favorite books. When I worked
at the bookstore in Woodland Hills. Yeah.

545
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,680
And uh, so Mabel Thorpe, I don't know
if you want to Google image search,

546
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,170
just show the people.
Okay. I can't show it on,

547
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm on Youtube is going to get flagged.

548
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,980
Google Thorp and just look
at the treasures. Yeah.

549
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,990
Maplethorpe Maplethorpe's m a. P.
P. L. E. T. H. O. R. P. E. Yeah.

550
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,820
Robert. You might have to
start, you don't have to,

551
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,170
you'll see some like naked people.
You're like, that's it. No, it gets,

552
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,780
it gets better. Yeah. Keep
digging. Yeah, keep going.

553
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,850
I've seen naked people maybe not
like this. You haven't special.

554
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,950
Yeah. Uh, yeah, but I was
disappointed that they didn't
go full maple for upon it.

555
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,550
Yeah. I mean that's kind of
what people want to see. Right.

556
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,140
If you want to know where's the com,

557
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,210
it should have been at the Maple Thorp
exhibit. They really should have been.

558
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:43,290
And they,
they dropped the ball on that for sure.

559
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,540
But we saw all somewhere
standing. Yes. It's,

560
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,980
you have to take a tram to get to the
Getty and you park down below and they

561
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:54,310
take you up a hill.
It's really alive.

562
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,690
That's the Maple Thorp exhibit o

563
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,553
okay.

564
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,080
I should have been playing the audio part
of the installation. Right. He's sure.

565
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:10,070
Yeah. As you walk, you
shouldn't play this. Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,680
Why did they do an audio component?
Yeah.

567
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,843
Come on.

568
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,410
That's art. Yeah, it's good.
Yes sir. That's art. Um,

569
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,340
stone sheep.

570
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,883
Go ahead.

571
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,240
So we're waiting in line to get on the
tram and we saw a little 20 year old

572
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,030
girls and it's funny cause, yeah, there,

573
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,460
and it was a cold day in la. You get to
wear a sweater or jacket. It was cold

574
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,550
and people don't understand.

575
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,930
I think that live in other parts of
the country that it does get, you know,

576
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,530
brisk. Yeah. Uncertain
days, you know, it'll be,

577
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,890
you might be used to it if you live
in a really cold city, but it's,

578
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,980
it gets to the point
where people wear jackets.

579
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,480
Well,
especially when we were in the,

580
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,210
in the mountains there the wind blows and
blows and you know, it's cold as fuck.

581
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:04,400
But there's always young
girls shivering in La.

582
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,530
Horrors are always cold no matter
what whores get cold because it's more

583
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:13,160
important to them for you to know that
they're whores, they're sexy. Warm. Yeah.

584
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,570
Yeah. And they're addressed like horrors.
Yeah. And I'm like, why the Getty?

585
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,060
You got to address it.
But I guess maybe the Maple Thorp Exhibit,

586
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,600
they went to go see Dicks,
but um, but yeah, I dunno.

587
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,690
I don't think those girls were
looking for those now. No.

588
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,130
What were they looking for it? I
don't know. But they definitely,

589
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,000
they're shivering a little chickens in
line put in work to be a whore. Yeah,

590
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,200
yeah, yeah. Once I drink,
that's a universal truth,
man. Whores are always cold.

591
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,530
Always cold. Yeah. Especially, I
remember when I did Indianapolis,

592
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:45,680
I did a crackers in broad,
broad ripple once,

593
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,940
when winter and it's cold
and it's, yeah. Oh yeah.

594
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:52,480
And it's in that bar area
where all the kids are. Yeah.

595
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,440
And I just a stack of horse
around the corner, just all,
and it's snowing outside.

596
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,540
Crazy. It is not a joke. You
see it any, if you go Friday,
Saturday out in any city,

597
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,180
yeah. You'll always see those cold
hookers walking around. I know. And the,

598
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,370
the heels you got to where you're hitting
your hooker heels and you gotta be

599
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:13,110
cold and Chevrons. Airports. Yeah. Oh,

600
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,520
he's wearing like eight inch stilettos
and your leg, not the fly, right? Yeah.

601
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:20,060
In the morning. I know the morning
flight and you appreciate the effort.

602
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:23,490
You're like you're a hardworking
hooker. But yeah. You know, uh,

603
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,360
you don't have to do this for a
flight. No. Okay. Comfortable. Yeah.

604
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:30,580
Get countable bitch yet. And then the
tight clothes you're wearing this to,

605
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,840
to sit, to sit uncomfortably on
this flight. So fucking weird.

606
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,250
And then you land and it's still
fucking early wherever we went.

607
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:40,010
And like you don't have to look
like this til tonight, right, man,

608
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,710
I dunno how much you suck sucking
it at the airport, you know,

609
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:46,460
stuck at the airport, given a little
suck, suck at the airport, you know,

610
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,700
it doesn't matter. We, we
can't get away from it.

611
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,090
And, um, it's, it's obviously, you
know, the show's gotten more popular.

612
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:56,500
We know that.
Um,

613
00:40:56,501 --> 00:41:01,501
but it's taken on a life of its own
and places you don't even expect it to,

614
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,360
to get picked up here
is, um, Rick Ross. Nope.

615
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,220
But I did go to high school with him
for a year. Yeah. Yeah. For a year.

616
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,340
He's got a really full
beard. I like that. He does.

617
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,950
He almost had that when he
was in seventh grade. No Shit.

618
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:22,210
And one of those dudes sound yeah. His
Dad a famous baseball player. No kidding.

619
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,440
Yeah.
Prints

620
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,400
the older Hitler so far today
Yoder, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler,

621
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,620
Hitler.
Hitler.

622
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,760
Hmm. I like that blue van and
do that. Oh, that was like,

623
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:43,080
it was really funny. Yeah. Yeah.

624
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,200
So there you go. And Prince fielder. Wow.

625
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,350
I didn't know he was an
anti Semite to well that,

626
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,470
I think the announcer was making it
clear what he was, you know? Yeah.

627
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,413
Very good.

628
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,160
Yeah. Yup. It's there, man. It's
out there. It's out there. Um,

629
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:08,050
another fun thing we saw at the Getty
was the guy in line two, we are awaiting,

630
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,943
oh my God,

631
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,230
isn't this not your favorite guy who's
got the horseshoe balding pattern and

632
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:19,150
it's all gray. It's all gray. Yeah.
He's a total dad. 50 some years old.

633
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,950
It's still kind of trying to keep it cool.

634
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:23,860
He was wearing his chuck Taylors right?
No faded.

635
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,370
The Light Blue Denim is light
blue denim was on his dad jeans.

636
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,580
Did he have belt on? A Brown braided?
I'm not sure. He had an untucked shirt,

637
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,290
a button down so you couldn't
see his belt. I remember.
Okay. And then, um, you know,

638
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,100
he had his, his, his vision is not
so good. He has glasses like dads do,

639
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,410
eh, I can't see this art. And then he, um,

640
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,430
yeah, he had Sasha with her, with him. Uh,

641
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,820
she was at least 20,

642
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,350
if not 30 years younger than yeah.
Way Out of his league.

643
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:58,840
Looks White. Yeah. Just
way out of his league.

644
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:03,370
And you could just have a lot in
common. Well, that's the thing when,

645
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:08,470
you know, I've seen Carl with
so many girls and he's just, he,

646
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:12,580
him and Sasha together, they're
just, it's like, you know,

647
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:16,390
they're meant to be, you can't even
tell that there's an age difference.

648
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,680
Like when you hang out with them
and you kind of, you go, I mean,

649
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,220
they might as well be the same age because
he really comes alive when he's with

650
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:24,910
her.

651
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,910
And I've just never seen him so happy
and it's just fun to see him finally find

652
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,390
the girl that's perfect
for him. So crazy. Right.

653
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,320
It's fucking the weirdest.
You think he's not embarrassed.

654
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:41,110
They should be embarrassed, but they're
not. And you're like, oh, I know.

655
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,180
And the embarrassed what he's like,
Eh,

656
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,750
he probably walked right that
she was totally like, she
has a little bit of like,

657
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,300
hmm. Yeah, he started, he had a,

658
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,260
he's a venture capitalist and things kind
of worked out so it worked out with us

659
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:57,670
too. So we should point out
that they were like kissing.

660
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:02,400
Yeah. Modeling and doing odd of PTA.
The whole like, I'm wrestling in India.

661
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,450
Yeah. You're like, what in the fuck? And
he was probably, do you like the getting,

662
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,150
she was like, what's that? Yeah, but
oh, by the way, the other Getty is,

663
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:14,740
I'm in Malibu and it's uh, it's
not as well known. It's phenomenal.

664
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:18,880
It was a private residence.
It's this, uh, what is it,

665
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,860
John Paul Getty. Um, what's that,
that architectural style though, bro?

666
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,430
Co Roman Roman style?
I don't know. I don't,

667
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:32,050
I have never been to that one in
the, in the Malibu Roman. It's a,

668
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,740
it's a multimillion dollar. Very
impressive. And they have a lot.

669
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,150
You could buy it from me and they have
all the Arthur you could buy the art for

670
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:42,210
me too. I'll do that. I'll just take
out a loan. I'll do that for you.

671
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,070
You probably take out like,
I don't know,

672
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,940
$500 million loan.
Do you think your,

673
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,250
will you take your second
wife to the Getty? Um,

674
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,330
when you get your Sasha,
when you done me and then you,

675
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,750
you have great to your 20 year old. I'll
go, you like the gay, she'd be like,

676
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:06,030
yeah, it did. He just do
a song with Rihanna. I was
like, this is a different guy.

677
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,730
She was like, I'll check them
out and then we'll go. Then

678
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,630
all of us, it's art. Why?

679
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,330
Because people make art. Ah,
that's nice. I have that.

680
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,810
That's pretty expensive when you buy it.
I think it's for sale.

681
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,250
I think that, can I
have it daddy? I want to

682
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,250
catch it. Whatever you
want. So retarded. Yeah.

683
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,380
I think my dad's had a few of
those. Oh my God. For sure.

684
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,670
That's probably why I'd notice it
cause I'm like, I don't, there's,

685
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,840
my dad has definitely. Why you notice it
here it goes, is 20 year old girlfriend.

686
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,490
Um, by the way, do you
remember one of the biggest,

687
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,493
um,

688
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,740
shows we've ever had was
a Miami fart machine?

689
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,540
No, it was, where is it?

690
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,810
It was a foreign

691
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,793
Barnett's

692
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,090
voice in the conversation or nearly free,
Ya know,

693
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,150
for, Ya know. So, and there was no,

694
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:23,610
there's basically no indication of
how things happened, you know? Um,

695
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,970
I mean, so listen to, uh,

696
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,540
let's see if we can get for free year
now for free. You're now free young. Now.

697
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,880
Don't play it my mommy
phones. Okay, go. Okay.

698
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,530
Sex with me.
So amazing.

699
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,890
Deseret. And people are free to believe
whatever they read, but you know,

700
00:46:44,891 --> 00:46:49,100
I mean clearly what I've
been going through, I know
it's not psychogenic as lie.

701
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,110
I hope by now you've probably noticed
Jennings spoke with a foreign accent that

702
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,190
she'd never had before. I'm from Ohio.
I should not be talking like this.

703
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,050
There's no way a flu shot can
cause someone's accent to change.

704
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:06,170
Absolutely not one more. She's
claiming a flu shot. Horseshit.

705
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,780
Notice when inside edition first
approached Jennings in this parking lot,

706
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:14,650
she seemed to be walking normally,
but after their interview,

707
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,860
she walks to her car sideways saying
it was Dystonia when kcal nine

708
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,470
news. Isn't that the best thing
you've ever seen? Walking sideways.

709
00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:30,260
And she was like a flu shot.
Flu shot there. They still buy.

710
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,200
Wow. That was really good. That was,

711
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,620
I got my flu shot and I told him, oh,
okay. Out of it. Totally not gaze.

712
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,230
What a lying liar.
Fucking liar.

713
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,990
Liar pants lie a little slut.

714
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:55,200
I think it is a little slut.
You're such a fucking, uh,

715
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,800
I think it is big as well. Just put your
fucking high heels on slide. She needs,

716
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:02,600
she's wearing way too many
clothes for them. Sluts.

717
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,530
Gotta wear horror it up a little.
Take off that jacket.

718
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:10,520
Show us your arms man. Um, foreign accent.

719
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:14,470
Speaking of foreign accents,
how not to actually, this is a,

720
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:17,680
a reporter and as a master of actions.
I really appreciate this.

721
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:23,130
This a reporter is interviewing some
soccer hooligans after an arsenal match

722
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,190
like soccer hooligan.
So silly. They're so,

723
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,350
they're so fucking gangster with how
much they love their, yeah. Their soccer.

724
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:36,550
Let's see what we can hooligans if you
can with these. Ruffians are up to,

725
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,533
here we go.

726
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,320
Also fancy TV. Really disappointed
today. Yeah. Again, I mean
I love that. I'm sorry.

727
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,570
I need to everybody, it's just like I've
seen it over and over and over again.

728
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:50,220
That sort of performance that I saw today
where we've had nearly all the game.

729
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,700
It's almost like it's just
a training game, right?

730
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,720
Not taking shots on guy guys.
Yeah.

731
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,020
Normal obviously. Yeah. But then

732
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,410
I mean it's so disappointing.
Yes.

733
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,980
It's the same ting blood every week,
blood every week,

734
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,840
fun every week.
Blood,

735
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,850
blood and Fam. I love it. I didn't
know that fam was international.

736
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,470
I thought that was totally us thing. I'm
not him. I don't even know that. Jesus.

737
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:21,220
You're so white fam. Yeah.
Well as in family. Yeah, fam.

738
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,580
Yeah, but no, but you hear it more
here. I'm saying never heard it here.

739
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,510
Never heard that. Yeah. Do
you have any friends of color?

740
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,750
No. No. I'm saying did the
fence. The fence is dead blood.

741
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,130
What's Paul doing? Blood. He has no eight
while I was doing, he's a sideman fun.

742
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,360

He's doing nef implant.

743
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,260
Yeah. No, I'm with fired. I've
never heard that. Really? Never Fam.

744
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:46,820
Like good to see you fam. Nothing like
that. No, no, no. Did you think fam?

745
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,220
Nothing like that. I mean, I don't
say it. It would sound absurd,

746
00:49:49,221 --> 00:49:51,470
but I've heard it a lot.
People have said it to me.

747
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,940
Steve Wilkos probably says it all
the time. We come with through fam.

748
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,860
You won't be there. Yeah,

Dennis, I want to paint you fed. You had
his number too involved in team blood.

We've all, Bowman has, he got
blood on you see the defense fund?

[inaudible] [inaudible]

768
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:16,910
[inaudible] [inaudible] well they have a
lift to none of them may have said that.

769
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:20,750
Dale, my f man. Yes. I
just realized I do have a,

770
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,270
Oh my God Dad,
that his dad had a mouse this whole time.

771
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:31,130
That as a mouse for the other, but
that's from, for this one. God Damn it.

772
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:36,080
So we dad, can he use that for this
one too? I mean the Mesas yeah,

773
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,990
we should probably get another
one, right? Yeah. Yeah.

774
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:43,660
Dad needs a mouse for every computer.
You know, from where I was saying that,

775
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,080
it looked to me like I've
terrible gold peak America.

776
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,610
Goalkeeping that you said it was just
like the first game of the season blood.

777
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,010
This is near post phone call.

778
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,030
It could be a new post blog
and it's done everything.

779
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:58,350
And then he did you understand
in a salad? Yeah, fam. Yeah.

780
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,490
Bam. You understand? Yeah. But look
how bummed this guy is just he's so,

781
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:05,250
he can't even bring yourself for words.
You so upset.

782
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:08,250
I was so bummed that he doesn't get to
talk. Yeah, I think that's what he's like.

783
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,390
Wonder if he'll ask me. He's like,
Hey, the whole time he's like, well,

784
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,150
he asked me a question.
You think? I think so,

785
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:19,070
but then this guy also knows that this
guy is great for PV blood. This guys,

786
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,320
I could listen to them talk all day.
Yeah.

787
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:26,780
I man just said Dave is a confidence
thing. Like I said in my interview before,

788
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:31,050
motivation, blood, the
team is not doing it again.

789
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,340
We'll quite get what she could walk again.
So fun.

790
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:41,140
I think doing robot come for five minutes,
but what did he do?

791
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,890
Black called? What's the point?
Blood is getting tagged from behind.

792
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:47,690
He's Tarot Ball.
What are they doing in the portrait?

793
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,440
We come up with five minutes,
but what did he do? Blood Park.

794
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,860
What's the point back off?
What's this man doing?

795
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,250
What he doing in the board
does not motivate. Get blood.

796
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,630
They're not doing that
and that walk out again.

797
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,470
We'll kind of get what you
give me a black eye robot.

798
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,690
Where does that come up for five minutes?
But what did he do call?

799
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,240
What's the point? What's this man doing
fun? What are you doing in the board?

800
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:12,310
But she's a crazy guys.
Amazing.

801
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,830
Yeah, I love it. I love
soccer. Hooligans and crazy.

802
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,090
You're like, you know,
I can't take it anymore.

803
00:53:20,091 --> 00:53:25,040
I just want to hear the best of what
this guy has got. Well, we got that from,

804
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,063

805
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,380
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

806
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:36,290
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

807
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:41,310
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

808
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,863
It has to stop.

809
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,590
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

810
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,900
Oh Shit. Oh man, that was good. Good
work. Blue Band. Really good job.

811
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,690
That's really good. Blah
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

812
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,360
So soccer hooligans or like the,

813
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:07,350
the British version of like our
football lunatic paint there.

814
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,990
I think they're definitely crazy.
Are There Derek? That they're crazy.

815
00:54:10,991 --> 00:54:14,050
They riot and the people up in
there as Harris. Yeah. Yeah.

816
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,710
But they're way more amusing to
listen to then it was pretty,

817
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,910
I mean there's those guys
pretty much holding it. He's
animated. He fired up that,

818
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:24,100
but his team losing.
But there's definitely,

819
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,410
I don't even know if he would
constitute a hooligan, you know,

820
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:31,210
hooligans over there. Really.
They're terrifying. Yeah.

821
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,790
Get big groups and they're
like breaking shit. Yeah.

822
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,960
Throwing Molotov cocktails and
yeah, they're, they're not man.

823
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,570
Bill Hicks had a great bit
about soccer hooligans.

824
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:43,160
He was saying that they weren't like,
um,

825
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:48,540
the biggest thing in England is a waste
bin was knocked over in Shaftsbury.

826
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,200
So cute. Where are the
hooligans? Like their,

827
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,710
their musicals maybe after he did
that, but things change. I know.

828
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,520
That was like in the nineties yeah.
You believe that dude died at like 34.

829
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,830
I know.
It's crazy.

830
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,780
And do you know that Hicks
toward while he was dying? Yeah.

831
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,240
And his last stuff he recorded,
it was as he was dying,

832
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:13,420
he told no one that he was, he told very
few people that he was dying of cancer.

833
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,620
Wow.
So crazy.

834
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,440
Could you imagine doing like that's
what you choose to do at the end of your

835
00:55:17,441 --> 00:55:22,000
life? I don't know. I might still do
standup. Yeah. I mean he also, you know,

836
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:24,230
he's a single guy and you
know, he didn't, it was,

837
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,950
we're going to do just sit at home.
And was he married? No, he had a woman,

838
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:29,860
but I don't know if they're only worried.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah,

839
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,910
I've looked it up and his
name wasn't married. Oh, okay.

840
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,180
No problem with that. I feel like you
wish you could have married Bill Hicks.

841
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:44,620
Yeah. You love his stuff.
Why would I marry Bill Hicks
when I'm married? A savage?

842
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:50,260
Who knows? And I married a dirt devil.
Burt dog. He might've been a savage. No,

843
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:55,210
no. Bill Hanks. He's kind of polite and
he is sweet. I don't know. I don't know.

844
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:00,310
Yeah, no, I like you. I'm glad
I married you. Yeah, yeah.

845
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,550
Oh,
Ooh.

846
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,080
Oh did you, that was bill
Hicks is ghost. It was.

847
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,800
We were just talking about him and then
our, our boards just fell. You see that?

848
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:16,820
That goes to bill Hicks came back
together. This guys. He's like,

849
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:22,210
bitch, he told you I love you. Fuck
it. You do love him. I do love books.

850
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,310
He was one,
I think one of the grades.

851
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,400
No, he just said hello.
He did say hello. Good.

852
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:33,830
Good for you. Yeah. Um, oh,

853
00:56:33,831 --> 00:56:38,450
this is pretty great. Um, I've,
I was, somebody sent me this,

854
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,560
you know,
there's nobody more,

855
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:47,090
I dunno who's left a bigger impact on me,
I feel like in my life.

856
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,070
Um, and, and how I try to
choose, I try to live my life.

857
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:56,720
Then I'm Steven Seagal.
Um,

858
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,530
everyone feels the same. Most people feel
the same way. Everyone feels that way.

859
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,510
Here is the coaster.
Segal,

860
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:10,790
um, in this, I guess it was an
interview with a French language.

861
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,240
Okay.

862
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,880
Media people. So it starts off with
a little tease here of his, uh,

863
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,283
yes.

864
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,310
Oh shoot. Bulls are secrets. Antonio
Machado. And also shake on him.

865
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,920
Patricia's on the BBC Denali.

866
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,800
I went, there we are with their face.

867
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,240
Super.
All right.

868
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,790
I'm gonna vomit.

869
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,000
That was so gross I said to have been
able to throw up. I can't hear it again.

870
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,860
More. Yeah, I think
I've played here. Yeah.

871
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:07,030
Wait time ago. Probably
was a long time ago. Yeah.

872
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:14,080
Okay. What are your relations
with Rw today? I mean,

873
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,990
you know, I don't live in
Hollywood. No, I just leave. I live,

874
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:23,400
you know, in Arizona and you
know, all over the place.

875
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,620
I'm gonna answer it. Where do you live,
motherfucker? It's simple and you know,

876
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,030
all over the place. He's a
citizen of the world, Tom. He is,

877
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,370
he has that world passport.

878
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,830
He's a widow's peak of the world and
been most deaf and they just, they don't,

879
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,580
they live with it.

880
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:43,380
Yeah. I mean, I still have a relationship
with Hollywood. I just don't live there.

881
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,790
Oh, I'm going to throw up if I know I'm
doing that while I use it to place not

882
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:52,050
really healthy
for me.

883
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:54,710
It's not so good, you know, rather,

884
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,810
you know, why did he go eat accented
there? Right. He picks up good. You know,

885
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,480
how'd you say the versa?
The act, as I just said,

886
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,490
I'm going to borrow this. You know, God,

887
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,780
because the savage long experience that
many of them do and many of them don't.

888
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,620
Oh,
that's a great

889
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,740
many of them do. Many of them
people feel that way. Many do, man.

890
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,580
I don't many of them.
Yeah.

891
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,260
Do you have
to say about the crew?

892
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,760
The team, but the scripts. Oh Jesus.

893
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:42,110
Are you on the quiet?
No.

894
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,630
On the movies I do.
I have some say so in all of that,

895
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,273
how do you think,

896
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,570
what an asshole?
Just answer the fucking question.

897
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,330
Something tells me it doesn't want to be
there. I don't, I don't know what it is,

898
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,980
but I think he doesn't want to be there.
He doesn't want to

899
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,840
press teaches said, well,
I don't know how they came,

900
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:08,380
but they did come and I
accepted it because I wanted
to try something different.

901
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,720
Different of Voluma. Right,
right, right. Yes. Yeah.

902
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,490
Skeet. Shoot. I said chip
at bargain with that.

903
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,280
[inaudible] would you like
to do to come back and to be,

904
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:29,170
you know, the master of your own
project to do he have, you know,

905
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,840
the,
the dream of

906
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,500
you can tell she's really trying
to earnest. Yeah. I'm like,

907
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:37,170
I have to these really like thought out.
Yeah.

908
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,020
I really want to get to
know your answer on this.

909
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:43,460
I really tried to construct this in a
way that you can take it from there.

910
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,680
Awesome movie. That would be
the movie of your life. Yeah.

911
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:53,690
I would love to come back and make
more movies that are great movies.

912
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,360
Huh? He's sick. That's why he's miserable.
He's taking his theraflu and he's like,

913
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,730
oh,
it's so much wrong.

914
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:10,060
I think we should watch all of his movies
dubbed over in French. Yeah, we should.

915
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,790
I feel like that makes it way better.
Oh,

916
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:14,440
they're much better when you don't hear
him actually speak. It's great. Yeah.

917
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:19,430
We started to watch a movie of
his on Netflix number for X.

918
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,770
I'm sorry, I mispronounce it all the
time. Uh, we got, how far did we get?

919
01:01:22,771 --> 01:01:26,910
10 minutes. It was a new one.
Yeah. Yeah. It was really bad.

920
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,470
It was shot somewhere in Bakersfield,
but it was meant to look like Afghanistan.

921
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,870
Who was, um, yeah, it was, it was,
it was shot in like Milwaukee.

922
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,720
You could tell. Yeah,
that's Midwest. Yeah.

923
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,310
Clearly the trees and Michigan's right
there. And he's just like, it's so,

924
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:49,530
so tough out here in Afghanistan.
Yeah. So, hmm. So ridiculous.

925
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,970
Um,
so it's been a minute and um,

926
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:59,150
it's definitely one of the most
important segments we do on this show.

927
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:04,390
Let's bring it to you right now
with a new introductory. So, wow.

928
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,123
Here we go.

929
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:15,140
Well,

930
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:20,140
I get to take on our
original dental update music.

931
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,040
It's called lost them shit by the ducts.

932
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,360
You can hear like the
influence of the original,

933
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,930
take her to the ticker type thing.

934
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,680
Um, do you have a dental updates?
I have a couple. Yeah. Um,

935
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,820
personally I'm really slacking
on a couple things. It's hot.

936
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,090
My flossing has not been as good lately
and I really need to white. And again,

937
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:52,260
I have my trays. Dude, I tell you to
whitening. Every time I see you smile,

938
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,460
I go,
look at those yellow

939
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,420
lottery,
your sex.

940
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:01,450
Can I tell you every fucking time I see
you smile to hug that the meanest thing

941
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:06,200
somebody could say to their spouse,
I'm trying to help. You're the worst.

942
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:11,040
So look how white my day that
I'm going to,

943
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:15,500
I want to talk about tonight. Let's
do it tonight. Yeah, I'll help you,

944
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,250
but we know where your trays are. I got
them in the closet. Yeah, you guys do it,

945
01:03:19,251 --> 01:03:20,390
dude.
Seriously,

946
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:25,450
it's going to burn like hell but really
it hurts so bad but you look so pretty.

947
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,040
All right.
Hello mommies.

948
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,430
I am currently sitting in the parking lot
of the dentist's office after my first

949
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:35,600
visit and over 13 years.
I lied to the dentist,

950
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,050
told him it'd been five years because I
could not bring myself to admit to him.

951
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:43,730
Should have been over a decade after
my first visit. After my visit.

952
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,410
You were the first people I wanted to
share this news with much like my actual

953
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:49,244
mother.

954
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:53,630
I'm sure you are quite disappointed to
hear that one of your own head ignored

955
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:58,280
their oral health for so long, but good
news. There is nothing to worry about.

956
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,950
After 13 years I am cavity fruit loud.

957
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,960
Never had one in my life
and didn't require anything
beyond a standard cleaning.

958
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:12,470
I'm not sure if I dodged a bullet and
this will put me back on the right track

959
01:04:12,471 --> 01:04:17,471
to proper dental care or if I just
reinforce my terrible behavior now that I

960
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:22,040
know it can avoid the dentist for a
third of my life and still be just fine.

961
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:25,940
Only time will tell.
Although my dental care may fall behind,

962
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:30,560
my genes will always stay high and
tight. We're too your mom, Bridget.

963
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,190
Uh, that was just, I mean that
is, yeah. Bridget, here's,

964
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,960
here's what I'm going to say. You did
dodge a bullet and I'm guessing you're,

965
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:40,310
I so I think so, but you can't
do this stuff when you're older.

966
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,410
That's the problem is when you
get into your forties and 50s.

967
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:44,990
She's in her thirties. But, but yeah,

968
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:49,340
as you get older it will get more serious
and I would consider myself just lucky

969
01:04:49,341 --> 01:04:52,950
on that one. If, if I was her, uh,

970
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:56,390
we got another one.
Let's see. Hey, Mommy's,

971
01:04:56,391 --> 01:05:00,200
I finally went to the dentist for the
first time in 10 years. Last week guys.

972
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:04,610
Boy was this embarrassing. After 26
years, I still have a baby tooth.

973
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,420
The original adult tooth group backwards
into the Palette of my mouth and was

974
01:05:08,421 --> 01:05:12,950
removed the last time I saw a dentist
10 years ago along with my five wisdom

975
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,650
teeth and it's falling apart.
Along with that,

976
01:05:15,651 --> 01:05:20,170
one of my showing teeth right up
front is broken in Hass slant ways.

977
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:25,110
That's what I had and seven small cavities
throughout the rest of my mouth. Oh,

978
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:28,900
Holy Shit. Right. My dentist
literally gave me a d plus grade,

979
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,020
so the fillings are covered by insurance,

980
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:35,230
but to get the crowns
it's like $900 a tooth.

981
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:40,000
Can have the tube teeth pulled and
get what's called a flipper tooth.

982
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,990
Just in case you don't know what that is
is basically a retainer. Yeah. My cousin,

983
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,740
he's attached to it.
That's going to run me about 450 bucks.

984
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,430
I basically want to know mommies.
What should I do?

985
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,170
What my Mommy's would do? Sorry.
I know Christina has always said,

986
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:59,540
put yourself in debt for your tea fees.
We already,

987
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,560
we are already paying an $8,000
hospital bill from 10 years ago.

988
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,190
What do I do? Jeans machine. How
expensive is it to repair? A crown.

989
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:13,030
I need help Mei, the tutes be
strong with you. The Nessa.

990
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,700
I'll tell you first of all, don't have
laid fixing those crowns are expensive.

991
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,130
Here's what you should do
if you can't afford it,

992
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:24,490
if you can't open up a line of credit,
ask for care credit. I believe it's,

993
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:27,910
it's a form of dental credit.
Your dentist's office may have that.

994
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:33,700
Go to a dental school.
Are you near a major city?

995
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:38,170
I recommend where near Ucla go to
UCLA and go to a dental student.

996
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,190
They can do it for a fraction of the
cost and you know the work will be

997
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:47,191
overlooked by whatever dentists
and such a that don't go cheap.

998
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:50,430
I don't, don't get the
flipper. I it looks like shit.

999
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,870
My cousin has a flipper
tooth with their retainer.

1000
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,050
I don't think she hasn't anymore.
Oh No, I didn't think she,

1001
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:59,530
I think she got replaced, but it, it
looks like it looks doesn't belong there.

1002
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:02,560
So you know what I read it. Recommend
to me if you're paying off at that,

1003
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,890
you said you don't want to accrue
all kinds of debt. One thing,

1004
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:09,160
and this doesn't work obviously if
everybody, depending on your situation,

1005
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:12,730
but a friend of mine did
this one time is that he,

1006
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:16,600
this was before like sell a kidney, right?
Yeah. He's, he's, and he's sold a child,

1007
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:20,430
uh, before Obama care and um, you know,

1008
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:24,190
all those mandatory insurance things.
But this happened is that he,

1009
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:28,930
he lapsed the payment on his insurance,
on his health insurance, lost it,

1010
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,130
and then was in a kind of a bind,
obviously for health care.

1011
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:38,550
And he went to doctor's
offices with cash and said,

1012
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:43,780
could I get, because those doctor's
offices and dentist as well are used to,

1013
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:44,200
you know,

1014
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,260
maybe funneling some of this stuff through
insurance and they know they're only

1015
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:49,390
getting a percentage of the
amount and all this stuff.

1016
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,260
So he just went and was like, if I
pay you cash, can I get a discount?

1017
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,960
And then he got,
he said yes across the board.

1018
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:01,210
People were doing it for a fraction of
what they normally charge because he had

1019
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:05,320
cash money. Oh. And I would say
if you have dental insurance, why?

1020
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,460
I think if I've had it once before and
it's kind of a waste. And not only that,

1021
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:10,031
the dentist,

1022
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:14,340
I did take insurance one time I went
to and they took my x rays and they,

1023
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,190
and the guy goes, oh, you have like

1024
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,210
12 cavities. Remember this?
Yeah. And I go, that's horse
shit. I don't believe you.

1025
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:24,770
I went to a dentist,
didn't tell them I had insurance and uh,

1026
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,600
they took the same x rays and they go,
you have no cabinets? No, that was me. No,

1027
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:30,434
that was me,
Babe.

1028
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:35,100
Sure. Yeah, 100% sure. Are you sure
one? No. It happened to me too. No,

1029
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,520
it did happen to me. And I've told
you this story. It happened to me.

1030
01:08:38,521 --> 01:08:42,240
I had dental insurance is
so weird. No, it happens.

1031
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:45,330
It happened to me when I worked,
my God, it happened to me too.

1032
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:48,840
Then there's a in Glendale
knew that it happened to you.

1033
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:52,290
So here's when it happened to me.
Okay.

1034
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,200
It happened to me,
happened to me too.

1035
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:57,470
I swear to God was the
first time we're hearing,

1036
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:59,160
I've told you this story multiple times.

1037
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,270
I worked for the show extreme
makeover as a law. Right.

1038
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,170
They let us go to the dentist to get
the zoom whitening treatment. Yeah.

1039
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,970
When I was there, the x ray me and the
guy goes, oh, you have like 17 cavities.

1040
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:15,710
And I was like, what? And I go, he's
like, yeah, you know, we'll, we'll,

1041
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,200
we can take care of them
all now. And I go, I,

1042
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:19,470
I think I'll take a range
of insurance at the time.

1043
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:21,810
And that's why he was milking
you for dental insurance? Yes.

1044
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:25,170
And so then I went to another dentist
that was covered under that dental

1045
01:09:25,171 --> 01:09:28,530
insurance and he was like, you have
no cavities to, you know, Ciro.

1046
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,480
And I was blown away by it.

1047
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,840
And then even though you know that
story that happened to you also,

1048
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,093
did it happen?

1049
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,650
Can I tell you why I had dental
insurance for the first time,

1050
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:40,560
my life when I worked at this
company. Yeah. And I swear to God,

1051
01:09:40,561 --> 01:09:44,070
it was in Glendale and the guy goes, oh,
you got a lot of work to do. We got it.

1052
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,270
I swear,
I believe you.

1053
01:09:45,271 --> 01:09:48,420
And then I took it to my Hungarian
guy who doesn't exist anymore.

1054
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:52,320
He retired fire Dr for hair
and he's gotten, he's retired.

1055
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,800
We can talk to him and he goes, there's
no way this guy was totally scamming you.

1056
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:58,530
And then I canceled dental insurance
all together and just pay it.

1057
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,930
So I would get a second opinion
is what I'm trying to say.

1058
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,890
And the cavities on the cavities and on
the extent of the work that you need a

1059
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:09,180
lot about it. Actually a
lot of times these scumbags
see that you have insurance,

1060
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,250
I don't know, box. And then they
tried to get their money from,

1061
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:17,310
you know, if it happened to both
of us, it can happen at the cabin.

1062
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,570
Was it when I was working in Burbank
did we weren't dating then where we win,

1063
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,670
the more you and I were dating, this
happened to me that this is a new story,

1064
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:30,960
but oh my God, ask Eric. Eric,

1065
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:33,480
if you're listening to this,
do you remember when this happened to me?

1066
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:35,810
Because she'll be like, I remember
what happened at Tom. You're the worst.

1067
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:38,520
And I remember, Oh, this
happened to you too. Okay,

1068
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,950
got you. Laugh like an all
day. I hate you the most.

1069
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,890
Ah, Shit. Anyway, why are
you have dental insurance?

1070
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:52,290
Unless it comes with your company.
Don't pay for that shit.

1071
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:56,270
There's no reason you're going to end up
getting jacked even harder. Check this.

1072
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:59,280
Go to a Russian dentist.
Yeah, I swear to God.

1073
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,930
Russians will do the work
a little bit cheaper too,

1074
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:04,250
but we don't know where she lives.
Well,

1075
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:07,740
find some fucking Russians or
eastern blockers. Foreigner.

1076
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,270
I find a foreigner and I mean that.
Find a corner. Offer them cash. Yeah.

1077
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:14,850
These white dentists, that's the problem
that they do everything above board.

1078
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:18,990
You got to go to an immigrant to do shit
the right way. Yeah, go to Chinatown.

1079
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,370
I didn't say that, but whoa.
Somewhere eastern bloc.

1080
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:27,200
I can't vouch for the Chinese. Do they
have good teeth? Chinese people? Ah,

1081
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:31,770
I don't know, but it just kinda feels
like words. I didn't say what I feel,

1082
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,680
but I know for a fact that my
tribal do your teeth pretty good.

1083
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,360
Russian eastern bloc.

1084
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,800
They do. That shit will fuck you. Okay.
All right. Well maybe the Russians.

1085
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:45,570
Uh Huh. Man, that was fucking good stuff.

1086
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,600
I hate you so much. Why do you
hate me? It happened to me too.

1087
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:51,900
I know it happened to you too. I
remember. Now you make me insane.

1088
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,480
And I canceled dental insurance
right after, dude. Yes.

1089
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:02,980
I think this is when we first
started dating. Well yeah,

1090
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:10,060
go to somebody like that. That's that
neighbor and guys run mother fucker.

1091
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:12,270
Go to that. My grandmother figure
and they'll tell you. Right.

1092
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:16,330
And for a obviously car repairs
don't ever go to a white mechanic.

1093
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:19,260
What are you nuts? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Always stay away from white people.

1094
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:24,070
Immigrants stay away. Right?
Eastern bloc. Asians. Okay. Yeah.

1095
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,660
That's a fear in la. I remember when
we went to get our um, Thai massages.

1096
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,660
Yeah. They were like hookers after,
cause you went to a different one.

1097
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:33,610
What happened was we,

1098
01:12:33,611 --> 01:12:37,930
so we moved to a new neighborhood and so
we have to do is to discover all kinds

1099
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:41,380
of new stuff again. Right? New restaurants
and everything you use. That's the only,

1100
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,251
you know,
it's kind of fun,

1101
01:12:42,251 --> 01:12:46,090
but it's also like bummed out if the
place he used to go to you liked. Yeah.

1102
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:51,390
So we went to this Thai place together
like a few weeks ago and then we went

1103
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:56,500
again and we called on the way they are
to request the same people that we had

1104
01:12:56,501 --> 01:13:00,910
the first time. Well, yours was available
for you, but mine wasn't. So I go, okay,

1105
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:05,360
well I'll try whoever's
available. So we finish, uh,

1106
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,410
the massage,
we go to the lobby and the,

1107
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:10,300
the lady that they had me
the first time goes, oh,

1108
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,220
she goes last time I go,
yeah, yeah. I asked for you.

1109
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:20,290
And she looked at the girl that just
massage and she goes, yeah, he has for me.

1110
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,580
And then she looked back at me and
she goes, so next time you meet again,

1111
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:28,630
and I was like, oh,
okay. And the other lady,

1112
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:31,980
you could tell that she was higher
up on the chain because the,

1113
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:36,320
the lady that had just massage me, cat,
like put her head down and was like, ah,

1114
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:37,960
totally

1115
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:42,670
power to hurt. You just got involved in
hooker wars, dude. Yeah. Ty Hooker whores.

1116
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:47,500
Welker wars massage. Hucker wars.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They totally,

1117
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,480
she had you as her guy and then you
betrayed her. They see that. They see, he

1118
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,580
just, you know, I think it's
a pride thing. Yeah. Yeah.
It's like that guy tips.

1119
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:00,850
So yeah, that's mine. Yeah. They fucking
fight over you once you left, dude.

1120
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,300
So who are you going to go with next time
we go back? I think I would go, it's,

1121
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:09,420
you know, they're so different. The first
one massacres me, but I, I liked that.

1122
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,440
I like,
how's the,

1123
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:16,480
you know, what the end,
I'd never come a harder,

1124
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:21,880
but the uh, the other lady,
petite hands, very small.

1125
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:23,440
She's so ferocious though.

1126
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,350
That first one really grinds
masturbated by a child. Right?

1127
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:32,020
Oh my God. Little girl hand. Just
the thought of that fully erect,

1128
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:36,820
but the second lady was a little more,
you know,

1129
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,900
loving. You don't like that?
Well, it depends. I mean,

1130
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:45,790
I tend to feel like if I had
to pick one all the time,

1131
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:48,880
I would go for the really
aggressive and you like to be hurt.

1132
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:52,270
You like to go and stop.
Yeah. You like that.

1133
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:57,250
That gives you joy during them as well.
It's that joy. I feel like the others,

1134
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,800
if it's less than that, I always feel
like nothing's happening. You have to,

1135
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,930
it has to hurt to feel like
something's gotta be deep. Yeah. It's,

1136
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,610
I feel about toothpaste if I
don't feel the burn of aqua fresh.

1137
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:11,350
It's exactly like toothpaste.
Yes. It's exactly like toothpaste.

1138
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:15,700
I know it's working cause it
burns your mouth. Yup. Yup.

1139
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,310
How do you like soft touches though?
Right?

1140
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:22,120
I like puppy touches you and like a
little puppy. I don't want to be heard.

1141
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:26,380
Life hurts. I don't need to be hurt
in life arts. I don't need to be hurt.

1142
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:29,320
She says, you know what I'm saying?
Took it to a whole other place. Yes.

1143
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,730
You know what I mean? I go
to their language, to me,

1144
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,940
I don't need her to beat
me up. Yeah. Palm with me.

1145
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:41,050
I like my lady. She's,
she's a little chunky.

1146
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,320
I got a little nervous when she got
on top of me. I was like, Oh fuck.

1147
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:47,200
This bitch got on top of me. Once you
explain yourself well at the time,

1148
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:50,410
his eyes day to day like sit on you.
She sits on my butt bones.

1149
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,890
They put their knees on you and I
got real nervous. I'm like, bitch,

1150
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:56,830
I just gave birth like, you
know, almost five months ago.

1151
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:58,690
My body is not aligned yet.

1152
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:03,020
My joints are still loose and
you know, we shoot sandwich. Oh,

1153
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,950
I saw saw I t I a gentle.
I'm doing her accent. I know,

1154
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,280
I know. What did she say?
No, seriously. She does what?

1155
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,790
She's how she did it. I
was like, Oh no, I beats,

1156
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:20,590
I stopped. The gentle,
gentle, gentle. She is,

1157
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:23,200
she's tired and she did and she is gentle,
gentle,

1158
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:26,030
and then she got on my ass
and I was like, Oh, you know,

1159
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,060
I was nervous because she's real chunky.
You liked that,

1160
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:32,830
but I liked the bup bones.
That's the past. That's good.

1161
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:35,560
That's my, I wish you'd would
like an hour of just bub bones.

1162
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,453
You could probably ask for it.

1163
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,250
That's that culture is all
into just whatever you want.

1164
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:44,370
And I like too that there's no modesty
and it's not like you're like a super

1165
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:48,520
uptight white place. Like put your, put
these panties on and you're like, come on.

1166
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,300
Yeah, I just get naked. And she
grazed my mal last time a little too.

1167
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:59,620
She really raised, oh whoa.
You didn't want to touch.

1168
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,260
You know they can go in there.

1169
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,100
Did she grazer nuts. The nuts. It's so, it

1170
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,910
is a lot. Like I'll be really
relaxed and then I will get,

1171
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:16,640
because they're so
aggressive with me that I go,

1172
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,200
I could really get a testicle hurt.
You know?

1173
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,270
It's not like a,
Ooh.

1174
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:27,280
It's like, yeah. So it's like, that's
usually where my eyes started to open.

1175
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:34,610
Don't please take all my
testicles with. Yeah. Oh yeah,
they could. I bet they have.

1176
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:38,060
Oh yeah, I sigh bowels.
What you're buying.

1177
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,823
Yeah.

1178
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:46,370
I saw I graze your bars. She
said, don't say that shit.

1179
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,050
They never say that she doesn't know
balls. I don't know. Sorry. Yeah, yeah.

1180
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:55,610
No, sorry man. No you don't. Yeah,

1181
01:17:56,390 --> 01:18:00,220
they don't do that shit. I'm
fine to be grazed. Yeah. We
should mention, by the way,

1182
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,370
speaking of buyers is that,

Alright. Let's do this. Oh, Jesus.
You Ready? We'll change your bum.

It does make me, yeah, it
goes through this. Everyone.

Well, he should wear a mask. Oh Man. I

Ellis' a couple of times. Yeah,

I have dry heaves sometimes.

where I'm like, whoa. Yeah, so bad.

1249
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,410
Yeah. You're not that far really
from him thinking about it. Yeah.

1250
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:35,500
Sometimes he has really crazy dumps. I
know sometimes you go like, oh, okay.

1251
01:22:35,501 --> 01:22:39,080
It's a little there and it doesn't
really have, but sometimes the,

1252
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,140
they're massive and you really,
it hits you.

1253
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:45,130
Sometimes I had to just give him a bath
right away. Yeah. I don't barely later,

1254
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,940
maybe later this year you'll get
logs, which are, you know, the smell,

1255
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:51,560
but I think it's going to be
different. Really. The died.

1256
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,960
I feel like a little turds easier
to clown. Oh yeah, of course.

1257
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,790
That's the slop is really his
pig slop dumps. Yeah. God. Yeah.

1258
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:05,630
And they're green. Yeah.
Yeah. Snarly yeah, it looks
like, yeah. It like an animal.

1259
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:10,000
This poor man. Yeah. Is it done or y'all?
Daniel finished your first year. I'd done,

1260
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,630
yeah. Let me see what else we
got. See if I have something else.

1261
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,360
I don't want to hear him bark. No, no.

1262
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:19,780
I think I got just one other thing to
show you and y'all finish. Y'All done?

1263
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:24,210

1264
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,300

fucker. It's a supercar.

1271
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,820
You're the worst.

1272
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,200
What are you doing?
We're doing the show.

1273
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:59,180
I don't even hear it turned mine down.
No, that's not yours. That's mine.

1274
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:02,570
We're done. You're lying.
I just turned it off.

1275
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:06,970
You're going to get it back
so fucking hard and we're
done. Pull your beard. Okay.

1276
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,450
I'm going to teach Ellis to pull your
beard and your buddy. We're done.

1277
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:16,250
You're lying to me and I know
I should. I close it. I did.

1278
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:20,930
I closed blue band. Blue Band is the
one that helps you with this. Very true.

1279
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,510
But,
but we're done now.

1280
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:29,150
He's the one that introduced it to
him. You blamed bluebell in blame, mom.

1281
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:35,150
I closed it. Okay. I promise. I
promise you can grab your headphones.

1282
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:39,050
Everything's fine.
We're done the finish and we're done both.

1283
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:42,830
We're both and trust you in the least.
Y'All are y'all finished? Are Y'all done?

1284
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:47,690
We're done.
Ah,

1285
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:52,620
you're fucking hell. I'm not. Smile.
I swear I'm done. I swear not done.

1286
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:57,140
Sneaky. I'm not, I'm not. I promise
you you're going to fucking get it.

1287
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:59,900
If I put my headphones on and
there's some horrible thing in there,

1288
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,870
I'm telling you,
look,

1289
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,900
I'll pull her tears tonight if I
have to hear something more Ramos.

1290
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:11,090
Look, here's what we, I wanted to play
for you next. Okay? It's a commercial.

1291
01:25:11,091 --> 01:25:14,030
There's vomit. You're going to
fucking get it. There was no vomit.

1292
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:18,190
Not going to touch your penis or for
a week. There's definitely no Bob,

1293
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:21,160
no penis touching. I mean it, you fucking,

1294
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:26,500
I won't touch it now.
We'll put it in my mouth for a year.

1295
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,490
Okay, I'm ready for that question. The
trash in the trash now lies. It is.

1296
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:37,600
Um,
you want mt touches on your penis then.

1297
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:41,410
Don't ever play barf clips. Okay.
We're done with them forever.

1298
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,510
Um, uh, check out though.

1299
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:50,790
Vocal fry from this lady.

1300
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,780
This mushroom foraging knife is made by
Radica or a company that has been hand

1301
01:25:55,790 --> 01:26:00,380
crafting brushes in Germany for over 75
years and is one of the last producer as

1302
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:01,214
a lab.

1303
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,320
You guys understand how pronounced
her vocal fry is? I mean it's like,

1304
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:07,343
uh,

1305
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:13,090
it's a deliberate,
the more that I learned about vocal fry,

1306
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,210
the thing that stands out and
that is a deliberate action.

1307
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,770
People are learning and
then repeating a forced,

1308
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,410
uh,
vocal

1309
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:26,430
affectation. Uh, yeah.
It's because people like,

1310
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:30,190
I know it's because of the
cart dash the Kardashians.

1311
01:26:30,191 --> 01:26:32,560
They talk like that and then people,

1312
01:26:32,561 --> 01:26:36,400
then they ended up talking
like that themselves.

1313
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:41,790
But it's not natural to be like they been
making these handcraft the artifacts,

1314
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,380
knives and brush hose,
not how you talk about,

1315
01:26:47,381 --> 01:26:49,730
I usually it usually
it does go with a girl.

1316
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:52,360
I was talking a lot
about a lot of Charles,

1317
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:57,840
it has been handcrafting
brushes in Germany for over
75 years and is one of the

1318
01:26:57,841 --> 01:27:02,010
last producers of handmade fresh ideas
are coming from a sustainably source,

1319
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:07,030
would handle a stinky hot lead and
have belts in pig bristle brush pipe.

1320
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:12,120
It is not only an ideal tool for foraging
mushrooms, but also to clean them.

1321
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:17,310
She looks a little mind blowing dirt away
from mushrooms is better than rinsing

1322
01:27:17,311 --> 01:27:18,144
them.

1323
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:22,510
Or I'd say, who the fuck has time
to do this to their mushrooms?

1324
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:27,550
I always pay by ability to pay your
mushroom and then use a special carving to

1325
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:32,310
like fuck off. Who's got time? Well,

1326
01:27:32,311 --> 01:27:34,290
actually I started studying could day.

1327
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:40,730
I bet he paints his mushrooms.
You pay your mushrooms, but

1328
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:47,370
yeah, it's a metaphor, right? Paint in
your restrooms. It's great. Yeah. Uh,

1329
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,870
can I see what she does with
these mushrooms though? I'm
curious now. She didn't,

1330
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:53,580
that's it. Yeah. We
just had the vocal fry,

1331
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,710
that's all my master

1332
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:02,550
painter mushrooms.
I paint my mushrooms.

1333
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,220
You're not every fucking day.

1334
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,870
I wake up at 5:00 AM before
the baby's loot the sun,

1335
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:15,230
and then I paint my mushrooms.
Uh,

1336
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,270
um, so we have, uh, something that,

1337
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,580
what's been in the,
in the,

1338
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,470
uh,

1339
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,340
been in the jeans kind of
machine here for awhile.

1340
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:36,740
I, one of the all time greats.
I think maybe one of my,

1341
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:39,860
it's gotta be one of my
favorite artists of all time.

1342
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:43,970
And that would be the great Rihanna.

1343
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:49,070
Also the Great Mozart, you
know, I'm a big mom. It's hard,

1344
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:53,420
I think you mean mom's, sorry.
And I are very, very tight. Um,

1345
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:56,180
I play a lot of his songs.
What's up?

1346
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,740
Is it a Mozart in that folder?

1347
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:03,590
Um, well let me check. I don't trust
you guys. Something smells fishy. No,

1348
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,250
it's not fishing. I promise. I promise
it's not, but I have it. I have it saved.

1349
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,260
Thank you. A blue band, everybody.
Uh, and maybe when you do patriotic,

1350
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:17,280
we can do a blue band episode
where we can get introduce. Yeah.

1351
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:22,170
Um, people are like, who's blue band?
Well, he's a fucking bird. Okay.

1352
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:27,230
Um, anyways, um, seeds,

1353
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:32,400
he needs seeds on a new mirror for
his cage. He likes to look at himself.

1354
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:36,010
Did you know
that

1355
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:42,510
at birds or is those silly?
Mozart was really into anal Lingus.

1356
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:46,590
I did. He wrote a song about it. Yes. Um,

1357
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:50,160
so we have some of this stuff here,

1358
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:54,100
some of his lyrics and some of his songs.
Um,

1359
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,850
we've been dying to play it for you.

1360
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,120
My ass,
my ass.

1361
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:06,380
That wasn't him,
but that's just kind of the,

1362
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,240
the world that he's in. Um, you
understand what I'm saying? Are,

1363
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,220
you know what I'm talking about? Do
you understand? Okay. Here we go.

1364
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,600
Okay. Yeah. Let me, let me,

1365
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,120
let me see what

1366
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:27,053
sound.

1367
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,080
Oh, fuck me in my ass.
Know how great is that?

1368
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,800
20,000 years ago

1369
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,740
you were writing
songs about

1370
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,190
22,500 years.

1371
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,650
Here's what's going on. Here's the
translation. Lick me in the ass.

1372
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:05,280
Let us be glad.
Grumbling is in vain.

1373
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:09,600
Groundling droning is in vain,
is the true cross of the life,

1374
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:14,670
thus less does let us be glad
and Mary Pretty Great, right?

1375
01:31:14,671 --> 01:31:17,550
It's great. Yeah. I've,
I've read about this before.

1376
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:19,080
It's a little ditty that he wrote.

1377
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:23,610
He also was known to be very sexual
in nature with his letter writing.

1378
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,600
Here's a letter that
he wrote to his cousin.

1379
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,610
Wouldn't you like to visit
hair? Goldsmith again? What for?

1380
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:38,130
Nothing. Just one choir, I guess
about the Spoonie Goonie fate.

1381
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,120
Nothing else. Nothing else.
Long live. All those who,

1382
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:45,960
how does it go on? I wish you
were. I now wish you a good night.

1383
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,630
Shit in your bed with all your might.

1384
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:53,250
Sleep with peace on your mind and try
to kiss your own behind. I love it.

1385
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:56,880
I would have really liked
your mom's house. I think he
would have been a big fan.

1386
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:01,510
Yeah.
Tip the hat to you Sir Mam.

1387
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:03,940
Sorry. Yeah. So this is um,

1388
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:09,010
I mean one of the greatest musical
minds ever isn't a shitting and wrote a

1389
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:11,140
beautiful song about, oh yeah. I mean

1390
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,510
we could probably get acquired as
things as not know what they're doing.

1391
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:21,910
That's a really funny idea. Actually.
Get them to sing it and be like,

1392
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:22,840
here's what you saying.

1393
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,060
I love it.
I love it too.

1394
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,780
Need to know that. And He, yeah, he
was a bit of a perv. That's cool.

1395
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:35,630
Yeah. Yeah. He had a lot of, of uh,

1396
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:40,160
apparently at more than one song about
the ass and ass eating. Yeah. Lick my ass.

1397
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:45,170
Yes. Very good. Very, very good.
Very talented man. That guy

1398
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:50,850
my ass late.
Another day there.

1399
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:55,030
Similar, similar, maybe not with the
music, but certainly a performer.

1400
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,180
The penis music. Yeah. One
of your favorites for sure.

1401
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:03,180
I love Rocco and I go way back.
So anyways,

1402
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:08,210
great discussion with him. We got to
wrap this show. Hey sticks on deck.

1403
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:12,470
600 deck. We've got a lot of
that. Um, where was it? Oh,
it was texts. Texted deal.

1404
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:16,280
So I got a rogue text message from,
you know,

1405
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:20,090
I got this new phone number about a year
ago and now I just, I get random texts.

1406
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:23,180
Random voicemails. Yeah. And
someone just wrote sticks on deck.

1407
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:27,390
We mentioned that last week and
we've got a lot of messages, a lot,

1408
01:33:27,391 --> 01:33:31,350
some of them very insulting. I'm
saying, how could you not know that?

1409
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:34,500
And then how could you name yeah,
how could you not know that?

1410
01:33:34,501 --> 01:33:37,980
And then 10 different versions
of what they think it meant.

1411
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:43,280
A lot of people said like the Xanax,
then I got Xanax.

1412
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:48,030
Right. Uh, then people said do 600
deck is guns. There's guns here.

1413
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:52,560
I have guns for sale. Okay.
No, then people said, uh, yeah,

1414
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:57,180
sticks on deck set. Like I wrote, dude,
obviously it's a photographer. Uh,

1415
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,710
dicks are tripods, so it's like
we're ready to shoot sticks on deck.

1416
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:05,970
They're ready to go. Okay.
That was a likely, um, not,

1417
01:34:05,971 --> 01:34:09,660
not very, I don't know. No.
Look. So I think it's drugs.

1418
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:13,230
So we had Xanax guns.
Um,

1419
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:17,700
a tripod and then somebody
was like, no, it's money,

1420
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:22,890
but that's stacks and stacks. Stacks are
not sticks. Yeah. He had sticks on deck.

1421
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:26,730
Right. It sticks on Day. Yeah. So
why would, yeah, I think it's a typo.

1422
01:34:26,731 --> 01:34:28,560
And there was like, oh, he's got
his money. He's got all his money.

1423
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:29,111
Here's why.

1424
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:34,111
Cause this phone number also gets
tweets a text about gambling too from,

1425
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:38,440
I think a similar, really the number. So
it's like, hey, there's action on blah,

1426
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:40,840
blah blah, or whatever. So
it's drugs and it's gambling.

1427
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:45,850
And that makes sense because eight is
the, who this is a problem, has a problem.

1428
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,880
Adas was mia and his
family was living in Rehab.

1429
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,530
He was in Rehab is shrink was
looking for him one time. Adas. Yeah.

1430
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,730
He ran from his family. So
he, I think it's atus. Hmm.

1431
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,483
Interesting.

1432
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,090
I know since Shenaz with all her
nursing job, she's not getting,

1433
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:07,130
and then the Persian a person.
Yeah. The Persian person.

1434
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,410
I forget what their name is.
That's what I'd say personally.

1435
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:13,940
I don't want to use the wrong
pronoun or something. June.

1436
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,530
June. Yeah. Joan. Joan. No, Shanna.

1437
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:24,020
Mm. Okay. Um, all right, so this is, uh,

1438
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:28,280
let's see, I got to look at
my cheat sheet. Assholes,

1439
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:32,600
my ass home. This is by Anthony. He's,

1440
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:37,790
Oh my God. Anthony Heath
data. I know, I know. I know.

1441
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,530
I didn't think that it
was happening right now,

1442
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:44,060
but those are the [inaudible] nine.
Hey, don't forget the bike shirt.

1443
01:35:44,061 --> 01:35:48,740
Please go to Tom [inaudible] dot com
people are loving the bike shirt.

1444
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:52,610
Please get that, uh,
support your genes. Anthony,

1445
01:35:52,611 --> 01:35:55,070
he here with the closing song.

1446
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:58,310
I'll let him set it up and take it away.
Jeans,

1447
01:35:58,311 --> 01:36:03,270
anything else you want to mention
before we go listen to that Steve Brown?

1448
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:08,430
Uh Huh.

1449
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,640
Listen to charter to the game and listen
to that steep bro. Yes, please do.

1450
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:15,390
All right, thanks guys. Thanks
mommies. Bride, mommies.

1451
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:17,930
Okay.

1452
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:20,410
Hey Hitler.
It's Anthony.

1453
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,233
Okay.

1454
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,550
My and I were talking
earlier and we noticed some,

1455
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:26,900
okay.

1456
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,050
Some more troubling pattern
in the community. Um,

1457
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,330
although the,

1458
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:37,360
your mom's house community has come
together to accept all poly and by people,

1459
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:43,010
which I am both. Um, there's been a,

1460
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:45,740
an outline group that
really is unrepresented.

1461
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:49,040
And even just sometimes,
um,

1462
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,270
I came out to my father at 15 as
an acoustic singer songwriter,

1463
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:58,990
and I just thought I should
work on something to really
bring the community back

1464
01:36:59,931 --> 01:37:03,080
together and, uh, and the rift, so,

1465
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:35,993
and

1466
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:53,150
little kids,

1467
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:43,470
whoa.
