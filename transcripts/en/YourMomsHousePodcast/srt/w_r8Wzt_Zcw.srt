classic. That's flown. So good.

17
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,180
We have the best music on the show.

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,960
We were in the car yesterday
listening to wrong submissions.

19
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,710
Yeah, it's ridiculous, man.

20
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,780
We just went through our podcast feed and
then played the opening songs and just

21
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,730
screamed out in the car yesterday so much.

22
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:22,270
One of the great musicians
listen to this show.

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,340
It's pretty nice. Yeah, we're always
impressed and we always love it.

24
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,250
So I'm always encouraging

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,580
anybody musically inclined to send
your instrumentals, send your,

26

know, become part of the show.

29
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,970
Yeah. And it happened so
organically too. Yeah.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,830
That's good.
It's good.

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,890
This reminds me of the Redondo

32
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,070

Houston and a nice play on
Houston. Yeah. Secret Group.

55
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,310
These are all submitted by listeners.
If secret group is a new venue, I think,

56
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,990
is that right? Yeah. It's a silly name.
I know. I worked with them as promoters,

57
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,590
so they were called the secret
group and I was say, okay. Right.

58
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,630
But then they opened a club
based on their promotional name.

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,080
It's called the [inaudible]. Like, Hey, do
you want to go down to the Cedar groups?

60
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,010
Yeah. Yeah. It's weird, but I, Hey,

61
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,770
go to the secret group guys.
And then, um, all right.

00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,030
This instrumental giving me
anxiety so it's too right. Intense.

81
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,830
That's a great club. I really do love
Columbus. It's great comedy. Clemis yes.

82
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,690
It's all like non binary to yes.
Then I'm a super non binary.

83
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,240
Then of course the live podcasts,

84
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,270
a string of dates with the odd ball tour,
which is a,

85
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,990
it's absurd. It's all amphitheaters
and arenas and shit. It's ridiculous.

86
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,830
And then after that nonsense,
like craziness ends,

87
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,850
I go back to reality
and I'm doing Charlotte,

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,430
We have a very exciting show.

97
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,650
Um, are you ready to do our
opening clip teens? Yeah.

98
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,830
Let me grab the baby g. All
right. It's unbelievable.

99
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:36,640
But we have baby jeans in studio
right now. Just woke up from his nap.

100
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,300
See if we can get him to make a noise.
He'll talk to you guys. Hold on.

101
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,530
A little distracted. Yeah, that
stuff just got up from his nap.

102
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,770
And I know a lot of you don't believe
that he exists, so baby jeans.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,070
Say something to the audience.
Can you talk? Can you talk buddy?

104
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,470
What's up? Maybe if I annoy him, he'll
tie. You want to talk? You're gonna talk.

105
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,240
Come on buddy.
Say something.

106
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,280
Nothing. Now you're shy. They're not going
to say anything. Come on. Come on man.

107
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:10,210
We're, we're rolling. You got it. This
is your moment. No, no. All right. Well,

108
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:13,030
he's eight months old,
so he's just starting to make sense.

109
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:16,720
Maybe he'll talk once we started talking.
Yup. He's turning the mic from you.

110
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,140
He likes to grab thing. Yeah, he
grabbing, yeah. Oh, there we go.

111
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,060
Excellent. All right. You ready to
start the show and let's go. Let's go.

112
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Who's fatter? Thompson or Bert
Kreischer. That's a very good question.

113
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,810
Very good question. I don't know if you
realize this, but to my very good friends,

114
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,430
Tom Sigora and Bert Kreischer,

115
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,820
they're both hilarious guys and they have
decided to do this thing where they're

116
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,270
calling each other fat. They're
both, but I love them both to jazz,

117
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:51,040
but they both lose a couple of pounds.
Think of bolts, lose a rural, um,

118
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,990
and they've just decided, uh, to, uh,

119
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,800
have this public thing where it's like,
Hashtag bird is fat.

120
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,160
Hashtag Thomas Fat, I'm going to
move my phone to this new thing. Ooh,

121
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,910
that's better.
Um,

122
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,480
and so they sell t shirts like half
Hashtag Thomas Fadden Hashtag birdies fat

123
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:16,050
tee shirts and all the proceeds from
the sales of those go directly to them.

124
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,800
So you're not helping
any fucking charities. No
starving. Kids are getting fed.

125
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,230
They're just going to
buy food and get fatter.

126
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,670
Oh, it's Ryan don't bring
in one loving to them.

127
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,650
Well, well, well go to your mom's house

128
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,490
Christina,
cause it's interesting.

129
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,153
Okay.

130
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,153
Yeah,

131
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,420
no man. Super good. Yeah, that was
hilarious. So I got baby jeans on my lab,

132
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,850
but grabbing a microphone,
he's looking around.

133
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,560
Maybe he'll talk. I Dunno. What, are you
going to talk? You can say something, Bro.

134
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,390
Ah, can we get, can we can't get like a,

135
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,020
well, he's not in the mood. He
just woke up maybe in a little bit.

136
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,160
He'll get chatty in a minute here.

137
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,100
That's hilarious. Joe Did a Joe
Rogan, our buddy did episode.

138
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,930
Um, eight, 27 of his podcast
where he just did a Q and.

139
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,930
A. That's how massive that guy's
show is. He can just be like Q and a,

140
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,970
so like three hours and then in
like, and probably get, you know,

141
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,650
whatever. 1 million downloads crazy. Um,

142
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,220
but people have been hitting him up
who's fatter because he's been so,

143
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,900
I haven't seen, I've been tagged
and tweets on, uh, on, you know,

144
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,050
on Twitter where they're, they're
tagging him. You're like, so Joe,

145
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,610
you haven't weighed in yet.
Who's fatter?

146
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,000
Did he, he didn't say whose
fatter, he just said you
both needed to lose some lbs.

147
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:28,490
Yeah. Yeah, he did. Yeah. And that you
guys are just going to buy it. Yeah.

148
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,780
You're going to buy more food.
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

149
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,470
What do you think Ellis?
Who's fat or your, yeah.

150
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,430
Oh, who's fatter? You're
going to weigh in on this?

151
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,470
Are you going to eat some microphone?
That's a cool thing that babies do.

152
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,730
We just put everything in there.

153
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,320
Yeah. Super Fun for Moms to
watch. Okay. Well anyways, uh,

154
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,930
very cool that he mentioned you
guys. Yeah. He madness. Yes,

155
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,090
he went on a little bit here. That's, it's
pretty funny. If you want to hear. Sure.

156
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,780
And birds case, he's probably going
to buy boxes of wine or drinks,

157
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,400
boxes of wine in an evening and so it
was trying to explain to me how many

158
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,750
bottles of wine that is and we don't
really know. I could Google that.

159
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm going to Google that right now.
Let's find out. If you had to guess,

160
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,190
how many boxes of wine would you say

161
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,750
one box is? Probably, I mean two bottles.

162
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,620
All right. Let's take a quick, let's see.

163
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,740
I guess how many or how
many bottles are there?

164
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:33,520
How many bottles of wine or in
a box? All right. Eight bottles

165
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,680
of wine are in. Oh, no, wine.

166
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,540
I'm good. Before I click on it, I'm going
to say, I think, I think it was nine.

167
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:48,190
I'm going to say it seems
like a lot for bottles. Okay.

168
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,960
Okay. Wait, six, six and two
thirds bottles. All right.

169
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,800
Here it was 750 mil liter bottles.
How many?

170
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:01,801
750 milliliter bottles are there
in a five liter box of wine?

171
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,420
Well at six and two thirds.

172
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,220
And if it's a three liter box of wine,
it's four bottles.

173
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,140
Oh my God. But wine is so Bush League
Cup. Burt though, you know he's,

174
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,120
he's a machine. He starts
with cooking it up, man.

175
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:19,150
Yeah. That's an order, right?

176
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,100
I bet he's drinking the six
and two thirds in a night.

177
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,440
I think he's done more than one.
Yeah, I forget what he said. Yeah,

178
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:34,441
he's definitely drank at least one
box in a night on a regular basis.

179
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
So that's a four. Bob. I would be dead.

180
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,560
I don't know how he does it. Well he's,
he's definitely fat. I mean that helps.

181
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,400
And then it's also,
there's a helps

182
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,980
that helps. Uh, so he drinks
a box every night you think?

183
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,770
I don't think so. No. I
mean Bertrand also, he,

184
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,580
he moves it around like he
doesn't just stick to one style.

185
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:04,750
Like sometimes it's beer, sometimes
it's just funny. He was a beer guy.

186
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,170
He likes beer, he likes shots,
you know, he's a machine.

187
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,760
He's the part of you that no one
party is like bird. No one parties.

188
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,030
I have that first full weekend
of odd ball with him. Oh my God.

189
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,100
I'm going to have to like, oh my God,
no, my detox before and after. Oh my God.

190
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:24,400
Oh my God. And plus you guys are
going to get a lot of fat shaming,

191
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,650
shaming together.

192
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,180
We're going to get a lot of people can
be weighing in as you're performing.

193
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:35,980
Probably probably you're fat or we're
going to hear it's like thousands of

194
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:40,090
people and then also on the odd ball,
you know we,

195
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,760
him and I,
we're not the big dogs on the show.

196
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,510
So you do like a 15 minute set and then
you're, you're done. Right? So you got,

197
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,900
you have to drink is what
you're saying? I think, uh,

198
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,760
she just walked by all account.
Let me, we should, uh, can you,

199
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,690
can you pass them off real quick? Okay.
Yeah. Press printing. Press. All right.

200
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,050
So now baby jeans is back in his crate.

201
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,223
Yeah,

202
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,620
it's a family affair here and now we
have two dogs in here and we replaced the

203
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:11,220
dog with a tube to other babies. There's
always babies. No bubbles. Memphis.

204
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh my God. The Mongan. Well,

205
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,870
what's really interesting about the bird
is fat phenomenon. And let's be honest,

206
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,370
there is no, Tom is fat
phenomenon. It is heavily weighted,

207
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,420
no pun intended, on Burt
Chrysler, Chrysler. Right.

208
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,220
And it is a phenomenon.

209
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,240
I mean if you look at the
Montreal comedy festival,

210
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:36,800
gave him his itinerary and it said burned
Chrysler Bark. Chrysler, Chrysler. Yeah.

211
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,370
Uh, we've been getting
countless tweets of Bev.

212
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,320
You wearing the shirts.

213
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,350
We've been getting international
submissions for Burdis fat. Yeah.

214
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,950
It's just taking, it's taking the world
by storm. Yeah, it's really great.

215
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,290
And I don't think it's,
I think it's just cause people love,

216
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,910
I don't know why this particular thing
to golf maybe cause it's just fun to,

217
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,770
to fat shame people as you know. Not
that that's bad. I think it's great. No,

218
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,130
I'm not maligning this. I think
this is a wonderful, yeah.

219
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,150
Public Service. We are describing
people in Latin. We're using adjectives.

220
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,250
Let's say the adjective or basis means,
uh,

221
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,620
let's try using that in a sentence.

222
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,210
So I'll put this on the
role of Bob's Christ

223
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,773
together.

224
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,260
Oh my God.
That was amazing.

225
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,180
There you go. That is beardo from
Australia. Thank you. Mom's Australia.

226
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,590
Australia. Yeah. That is wow. Leave. Wow.

227
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,590
That was amazing. Thank you for
doing that. See what I'm saying?

228
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:59,450
It's a worldwide phenomenon. Yeah.
Let's hope that it motivates Bert to,

229
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,050
uh,
to stop being so fat.

230
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,450
So undeniably unapologetically fat,

231
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,590
no remorse, right. No remorse
whatsoever. It's offensive.

232
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,770
I'm offended. Yeah. It's quite,

233
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,820
quite horrific to be in the presence
of should we call him by a new pronoun?

234
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,900
Like a fat brown?

235
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,580
I don't know man.
So that's an interesting way.

236
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,250
Maybe it needs a new pronoun. Thank you
for leaking like Lindsey. Thanks bets.

237
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,700
We have a quite a show lined
up for everybody. This is,

238
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,270
I'm not your typical mom show.

239
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,950
Um,
the genes machine and I,

240
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,890
we have a special family edition.

241
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,950
I mean you heard our
little son barely murmur,

242
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,450
but we also have my
sister LMG Maria was here.

243
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,970
Oh, okay. Um, I sat with here
with her and studio for a while,

244
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,101
talked to her.

245
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:09,630
I'm going to get into that and then I
have almost a full hour of top dog and

246
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:14,430
Charo. Oh my God. I'm
going to start things off.

247
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,450
Why don't we get, uh, the
Maria portion. Oh my God.

248
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,240
Your sister when she was here was on all
cylinders. Yeah. Do you realize what she,

249
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:28,020
she flew across the country was a
one year old. It's unbelievable.

250
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,960
And on two connecting flights.
Yeah.

251
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,280
And then showed up here and the baby
was exhausted and she just, it just,

252
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,910
it just rolls off her back.
Like I envy that level of like,

253
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,170
I don't care what to let, let's go.
And I think we need to interrupt.

254
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,180
One thing we didn't think about is how
much our show luckily has grown since the

255
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,160
early days for people that are joining
us that maybe had to listening for a

256
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:52,590
month or so and they're like,
what's the big deal?

257
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,620
The foundation of this show
in a lot of ways is OMG Maria.

258
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,730
In the old days,
man,

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
we would get her on the phone and she
would just be fired up about some lcs or d

260
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:12,450
sees. Those are lazy concen dumb cons.
Starbucks fucking up her Starbucks order.

261
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,240
I'd never thought that Maria was
stopped drinking coffee, but she did.

262
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,110
I know it's an, it's a bummer
for our show, which I know
I want to encourage her.

263
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,340
I don't care about her health. I want the,
the content. I know she drinks tea now,

264
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,290
which just does not as fun as that is fun.

265
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,070
And she's not as angry as she used
to be at Starbucks. The caffeine,

266
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:32,720
she would order like three or four drinks
per day and that would make her angry

267
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,000
or naturally fired up.
So it's fucking amazing.

268
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,470
It's like the caffeine was
throwing kerosene on her
personality. It was perfect.

269
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,280
Um, so anyways, I want to play for you,

270
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,120
the Maria conversation and a,

271
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,240
then we'll come back and we'll talk
and we'll get you into the top dog and,

272
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,230
and Charles Conversation.
Yeah, I can't wait to hear
this. Alright, here we go guys.

273
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,300
Oh Em.
Gee Maria.

274
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,050
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my
God. Oh my God. Seriously.

275
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,680
Seriously. Seriously.
Seriously. Oh my God.

276
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,800
Oh my God.
You're fucking McGee.

277
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,930
Hand seriously as the backup and
had a hole in it is important.

278
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,870
That goddamn bottle. Oh my God. Seriously

279
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,670
female. Okay. All these
bodily fluids come out.

280
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,190
Do you think there's more coming at you
is too there was semen or something,

281
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,950
something else? Semen would be from
three days ago. Yeah. You know,

282
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,940
I got pregnant with Weston five days
after we had sex and there was still,

283
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,020
usually when we have sex,

284
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:38,420
it still leaks out of me for like a few
days after because apparently I have a

285
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:43,030
very mucusy cervix. Hmm. How do you,
how do you find out something like that?

286
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,220
The doctor told me because when we
estimated the date of conception was in

287
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,610
California and Shabbos in Chicago, I'm
like, I had sex with them a week ago.

288
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,060
Is that unusual?
I don't really know.

289
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,970
I mean I think usually if it happens
within two or three days because they die

290
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:59,470
out.
I don't know exactly how it happens,

291
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,960
but apparently with his strong swimmers
and my super mucusy cervix just hangs

292
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:09,250
out in there. So like five days
later it's just leaking out. Whoa.

293
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,120
That's why I can't wear thongs
usually. Yeah, we can't, you know,

294
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:17,840
I had to wear underwear with
like something there for
like the week after we got

295
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:21,610
after sex. Yeah. He like comes in
me or I can't have a massage. Like

296
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,050
you know if we have sex
that day for a few days,

297
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:30,310
cause it's happened once before where
I was having like a massage and it was

298
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,820
like, it was like gross and like a
snail trail after I got from the,

299
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,040
it was so disgusting. I know. It's
so brown. Yeah. Lesbians do it.

300
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,240
Like knowing what the shit comes out of
your bodies. I don't get at, wait, wait.

301
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,650
You don't understand what
was going to do what?

302
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,140
Like knowing what comes out of your body,

303
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:51,730
how they like go downtown on each other.
Oh yeah.

304
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,310
Really? Yeah. I know. I mean when I,

305
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,810
knowing what comes out of me and
the worst part is as you get older,

306
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,760
it's stinkier kids.

307
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,020
When you see like older lesbian and
you're like I can't, I don't know. Yeah,

308
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:08,830
I don't understand it. I'm like, it's so
gross down there. Cause you feel gross.

309
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,800
I feel disgusting. Yeah.
I think it's disgusting.

310
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:14,500
Like the vagina as you
get older is disgusting,

311
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,530
especially of you have
kids and it's just gross.

312
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:18,820
Everything about it's disgusting.

313
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,540
Hairy balls and saggy vault.

314
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,910
It's actually the same argument can
be made when you think about it.

315
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,940
What you're saying applies to a straight
man with a woman as they get older

316
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:40,250
because that's also an
older vagina at time. No,

317
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,560
but I mean it's the same. The same thing.
They have to comply. It's up to him.

318
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:47,800
Him lapping it up every night
or whatever. Yeah. You know,

319
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,420
it's discussing.
What about Old Dick?

320
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:57,010
So they get saggy. And I haven't
been that. I'd never say no.

321
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:00,910
I haven't been with a really old deck,
really know. And Jeff is younger,

322
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,990
so I've been with, um,
well I've been with,

323
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,400
but I've seen my dad's balls.

324
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,300
Is it so discussing and I have seen on
videos like old saggy and they're so

325
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:15,040
Wrigley's balls. I'm not even kidding
actually. It's been a while now,

326
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,720
but I've been in the, in their bedroom
where he, you know, he changed,

327
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,660
so he drops his,

328
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,820
his underwear down and bends and
like it looked like animal testicles,

329
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,540
like did that big and they
hang were enormous. God,

330
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,260
like go to pick nuts. Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,810
And I was like, Whoa, dad. He
goes, well, what are you doing?

332
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,660
And he just started to see samples,
man, looking at your balls.

333
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,260
I'm going to talk to him about his
balls. If I see that video, that nut bra,

334
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,210
the Nub Brown. Yeah. They did a little
comedy thing about, cause you know,

335
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,680
old men as they would go to the bathroom,

336
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,800
cause their ball start to drop and
sag and they would drop in the toilet.

337
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,570
Said someone came up with like an up
raw, it was a joke. But now you know,

338
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,820
you don't sit on your balls anymore
and you don't have to worry about them

339
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,460
dropping in the toilet. It was
really funny. And there's that. Um,

340
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,210
there's the story about, you know, Mr
Belvedere remember that show? Yeah.

341
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,870
That he sat on his nuts,
um,

342
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,930
at a read through and it's off bad
to delay shooting an episode once.

343
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,980
Yeah. She sat on his testicles.
That sounds awful. I know,

344
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,320
I know. So gross. I've actually heard
they getting kicked in the nuts.

345
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,510
They coolant and pain from man,

346
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,140
like getting kicked hard is the
equivalent of pain as like, you know,

347
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,160
labor contractions. But the only thing is
labor contractions go on and on and on.

348
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:40,840
It's so horrible. Yeah. It hasn't
happened obviously in years, but he did a,

349
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,840
he measured pain.

350
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:45,710
Like they actually like that measured
pain receptors on a man and it kicked him

351
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:49,610
in the nuts. Oh my God. I mean the idiot
that was willing to do this is amazing.

352
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,650
But um, and then they did
it, you know, women, the pain
receptors. It's weird thing.

353
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,000
I've never,
I mean I'm,

354
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,020
I'm really all about whatever get
whatever turns you on is, you know,

355
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,083
do your thing.

356
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,990
But there's a whole whole segment of,
you know,

357
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,720
adult erotica that's about dudes
getting kicked in the balls.

358
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,760
Yeah, yeah. I love it. Yeah.

359
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
They love it. Oh my God. There's
some sick people, you know,

360
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,830
I think I can understand that guys
signing up for it and they get kicked him

361
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,060
fucking hard, hard, and
repeatedly, not once.

362
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,920
And sometimes they cough up and they
have blood coming out of their dicks.

363
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,890
Oh my God. Yeah. I mean,
they signed up for it.

364
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,350
I thought porn ones when a guy had like a,
like a long metal tubing shoved.

365
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,010
Oh my God. Oh my God. That
his penis. I just don't get
it. The pain thing. No, that,

366
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,160
that thing, I definitely don't
get her right neck. Yeah. Well,

367
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,650
so it's eating stool and like
shitting on each other. Nobody,

368
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,420
there's something seriously wrong with
these people. Yes. I totally agree.

369
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,280
And I want to know what goes through
their head that they think like this is

370
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:04,580
normal. I'm definitely going to find a
great woman that wants to do this with me.

371
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,990
She's quality material.
It's, I know. So, um,

372
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,020
I think I've ever had you have ever had
you in studio? I did once before, right?

373
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,450
Yeah. And uh, Redondo.

374
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,020
So obviously people are
a big fan of yours. Um,

375
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,960
there, everyone's always been surprised
that you stopped drinking Starbucks,

376
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,300
but where do you encounter,
um,

377
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,360
your LLCs and dcs these days?

378
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,020
Cause that was like the main
place used to get them a voice.

379
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:37,970
You're now living in Florida. He
find a surprising number of them. Um,

380
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,520
well one the worst.

381
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:44,910
I think the greatest population
of lcs and dcs would be at Kmart.

382
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,800
I went once,
I will never return.

383
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,490
The second group is definitely Walmart.

384
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,550
Unfortunately I have to go
there every now and then.

385
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,490
Sam Clubs is the Fattest Group of
lcs and dcs. Really? It's horrible.

386
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:02,520
I actually at the point now that on
the weekends I refused to go to Publix.

387
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,820
Sam's club or Walmart or any grocery
shopping, I can't deal with it anymore.

388
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,390
I think goes out there. And how
disgusting and how obnoxious and rude.

389
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,760
So Sam's Club, you know, you
go, we go on the weekend,

390
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,110
we did our bulk shopping of stuff and
it's all have also happens to be sampled

391
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:20,460
day. So every aisle has samples.
And you had these heifers,

392
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,930
I mean these huge families and they
bring the whole fucking family.

393
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,710
I mean it's not like mom or dad doing
the groceries. It is mom, dad, brother,

394
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:30,120
sister, grandma, the wheelchairs.

395
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:33,600
They've got the automated wheelchairs
everywhere and they just stop and they

396
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:38,100
just go on these feeding frenzies it's
like going on a carnival cruise with all

397
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:39,660
you can eat buffet.
It's disgusting.

398
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,450
And you and I just want to go get a
fucking rotisserie chicken and some toilet

399
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:46,770
paper, but you can't get through the
aisle and I lose my shit so I can't,

400
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,950
I told you, I'm like, it makes
me angry. And it was my weekend.

401
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,190
Like I just want to go buy some things
and go home and I can't go through

402
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,610
anywhere. So you're really angry when
you see like a super obese people? No,

403
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:58,620
I don't get angry.
I want to see obese people.

404
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:01,500
I get angry when they make the whole,

405
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,560
they feel like I'm inconveniencing.

406
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,410
They're feeding frenzy and they
just, you know, they're in,

407
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,980
they're in my way of everything. We're
getting animals. They were like animals.

408
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,270
Yeah. And it's like my fault.
Like they're like, excuse me,

409
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:15,980
I'm trying to eat a sample here and as
long as well as the rest of the store and

410
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,260
you just see like what they're doing.
Like I just, I don't understand. Like,

411
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:22,170
if you're at the point where you
can't see your genitals or your feet,

412
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,910
why do you think it's okay to go get
like mass quantities of like pork,

413
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:30,090
ribs and Cheetos and it's disgusting.
And you just,

414
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,530
I remember when we were
in these obviously, but we
were in high school. Yeah.

415
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,900
There was a pretty big kid of
the other high school. Okay.

416
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And um,

417
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,480
one of my friends told me there
was good friends with him,

418
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,600
but one of my friends who was good
friends with him and told me that, uh,

419
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,510
his family made every meal with Bacon
and that they've saved the bacon grease

420
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,270
and that they would use the big ruse
to like co can flavor things with.

421
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,420
I'd never heard of that
since then or before then.

422
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,310
I did that with duck fat.
Really? Yeah. When I cooked doc,

423
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:14,910
I say the grease and I'll use it to
like saute potatoes or vegetables.

424
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:17,280
You see the George multiple jars.
It's disgusting.

425
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,140
I mean I would say one darn
it would last me forever.

426
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,410
Every meal is or their bacon sausage
some. They were big people too. Yeah.

427
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,800
But then there comes a point where
we're like, you know what, this law,

428
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,630
you look at everyone else around you
and you're like, something's wrong.

429
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,460
I can't see my feet. I should probably
do something about it. I think those are,

430
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,700
yeah,
that is the way I think the,

431
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,360
what happens with when their families
have those epidemics is that you've made

432
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,860
it normal at your home.
So on your feed,

433
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:46,450
your kids and you take your kids to go
give them sugary drinks and a bunch of

434
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,300
crap and garbage and that's all they
know. It's the norm for them. Yeah.

435
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,180
It's the same thing with like all
those teenage moms that you know these,

436
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,710
so when I was doing that,

437
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,270
the class is at the women's care
center and I would have these girls,

438
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,640
I mean they're girls like
in high school coming in,

439
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,410
they're on their third or fourth
pregnancy and they had no interest in ever

440
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:10,210
doing anything. They're like, oh, just
get on WIC and food stamps and welfare.

441
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,780
Yeah. And, and it's normal. Like
this is what the norm is to them.

442
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,830
There's a zero dream or aspirations
to do anything more with your life.

443
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:21,930
It's depressing. Yeah.
No, I gotta say you, um,

444
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,670
you have this unreal drive to work out.

445
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes. It's so cool. Where do you
think that comes from? Where you are,

446
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,160
where you work out?

447
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,980
So savagely to get my aggression out
and eat a healthy outlet. It's really,

448
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,650
yeah.

449
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,650
I mean I need to do something to get my
frustrations out and energy and board of

450
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:47,290
the frustrations come from
using everybody's frustration
to me now. You know,

451
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,680
like working kids, it's exhausting.
So it's good to be like that.

452
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,970
Like life in general.
Yeah.

453
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:54,970
I mean like when things piss you
off and if you didn't do that,

454
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,680
it would just be like, you have been
irritable bitch. I be intolerable. Really?

455
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,530
Yeah. I mean you see now as the poor, like
even in high school, like if something,

456
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,240
if I get mad, I mean frustrated.
I need you just our families,

457
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:12,000
the St will explode if I don't find
some way to get it out. Yeah, true.

458
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,870
I feel the, I feel a similar. Yeah. I mean
I need somewhere to explode. I can just,

459
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,320
I can be aggressive. I'm not
hurting anybody. I need, I have,

460
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,530
we all have aggressive jeans.
I need somewhere to get that out.

461
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,090
That's not going to harm others.
I mean, useful for people to know.

462
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,750
You flew from the east coast, you
connected in Dallas, you had to lose,

463
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,310
you got here in the evening and nine,

464
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,320
it wasn't like we went to bed relatively
late and then you got up really early

465
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,940
case got up so early and then when I
got up you'd run five miles and uh,

466
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,090
most of it is at an incline,
a severe incline. I was,

467
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,890
I was not prepared for that one. Pushing
that stroller up that hill was like God.

468
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,280
But I was explaining to me what you
did. First of all, I have yet to see,

469
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,360
I don't want to give away my address,
but in this neighborhood,

470
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:12,100
I've yet to see anybody run where you
were running. I mean, that's a walk,

471
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,410
you know,
and most people walk up that slowly.

472
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:20,370
This is crazy that you were able to run
five miles and that you did it at seven

473
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,030
in the morning. No, I did
it, I think at nine. Nine.

474
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,050
I don't think so. Maybe eight,
maybe eight I think. I have no idea.

475
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:32,440
It was up so early. I just didn't know. I
just needed to get her calm. I was like,

476
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:37,330
okay, here we go. So after that run,
you feel totally like more balanced?

477
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,120
I do. I was telling me my legs are
shot and afterwards I was tired,

478
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,030
but I felt really calm the
rest of the day. I was super

479
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,670
chill. And then like
today, what will you do?

480
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,530
You and I are going to do
a burpee circuit. I burpee
challenge burpees, challenge.

481
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,920
You're going to do it. Preppy
challenge, 30 minutes nonstop, nonstop,

482
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,520
or every channel.
ABS dips in between.

483
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,230
Okay, cool. It'll be, it'll be,

484
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:14,960
it'll feel good after tired. Look good.
Um, and then you're really on top of,

485
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,680
you love to cook, but you
like healthy cooking. I do
like how they cooking. I mean,

486
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,820
I don't want to be, you
know, a Walrus. Yeah,

487
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,510
I see enough of them at Walmart and
Sam's Club. Yeah. So rose, that's okay.

488
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,500
Do you think bird, his hat? Who? Bert?

489
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,110
Bert Chrysler.

490
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,470
Just kidding. He's a
friend of mine. Oh, okay.

491
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,920
There you go. Genes. There is what
wasn't there in that interview. I've,

492
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,790
I feel like you guys covered it
all. She, she hates fat people.

493
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,700
She hates vaginal discharge.
She hates old balls. Yeah.

494
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,630
And Publix. Walmart. I mean
that was, I was amazed.

495
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,470
It was amazing.
She's evolving and I her by the way,

496
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:07,950
you're right that that level of fitness
she had when she came to visit us was

497
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:08,784
like,

498
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:14,070
remember that one time in Miami when
before we took the family cruise and she

499
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:17,830
flew in on a red eye. Yeah. And was that
the night we were like, we're going to,

500
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:22,140
we'll meet you for breakfast. I did. Well
I did because I was also international.

501
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,020
I was coming, I came over
from Asia I think. Right.

502
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,950
So I was waking up every day
at like four in the morning.

503
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,150
So I was like, dude, I'm out at earliest
shit breakfast. And she was like,

504
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:35,400
have meet you at that place.

505
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:39,630
So she meets me there and she's
in full workout gear and I'm like,

506
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,360
that's what time is it? It's like six in
the morning, six in the morning. And I go,

507
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,210
uh, we're going to breakfast. And she was
like, I'm just gonna have a glass of tea.

508
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,960
And they went, do you said you meet
me for breakfast? I know, I know.

509
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,940
I'll sit with you. What are you
going to do? I'm going to run.

510
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,950
And then she ran like seven Myers
and she was like, I fell it hard.

511
00:34:55,951 --> 00:35:00,900
One in Miami. It's not, it's never
not hot and humid. Yeah. That's great.

512
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:05,110
Summertime in Miami. Yeah. It's crazy.
It's crazy. Lunatic. Yeah, man. Wow.

513
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,370
She really hates what comes out of her
vagina. I wonder what's happening. Yeah,

514
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:13,170
I liked it. I mean, she uh, likened
that to a lesbian problem. Right.

515
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,200
As opposed to all the older heterosexual
couples and where there's also one

516
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:23,841
vagina and that there might
be an issue for the man or,

517
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,330
or like old stinky dicks
and balls are not a problem.

518
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,350
Yeah. There's nothing like Mario
fired up, man. I just want to go,

519
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,040
I just want to get a rotisserie
chicken on my paper. I'm,

520
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,410
I told pepper and I can't
cause that people eating

521
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,490
like can I gusting or your hair?

522
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:47,923
Yes.

523
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,800
Hobert Rawer Cordova [inaudible] over

524

a fat. They can't then Tom Segura might.

525
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,900
Wow. That's international. That was
amazing. That was British Irish.

526
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,160
Um, Polish. Yeah. Let's
see. There was Ireland,

527

other moms. Wow. Pretty Great.

528
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,503
Why

529
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,370
Cobart Cordova love sugar,

530
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,760
but Christ Crawshaw

531
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,900
you are a fat can't, uh,

532
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,040
oh my God. Shit. That's a really good,

533
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,620
um,
now genes for the mother load.

534
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:41,930
This is a top dog and Charo in studio.
Oh my God,

535
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:44,840
I can't wait to hear this.
We've been talking about that by the way.

536
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:49,841
Charro sat in blue bands chair and I had
to constantly just like point to talk.

537
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,390
Like you will hear her like this and
she's like, yeah, and then what are you?

538
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,510
And I'm like, mom. And I actually
got to the point where you know, you,

539
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,720
you have ways you navigate parents.
I was like,

540
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,100
I don't want even want
to correct her anymore,

541
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,510
but I just let her talk
off my head just to not,

542
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,550
you know, bother, you know what
I mean? Like, just let it go.

543
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,320
I have it in Hungarian.
Do you want to hear Wiseberg Chrysler.

544
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,120
Chrysler's a bad mayor.
Bert Kreischer on Euro Qvr.

545
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,130
That's really good.
Myth myth.

546
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,050
Medved Kreischer Anurag cover.
Yeah.

547
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,800

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,590
bad crisis.

549
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,620
Um, anyways, it was such a
pleasure to have them in here.

550
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,770
There's a lot man. We get into
so many things. We got it.

551
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:48,830
We get into nonbinary or we
get into the gender pronouns.

552
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,930
We get into king ash Reber who get into,
um,

553
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,260
I think I convinced them how silly their
worry of a transsexual is using the

554
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,550
wrong restroom or like, you know,
the restroom they desire. Right.

555
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,300
I think I talked to him off
the ledge on that one. Uh,

556
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,190
play songs that they're in,
that listeners have made. It's,

557
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:16,130
um, it's a lot of fun.
So I wait to hear this.

558
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,320
Without further ado.

559
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,250
My mother Charro and my father.

560
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,750
Who many of you adore top dog
here in the studio right now?

561
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,800
Hey Buddy. Stop Dog. Kate, buddy.

562
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,500
Stop Dog.
Okay Buddy.

563
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,200
Stop Dog.
You need to

564
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,413
stop dog

565
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,590
picture which picture in
front of me? Oh, of us? Yeah.

566
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,310
Are you talking? All right. Good. Yep. Um,

567
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,150
everything's going wrong today.
So annoying.

568
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,240
I'm ready. Ready for what? Whenever
you start, we already started. Oh,

569
00:39:08,241 --> 00:39:12,300
we did? Oh yeah. Okay. We'll take
hello? No, what do you mean? Hello?

570
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:18,260
Hey. Hey. Can I talk about your
house? What do you wanna talk about?

571
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,680
But first I want to talk
about the baby and for what?

572
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,700
Cause I want to steal the baby. And
it's important that you know it. Oh,

573
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,620
you can steal them. That is to die for.
Yeah. I am obsessed with their baby.

574
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,230
It reminds me of me. That
cute. Well, what? I want it,

575
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,960
I want to talk quickly. Finish. Go ahead.

576
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,210
He's Barry Lynn billion.

577
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,580
Extremely observant coaches and yes,

578
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:50,420
it complete joy. Yeah. No,
well it's a guy from there.

579
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,730
I come in the house. The house is
beautiful, but I need to go to a bathroom.

580
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,080
Yeah. Tommy [inaudible] it's
going to cause a divorce.

581
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,250
You're fired if he doesn't get me that
toilet, you want it, right? No. Yeah,

582
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:07,910
we've talked about it a bunch that uh,
it's really a game changer.

583
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,170
It really is just, you know what number
one, even if I'm cold, my whole body,

584
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,731
I go to the bathroom,

585
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:17,960
I sit there and it is so warm that depict
honestly your war map, my whole body,

586
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,110
it has an environmental advantage because
you actually use less toilet paper.

587
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,050
Yeah. And you know, so
you're really actually,

588
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,940
but then you're using a lot of water,
I guess is kind of a tradeoff.

589
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,210
Well know it takes more water
to make that amount of time,

590
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,400
so I think it's a better deal. Yeah.
Well I know that I feel a lot cleaner.

591
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,960
It does that well. When I,
when I first did my yesterday,

592
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:45,960
when I did my first dump here. Yeah.
And then I went in for my normal rewind.

593
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,020
A lot of times when I do adopt,

594
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,030
but I have a wipe and then
they have to go back a little.

595
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:53,710
But all that you know about whole ledge?

596
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,280
Yeah. Where they would get at a
hotel. He barely made it to the room.

597
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,480
Oh, that was mid day. He went from there
to the shower. I didn't really know.

598
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,830
It was a classic.

599
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,100
It really was a 3.5 it
wasn't quite a four.

600
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,930
It was so bad that he told me he won't
tell me about it too. Don't discuss,

601
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,670
tell me about it. It went,
it went on for like ever.

602
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:18,210
It was one wasn't a last year was a
three, five, probably three, eight,

603
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:22,290
maybe one to four and it
just kept going out out now.

604
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,210
So it was kind of solid. Well it was, it
was, there was a softness to it. Okay.

605
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,630
So it was so maybe closer to
4.0 yeah. Yeah. Okay. From

606
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,483
the bedroom.

607
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,000
I wasn't sure if he was making
movies or he was doing pub

608
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,820
anyway. It was like it was
gigantic. Okay. And then,

609
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,800
but here's what happened.
It kind of,

610
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,620
the last bit kind of broke off so I
didn't have enough in me to shoot out the

611
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:53,700
last bit. So some of it kind of
hung there. So I had to go through,

612
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,240
had to go through half a roll of toilet
paper to get the last bit out and it was

613
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:00,930
just dirty.

614
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:05,931
So finally what I had to do is get up
and get in the shower and finish off in

615
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:10,260
the shower. So you went shit the
shower. Oh, immediately. Yeah. Yes.

616
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,240
Now do you ever take a shit and then go
to the shower without wiping even once?

617
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,530
Oh No, I never do that. No.

618
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,860
What I do is I make an
evaluation businessman's or
seen it does that I make an

619
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:27,700
evaluation if I'm, if I'm, if I'm a
half a roll of toilet paper in. Yeah.

620
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,060
And it's still some there. I've got to go
to shark. Oh. But the thing is that, that,

621
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,680
that big day kind of saves you now that
you think will meet men you think has

622
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:36,260
made me, I want to make it, I know this,

623
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,200
this trip is going to cost me some
money to cause I, when we get back,

624
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,080
here's what we have to do.
We have to, she'll go online.

625
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,890
I don't know if Amazon prime sells these
things or not, but she'll find out.

626
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,380
The company's called
Toto USA. Toto USA. Okay.

627
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,540
I dunno because we rent this house so,
okay.

628
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:59,100
You're going to have to go to total
USA and look into that and have, uh,

629
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,970
now you have to pick out your favorite,
your re replaced to do it too.

630
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:06,640
You just can't have it. I mean
we can't, okay. The melon,

631
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,980
it's actually called a,

632
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,140
they call it a washlet I
think is what they call it.

633
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,000
Divide it down for me because
it's got the heated toilet seats.

634
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:19,560
Got a heated toilet seat
too. It's great. Yeah.

635
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:23,900
I enjoyed that when I tested
it out yesterday, you know?

636
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:29,310
Yeah. It's called a washlet.
Honestly getting my job.

637
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:31,540
But you walk out of that place.
I do took a shower.

638
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,990
It's pretty amazing because people in
basically take showers for main parts of

639
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:36,230
your body to be clean.
Yeah.

640
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,000
And that's the most important part of
your body and when you get out of there

641
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,240
and said, oh my gosh, I feel
like just, it's incredible.

642
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,360
It is.

643
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,360
I can't believe that I'm going to be 69
years old next month and I never used

644
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,110
one of those things until yesterday.
It's incredible.

645
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:55,170
You think about what I'd been missing
out or you really have been missing out.

646
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,000
I know. I feel like my life's
changed ever since. Ever since

647
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,170
girls have these things I went to,

648
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,800
it's gonna be ridiculous. Your
factories, your mother. Yeah.

649
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,990
I mean I haven't seen a smile on
her face like that and then a while.

650
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,510
Let me tell you just teasing. Just
teasing. Okay. Now have you had any

651
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:19,530
double pipe classics and all
recently double double pipe classics?

652
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,200
I have no idea about.

653
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,140
It's like when you fart and Burp at
the same time. Those are very rare.

654
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,980
Only lately, but never. Thank God
I am Numb. He's had them. I've had

655
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,551
it.
Not often,

656
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:36,570
but there it depends where you hear that
you have the capacity of doing it from

657
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,700
the top and the bottom at the same
time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not,

658
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:43,530
it's not very common. It's both barrels.
Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's both girls.

659
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,470
Absolutely disgusting. But think
about is it that one? Yes and no.

660
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,030
You never had one about three weeks ago,
but what, what did you eat to be able to,

661
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,060
I think it was having Sushi
and something carbonated,

662
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:02,270
but the cool part is usually the gas picks
one hole and in this case it went out

663
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:07,750
of both at the same time. So I
farted and burp together. I, yeah,

664
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,540
it's very rare people can do that.
It's not very common sticks an effort.

665
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,230
Well it has to do, I think of it
more like magic because you can't,

666
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,480
you can't fake it. You
can't fake it. You can't,

667
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,840
I mean it went from the baton just
comes out. It just came out. Yeah.

668
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,110
As you are doing the effort to go.
I think actually the effort,

669
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,710
I was going to fart and it went
out of my mouth at the same time,

670
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,920
like I wasn't expecting the Burkhart
top of that. You were proud of that?

671
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,540
I made tee shirts about
it. You called me. Yeah.

672
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,780
He called me immediately and we make it
for us. I'm doing this and you can't.

673
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,770
You can't. No, no, you can. You, you have
to go back and reminisce. It had been,

674
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:47,040
I think I said to have been a few years
since I had one of those. Yeah. You know,

675
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,950
it's like, it's like Haley's
comet only comes. Exactly. Yeah.

676
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,500
Everybody comes every so often,
but well people,

677
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,540
people have been messaging me after
I talk about it and saying, you know,

678
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,060
does it count when I sneezed and Fart?
And I go,

679
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:04,590
absolutely not because that's a natural
pressure thing to sneeze and push out a

680
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:08,360
Fart, but to burp and Fart is,
it's pretty special. Yeah. That,

681
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,030
that is a topic of conversation
and know there's a bunch of topics.

682
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,100
There's this guy,
he goes by a king ass ripper.

683
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,310
He's called the Fart. God,
I wanted to show you him.

684
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,330
I think this is simply the same topic.
He's called the part guy here,

685
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:27,850
but watch him.
He makes his videos.

686
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,073
Yeah.

687
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,890
Found him and we gave
him a lot of publicity.

688
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,330
Yeah.

689
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:41,650
Yeah. Isn't that incredible? He's been
doing these for years now. Yep. So yeah,

690
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:49,260
but look how good he is.
Okay.

691
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,040
It looks like me a
little, right? Yeah. Oh,

692
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,710
it's real. Real. Yeah. I met a
guy in college that good, good.

693
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,960
Breathe air and breathe
air in and blow it out. Yet

694
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,120
I do it just like that.
This guy has

695
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,540
not as good as this guy.
No, this guy's good.

696
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:16,230
This guy's a 70 yard. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,520
He also has different videos.
I don't want to say that.

698
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,380
Listen to that and say, whoa. Yeah.

699
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,840
I wonder if you could write music to that.

700
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,310
You'd like notes for that people have
taken his far as amazing songs that I can

701
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,144
say that.

702
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,850
Yes.
Which is

703
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,620
hours, video hours. How does he manage
to get done when its roots? I don't know.

704
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,040
That's a great question,
Huh?

705
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:54,790
Right.

706
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,290
You think so?
Do you think that's why he goes,

707
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,810
nobody can work. I've
seen it. I've seen it.

708
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,690
No one guy, he's said nowadays and
faking it. I make people believe it.

709
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,810
Let's see. So it sounds like a perfect.
Okay. You guys speak more into the mic.

710
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,950
Okay.
Yup.

711
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:24,980
Like this.
Oh

712
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,120
yeah. Yeah. Look, look at
that medical part like this.

713
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,220
No, he's really doing work.
Look how dirty those panties or

714
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,910
underwear.
So dirty.

715
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,573
Oh

716
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:52,570
No, look at his stomach. It's
all good. It's all gas. Yeah.

717
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,123
Oh No,
no.

718
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,640
You got a sunset sunset.

719
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,100
Well that is a real sunset.

720
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,890
Okay. Okay. Well, just to show
you how great this guy is.

721
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,650
Absolutely. He does. Uh Oh God. And know
don't do this. You can see his face.

722
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,633
He does like

723
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,160
he does. I'm glutton scenes too.
You know, like we're, he'll eat,

724
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,290
he'll just eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat,

725
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,150
eat and then burp
living. Yeah, I think so.

726
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:46,720
I think he has people that pay
him to do it. I mean, yeah.

727
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,310
Tell me what's that got to make
that business zone. Now. I can't,

728
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:52,970
I can't get on a die.
You're wanting to get into that.

729
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:56,500
You can't control it like that. Mine
just, mine is always spontaneous.

730
00:49:56,501 --> 00:50:00,070
Spur of the moment. Yeah, don't
work. You had to. It is now.

731
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,220
Now if you try to do it, you can't
do it. It's gotta be natural.

732
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,870
It's a natural thing. Yeah. This guy,

733
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,120
he just has these videos all over the
internet, but I have to have bacon.

734
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:17,810
I tell me discussing when talks to them
just barely ripping or Rhonchi far farts

735
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:22,000
are my, ah, Ooh, I should
have some more Berlin.

736
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,900
I kept it off. This is
disgusting. It's pretty cool.

737
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:27,940
We judge something.

738
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,510
Went back to park.
Okay,

739
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:38,900
so you know that your
daughter Maria was in here.

740
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,093
She's a,

741
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,410
she's very well liked by the listeners.

742
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,460
So we had had them email
questions and Maria answer them.

743
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,740
Yes, that'd be classy. Okay. You
can hear it. I'm really, you know,

744
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,020
you're very popular on the show.

745
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,940
People really like getting to know you
and I want to get to know you a little

746
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:01,361
better.

747
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:06,361
I've had some questions submitted
from fans and some of them are,

748
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,090
you know, in an appropriate, but
that's kind of the theme of the show.

749
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:13,590
So I'll just start with this
and you just let me know if I'm,

750
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,610
you know what the answer
is. Okay. Okay. Um,

751
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,050
what's the most amount of guys
you've had sex with in one day?

752
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,570
One day?
Yeah.

753
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,760
I'd say for what,
but neither of us climax one,

754
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,070
if that counts all four times.
Four different guys. Well,

755
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,310
three different guys. I climb, I sweat
the fourth one. Neither of us did,

756
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,440
so I don't, that counts. So
food, that's a crazy number nine.

757
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:48,130
If you'd think about it over the course
of 24 hours and it was spring break,

758
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,700
you gotta be kidding, right? Yeah.
Spring break. We're talking 20 here.

759
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,140
Four. I mean, all her stories
are crazy. You know, of course.

760
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,090
I didn't know what that was.

761
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,660
I mean that she's always
pushed the envelope,

762
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:05,010
but then realize that this
was FedEx. Okay. Yeah, I mean,

763
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,283
mine

764
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,760
for, uh, she, uh,

765
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:13,470
I think on the fourth one because he
was almost a climax. They didn't climax.

766
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:18,080
Yeah. But this was back in her crazy
days, guys, four different guys.

767
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,010
I need you to do the roof of a hotel.

768
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:25,870
One time she told me you're kidding up.

769
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,100
So we were there. Then I remember we were
in a hotel that she went to the roof.

770
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,850
Yeah, because they had to pull the
pull this closer. Where was that?

771
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,630
I am trying to remember. We
were there again, was there,

772
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,410
told me was that it was still,
they keep hiring them.

773
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,270
Idea says I'm going
upstairs to lay in the pool.

774
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,380
Took her forever to come back and
that could be it. That could be, yeah.

775
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,230
She says she has so much time.

776
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,780
You don't mind is crazy.

777
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:55,800
Spring break and you were these just
random guys you would just run into,

778
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,070
but they were there all week
at the same place. Holy Shit.

779
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:07,420
That means that I understand
the translation. If she,

780
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:12,450
if they're there then more than 24 hours,
it deletes the word random. Right? Yeah.

781
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,000
I mean that's, that's good. Okay. Yeah,

782
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,640
so there was one of them, I don't know,
but there's a three I'd seen around,

783
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:24,290
so that's what, that's
ridiculous. That's a lot. No,

784
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,393
a blind

785
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,110
one of them.
One of them,

786
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:32,160
I didn't know three of them I'd seen
around seem I've round, I see them around.

787
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:35,120
So like if she saw him mouth to have,
so basically what you're saying is,

788
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,960
so have you seen with him
because he didn't even know,

789
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,460
they didn't even know his
name. That's good. Yeah.

790
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,870
I mean if I walk around and I pick it up,
she didn't get paid.

791
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:53,760
So technically speaking it's not. So
what is it calling? It isn't being loose.

792
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,920
Oh it seems like a lot back then. I did
not. Did you do that again somewhere else?

793
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,620
No, the most I ever did
after that was to one night.

794
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,400
Wow. That's a lot. All
right. Question number two.

795
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,210
What's the most cocaine you've
ever done in a day? Oh my God.

796
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,740
I think three grams.
Three grams. But give a,

797
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,120
cause you know what three grams are but
either July. So that's why a non user,

798
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,650
an idea of what that is. Like what,
what does, what does three grams mean

799
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,770
strictly on the scene and
you would use cocaine.

800
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:42,620
You generally do like
align. Align is like, yeah,

801
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,430
so that's one line,
right?

802
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:50,430
Just like a fraction of a gram
side maybe did like 30 40 lines,

803
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,630
30 or 40 lines of coke and
one day while in Mexico,

804
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,820
Mexico, Mexico, which is
so dangerous. Oh my God.

805
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,023
So she was she,

806
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:05,530
she helped start a drug cartel basically.
Business. Yeah. It's good to know. Yeah.

807
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,090
This is the most scariest
thing I've ever heard

808
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:13,170
from a guy that was our waiter who happens
to also be a drug dealer and as well

809
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:15,180
as the guide on our fishing trip,

810
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,720
I don't know,
few years ago

811
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,090
in tango. Wow. Really? She remembers.

812
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,040
That's really dangerous.
Yes.

813
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:31,150
Remember that guy she has to
remember is the drug dealers.

814
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,570
She just hit them. Yes, I do. No,

815
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,030
I don't think you did because you
were making fun of this. Well,

816
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,160
I mean it is prostitution then.
He's a drug dealer.

817
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,840
That's what it is. I mean 30
grams of the rocks. Your daughter,

818
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:49,410
cocaine anymore. No, I mean there's
this, that was all in the past.

819
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:52,790
That makes it, okay, well it's over. What
do you want to do it? It's in the past.

820
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,070
It's still the brain is damaged.

821
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,240
I realize that that leaves
the next question here. Um,

822
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,400
have you ever been
arrested and taken to jail?

823
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:11,100
Uh, and if so, what for?
You have gone to jail?

824
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:16,090
I have gone to jail. Mom and dad do
not. Where, what city were you in?

825
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:20,310
I was in,
I was in Chicago.

826
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,160
You got arrested and taken to jail?

827
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,410
Jeff and I were living
together and decent behavior.

828
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,440
We were high and drunk and naked
running around the streets in the snow.

829
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,200
I'm challenging each other.
Her neighbors called police.

830
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,500
How'd you ally? Cause obviously you
don't think you got charged right now.

831
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,010
Jeff had a lawyer. Thankfully that's
grandparents bailed us out of that one.

832
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,190
Really? Yeah. How long were you in
jail? Just few hours. Few Hours.

833
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,570
Sounds plausible to me.

834
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,700
They were naked in the streets.

835
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,780
There were,
but this is a heavy drug use these days.

836
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,720
It doesn't feel good to him.
He just goes,

837
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:03,780
gets the drunk naked and
go outside to do stuff.

838
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:07,770
Well people, people on drugs do
crazy things. It's not that unusual.

839
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,240
I mean they do.

840
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,390
Yeah. This is the most escape.
Interviewer you ever heard in my life?

841
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,380
I can't believe we're
talking about my daughter.

842
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,700
She parties pretty hard.
You know,

843
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,480
I didn't know that. I knew she
party and have fun and you should.

844
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:30,120
I mean, I remember one time, it
really affect me. We were in church,

845
00:57:30,121 --> 00:57:34,590
I mean out of all the places media
decide to tell me riding mass.

846
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,790
She didn't around.
She says,

847
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,300
I want you to know that they already had
sex before she was in high school and

848
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:43,951
that is okay.

849
00:57:43,951 --> 00:57:48,620
I don't have a baby and brain in mass
with my kids and husband and didn't

850
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,300
realize it. I don't want to lie.
So it's important for you to know.

851
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,070
It's an interesting
spot to a nice clean up.

852
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,790
I think he's a smart spot to come clean.
I couldn't even talk. I just keep going.

853
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:03,930
And that's you're right. Yeah.
And after mass I said, Maria,

854
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,770
you shocked me in the middle of the night.
She says what?

855
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,420
It bothers me that you didn't know.
And I said,

856
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:14,100
when you're a kid and you
said there is no baby.

857
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,290
And she said, no, you don't
have to worry for that part.

858
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,190
So I never wanted to ask why?
Because I don't know if she, yeah,

859
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,340
things happen. And the guy is
not a boyfriend. He was, yes.

860
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,440
I don't mind. It was one of the
five guys that she had in one day,

861
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:33,870
but here there's more.

862
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,120
It's pretty intense.
Um,

863
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,070
have you ever committed a robbery?

864
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,560
Yeah, big ones. Small ones.

865
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,220
It's more of what I think she confused.
Robbery was shoplifting though.

866
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:04,650
Things have you prob tic tacs,
lot of alcohol and cigarettes.

867
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,370
That's like shoplifting clothes.
I mean,

868
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:12,810
but have you ever broken into somewhere
and stolen? Yeah, I was really,

869
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,810
I don't even remember what we stole it.
We were like stupid and drunk and

870
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,520
we just went into someone's house and
took stuff and just someone's house.

871
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,060
That's crazy. And what city was
that? That was in Boston. Really.

872
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,260
So college days,

873
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,130
not the easiest. Really Sad. Wow. This is
absolutely the place to hear my daughter.

874
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,540
No,
it's a colorful past.

875
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:38,430
A colorful pass to be roasted
to drug dealers. Going to jail.

876
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,850
It means you've lived a full
life. It free lights. Yeah.

877
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,290
That's not the way to beat the light.

878
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,080
I think I prefer,

879
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:50,840
I prefer to think of her as is a a what
a great mother and she is today and then

880
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:54,780
I just, it's eccentric. She's eccentric,
she's a century. But you know,

881
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:59,760
I guess as a father, you know, I realize
that people do things in the past,

882
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:02,790
but I think I,
this is like,

883
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,370
well, I have to tell has
been peace palace. Yeah. It's
okay. It's in the person.

884
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,140
Wonderful human being. Yeah. At
least I hope that she never, ever,

885
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,070
ever judge anybody. Right. Yeah.
That's a good point. Good point.

886
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,420
Yeah. That's a good college.
That's amazing. It's a good
point. I didn't know that.

887
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,840
I mean, I, you know, still there's
so many things that were blurry.

888
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,710
They give us kind of like,
yeah, I think I did the,

889
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:30,860
I don't remember the specifics about
it, but I remember, can you kind of,

890
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,110
it's kind of a haze. Yeah. I remember
we were really drunk and they were out.

891
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:37,520
We knew that the people were the God
and the brownstones on Brookline.

892
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,010
And so we've just kind of went on.
I don't be, didn't take anything.

893
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:44,210
We just kind of hung out in their house
and paint your alcohol and eat their

894
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:47,240
food. And then like, okay,
I'm gonna go back. Wow.

895
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,120
I ever been in a fight with weapons.

896
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,350
Hm. I think that, I remember the,

897
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:56,970
the boss university tuition was 19,000
a year in those days. So I'm glad. Yeah.

898
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,651
My money was,

899
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:02,651
was going for good cause good cause for
19,000 it was tuition that didn't it no

900
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:05,750
weapon Roman board. Well, there's
something about that here.

901
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,940
Yeah.

902
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,370
No, I really wanted to though. I've always
wanted to be like, like a warrior tasks.

903
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,070
I'm like fight someone and just win.
Yeah. I haven't had that opportunity.

904
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:15,760
Words and stuff. Yeah. I
think that's kind of the,

905
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:16,990
one of the reasons why I joined the navy.

906
01:01:16,991 --> 01:01:20,920
I was thinking I was going to get to
go and do some kind of like mission

907
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:23,510
impossible, you know, stuff. And I did it.

908
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,830
I even took martial arts
classes and it didn't happen.

909
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,610
How about, um, have you ever done anything
in the adult film industry? Like porn?

910
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,250
I did a long, long time ago
because I needed extra money.

911
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:43,630
I didn't feel dad was giving me a math
in college and who is really excited that

912
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:46,990
finally I will start asking for money
and my credit card expenses went down,

913
01:01:46,991 --> 01:01:50,290
which he doesn't know is that
I did do one film for cash.

914
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:55,910
Hi. This is Debbie. This is a
job. No, no, this is not real.

915
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,720
Yeah, that's good. That's
Marie exaggerated. It's got to
be, I don't think so. No. I,

916
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:04,010
I can't imagine her doing that.
Really. I know that's gotta be here

917
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,210
in college. I got like, like, like $2,500

918
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,650
I am dealing with, I
think, I'm going to think,

919
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,940
I just, I think sometimes Maria, yeah,

920
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,070
go ahead Maria.

921
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,510
She is very good at in Bella Sheen
and playing to the role. Yeah.

922
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,280
I mean, I, I really, that one, I
don't, I just don't believe it.

923
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,440
Here's another,
just one more.

924
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:33,543
Yeah.

925
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:38,780
So had this idea that um,
it's mom and dad are coming.

926
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,210
I want to play this game where
they're always like, oh my God, Maria.

927
01:02:44,211 --> 01:02:47,860
So Maria shocks this way.
Surprises this. Yeah, so

928
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:53,240
they're always like in
disbelief of your reality.

929
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,240
So I thought it would be fun, but I
was saying it right now and I'll, I'll,

930
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:03,560
I'll play this later. Okay. I'm
asking you to make things up,

931
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:08,090
but the game will be that this is real.
Yes.

932
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,460
And it'll be something like this.
Like I'll say,

933
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,950
why did we get played? I mean
you're talking about hook,

934
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:18,730
line and sinker being played.

935
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,650
No, no, no. I was calling my tears because
I was in the worst really effect. Really?

936
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,210
Oh I'm sorry.
Did they went to jail?

937
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:32,030
But that's pretty good
amps and he scared buddies.

938
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,660
Took him Outta jail guys. For Times.
It's sitting years, a walk around.

939
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,390
The God is stole from everybody,

940
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:43,170
but we should have it knowing
Mariana says for exaggeration,

941
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,200
I started to get suspicious for me at
one point I said to me a little bit,

942
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:50,650
it's going to be real that he, she
did it, but I think I believe it.

943
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,730
Tommy is the worst. Did
you play us on it? Well,

944
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,510
I thought we were going to have
more fun with no, we got it.

945
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,060
Take it out of this deal.
I didn't think you're going to get yeah,

946
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,750
totally devastated. Told me. Yeah.

947
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:07,563
Yeah,

948
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,570
that's all right. Call her. Hey. Hi.

949
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:17,170
So I just, I have mom and dad here. I
just did the, uh, the game we did and

950
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:23,540
mom was in tears. She was not
amused. No idea. I was devastated.

951
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,280
She was so upset by it.
Basically,

952
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:30,560
the first year were they born or stir fry
and have sex with a stranger is a pass

953
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:33,050
around four times a day.

954
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,820
Call me because you'd have like city
grams of cocaine and they give you an idea

955
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:44,310
at one line is, I don't know what
ever. So you have like 43 a day.

956
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:49,490
You went to jail.
I'll be naked in the streets.

957
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,750
We don't give giving you shit for him.
He said,

958
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,010
Oh know only from the stores and stuff.

959
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:59,960
But you went in people's houses
and think that his teams, yeah,

960
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:04,800
I mean all I'm doing is crying.
She mom was crying and I said, me,

961
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,300
I can't believe this is my daughter,
is it? But is in the past month? Yeah.

962
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:13,250
I told him was in the past, but she
was just super effective is I told him,

963
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:17,440
I said, you know what, she needs to
learn from this and this is never, ever,

964
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,670
ever judge anybody.

965
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,230
Yeah. You can't judge anybody
because you were a prostitute.

966
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,020
I never hear judging and I,

967
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,540
and I'm sitting there thinking I'm
spending 18,000 in the current tuition.

968
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,900
No. How you guys know it's a joke, right?

969
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,843
No,
of course.

970
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:38,020
Now I know there's torture as do
the this big time on this one.

971
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,710
Yeah. Big Time. There was really good

972
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,300
you think?
What did you think dad?

973
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,820
Dad was like, and he seemed to in kind
of shock the one that he was like,

974
01:05:47,821 --> 01:05:50,060
I just refused to believe it was when,
uh,

975
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,140
you said you did one porno back in
college. He was like, I can't, he says,

976
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,100
I can believe that.

977
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,910
But he did believe that you broke
into people's houses and boss

978
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,150
and he did believe totally. They
do have sex with this today. Yeah,

979
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,820
he did believe you had sex with four guys.

980
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,133
He did.

981
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:14,190
Why was it that roof and Maria, do
you remember what his mom saying? Oh,

982
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:16,560
I remember that. I didn't
even know. I remember,

983
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,880
we remember one hotel that we were there.
Has it pulled in the roots?

984
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:21,990
Do you remember that Maria? Yeah. Okay.

985
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,950
And you went to the hotel that had a in
the room around, in the roof. On the roof.

986
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,030
We went with hotel. Then you got a lot
of hotels out there. I was with us.

987
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:33,710
And you said,
I'm gonna go and lay in the pool.

988
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:37,910
I'm looking back and get to
the base there. You haven't
have sites. Don't tell me.

989
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:38,500
That was great.

990
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,960
They have wanted to stay in this picking
up because I took it like you have a

991
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:44,270
great day with a pool and the
sun and they tend to be that.

992
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:48,990
It wasn't man walking by and I don't know
what did they pay you for this or what?

993
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh my God. No, no, no.
This is all made up.

994
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,640
I can believe her. I mean,
he made me get out. Yeah.

995
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,940
Saturday.
I actually cut it short.

996
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,400
I didn't play the whole thing because
I saw how upset you were getting.

997
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,760
No, no, no, you're not. I tried to put
it behind and said, and five it comes in.

998
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,970
One of he uses,
I think of Mighty Asic.

999
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,880
Yeah. He was like, Nice.

1000
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,420
Aw, that's sweet. Well, I promise you
guys, it was all made up. We just did it.

1001
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,000
Yep. Well, you succeeded in that.

1002
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,160
I lost 10 pounds in one minute.
Yeah. You didn't get a job.

1003
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,490
Yeah. Good job, Maria.

1004
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,890
Right. This is a 500%. This is that.
This is all Tom. He's doing please.

1005
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,380
This is all my thing. I, I did this.
I totally do. You guys. All right.

1006
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,200
It was all made up. Okay. Bye Bye.
Bye Bye [inaudible] guys. Bye.

1007
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:43,973
Okay.

1008
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,103
MMM.

1009
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,220
That's a lady farting.

1010
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,713
Oh,

1011
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,360
but you know how you said, do
they ever, that's such a fart.

1012
01:07:57,361 --> 01:08:01,340
Can you make a song out of it?
So that lady farted, right? Yeah.

1013
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:07,343
Oh,

1014
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,710
and then,
uh,

1015
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,010
a guy sent this in.
Okay.

1016
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,140
Oh,
he's

1017
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,520
got
to get beat.

1018
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,060
Then he turns to the far end of the note.

1019
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:44,210
[inaudible]

1020
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,920
what do you think? That's my
kind of music. I love that music.

1021
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,630
It's amazing. They can be
spiteful. Barrett's by babies.

1022
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,880
Hurts.
Oh my God.

1023
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:46,380
This or some shit because birds sing.
So with immune birds do sing.

1024
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,880
There's this thing and they also
shit on you from 5,000 feet. Hey,

1025
01:09:50,881 --> 01:09:53,090
what do you guys think of this by the way?
Oh my God.

1026
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,930
This is something that I thought you
might have something to say on. No.

1027
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:57,840
All right.

1028
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,020
Hey everybody. Welcome back this week
going to be talking to you about pronouns.

1029
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:04,960
Sonos preferred pronouns or preferred
gender pronouns or PGPs, um,

1030
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,450
whatever you call him.
Pronouns,

1031
01:10:06,451 --> 01:10:10,110
the things we use to refer to people in
the third person that are their names.

1032
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,690
They're also often used as the linguistic
representation that people's gender

1033
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:19,590
identities. So there are really
important, really, really,

1034
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:20,550
really important.

1035
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,260
Okay. You understand what
that this is or no? Yes. You
know, a gender Pronoun. Is He?

1036
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:27,640
Him?
She,

1037
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,833
her

1038
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,140
like that. Okay. So I got,
um, you know, got it. Yeah.

1039
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:35,270
All right.

1040
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:42,390
The first and most important rule
regarding pronouns is to respect people's

1041
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,290
pronouns. Always. There's
a rule number two,

1042
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:47,910
always ask,

1043
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:52,050
don't assume it's far better to ask you
someone's Pronoun is just be like, hey,

1044
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,890
hi. How are you? What's your name? What's
Your Pronoun? Not every dealer. Hey,

1045
01:10:55,900 --> 01:11:00,530
just want her to confirm what's, what's
your pronoun? It's so much better to do.

1046
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:04,270
Most people are really like just pleased
when someone asks about them cause it

1047
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:07,170
can feel very welcoming and accepting.
Um, when other people do that,

1048
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:11,430
especially when you're newly coming
out. Um, worst case I want to be,

1049
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:15,690
there are a lot of pronouns out there,
like huge amount.

1050
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,850
So this is where the things have
changed recently. I, first of all,

1051
01:11:18,851 --> 01:11:23,020
I hear you laughing.
So the different,

1052
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:28,140
this is going to be now what people want
to be referred to as like slowly and

1053
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:34,120
slowly adding, Huh? Oh I go by they them.

1054
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,010
Well was the two most
common ones are he and she,

1055
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:41,730
she has is traditionally considered a
male pronoun and she is traditionally

1056
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:44,450
considered a female pronoun.
However,

1057
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,980
it's important to note that some people
use he or she but did not identify as

1058
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:52,640
male or female.
So if someone says,

1059
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:56,750
oh my parent is he, you can't just
assume that they're male or you know,

1060
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:57,703
if they say,
sure,

1061
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:02,010
what are you laughing
at? Funny, funny video.

1062
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,630
How can you talk about it? Here
is not a male I am assuming. Yeah,

1063
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,940
that's all I say.
She but I call him a hit.

1064
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,120
So basically it's a he because he
was born male but now he has it.

1065
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,830
Well this is more about you're
talking about um, sex organs.

1066
01:12:19,831 --> 01:12:22,220
This is gender identity.
So like we're not,

1067
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:25,420
but if for some people the gender
identity spectrum is very wide.

1068
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:31,130
When I want to understand this,
like if I talk about you and I say hey,

1069
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,650
there are actually,

1070
01:12:32,651 --> 01:12:37,050
I don't mean he but it is because you
don't describe yourself as a male.

1071
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,070
Right, right, right, right. Can I see war?

1072
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,210
You can't assume that there are female.
Um, so if you were to say like I prefer,

1073
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,970
I prefer like masculine
pronouns are male pronouns.

1074
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,760
It sort of implying that
everyone else who uses he

1075
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,180
uses,
you know,

1076
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:57,720
it is male or that like everyone
has identified as male uses heat,

1077
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,220
which is not also not
necessarily the case.

1078
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:03,280
So it's better to just say I
prefer he'd be done with it, um,

1079
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,470
or she could be done with it.

1080
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,473
It gets better.

1081
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:10,970
Um, now. So then they're
also gender neutral pronouns,

1082
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:15,590
gender neutral pronouns can be used for
anybody of any gender and they have no

1083
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:19,910
gendered meanings attached to them
at all, which is super cool. Um,

1084
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:24,710
and there are so many of them.
The most commonly used is they,

1085
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,210
they have traditionally plural,

1086
01:13:26,211 --> 01:13:29,720
but we already used in the singular
form to like maintain people's anonymity

1087
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:32,210
here. Like if you just don't know what
their gender is, you'll be like, oh,

1088
01:13:32,211 --> 01:13:36,110
I was talking to a student and they
told me Blah Blah, blah. Totally normal.

1089
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:39,860
So you can use it for specific people as
well. And a lot of people prefer they,

1090
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:44,970
how did you feel about in your office
somebody having a gender identity thing

1091
01:13:44,971 --> 01:13:47,790
and saying, I like to be referred
to as day, then that work.

1092
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:53,550
I mean if I have normally called
people by their name, right,

1093
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:57,480
but if you're referring to somebody
and they have a gender identity,

1094
01:13:57,481 --> 01:14:00,120
like preference,
but Pronoun Preferences,

1095
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:04,650
I would still refer to that other person
by their name rather than they them.

1096
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:10,460
So if I'm in an office and they're
talking about Bob or Bobby,

1097
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,780
I would not say they them.
I would say Bob or Bobby

1098
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,870
next.
Most common I've seen as z.

1099
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:23,760
Z can be spelled a bunch of different
ways and it can be declined,

1100
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:27,390
but in bigger ways it's like
declension lake. So like he, him,

1101
01:14:27,391 --> 01:14:31,450
his and then Z. Z. He are here.

1102
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,550
That z Zim Zur.

1103
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:40,410
Yeah, Darryl was, there are
a lot of options with z.

1104
01:14:40,411 --> 01:14:42,030
So if someone says I prefer Z,

1105
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:45,420
ask them what spelling
and if they can use it,

1106
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,150
can they use that in the office?
Well, I think as a neuroma one,

1107
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,370
I think Czi I think it was it. Okay.
But that's what you think of him.

1108
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,260
That he's telling you how people use it.
So what is z means?

1109
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:59,010
Z is a pronoun. That is what? That is.

1110
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,390
Gender neutral. So you're not
identifying with either gender.

1111
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,313
Oh,

1112
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,080
you know, is your mind blown or no?
Well, I mean I think I hear women.

1113
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:12,910
Yeah, that's for real. I hear you.
I hear, I hear women often say,

1114
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,640
you guys right. Okay.
Referring to they use Z,

1115
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:22,510
I'm referring to a group of other women.
Right, right. Okay. So I think that,

1116
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,020
you know, the, who's responsibility is it?

1117
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:31,210
Is it the responsibility of the
minority or the majority and which,

1118
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,510
that's an interesting, it's an interesting
question. Okay. And the question is,

1119
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:37,840
if you get closer to the
mic, I think that, you know,

1120
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:42,130
for me the challenge is, and it
also have, you can raise the arm,

1121
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,350
the arm. No, not from
there. Not from there.

1122
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:45,923
Okay,

1123
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,050
awesome.
You know,

1124
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:52,051
believe that there should be some
deference to seniority and tradition.

1125
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:53,703
Okay.

1126
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:58,540
So if you have somebody who's 70 years
old who was raised in an environment

1127
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,610
where this is the way,
as long as he's not,

1128
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:05,060
as long as he's not overly disrespectful
or trying to be disrespectful. Right.

1129
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,540
But he's traditional and his commentary,

1130
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:12,930
I don't think it's up to him to modify
his behavior in order to make the new

1131
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:18,130
minority Hamby I, I totally see what
you're saying there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1132
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,120
I just don't,
I mean,

1133
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:23,560
I will say I do prefer these
him Zur as a pronoun for myself.

1134
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:24,913
Tell me

1135
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,870
I never heard that.
Z.

1136
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,840
Yeah. Yeah. I've never heard this
for real. I've never heard it.

1137
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,030
Z means you don't have it yet.

1138
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,700
So Z is,
is how you'd say he,

1139
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:41,970
if somebody was like, oh, or
she, for somebody that goes,
I'm not he or she, um, z.

1140
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,520
So you areZ ,
right?

1141
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,250
So you'd say Zee said z one at a coke.

1142
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,240
I get the dose or Zim over there. Oh my
God. This is not for real though. Yeah.

1143
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,720
This is for real.
I'm glad it

1144
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,470
one last too long because this is as
crazy as it comes. Now, if you are a toZ

1145
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,460
and Christina is a psyllidZ or is it she,

1146
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:05,540
she uh,
she's more on the,

1147
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,930
on the female gender spectrum.
Yeah. So, so far still,

1148
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:13,490
sometimes she goes by,
they them.

1149
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,610
So you had in z?

1150
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,950
Yeah. Let, let me, let me, cause
both of you speak Spanish. No,

1151
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:21,310
but I want to know Amy.

1152
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:25,210
Where's sure. Okay. The baby is a hero.

1153
01:17:25,211 --> 01:17:27,230
The baby's on z right now.

1154
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:32,231
We're trying not to place too many
gender identity issues like on him.

1155
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,820
So we're still, it is a boy. I know. So
I know. I'm trying to dial that back.

1156
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,220
So you have to say on Z.
Yeah.

1157
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,180
All right.
Since both of you speak Spanish,

1158
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:46,300
which is a mask in the feminine language,
unlike English,

1159
01:17:46,301 --> 01:17:50,440
which has a lot of adjectives
or verbs or whatever,

1160
01:17:50,441 --> 01:17:54,020
there are adjectives that are gender
neutral. Gender neutral. Yeah.

1161
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,730
How does this translate
into other languages,

1162
01:17:57,731 --> 01:18:01,790
which are very much like
French or Spanish or Italian,

1163
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,230
which you're very much
a masculine feminine.

1164
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,320
That's a good question. I mean, I
don't have the answer, you know,

1165
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,130
I don't know what the answer is.

1166
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:13,610
Spanish to you because I will
know what to call you. Um,

1167
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,770
uh, Z does moving,

1168
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,183
but as yes,

1169
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,070
see it,
Christina,

1170
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,300
Eh, oh yeah. I would
just, instead of saying a,

1171
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:33,350
I would say if he Stena like he
was saying and, and, and see.

1172
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:37,480
Oh, how about uh,
[inaudible] if diving there.

1173
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,880
It sounds feminine.

1174
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:47,170
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

1175
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:49,580
it's good.
Z

1176
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:55,170
you will know. Say you're making
it. It's very interesting.

1177
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:59,100
It's interesting stuff. Any money you will
make it French or rice. Oh my goodness.

1178
01:18:59,160 --> 01:18:59,790
Yeah.

1179
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:04,770
So, so can I, can I bring up a question
here that I have on my mind? Uh, you can.

1180
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:09,580
Okay. You know, there's
been a lot of this LBG,

1181
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,790
LBGT,
whatever it's called.

1182
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:17,610
So the issue is like going
to the bathroom. Okay.

1183
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,930
Yeah, that's a popular topic
on the show. Okay. Going to
the bathroom is, yeah. Yeah.

1184
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,970
Okay. Now if you have a
transgender person who says,

1185
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:30,360
I, I'm more, I want to use
the ladies' bathroom. Yeah.

1186
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,920
Even though he has the physical
characteristics of a male. Right.

1187
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:39,800
How are the, when he goes into a
woman's, they, you stalls on the women's.

1188
01:19:39,801 --> 01:19:43,470
So it's a little bit different. But
if, if the guy gets out of a stall,

1189
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,450
how are the women going to know he's
transgender and not some guy who was in

1190
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:49,470
there looking for a peak?

1191
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,420
Well,

1192
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:55,420
I mean transgender people don't
look like a guy looking for a peak.

1193
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,520
No, but how do they know that? Well,
what do you mean? How did they know that?

1194
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,770
Why did he is not really how,
but that seems to not be an issue.

1195
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:07,740
Like it's, it's the issue of people
like saying it, but it's not.

1196
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,910
But what I'm saying,
I understand his question now.

1197
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:15,540
I don't think somebody is not
really just gender. Right.

1198
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:19,730
I use the skews of it. Their agenda
right there is as a transgender. Right.

1199
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,620
But it really is a male. Right.
He can go into the ladies room.

1200
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:25,290
What I'm saying is I
understand that and what I,

1201
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,090
what I'm saying is as of now,
yeah, that's not an issue because,

1202
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,220
no, it's not, it's not an issue because,

1203
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
because we have transgender people
using restrooms all the time now.

1204
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:38,520
Yeah.

1205
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,520
And the occurrences that you're speaking
of are obviously an anomaly because,

1206
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,750
well, they have, it's gone. It has an
APP, you know, we act as an API yet,

1207
01:20:47,751 --> 01:20:51,290
but it's I rapists. But I mean
those are anomalies. Yeah.

1208
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,060
So you can't just say,

1209
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:57,980
well the one guy who was
posing as it was faking,

1210
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,510
so therefore all the other transgender
people who are transgender,

1211
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:06,110
I mean you're talking about like, so
the one in a thousand thing needs to be,

1212
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,600
so I think [inaudible] are we going
to go to rather than a for the future

1213
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:16,400
multisectoral Unisex restrooms.
Yeah, I think we are. Yeah.

1214
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:20,090
That's where I think it's all going.
We're going to a bigger bathrooms. Yeah,

1215
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,100
but the issue you bring up,
I don't think it's an issue.

1216
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:24,200
You don't think it's an issue?
I mean, it's not an issue.

1217
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:26,180
It's an issue of the imagination,

1218
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:31,270
but it's not an actual real world issue
because we do have transgender people

1219
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:35,810
using restrooms. Yeah. Using the
opposite sex restroom. I have never seen,

1220
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:38,780
most people just want to relieve
themselves. I haven't seen that yet.

1221
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,250
But it's happening all the time. You
don't even know it. Shut it down.

1222
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,050
How do we do not,
well,

1223
01:21:45,051 --> 01:21:48,700
we haven't had any people
that look male in the grocery.

1224
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:52,190
I'm wanting to know the difference.
The other guy,

1225
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,990
you can be transgender and still dress,
get you as a male and you're,

1226
01:21:56,991 --> 01:22:00,220
and you're, and you're inside. You're a
female. No, that's, that's not really,

1227
01:22:00,221 --> 01:22:02,330
that's the work that way.
No. No. Okay. All right.

1228
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:05,450
Okay. Yeah, I think the
issue is not an issue.

1229
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:11,030
The issue is econ bullying because there
is so much going on lately and every

1230
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,590
sense that it could be a great business
says, okay, this is my chance. No,

1231
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,220
it could happen. I'm not
saying it couldn't, but I also
think that like, it's like

1232
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:25,100
the rapist is still gonna rape.
Whether or not we have this,

1233
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,310
he doesn't need to be. Yeah. This
issue is actually completely different.

1234
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:31,010
Prophets are rapist.
No, no. Or even a paper.

1235
01:22:31,011 --> 01:22:33,560
It's like they're going to do
that regardless of the rule.

1236
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:38,250
Most people want to just go to the
bathroom in comfort and just feel feeling.

1237
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:42,860
I can appreciate that more than anyone.
I know you can. I know you can. Um,

1238
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,300
wanted to show you this now that we
got off of that serious topic, um,

1239
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:48,680
uh,

1240
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,680
this apparently this guy made this and
there's an argument that it's the longest

1241
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,890
fart ever. Um, yeah, this one.

1242
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,690
Oh, there's an argument whether, yeah,

1243
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:08,470
tell me if you think it's real
because you can see him breathing.

1244
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,320
You can hear the room tone audio.

1245
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,660
He's got a microphone there.
The bed.

1246
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:32,390
I know
the guys had a lot of parts

1247
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,650
consistent.
Yeah.

1248
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,593
Great.

1249
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:51,300
I think that when you have
a real fart like that,

1250
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,071
it's,

1251
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:57,810
the tone is to consistent and almost
like as a mechanical device further for

1252
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:02,820
awhile because you have this consistent
tone and as you have pressure released

1253
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:08,400
in your large bowel, okay. It's not
going to be completely consistent. So,

1254
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:12,450
but it doesn't sound completely
consistent. It goes, well
there's a longer, I know,

1255
01:24:12,451 --> 01:24:17,340
but there's a long section in there that
there that it sounds like it was just

1256
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:22,170
the, the frequency didn't really change
that much. I have had long farms.

1257
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:26,270
Yeah. You have really long
for it. Well, she does. Oh,

1258
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,490
scream from the bedroom. I'm
in the bathroom. Oh my God.

1259
01:24:29,491 --> 01:24:32,630
I can't believe how long I know what,
he's a long prayer. Unfortunately.

1260
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,560
Sound comfortable.

1261
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:38,010
There's no way you can last that
long and it still keep going. Yeah,

1262
01:24:38,011 --> 01:24:40,650
I don't agree.
That doesn't mean that it made up.

1263
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:44,130
I can pretend to do anything of this song.

1264
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:45,920
Okay.

1265
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,180

1272
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,220
All right,

1273
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:01,490
well someone else did it.

1274
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:06,110
Matthew Miller made the song for the last
time you were on the show like a long

1275
01:26:06,111 --> 01:26:10,880
time ago. Cause it's, it's good.

1276
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,220
It's really good.
There's a few for dad.

1277
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:22,270
This chart, this chart would know about
the Orlando airport. She know that story.

1278
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:24,003
Good luck.

1279
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:29,260
You know, I, I think, I think
I told her at the time. Yeah.

1280
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:34,530
But I took in the terror
and the Orlando right dump.

1281
01:26:34,781 --> 01:26:37,840
They kind of went through
my pants and she knows.

1282
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,790
Do you know about that one though?

1283
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:44,650
It went through his pants and he
couldn't get it off. So he flew with,

1284
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,370
got got on the pants.
That was it.

1285
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,740
I had no choice.

1286
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,580
Yeah. Well. And you go to
the bathroom before you go?

1287
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:58,570
No, I, I raced into the men's room there,

1288
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:02,940
but I just didn't make it in time.
So I had to ditch my underwear in,

1289
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,690
in the or with Gacaca and your
pants and get in the plane.

1290
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,180
I wiped it off as best I could.
Okay. Ah, flush four or five times.

1291
01:27:10,181 --> 01:27:13,360
Went through a whole roll of toilet paper,
try to clean things up.

1292
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:18,460
But in the end I had spots,
stains and my tracking my ass.

1293
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:22,400
Oh no underwear. And I had
to fly to Arizona. I Europe,

1294
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:25,870
Orlando to Arizona in Orlando
to Arizona. So, you know,

1295
01:27:25,871 --> 01:27:27,190
there's little cock out in that seat,

1296
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:30,910
which makes you think about how many
seats have got, got what he's eating.

1297
01:27:30,911 --> 01:27:34,190
Told me. Because you can
not have Catholic. No, it's
just, you know, as you're,

1298
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,500
you're the cook.
Okay.

1299
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:39,190
So some of your food maybe because if I'm
the cook more reason not to have them,

1300
01:27:39,191 --> 01:27:43,810
I don't go,

1301
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,510

01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,850
We're walking back and
they love to tell him.

1305
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,140
He started walking with the two legs.
Yeah,

1306
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:58,610
next to each other and it deleted
a little penguin stuffed. Nope.

1307
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:01,430
First we're going and he was walking
in Berlin as load my back hurts,

1308
01:28:01,431 --> 01:28:04,360

1309
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,290
[inaudible] speeding little,
you know,

1310
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:09,470
like a little 87 year old mom that
doesn't want to get killed. Yeah.

1311
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:13,610
And he's being good job. Good job. I
said, oh, it's coming up. It's coming up.

1312
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:17,120
I have to do it. Good. I have to make
it. It'll be okay because it's a muffin.

1313
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:22,490
Oh No, no, actually it's, it triggers
when you eat, it triggers your about,

1314
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:25,370

happened this morning. My God,

1315
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,130

This is not funny at all.

1316
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:31,050
That Kenny light were coming back
from the template. [inaudible]

1317
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:34,710
yeah, we are crossing the
street. The light is green
and it's feeling as you know,

1318
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:39,420
and as we're closing, he's on the left.
I'm on the right. A guy decided to come.

1319
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,890
How do you say making a
lefthand turn into Mercedes.

1320
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:45,180
And of course he was looking at his phone.
Yeah.

1321
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:49,070
They ain't look at and glows from hitting
your father then you had the right

1322
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:51,590
away. Oh yeah, we had the
white thing. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1323
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:55,850
He's looking at his phone was
what'd you do? Well I jumped back,

1324
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:57,200
almost spilled the coffee,
you know,

1325
01:28:57,201 --> 01:28:59,540
and it would say he came
within three feet of madness.

1326
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:02,100
Listen that and what surprises me?

1327
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,100
I said don't at least I would roll
down my windows. I'm so sorry.

1328
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:09,640
The guy went like this. Like
you know you're safe. Yeah.

1329
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,850
Yeah. That was a skewed. Yeah.

1330
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:22,743
Why?

1331
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,153
Okay.

1332
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:35,263
Okay.

1333
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,213
Okay.

1334
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:51,763
Yeah.

1335
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,730
Can we get one new question?
I've been half.

1336
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,910
This is the cold shoulder
related to mostly farts.

1337
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:14,520
Yeah. You know, I do see
mostly far it's got guy. Um,

1338
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:18,450
so that is not, we cannot be funny
and this with heart. No, no we,

1339
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:21,360
we do sexual stuff too,
but I'm leaving that out cause you're here

1340
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,240
a my part of enjoying life.
Yeah.

1341
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,930
It's to make the most out
of everything that you do,

1342
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:33,220
that you see lying down in the Serengeti
when they stake out their territory.

1343
01:30:33,221 --> 01:30:35,650
You know, they're sad. It's what I do.

1344
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:40,780
Anytime I start blowing farts, you know,
30 minutes later I'll be dropping one in.

1345
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,720
Did you just,
did you just turn your hand?

1346
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:47,470
This was a real squirter drop my load.
Just chill and take it down.

1347
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:51,880
He's the Oprah of shitting.
Absolutely. Kind of the doctor.

1348
01:30:51,881 --> 01:30:53,260
Eyes of the radio network.

1349
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:57,640
You know the wipes people use to clean
like countertops, industrial strength.

1350
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,910
Always use the handicap stall or to hold
your keys together when you're walking

1351
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:02,930
down stairs.
The cheeks on stay close.

1352
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,070
That's good.
See,

1353
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:09,180
these are all little tidbits of
advice said I've helped Tommy's view

1354
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:13,080
listenerships over the years and
they've got some good feedback on this.

1355
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:14,190
Definitely.
Oh yeah.

1356
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:17,900
Part of enjoying life to
make the most out of it.

1357
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,630
Uh, but yeah, there's a
lot of top dog songs. Um,

1358
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:25,050
and then, uh, you know what,
one of my favorite thing is,

1359
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:30,140
is that the first time you guys ever like
it was Weston was born and I went down

1360
01:31:32,011 --> 01:31:36,390
there and you had guy,
you guys argued it was the funniest thing.

1361
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,180
I've never laughed so hard
and I recorded it on my phone.

1362
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:43,760
I hear what you're doing here. I
never get bored with, you know,

1363
01:31:43,761 --> 01:31:46,900
I'll give you and said that. What did
you tell me? You called me and said,

1364
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:47,973
you know,
it's funny.

1365
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:53,310
It's a big thing and they get so bored
with you was that nick doesn't get them

1366
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:56,500
focused on doing that conversation.
Yeah,

1367
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,810
but you're automatically
included in my list.

1368
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:05,120
Right? I told you that other times
you don't get it. No, you didn't.

1369
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,293
Well,

1370
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:10,693
what am I here

1371
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:14,030
ever been bored with you? Well, you
don't have a choice. You live with me.

1372
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,320
If you're a boy,

1373
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,510
he's willing to look at me and said,
you need to wear a necklace today.

1374
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,193
Oh

1375
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,133
does this one to,

1376
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:32,700
one of the things we've talked about on
our show is I tell our listeners how you

1377
01:32:32,701 --> 01:32:35,540
gave me great advice on how to wipe you.

1378
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,170
Remember when I called you and I was like,

1379
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:42,240
I just keep wiping and you told me maybe
you're wiping too hard and you're going

1380
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,440
in, right? Yes, I do remember
that. And what'd you tell me?

1381
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,440
Do you need to wipe down,
wipe down,

1382
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:53,080
and also not push in,
right.

1383
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:55,620
Not to push in because it
just drives him more in, yeah.

1384
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,440
Yeah.
What is your profession

1385
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:08,110
you cut out to be discussing? No,

1386
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:13,200
I just hope this give you for,
I can just do this.

1387
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,840
Your daughter, your wife. Well for sure.

1388
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:22,130
Okay.
So now what happened?

1389
01:33:22,131 --> 01:33:27,110
Now if you wiped too hard, like I used
to get dingleberry's well not just that,

1390
01:33:27,111 --> 01:33:30,230
but you, you can be pushing into
your bottle. That's right. Right.

1391
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:33,260
And that's why it was always
brown, right time. Right, exactly.

1392
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,750
And then there was the booger incident,
which mom also was there for.

1393
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:41,590
Yeah, it was great. Yesterday. What?
What did you do in the elevator?

1394
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:47,030
Put a big booger on the
number one a button.

1395
01:33:47,031 --> 01:33:51,010
So this way I get spreading germs out of
my nose. All the residents of the hotel.

1396
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:54,230
Why would you do that? It's fun. It's fun.

1397
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:59,410
What's that?
What do think is disgusting?

1398
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,380
They been the same.
I'm recording it. Yeah.

1399
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,670
So do people know that your
father is absolutely disgusting?

1400
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:10,560
I don't think this is funny

1401
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:16,300
what it's. You know what he did right?
Did she? No. No, no. Don't tell her.

1402
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:19,940
Don't tell me
you said it.

1403
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,900
I didn't die when I cleaned it off.
I didn't quit.

1404
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,053
That's the funny.

1405
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:27,763
Have you ever,

1406
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,570
I don't see no one is called is a closet.

1407
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,880
Oh Man. I laughed so hard
at that. You liked that one.
Nobody. Yeah, that was great.

1408
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:41,920
That was good one.
Then you are disgusting diarrhea.

1409
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:46,680
And you know what I noticed where I
actually enjoy being discussing. He does.

1410
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:50,740
He does. And that's what
he, the story of nobody.

1411
01:34:50,741 --> 01:34:55,430
Everybody gets bored. He
messaged you. Yeah. He keeps
repeating until today. Yeah.

1412
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:58,220
And I keep reminding that I exist.
Yeah.

1413
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:03,500
The baby. Yes. Obvious I do too. Yeah.
They, he does enjoy being discussing.

1414
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:09,440
He does. When, when we were,
uh, we went to Maine together.
Oh, that was so much fun.

1415
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:12,590
He shit his pants there
and he told me the story.

1416
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,760
It's because he went in the handicap
stall and it was too far away.

1417
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:19,750
It was good. Yesterday. I didn't
make it and I was, you know,

1418
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,720
it was just ugly.
I had to go and you know,

1419
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:28,380
I misread the sign and the hotel. Yeah.
And they had to go down the stairs and I,

1420
01:35:28,381 --> 01:35:31,330
I was squeezing the cheeks
going down the stairs. Yeah.

1421
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:36,370
And then went into one of these
places, you know, where the, you know,

1422
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,520
you're rushing in,
but it's one of these handicap stalls.

1423
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,290
It's an extra five feet
before you get to the, yeah.

1424
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:46,450
And it's five feet too far.
Five feet too far.

1425
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,023
Okay.

1426
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:50,003
True Story.

1427
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,550
Can they live [inaudible] works
in a serious business. Yeah.

1428
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:58,330
He enjoys being in a party,
whatever this thing is called. Yeah.

1429
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:00,610
And talk about his files,

1430
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:04,720
shitting his pants. What
is newco thing? Elevator.

1431
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:09,150
It's like having a two year old.
Guess what I did.

1432
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:15,270
It's the most embarrassing thing possible
for an adult. Is your husband. Oh,

1433
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,650
I'm not sure for how long

1434
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:22,290
you think take getting that toilet for
$20,000. If he wants to know. Oh my God.

1435
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:26,070
All right. Well this is
really fun. Um, I think, uh,

1436

advertisements, okay. Oh,

that'll be fun. Okay. Buddy does in both.

1438
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,530
There's no force in those.
Okay. All right. I love you.

1439
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:39,973
Okay.

1440
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,283
Jeans

1441
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:41,453

1442
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,103
