1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
You're welcome.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,420
Well go to your mom's house. Just
seeing them come over later from Moose.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,660
Hey Hitlers and keep them high
and tight jeans or all the way up.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,990
You'll burn your wicked big dude. You
got to lose some more weight. Fuck,

5
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,210
you're doing good.
I am going on.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,560
Yeah.
Alright,

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,530
we're back guys.
We're back.

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,720
We just had to have our moose suit. That
was, uh, that was really terrifying.

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,790
I was really scared actually.
Let's see.

10
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,360
What do we do this whole time without our,

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,540
without our shit drops in
her. Yeah. I don't know what
to do, mother fucker. Right.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,130
Okay. Yeah. All right. That works.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,710
Make sure I go retarded. That
works. And we're back. All right.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,930
Welcome to alive.
Your mom's house and

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,480
press pause.

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,400
You're down here with all
the snowbirds and uh, Jews.

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,650
There's one and you
fucking Puerto Rican area.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,530
There's been so many Puerto
Ricans, Cubans, Cubans.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,810
Yeah. We couldn't go swimming today
though. Cause your water is contaminated.

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,420
Did you guys know that?
You know when you're putting me,

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,360
can you just Puerto Rican as well? This
is true. We went to the beach today. Yeah.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,600
And they, and we went to, uh, the
guy at the hotel and we're like,

23
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,980
can we get an umbrella? He's like, yeah,

24
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:45,840
but you just got to let you know you
can't get in the water. I was like,

25
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,840
why do you think we're going
to do here, man? And I go,

26
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:53,470
why can't we get in the water? And
he goes, this bacteria is real high.

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,430
And I go, is that common? He
goes up under a few years,

28
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:02,200
have never heard of it before. I
know. And I'm like, well, okay, great.

29
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:07,050
I swam in this yesterday. I'm
sure it's fine, right? Yes. Yeah.

30
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,900
Just it just got here, uh, from the ocean.

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,150
Yesterday was cool, but today
is all shitty and bad. You know,

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,230
I think we're going to be radioactive now.
Terrified. This will be our last show.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,110
Thank you,
Florida.

34
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,320
We flew here then know, but make
sure this is a all working though.

35
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,540
Hold on a second.
So just to make sure that,

36
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,403
okay.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,260
That worked dirty and
disgusting. Yeah, there we go.

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,370
There we go. Okay. And
what's Your Pronoun? Okay,

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,120
so there different levels. That's fine.
Open calling me, ma'am. Left and right.

40
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:54,050
I'm very offended just because they asked
him in, you're a woman. I'm sorry bro.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Oh,
cause you're an old woman.

42
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,620
Well I don't, nobody calls me Sir.
They're always like little boy. Yes.

43
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,340
When I'm like, it's so stupid.
I hate being called Ma'am.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,890
Someone called me madam
the other day and I really,

45
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:21,891
I liked it though cause I wasn't seven
11 buying hot Cheetos and he was like,

46
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,790
there you go madam. Or new words dude,

47
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:32,380
what is wrong and why
that is so offensive.

48
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,550
Why is it a it?
He was an idiot.

49
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,180
Thank you madam. Big words.
Yeah, it's a big word,

50
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,480
basically is a big word. And I
was so like, I felt super fancy,

51
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,620
you know, like okay. All right.
Shit. Cause you were a madam. Yeah.

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,030
You feel like a mistress,
like a farmhouse.

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,473
Yeah.

54
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,390
So many people have gone to far
mistress.com the site has crashed and and,

55
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:06,051
and they're sending messages to my
mother to be the fart mistress and she's

56
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,930
like, I'm not going to do it.
She's like, she's very upset,

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,480
but then she likes the flattery of the
messages. I tried to get it on Conan,

58
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,270
I did Conan a couple of weeks
ago and there were, you know,

59
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,160
they do a pre interview like
what are you want to talk about?

60
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,960
And you start telling them all.
And then I was like,

61
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,100
can we talk about foreign [inaudible]
dot com and his producer was like,

62
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:30,690
I'm listening like what is it
told him?

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,030
And he goes, he thought it was
hilarious. And then he goes,

64
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,060
I told Colin and then maybe
we'll get to it. And I was like,

65
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,890
are you fucking serious? And it goes, he,
he could go there and I go, all right.

66
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:44,800
And that was the whole time. I was just
anticipating him being like, tell me about

67
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,700
Fart, Mr Well Cook, can they,

68
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:51,700
they can say fart now on TBS,
right? Cause Yeah, you did the,

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,080
you know the network version, they won't
even let you no, no, no, no. Just farting.

70
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,590
No, no. But yeah, now
you can go full farts.

71
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,550
You can go all part or you are
waiting the whole time for him.

72
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,150
Like I was sitting there in the
chair, like, you got to do it.

73
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,800
And then he was like, yeah, we'll see
my guests at the fucking other place.

74
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,160
I was like, Oh okay. Yeah.
But I was really excited.

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,670
Do you, okay, so your mind is,

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,550
are we going to read her the emails
people have been sending a hundred

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,640
okay. Yeah. I'm excited. I
want to get her on video. Yeah,

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,750
we'll be at least at least video her
hearing them and maybe processing the

79
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:32,590
movement if you don't
know. We bought that,

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,130
we paid for the website fart mistress.com
yeah. And I told my mom like,

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,470
will you fart on this website?

82
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,510
And she was like 100% no. And I was
like what if we can get you money?

83
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,940
And she was like what kind of
money you're talking about?

84
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,320
And I told her like a couple
thousand dollars and she
goes, I'm not a prostitute.

85
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,240
And I go well what's your number?
And she goes 3000

86
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,980
well

87
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,240
cause you also position it like this
is your gambling money cause she really

88
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:07,220
likes, she loves damn ball hard cock
comes, you know in Fort Lauderdale,

89
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,070
Fort Lauderdale makes me laugh every time.
She loves the slots she plays,

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,710
the slots there. Play real.
It's like petty stuff, right?

91
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,510
Like it sucks. She's a fucking,
she's the cooler. Like she comes in,

92
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,340
the cooler is
when you walk in and they're like,

93
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:32,010
I wasn't going to lose. That's
the cooler right there. And,

94
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,460
but here's what she has advice for you.
So there's like,

95
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,330
it's the person measuring
the person that's like, I've
been divorced nine times,

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,440
giving you relationship advice like
that. You're like, but you suck at this.

97
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,910
And then she's like, I know, I know.
She's like, this machine doesn't pay.

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,240
Don't see it here. And I'm like, but if
you're saying it, it probably does pay.

99
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,830
So you know what's so interesting is
they put the water bucket next to me.

100
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,810
[inaudible]

101
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,930
it's like they knew that
I drink the most water.

102
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,110
That's some bullshit right
there. Yeah, take your time.

103
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,510
Yeah, you wanna you wanna
[inaudible] nipple for that.

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,600
Why are you putting the mic?
I want them to hear it.

105
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,730
They didn't hear that. But this is
bullshit that this doesn't dehydrate you.

106
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,450
Do you believe in that club?
If you think coffee doesn't dehydrate,

107
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:32,690
you psychos five Psychos,

108
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,720
but then I'm still thirsty when I
drink it. It doesn't do shit so hard.

109
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:42,320
Does not. Speaking of Shit,
since we've been here,

110
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,750
I just feel like you guys should
know that I haven't really been,

111
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:47,750
browning is much. I
know. Devastating News.

112
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,680
Yeah,
and I think part,

113
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:58,850
I think the problem is because we
don't have a bad day in the hotel.

114
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,870
We're staying.
It's disgusting affecting.

115
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,690
You're going to the bathroom
because my asshole is a gun shy.

116
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
It knows.

117
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,540
It knows that it can't relax and
release because there's no ample cleanup

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,910
provided. I have to
admit, it bums me out too.

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,920
We have bad days now in
three bathrooms at home.

120
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,070
I feel like was balling out of control.
You know,

121
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,610
you guys could get the tushy.
It's a reasonable one. It's
like 50 bucks sponsors.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,570
It's fucking, we bought
it. They should, but yeah,

123
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,150
they're fucking assholes for not
sponsored. It's like 70 bucks.

124
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,220
It's a firehose here,
but hose,

125
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,660
you got to really ease into turning it
off because you can get loose with it and

126
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,450
it's just like,
it hurts your eyes.

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,380
It'll hurt your tender. Sweet
little asshole. And it actually,

128
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,340
it actually opened

129
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,660
up my ass home when the
water shot in there.

130
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,120
It actually opened it a little
and we need more brown. Yeah,

131
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,700
come, I've had that too. It's true. It
does that cause you'll be like, I'm done.

132
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:11,780
I'm done. Yeah. And then you go,
wow. And then you're like woo, Woo.

133
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,240
Like it was like somebody
got in there. Yeah, it does.

134
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:17,580
Is that what it feels like?
What,

135
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,110
what feels like having someone
to go in your ass feels like

136
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,940
go in your ass? Like what their, hey,

137
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,350
that hasn't happened in a long time.
It has.

138
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,460
That is so nasty.
Ah,

139
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,023
yeah.

140
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,920
Siri say, be honest. They don't know.

141
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,160
But you did used to put your
fingers in my butt. I like, because

142
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,500
I feel like I'm alive. Show we
can, we can say a little more.

143
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,480
Okay. You know, this is
going to be downloading.

144
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,860
I don't know why I feel more.

145
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,590
I'm just married to a triple d s l u t

146
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,420
click last late. My uh, yeah.

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,170
Okay. Can I tell you that? Honestly,

148
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,660
since I had our kid though and since
two holes became one, you know,

149
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,350
had an episiotomy. Yeah. So I'm a little
nervous cause that whole is not as as uh,

150
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,830
taught if you will as it

151
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,133
yeah.

152
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,500
Because I haven't noticed anything really

153
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,810
might be home or my vision.
Oh you're a virgin is a fucking third.

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,650
That's a loose, yeah. No,

155
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,070
it has to be,
you're such a liar.

156
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,760
So you say that sear your sweet guy and
I appreciate it. I am not being nice.

157
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,050
I'm being honest. I mean it does.

158
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,130
I have to picture like I have to picture
like eight guys standing behind me just

159
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,470
to try to get in there.
Like I,

160
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,210
I pretend it's a competition and,

161
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,710
and they're like, yeah, Tom. Yeah.

162
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,060
Like do it up, hurry up.
And then I'm like, ah.

163
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,420
And then there's other guys
orderly way give it to everyone.

164
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,970
Like it's the gardeners and it's
the fucking what we have gardeners,

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,090
so how can I get it?

166
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,900
Shit for the Indian guy, which is
a real thing because we have Jose,

167
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:39,520
he comes by every fucking
Wednesday. We talking about like,

168
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,180
all right, what does that
mean, Dal? Like wave most.

169
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,283
I like that.

170
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,920
That's giver her eggs.
Give her eggs,

171
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,170
eggs.
This one's fine.

172
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,240
I don't know what the fuck he says
honestly. Is that Daddy Yankee?

173
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,500
I think it is. You wouldn't
know pit bull, Huh? POSTER

174
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,840
MR worldwide. Do you know that dude?
He's, he's ridiculous, right? Yeah,

175
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,300
they are.
He makes like 35 million

176
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,570
easy. Right? Just like giving way was out.

177
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,980
What does it mean? Seriously
way. But she's not saying,

178
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,593
I don't know.

179
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,483
What is he saying?

180
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,913
Give her,
come

181
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,670
get her.
Those give her that ball juice.

182
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,530
It's like fill me with your guests.
So Lena,

183
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,750
the same thing. Yeah, always
come with those guys. Huh?

184
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,690
Savages. Yeah. Guys like to come.
What are you going to do this?

185
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,201
Isn't that crazy?

186
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:21,970
That basically every decision a
guy makes it is connected to coming

187
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,740
for you? Not necessarily.
Let me mean for me.

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,330
These guys are that different.
But then,

189
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,980
but then when guys turn like 50
they become, you know, human like,

190
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,660
you know what I'm saying?
Like your dad,

191
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,690
it became sweeter and now like when
the need to come goes down a little,

192
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:46,420
like you guys start to care about
helping turtles across the street.

193
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,200
I think it doesn't happen at 50 I
think you got that wrong. Maybe like 68

194
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,320
that's when the testosterone starts to
like dial down and you turn it into women

195
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,050
and you become people. It's great.
I know I have an uncle who was like,

196
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,940
just started crying at 75

197
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,230
and I'm like crying and he's like,
it's a sweet moment.

198
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,900
Like you were a savage dude.
Do you,

199
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,380
do you think your dad still comes a lot?

200
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,840
Definitely. No, cause he's, he has,

201
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,930
he's friends with a lot of older, like
older than him and he's like, you know,

202
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,010
my buddy, whatever, he takes a pill,

203
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,980
my other buddy has to inject himself.
Yeah. But he's like, you know,

204
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:37,270
this guy's 81 this guys. And I go, oh
man. Like how about you? He like, ah, no,

205
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,020
not a problem about like still a
lot of lead in the pencil. Not even

206
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,870
your old man's doing fine. I'm like
that's enough. That's enough information.

207
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,150
Enough information about my dad's Dick.

208
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,960
So I remember when I saw
his balls on the cruise,

209
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,000
I still think about it. Yeah. In what way?

210
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,100
Like how just like I remember
him flipping his leg,

211
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,800
her and I was like what there it is

212
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,520
as I recall.
I recall.

213
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,680
Yeah, I remember that. Crazy. Pretty big.

214
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,710
They're low hangers though. Like you're
going to have nuts to hang low too.

215
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,930
I hope so.
I can only,

216
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,460
I can only dream about
having balls that are,

217
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,540
sometimes I think about that.
Honestly not to hit it again,

218
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,800
but I think about it on the toilet.

219
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,290
Cause sometimes you're like
thinking about toilet water.

220
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,140
That's real to your boss
touched the water yet. No, no.

221
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,100
I mean I have just regular balls. They're
not. No, they are. They're really,

222
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,410
they're good. I really like him. Come on.

223
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,470
I have all the balls and
I've touched a lot of balls.

224
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,080
Puerto Rico. Yeah. Well,
what were they like?

225
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,930
Bad Ball am I mean look, one woman's
bad ball is another woman's treasure.

226
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:09,764
I don't know.

227
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,460
Okay.

228
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,910
Right. Different strokes.
Everyone's the same. So maybe

229
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,500
personally, here's my, I just
don't, I like him high and
tight. I do. I like, Oh yeah,

230
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,270
like yours are nice and high and tight.

231
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,960
I've had balls that are just
all skin like you're like too,

232
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:31,910
so they're too big and there's not,
there's nothing in them. It's just,

233
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,590
I've never,
I've been blowing old guy again.

234
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,340
No, they're, they're young guys at that
huge nuts, but I usually usually it,

235
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,580
the interesting thing Tom really thought
provoking that the bigger the balls,

236
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,120
I found that the shorter
and fatter the wiener,

237
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,810
like it would be like a coke can or the
balls. Yeah, there were shorts down.

238
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,300
Did it affect the loads they busted?
No,

239
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,340
I'm saying where the big
balls when you're like, Jesus,

240
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,070
this thing doesn't turn
off. Where is it? Like that.

241
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,313
Okay.

242
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,890
No, I mean, what was it like that no,

243
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,770
really hoppy on? Do you want
to know? Is that the most

244
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,283
I have the most,

245
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,010
a lot of loan.

246
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,640
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

247
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,920
I will check off with any of you guys.
I'm serious.

248
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:40,260
This is gross, but I'm going
to do it any cause, whatever.

249
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,750
I mean from high school I had high school,
college girls are always like, Jesus,

250
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,130
what is up with all this jazz man. I
know. And I actually asked the doctor

251
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,520
about it once cause you know you have
like men have con like I could like it's

252
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:57,210
like a contraction, right? Like yeah, I
had, so I went to the doctor, I was like,

253
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,740
I was uh, I don't like 18, 19. I was like,
look man, I'm busting these huge ass nut.

254
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,600
Is that normal? And he was like,
what kind of con that's like,

255
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,880
so I described it to them in detail and he
was like, no, it's not normal. And then,

256
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,200
yeah, well he goes, it's,
it's, it's, it's a, you know,
high, much higher than average.

257
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:21,890
But he goes, yeah, just consider
yourself lucky. He's, he said it though,

258
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,230
he said it like I've been trying
to come like that for years.

259
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,060
I dedicated my life to this and you just
get it naturally. And I was like, yeah,

260
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,030
that's fascinating. I know. I wonder if
I'll and want to get into the details.

261
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,160
What do, do you think you have
more swimmers than most? No. No,

262
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,820
I don't think it has anything to do with
that. Just the amount of fluid around.

263
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:46,380
Yeah. I just have a great prostate. Wow.

264
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,370
I go rob.
Rob.

265
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,783
Wow.

266
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,540
Yeah, he been, did you sharpen your
knife today? Uh, you should know.

267
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,700
You did take a long shower. It
was really long. Yeah, I did.

268
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,090
Rough Rah Rah guys.
The grossest

269
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,610
he's soap nest. You know it's all
right. I'll get to it. Let's do this.

270
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,850
I have a proper show.
Open clip,

271
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,480
so we'll play that and then we'll get back
to this in a second. Okay. Here we go.

272
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:20,840
Forward an issues. Here we go with the
important issues of, of, of our show.

273
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,850
Here we go.

274
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,840
What I'm thinking for Marlene,
this is Mike, which is scrub kip.

275
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,790
Be Stuck in an elevator fixed. It's
not. That was on the phone earlier.

276
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,790
16 [inaudible] out.

277
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,343
Oh Shit.

278
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,520
Don't bring in one month into this.

279
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,510
Well,
go to your mom's house,

280
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,603
Christina.

281
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,920
There it is,
right.

282
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,710
We are live and breath
balls, beach, Florida.

283
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,880
That um,
so that guy was pretty pissed off.

284
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,290
He's talking to an elevator
manufacturing rep on the phone.

285
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,750
I guess his elevator didn't get
fixed when he wanted it to, so he did

286
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,693
just

287
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,450
talking out my Beta fish.

288
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,710
Did he say the slut?
I didn't know that.

289
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,170
Nobody ever says that. Like get that
fucking slut that I was talking to.

290
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,110
That's so crazy. It's a tough call over
the phone to now she's a slide doesn't,

291
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,760
but it's a, it's a good way to provoke.
See what happens. Just spoke a little bit.

292
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,170
Is that slut still there? And
then they're like, excuse me.

293
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,920
Nobody likes that. How
can call it the, I mean,

294
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:42,920
I guess your elevator not being fixed
does piss you off. But this level,

295
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,783
this level,

296
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,950
okay. I'm sorry I have
to deal with people.

297
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,000
It's the worst elevator on the world.

298
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm going to come in and rev
it up your fucking noses.

299
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,630
Get him here now.

300
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,350
Jesus Christ.
I,

301
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,580
you know what I stands out to me the most
about that is that he will shove it up.

302
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:08,581
Your noses like to be that angry
and the natural inclination to be,

303
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:10,240
I'll shove up your fucking ass.
And he was like,

304
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,350
stuff that fucking elevator up your nose.

305
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,470
It's almost like he pulled his anger in
for a moment. He didn't want to go blue.

306
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,790
He was like that's too far.

307
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,500
But it probably would hurt more
in your nose then your ass. Right.

308
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:30,140
What do you think it would hurt to have
an elevator shoved in any orifice so

309
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:34,300
that you have but yeah, your
nose. You definitely die for sure.

310
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,010
If I put an elevator up your
nose. Yeah. That hurts so much.

311
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,580
You know I keep thinking about
the animal lady this week.

312
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,930
Like some clips stick to me.

313
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,120
I keep thinking about how Lawrence rain.

314
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,660
Is that her name? Yeah. Oh I can show

315
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,000
cause it would absorb the
toxins like you would die.

316
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,540
And what really stood out to me about
her just laid, it gave herself a year,

317
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:08,620
an enema. Was that?
Yeah, let me bring it up.

318
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,090
Yeah. You know what I'm saying?
Here we go. Fucking sad.

319
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,493
Lawrence.

320
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Today I'm going to do a urine for
the first time for the first time.

321
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,360
And you should see like,
she's like,

322
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,850
like I'm going to see my
dad for the first time.

323
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,610
She's so tough attached that
she's committing to this.

324
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,720
She's so skinny today.
During the day I have collected

325
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,100
this much.
I just

326
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,810
poured one court and to my
animal bucket right above me.

327
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,280
You pissed in a bucket is what you're
saying and you're going to put it in yet.

328
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,180
What happens to you
that you get that nutty?

329
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,200
Like how does that switch flip where
you're like, no, this is healthy.

330
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:05,790
She's a conspiracy theorist for
sure. Yeah. Yeah, she is. Cause I,

331
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,990
I remember one of my, uh, down here,
I went to high school in Vero beach.

332
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,940
If you don't know if I run
around here and what am I

333
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,710
friends' moms was like,
you can't trust doctors.

334
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,110
Like they'll, they'll fuck
with you. I'm like, okay.

335
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,710
And like when you're sick too,
you know, what should I be like,

336
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,420
I'm going to the doctor.
She was like, that's stupid.

337
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:29,510
Only an idiot would go to the doctor
and then she had all these

338
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,440
is alternative therapies,
which I'm sure like,

339
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm not saying that there's no alternative
therapy that has, you know, value,

340
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,470
but if you,

341
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:41,430
if you keep embracing that
only alternative works,

342
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,950
then you end up putting your own pissing

343
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,130
it gives you are going to
die. Yeah, because who was
it? Who Was it? Who's dead?

344
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:52,430
The computer guy. Yeah. He
was alternative therapy.

345
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,570
He had pancreatic cancer,
which is aggressive to begin with,

346
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,020
is not high

347
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,000
chance of beating it. And they found
it early and so they were like,

348
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,950
we're going to take it out. And he
was like, I'm going to eat fruit.

349
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,123
And they're like,
yeah.

350
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,900
Right. What? He's like, I
fucking made these things.

351
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:15,850
I'm eating fruit. All right. I'm gonna
end. The doctor's like, all right.

352
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,520
He did make the shit that we're typing on.
So,

353
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,920
and then a few months later he was
like, oh, I fucked up. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,310
That is the equivalent of like, I'm
going to get myself. You're an animal.

355
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,940
You're right. Gert. And it'll,
that's what happens. This lady

356
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,760
100% if they were like, you have a brain
tumor, we need to operate, she'd be like,

357
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm going to juggle this week.

358
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,670
And they do see what happens.

359
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,100
Okay.

360
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,100
So I'm laying on my left side and I'm
just about to insert the hustle right now

361
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,530
during this process.

362
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,380
Okay.
She is so emotional about this.

363
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,533
Like she was like,

364
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,520
which I understand like again,
you're

365
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,110
putting your own piss and
shit is crazy crazy to me.

366
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,590
I love creating and allow the
urine to enter my colon. Oh,

367
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,510
I'm going to try to hold
it for about five minutes.

368
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,700
Girl,
you nasty as hell.

369
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,870
Now she's, her face is
in so much pain. Ooh,

370
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,680
Ooh.
Hey Marty noticing.

371
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,110
Okay. Yeah. What are you noticing?

372
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,920
So fucking crazy.
New leg again.

373
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,763
Okay.

374
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,780
I'm having a little bit
of leakage and I don't

375
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,860
just a little bit. I wonder if
he would have that, you know,

376
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,280
if you'd have that league.

377
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,320
I just, I don't know how people have
stuff on their butts so easily. I mean,

378
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,920
are you getting used to it?
You get used to it. You gotta

379
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,340
just some of our, I mean, I'm sure
there's people in the audience like this.

380
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:29,230
Some of our friends are like,
oh yeah, like, you know,

381
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,550
we bought fuck pretty
regular. And I'm like, what

382
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,690
maybe were the square's Tom,
you know what I mean?

383
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,710
Maybe we should be giving ourselves p
animas and fingering are two different

384
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:45,400
things though. Right? But fucking
regularly and giving yourself a piano bar,

385
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,000
but all you have to,
I mean,

386
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:52,220
shouldn't you give yourself an enema
before you have bud Saks? Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,950
Or a strong performers do that.
It's a very strong performance

388
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,950
as a courtesy, I'm assuming. I
think it's a courtesy to yourself,

389
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,700
man. Makes it easier as
wild. Cool. One more time.

390
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,030
Whoa.
Oh.

391
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,160
Oh.
This purple vision.

392
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,920
She's tripping out

393
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,890
purple vision toxins in her bloodstream.
Crazy.

394
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:33,660
10,000 more people coming together

395
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,290
and support support me.

396
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,330
It sounds like Trump at a Trump
rally or something. Right?

397
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:49,140
Like maybe that's why he has
such a big ego. He's like,

398
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm putting pissing my ass every night.

399
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,390
People love me. I can't say I
can't help it. Facebook live of it.

400
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,410
Yeah. And support. God, I can't watch me.

401
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,630
See she's saying her own name now.
Lauren. That's what's going on.

402
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,130
Who Sell Marketing the clamp again?
Oh boy.

403
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,490
Wow. Close the, Oh my goodness.

404
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,260
I almost want to cry. So do, I

405
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,010
don't want to watch and do this.
It's tough.

406
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,120
I can't do it anymore.

407
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,170
And my botox reason region,

408
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,510
it might just be because the,

409
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,600
the urine is a little bit called that.

410
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,730
That's not the only reason you're feeling
that way. Let's move right along Tom.

411
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,830
Yeah. Interesting enough. Okay.

412
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,240
You brought her up or I feel bad.
She's crazier.

413
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,900
Crazier than catch it. Okay. So what
I learned about you on this trip,

414
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,180
it's very interesting.
After 12 years of knowing you,

415
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:05,740
I feel like I know almost
everything now you are anorexic,

416
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,960
you can use,
I can use either hand.

417
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,533
And,

418
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,773
and

419
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,220
what's neat about that talent is that
sometimes I notice you sign with your left

420
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:24,320
and it looks all retarded.
Like you'll be all, wait, what?

421
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,520
He looks stupid when you do it.
But it's cute. Like you saw it,

422
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,990
it looked stupid because it's not right.

423
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:33,010
Like you shouldn't just like
when you sign your name,

424
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,000
but it got me to thinking what do
you do with either hand, which,

425
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,520
which hand do you wipe with?
Cause I'm not with you at those times.

426
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,290
Very thought provoking. I mean all
the things it's like, it's automatic.

427
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,530
Like I'm just good at
everything but I do it

428
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,250
like the hand chooses like through
the anorexia chooses itself.

429
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,730
So I write lefthanded and it looks stupid.

430
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,660
I brushed my teeth lefthanded
eat with a fork left,

431
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,510
I throw a ball right handed,
didn't notice that. And I,

432
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:20,610
I prefer to jerk it right handed.
I can do it with the other hand.

433
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:21,980
Okay.

434
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,670
But I prefer especially to finish
with the right hand, you know,

435
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:29,300
there's just like, there's
just, I know how to,

436
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,530
yeah

437
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:36,510
though that your, your subtle moves
and especially for like that finishing,

438
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,000
you know what I mean? Rounding
third, I like to go back to them.

439
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,060
Like I can go left, left, left wing
up and then it goes to the right hand,

440
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:46,200
you know? So I do that and I
definitely wipe right handed.

441
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,540
Yeah. Interesting. I think higher
skill level things are right handed.

442
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,120
Wait a minute,
but you write with your left.

443
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:59,460
That's quite possibly the highest skill.

444
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,210
Yeah.

445
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:06,440
Throw a football man right handed.
Okay. Yeah. Interesting. In baseball,

446
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,680
I shoot right handed.
Yeah. Golf, right handed.

447
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,670
Not that I do that regularly.
But you're not a golfer.

448
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,960
I didn't know all this about
you. These are all new things.
Yeah, I didn't know it.

449
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,010
I like learning.
We should go out to dinner sometime.

450
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,820
Tell you a bunch of stuff if you want to,
if you want to find out.

451
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,470
I've also been watching you do
everything right handed everything.

452
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,660
I have known you. This is
useless. Why don't you donate it?

453
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,750
Why don't you give away?
Even when I do polities and stuff,

454
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,250
the left side is terrible.
It's wonky. It's weaker.

455
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm totally right dominant,
you know? Yes. This talent,

456
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,960
it's just being strong and stuff.

457
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,910
Okay. But back to you. So

458
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,790
notice this week we spent a lot of time
together. We've been on vacation here. Uh,

459
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,800
you really savor your body functions
like more than anybody I know.

460
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:01,390
Like you'll sneeze,

461
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,750
like you do this annoying thing where
you sneeze like three times in a row.

462
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,330
Like it's clearly for attention.
But yeah,

463
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,243
third time

464
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,180
you have to look at the light
to get it out. That's the worst.

465
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,000
I always look for the light.
Oh yeah.

466
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,450
And if you say bless you before I sneeze,
I'll knock you the fuck.

467
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,453
Yeah,

468
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,170
because it will fuck with me.

469
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,230
It makes me so upset when you're like on
the edge like hot and someone was like

470
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:39,040
bless you, bye. Fuck you. Fuck
you. I don't know. It goes away.

471
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,890
Yeah. Cause you need, you need total
focus. Like when I see you doing your,

472
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,430
that doesn't,
I don't feel like that's what I look like.

473
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,860
I have to stop and let you dig your
retarded face and then you sneezing threes

474
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,760
and then after it you'll be like,
oh that was such good snakes.

475
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,270
I like how it feels.
Don't you like that feeling now?

476
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,030
It's a little, it's a little pleasure.
It's not like, I'm not saying it's a myth.

477
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,340
If you have like a like three or more in
a row and you have that momentary buzz

478
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,950
from it, you're like, whoa. It feels good.

479
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,010
I like it like that.
You'll be like,

480
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,010
that was a good cough or that was a
good shit or that was such a good shit.

481
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,610
Like I don't really enjoy shooting.
I just like,

482
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,830
and I'm like, Oh God, I feel
so fucking good right now.

483
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,900
And she's like this golf
thing. Like I'll, I'll

484
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,980
cue tips. Look like someone
dip them in orange paint.

485
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,050
Okay.

486
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,550
Jesus Christ. Yeah, we got a
lot of waxes. Hereditary. Yeah,

487
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,590
that's what my dad told me. I know.
It was like, I was like, oh dude,

488
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:03,090
I had a lot of wax. He's
like, yes. Genetic, like all
excited. I'm like, couldn't,

489
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:06,630
it couldn't be a vertical leap
ahead to be fucking ear wax. Sweet.

490
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,550
It's just really cool jeans.
You got that down.

491
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah, but you do like them more
than anyone else. It's true.

492
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,190
All right. Do you want to go back to this
or no, this isn't, what's the, was this?

493
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,830
No, he don't like that.
Next to the better guy.

494
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,120
All right. We're done with
elevator guy. The fucking lady

495
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,980
ended it. So Christina, it says, I was
listening to episode Oh nine this morning.

496
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,040
No, was an audio issue. Uh,

497
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:46,130
three 36 in awful sound filled
my headphones and it's you,

498
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,450
you sneezing. It says, let's see.

499
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,960
[inaudible]

500
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:09,010
you have the fucking
balls to talk about my

501
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,390
the fuck man.

502
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,970
But that was so charming.
It was like a little like a little dose.

503
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,960
That's hideous.

504
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,250
Maybe that's why I don't enjoy them.

505
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:39,150
Oh Man. I'm going to set it affected me
emotionally and still have not recovered.

506
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,620
Also also at 1508,

507
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:51,621
there was a sound of what I think was it
touched individual attempting to sing.

508
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,130
It was deeply disturbing and hope it
was just an equipment issue that can be

509
00:36:56,131 --> 00:37:00,810
fixed. And then it says, click
here to hear it. Here's this one.

510
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,323
Yeah.

511
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,083
Okay.

512
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,943
Yeah.

513
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,273
Wow.

514
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,970
By the way, that's called a
perfect impression. I don't know.

515
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,390
Yeah. I'm a huge DNR fan, guys.

516
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,333
Okay.

517
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,230
Ah, you can't take your
headphones off now, can you?

518
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,073
Yeah.

519
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,590
You are fucked now. You guys
are all rotten. All of you.

520
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,830
You're terrible. You're the
worst. Don't do it again. So No,

521
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:05,790
don't do it again. Don't do it again.
No, don't do boring things. Okay. Okay.

522
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,270
All right guys. Let's get to some
why a major business. First of all,

523
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,530
we know a lot of people been writing in
about this very important debate that's

524
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:18,660
been raging on in the your
mom's house community,

525
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,050
and that is whether or not
shit's pushed the fart out.

526
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,073
Wow.

527
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,220
Yeah. Very divisive. Finally,

528
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,710
someone is addressing,

529
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,770
so

530
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,970
this came in from Zachary? Yeah. Hey,
Hitler's. I've been thinking about Europe.

531
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,800
I know.
It's so funny.

532
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,850
God dammit.
Hitler's every,

533
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,610
every one of them starts
hailing. Okay. Hang on. Learners.

534
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,600
I'd been thinking about your far
and shit situation. Any rights.

535
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,400
Honestly,
I'm deeply offended.

536
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,560
Who are we to apply socially
constructed roles to shits and farts.

537
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,470
Maybe some farts push out shits
and some shits. Bush out farts.

538
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,040
You excrement. Normative.
Binary Standard. Yeah.

539
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,180
Should be cast aside and we should just
accept that. Farts and shits are fluid.

540
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,630
Anyway,
I hope.

541
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,660
I hope you can get rid of yours says
normative constructs and see the light.

542
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:36,760
Keep it high and tight. Thank
you Zach. Well, thank you. Wow.

543
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,750
That's a really
good stuff.

544
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,990
Yeah. Well that's really
interesting. Well,

545
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,020
did you want to read something,
Tommy? Yeah. Which one? The
next one. Well, no. Yeah,

546
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,420
on this topic I'm saying, well, a

547
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,750
good job. Young Jedi.
That was, that was great.

548
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,250
I mean, no, once a listener
brought it to my attention,

549
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,900
I was totally blown away.
Yeah. You had me believing far.

550
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,020
It's supposed to shit out for years.
That's what my mother taught me.

551
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,760
That's not true because they're
taught me if farts push the shit out.

552
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,440
Yeah.
When shit was done,

553
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,180
there'd be so many parts after it a
shit out when shit was out there before.

554
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:27,680
It's not necessarily so Tom
Shit's Bush the farts out. Right.

555
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:30,350
So then there should be four. It's at the
end of the shit is what you're saying.

556
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,540
If our sports the shit out,
but we're going the other way on it.

557
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,020
You want to even understand this.
This is high level stuff.

558
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,740
Philosophically speaking. Well, I had an,
I had an epiphany on this very topic, uh,

559
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,950
as we've been spending
time here in Palm Beach,

560
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,190
is that I farted the other day and I
kept farting and farting and farting and

561
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,950
farting with no shit. Okay.
And I thought to myself,

562
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,340
I thought to myself,

563
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,990
can't we have farts for
the sake of having them?

564
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,890
Why? Oh yeah.

565
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,330
Why must all farts have
purpose or utility? Oh,

566
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,730
he wouldn't really philosophical.
Thank you. Yeah. I mean,

567
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:19,960
it's like this capitalistic notion that
everything has to have a fucking utility

568
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,590
attached to it. You really did. What a
farts or just refer to sake, like art

569
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,810
first static enjoyment.
There's no usefulness to them.

570
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,720
Yeah. You're opening my whole mind up
again and again. Really interesting stuff.

571
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,780
I thought it was super
deep, Bro. Thanks guys.

572
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,140
Um, here's a, a thought
provoker it's also fowl.

573
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,560
Uh, it says sub cane. I was sitting in bed

574
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,040
after a night at the bars and
my girlfriend was vomiting
in the bathroom right

575
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:57,520
next to my bedroom after one
too many adult beverages. Nope.

576
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,580
That's when something amazing happened
at the same moment while she barfed it

577
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:06,910
made a sound. Only Chris Jeans
I could love. She farted,

578
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,430
which raises the question,

579
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,010
what do you call it when you
puke and Fart at the same time?

580
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,380
Keep it high and tight and Paulien
by sincerely hot cocoa. Whoa.

581
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,393
Hmm.

582
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,920
What? Do you have a name for
that? No, that is a thought.

583
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:25,670
Provoker then you can fart,
puke and Fart.

584
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,380
I feel like those two go hand in hand
because you can't have food poisoning.

585
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah. And if you barf and
Fart, it could be a bart.

586
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,670
I guess I would just call it a
Bert and leave it at that. Yeah,

587
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,570
yeah. Well done, Tom.

588
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,680
Yeah.
Yeah,

589
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,260
you're right. Let's leave it at
that. Yeah. Here's another thought.

590
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,580
Provoker that came in. I really like
this one. Okay. Are you ready? You guys,

591
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:52,210
this is from Gerald. Uh, he writes,

592
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,520
can retarded people vote?

593
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:01,810
Whoa.
That's such a good question.

594
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,890
It's mean,

595
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,070
and you go like, come on. But then
like a few seconds later, you're like,

596
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,140
that's a good question.

597
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,800
Like, right, right, right.

598
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,900
The answer's yes. Wait, how do you know?

599
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,930
Wait, wait, what about
retiring people voting?

600
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,340
He was voting. Yeah, cause they
can't be like, dude, not you.

601
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,510
Thank you. Can you go to vote? And
they're like, no, no, no, no, no,

602
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:42,070
no, no. You're like, I can't. No,

603
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,633
that's true.

604
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,650
Someone helped him sign. Well now wait
a minute, that's a physical disability.

605
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:56,230
But he was mentally disabled
as well. Okay. Yeah. But
what if he's like, you know,

606
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,633
you know.

607
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,710
Okay.

608
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,380
Like what have you seen
when you were like, this guy
doesn't know what day it is.

609
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:03,214
You know,
like

610
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,100
I'm serious.
Like can that guy,

611
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,740
he cannot, how do you
know this though? What?

612
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,363
Oh,

613
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,483
you retarded.

614
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,330
Interesting. And uh, I wonder, I
wonder, couldn't can retard it.

615
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:31,160
They can drive clearly can.

616
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,940
Yes they can. We learned that as long
as you can pass the driving test,

617
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,100
you can show up fucking drooling and
no, it's true. And if you pass the test,

618
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,390
they were like, you passed the test
like, but I'm saying for voting,

619
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,130
it's your, it's your constitutional
right. You're 18. That's true. American.

620
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,810
That's the only two prerequisites.

621
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:54,960
I think you would have to be
just beyond like they literally,

622
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:59,890
they would have to be like, no,
you know, like he was like, ah,

623
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,800
like if you can't find your
way in the booth, then baby,

624
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:08,580
they can go like you definitely camp.
Oh, but so wild. If you're like,

625
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,230
I like orange.

626
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,870
What?
What?

627
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,400
That's not crazy.
I'm an actor.

628
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,250
I'm so offended. Blah,
blah, blah, blah. Says,

629
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,990
okay, do top dogs. I'd go retarded.
Oh yeah. That's my favorite.

630
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,410
Where is that? Oh yeah. I
go retarded. I go retarded.

631
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,660
Yeah, I got retarded. Yeah,
it's the best. All right. As I

632
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,560
read this one, this is another thought.
Provoker. Let's see this one. Yeah.

633
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:55,250
Okay. Hi Hillary. God Damn it.
They're all, it's a lot. It's a lot.

634
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,810
Do you guys think deaf people are more
grossed out by Farge than non deaf people?

635
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,680
That's a good question though.
I look at it like this.

636
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,920
There are other senses are
heightened just like blind people,

637
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:15,140
including the smells, but add into the
mix. They can't hear them. A silent,

638
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:19,340
but deadly is always worse because
it sneaks up on you. Basically.

639
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:21,920
Their whole life is nothing but silent.
But then

640
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,050
that's from Kevin. Kevin,
you're a Goddamn road scholar.

641
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,690
And that is true because
every time someone could,

642
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:38,640
it could be like super loud and you'd
be like, what the fuck man? Yeah.

643
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,490
Well they just kick you. It's the
warning so you can brace. Right.

644
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,320
So when you know the expectation is met,
then you know that's true. Yeah. You're,

645
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:50,630
you're, you're, you're, it's always a
surprise. Yeah. Let's talk about death. So

646
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Jerry Lewis died. Yes. He was, uh, uh,

647
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,850
Christina's. Yeah. Not a fan.

648
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,570
He was,
while

649
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,720
speaking of retarded, that was
his whole thing. That is true.

650
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,190
His whole thing was acting
retarded. Um, funny,

651
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:16,840
retarded big teeth and the
big glasses. Yeah. Yeah. He,

652
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,930
he basically locked down
retarded. Um, I mean, that is,

653
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:22,764
that is,

654
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,760
ah,

655
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,080
that's Jerry Lewis.
If you didn't,

656
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,000
and he died and they did this thing,
the Hollywood reporter,

657
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,630
which is, it's really big in,
in La that the trades, right?

658
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:41,290
Like the industry news and Hollywood
reporter is definitely one of the biggest,

659
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,180
they did a special interview where they
were interviewing people that are still

660
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:51,181
working in Hollywood over 90 years
old and cause this just to be like,

661
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,140
well that's what they wanted to know.
They're like,

662
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:56,130
why are you doing stop and just relax.

663
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,080
But I mean they were also celebrating
them, you know, they're like,

664
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:04,081
you're old as fuck and you're still
entertaining people and it's pretty,

665
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,960
you know, it was probably a, it's a cool
thing. The Hollywood reporter calls you,

666
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,170
you work in Hollywood, it's a
big deal. They go to his house,

667
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,940
he allows them into his house.

668
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:17,920
They set up for eight an interview that's
going to be in print but also it to

669
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:18,940
air online.

670
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:24,180
And he was such a deck and it's,

671
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,180
it's Kinda hilarious. But like
he just was like, it's like,

672
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,200
why would you even say yes to the
interview? That's a thing is that he had,

673
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,940
he was a notorious, they don't
just show up. They weren't like,

674
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:35,710
you want to do an interview
now, you know? No.

675
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,340
And he had a bad reputation for being
really grumpy towards the end of his life.

676
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,070
Yeah. This is pretty
funny. This is pretty,

677
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,570
we're doing a feature on people who
are still working in their nineties.

678
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,210
Have you ever thought about retiring?
Why

679
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,670
was there never a moment that you
thought it might be time to retire or you

680
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,040
would want? Why? Yeah,

681
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,580
so that the management being the
interview, I'd be like, Oh my God,

682
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,960
you come from,
you come from a generation,

683
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,430
a little older and I think of Bob Hope.
George Burns.

684
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,880
I liked it. He tells a 91 year old guy.
You come from a generation a little older.

685
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,343
Yeah, no shit. Huh?

686
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,640
People you knew, many of whom
didn't want to, uh, were,

687
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,390
are never retired either. Um, do you
see similarities with them? None.

688
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,373
None.

689
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,500
What do you think drives people like
you and to want to keep working?

690
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,290
Cause we do it well.

691
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:42,050
Shit. Wait, this is even better.
This, this is great. Hold on. Hold on.

692
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,080
What's different about performing
now for you than say 20 years ago?

693
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:49,150
How has it,
how is it different for you?

694
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,810
What an inspiring interview,
Huh? Hey, here's another lab.

695
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,980
Have you made any, do you, how do you
keep the material fresh sessions to be,

696
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,000
you know, older and you're in,
you're performing or does it?

697
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:11,600
How do you keep the material fresh
for yourself by working at it?

698
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,680
So then if you're this guy, you're
like, oh my God. So then he goes like,

699
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,530
cause you're out. You're basically
willing him to just talk more,

700
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:22,210
not give you one word answer.
So he's like,

701
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,110
well here's one I know factually you'll
have to give me a different answer.

702
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,190
He's asked, he's gas. How is

703
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,750
Vegas different now than when
you started working there?

704
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,930
50 plus years ago, right?
1 million. Which is

705
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,550
Vegas different. Totally different.
You then when you first came here,

706
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:44,470
what was the first time you you
performed at Vegas? 1947 sorry,

707
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:49,010
seven times. What? What face? She's
like when you first showed up. It's not,

708
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,050
it's the same.

709
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,310
Exactly the same.
Exactly the same.

710
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,790
It's totally that.
There were two hotels.

711
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,480
You Lying Dick,
he,

712
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:05,970
he's so dismissive.

713
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:09,090
Why do the interview if you're
not even going to answer the guy?

714
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,070
It's so weird.

715
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,280
Well, it looks like, is it about being, I
wish she could see that. What is it about,

716
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,540
how would you describe the place?

717
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,050
It doesn't need to be
sharp in 1947 what was it?

718
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,370
I wasn't a little bit of a dusty
cow town. It was, what was it?

719
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,650
What was it like Dustin cow town.

720
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,770
Well, thanks for the
interview, Jerry. Yeah.

721
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,170
Here's the super cut of his answer.
Why?

722
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,520
Why none?
Cause we do it well is not at all.

723
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,480
Why working at it? Anyone
that's $90. No, no.

724
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,480
1947 it's not,
it's the same.

725
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,450
Exactly the same Dustin cow town. No, no,

726
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,160
you asshole total. I have to admit, I
think that's the funniest shit he's ever.

727
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:09,880
Absolutely.

728
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,350
I feel like at 91 I would give
the same interview, you know?

729
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,670
Well that's the thing is once your
face starts melting off of your skull,

730
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,140
you know what I mean?
Like you,

731
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:23,730
that's when you go behind closed doors
and just retire. Yeah. You know, just,

732
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,340
just give it up. Your Ego and the guy
is such a fucking egocentric. Yeah.

733
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:33,170
Torturing people with your existence.
At that point. You know what I mean?

734
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:38,140
Just go away and die like the
rest of us. Oh my God. Sorry.

735
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,400
Is that too dark?
It's too old.

736
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:47,430
How do you know where blue jeans
came from? You know about this?

737
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,800
During the 1950s young America discovered
blue jeans and the industry exploded

738
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,610
in the United States.

739
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,840
It's a hidden appeal club.

740
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,480
I had you looking over here.
Boom.

741
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,963
Okay.

742
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,580
Do you know
the fucking hurt?

743
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,700
That was mean.
That really hurt actually.

744
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:28,860
You're the Jerry Lewis.
That was a dry heave.

745
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,360
God, you're terrible. All
right. Here's another thought.

746
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,680
Provoker so there's no more barf clubs.

747
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,780
When food goes right through you,

748
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:45,290
is it the meal you just ate or
a prior one being pushed out?

749
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:51,090
Good question. I don't see how it could
be the meal you just ate. It can't be,

750
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,180
but it feels like it does,

751
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,250
but maybe it's pushing the bad food out
that you had earlier and that's what's

752
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:02,100
cleaning you out, right? The
Prius, the meal that was,

753
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,280
I mean,
you're getting into medical stuff now.

754
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,220
It's making space.
Wow.

755
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,090
That's what it is.
Yesterdays

756
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,050
stomach's like fucking get out of here.

757
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,560
You also knew the retarded question town.

758
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,680
If I can an expert of West Palm Beach.
Huh?

759
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,460
Do you want to do a master of accents?
Yeah,

760
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:40,030
yeah, yeah. Totally. Okay,
so this came in. Let's see
what this is here. This is a,

761
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,810
I have like a fucking God damn nat.
Alright,

762
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,860
so this is Scottish.
Woof Blatz a toughie.

763
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,040
This couple is on the Jeremy Kyle show
confronting each other about cheating.

764
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,490
Oh, all right. Let's see if
you guys can figure out what's

765
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,593
yeah,

766
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,090
that was English.
Just so you know.

767
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,640
No,
I heard

768
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,810
it's not,
I know what you thought it was.

769
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,380
Good n word. No, no, no, no. It
sounds like it. I heard big words too.

770
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:44,810
I heard you know what? Yeah.
And she said it's clear.

771
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,520
She said it's clear.

772
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,763
Yeah,

773
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,380
it was clear something

774
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,850
obviously she said
obviously. Oh honestly, okay.

775
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,560
Fucking show offs and then,
and then

776
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:10,903
mine I think.

777
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:12,850
Okay.

778
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:17,850
So let's go back to the one where
everyone thought they heard something.

779
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,350
Cause I have, I have the clip here.
Okay. You have a, exactly. Okay.

780
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:24,040
Let's hear it one more

781
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,150
time and then, okay, here
we go. Okay, here we go.

782
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,350
And Go ahead.

783
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,200
Losses.
That's good.

784
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,390
Blank or conversation.

785
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,053
Okay,

786
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,860
good. So that by the way, that the
beginning is, she's saying you did.

787
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,610
She's saying you did.
That's how heavy the Scottish accidents.

788
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,260
That's you did.
And then,

789
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,620
Oh man,
good.

790
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,970
She's saying the n word conversation.
So now you're going to say,

791
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,030
see when you finally get
the balls to admit it,

792
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,420
you're going to say one or two lassies.
That's what the whole thing.

793
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,770
That's what she says. I
swear to you. Yes it is.

794
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:26,640
She's racist.

795
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,610
Two losses. I heard. That's what she says.

796
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,180
Well, the philosophy here, Scottish,

797
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,870
do you not think she's saying that
you think the translation is wrong?

798
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,470
She says the n word conversation
with no, she doesn't. No, I know.

799
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,880
I'm sure the translation is accurate.
I just don't, you know that's crazy.

800
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,400
That's crazy that that is English.
Maths, English. Damn, that is,

801
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,960
that is English when I,

802
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,320
okay.

803
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,180
He says when I slept with someone else,
he does.

804
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,000
He says, when I slept with someone
else, I told her when she did it,

805
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,330
she lied for a year and a half.
That's what that's right here.

806
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,180
When I slept Sunday,
we'll talk to her.

807
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,040
These are our fucking
brothers and sisters guys.

808
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:33,743
Yup.

809
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,800
All right. That was a horrific
failure. That was bad. All right.

810
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,240
You know what I've been
noticing on this vacay?

811
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:43,840
Daddy is vacation dads.

812
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,960
They at the poppy, sorry, I'm in Florida.

813
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,130
There is a specific,

814
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,600
there is a specific type of vacation.
Dad, I've been seeing where they,

815
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,220
they're always shirtless, right in
their boxer, whatever. Swim trunks,

816
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,560
and then they have the hard booze belly.
There's that guy, but then dad bod, right.

817
00:59:06,561 --> 00:59:10,340
It's hard,
but then I saw they had like a rib,

818
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:13,280
the rib cage shows and the fat belly,

819
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:18,650
which I feel like it should be either or,
but not both. It's a good observation.

820
00:59:18,651 --> 00:59:22,040
How do you have a fat
belly and the rib cage? She

821
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,630
Stage three cancer. Actually. No, that's,

822
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:31,380
that's totality. That man,

823
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,350
the eclipse.
Ah.

824
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,590
Oh my God.

825
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,760
Prominences how many of you did that
guy's voice during the lifestyle?

826
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,890
It was great. Right. We
did it the whole time.

827
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,270
He was so excited.

828
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,220
Yeah,

829
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:03,530
that was great. That's love that
they do that dad prominence is uh,

830
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,660
that's hard to achieve that you got
to go hard for years to get that,

831
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,640
that special bar bod for where
the ribs and the big hard hoochie.

832
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,990
That's rough man.
You got to like really booze it up.

833
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:23,620
Definitely six days a week and and
like you still somehow stay active

834
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,040
so you have the hard gut and you're like,
I'm doing all right.

835
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,940
I've got the ribs on the side.
It's a Florida bought,

836
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,960
it's a Florida guy bought
totally.

837
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,590
What I've noticed is on every
beach, whether it's, you know,

838
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:40,930
it's like a Florida keys bod,

839
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,250
but I noticed like in
south beach or are here,

840
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,630
there's always the guy who looks
like a piece of fucking beef Jerky,

841
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:52,840
skinny,
skinny,

842
01:00:52,841 --> 01:00:57,750
skinny guy with his dog ribs
showing leather skin like

843
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,030
charcoal king's son. More and more,
more, more, more, more, more. Yeah. Yeah.

844
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,740
That is a Florida guy to Florida guy.

845
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:11,420
But then they're, they're,
they're athletic. Like they
run all day or something.

846
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:13,480
You're like, what are you
doing? You just want to die,

847
01:01:13,481 --> 01:01:14,530
like you're trying to kill yourself,

848
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,000
the sun worshipers, man. You
know what else is a stupid,

849
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,830
so you see it in the south, you
were pointing out, you're like,

850
01:01:19,831 --> 01:01:21,610
look how this dip shit is dressed.
See,

851
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,940
I'm used to seeing this
from growing up here,

852
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,030
but so we're at the hotel
and this guy has on like,

853
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,780
like pink khaki style,
you know,

854
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:35,190
like pink shorts with a belt and then a
tucked in shirt, buttoned down collar.

855
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:39,240
Like he looks like a, like a
Frat, like going to the game.

856
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:45,570
It's a Douche bag. And she's like, what
the fuck is that guy wearing? And I go,

857
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:49,050
Oh yeah, that's a def. That's like a,
it's like the southern preppy look,

858
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:53,890
you know what I mean? And, and I got,
yeah, I hate him so much too. Uh,

859
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,400
and she's like, who dresses like that?
I'm like, like 18 million people. Uh,

860
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,840
well, because like, because seriously
in La, if I saw fucking dude,

861
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:07,980
we're in like pink, pink, khaki
shorts, a brown braided belt,

862
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:10,350
and then like a polo

863
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:15,190
taller and then tan top siders with
no socks. I know you'd be like,

864
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:19,770
this dude's about to get beat.
That motherfucker will be dead.

865
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:23,150
There's no way you would survive.
But it's like automatic, right?

866
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,120
You see that guy doesn't even,

867
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,340
you don't even blink when you see that
guy and you're like, fuck that guy.

868
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,080
But you know,
he's like a preppy douchebag.

869
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,080
Douchebag. It's a Douche bag at
the Brooks brothers. Look. Yeah.

870
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,100
Fuck the Brooks brothers. You're going
to like the way you look at that. Them

871
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,920
No,
that's men's warehouse.

872
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,550
You're gonna like the way
you look at Brooks brothers.

873
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,620
Well, what's Brooks? Brian say? I
love how much you don't know that,

874
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,670
but I have no capacity for,
you know,

875
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,390
I don't fucking care that Brooks brother.
That is some southern shit though.

876
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:11,800
We don't have that in la. No fucking
way. When a guy wear like a lime Tuxedo,

877
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:17,350
why does that cause seersucker suit
to fucking super southern. Yeah.

878
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:21,440
That's never been like
Georgia, Alabama. Yeah. Yeah.

879
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:26,380
The Carolinas nerds racist
places, right? Yeah. It's like,

880
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:31,420
it's, it's an Alpha that says, now I
might be racist. Right. The plantation.

881
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:35,120
Yeah. You get the suit, you get the
Tiki torch. You're ready to go now.

882
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,520
Got The whole outfit, man. Tiki torch.
Alright. Half those guys were prepped out.

883
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,240
They were like wearing collared shirts.
They went to Brooks brothers. They did.

884
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:47,820
And they're like, I liked the
way I look. I want to go out.

885
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,350
Uh, you're smart, but all cells are fine.

886
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,890
Should we do ours?
Our specialists also,

887
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,930
you want to get that twin thing came in.

888
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:06,220
We've been really asking great
questions about twin. Yeah.

889
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,570
And are there any twins here? No. Twins.

890
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:14,700
It's like almost 500 people. Uh, sorry.

891
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,560
Like you represent the
twins that aren't here.

892
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,200
They didn't want to come this,

893
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:25,480
these guys are actually twins
and they're talking about it.

894
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:29,810
They couldn't get inside. She was too
tight. Yeah. And so you stepped in,

895
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,430
took a smaller pieces that way you get it.
Another girl,

896
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:38,970
I did not understand that. Their Twitter
accents are a fucking, oh no, no, no,

897
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:42,990
they're twins. So, but the, here's what
the guy says, this is what he gets to.

898
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,720
So there's, there's this lady's
interviewing these two twins.

899
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,860
One of them basically says that, you
know, a guy had trouble with the girl.

900
01:04:49,861 --> 01:04:51,270
She was with and then,

901
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,530
okay. It was, they were friends. I thought
it was like you couldn't fit inside.

902
01:04:54,531 --> 01:04:57,900
So he called you in because you have a
narrower penis. And he was like, okay,

903
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:02,650
we got everything. Just the same, same,

904
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:07,060
everything is identical. Everything is
identical. So that's another eyebrows.

905
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,690
A case that are dicks are the same.
Exactly the same.

906
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,260
I'm beginning to lean towards that
as the solution to this a thought.

907
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:16,960
Provoker yeah, yeah,
yeah. I mean it's, it's

I think we've spoken.
The tribe is spoken,

926
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:55,120
but if I have to choose, I mean I cannot
really think about it. They know I am.

927
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:58,900
I am. Here's a rain, Florence.
She's going to be all weird and oh,

928
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:02,860
she's going to cry.
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

929
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,860
She is filled up with pis,
so

930
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:12,090
I feel like the moose soup lady is a real
pig and the sense of it like she is a

931
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:17,650
savage. Yeah. Yeah. Like rain's going to
be like, I want you to connect with me.

932
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:21,520

to cry and feelings and all that shit.

933
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,770
I'm ready to make love.
No, I don't want that.

934
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:27,060
And Moose Soup lady is going to be like,
fucking just slam it in there.

935
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:27,923
Don't give a shit.

936
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:33,450
Moose Soup Lady would take your head and
just force it in between her legs. Yup.

937
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:37,620
Calm down layer for myself.
And you'd have to,

938
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,330
you'd have to eat her box so
she won't let you out. Oh Gee.

939
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,270
Eat all her moose suit
before you get out of that.

940
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:51,110
Oh Man,
I'm going to go,

941
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:55,220
I bet at least if you were eating her out
she'd be super complimentary, you know.

942
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,260
Musu you guys are doing good.

973
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,560
Oh,

974
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:16,140
It's not going to be, I mean,
close your eyes. Close your eyes.

kisses, kisses on your neck

976
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:27,503

01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,580
oh, oh, oh.

979
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,610
He makes that noise
from a fucking highway.

980
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,990
Imagine if he's up inside of you

981
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,920
just pumping over and over.

982
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,870
The Rab Rab guy is so fucking creepy.
I can't even,

983
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,560
I'm so not in.
He's a master of lovemaking.

984
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,890
You I that doesn't,
but doesn't matter.

985
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:10,730
Here's why I don't like him. He'll
take longer because he's mastered his,

986
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:15,510
his circumstances. Right. Circumscription

987
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:21,390
how'd you say that's
all beside the testicle?

988
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,493
We found

989
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:28,080
old videos of him. Yeah. I just
want to see this like, I don't know,

990
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:30,720
30 plus years old still.

991
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,560
He was talking about your deck
and your balls then like he is,

992
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,740
he hasn't wavered at all man. When you
finish the kidney massada testicle.

993
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,170
Okay.
How's it called?

994
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:47,220
East in crowd about factory
producing a lot of sexual energy.

995
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:52,310
This is from the 70s yeah. Okay. Went
back to the story. Okay. Rob. Rob.

996
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,433
Yeah.

997
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,560
I mean it's a really
interesting one to think about.

998
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,610
So you have a guy who for 50 years,
he's just been like touching his dick,

999
01:12:00,611 --> 01:12:03,010
talking about his dick,
talking about sex.

1000
01:12:03,011 --> 01:12:06,280
So maybe it'd be like the most
mind blowing sexual experience.

1001
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:11,250
You could ever know why he's
such an expert. So sharp.

1002
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,080
I mean woman to woman,
like the,

1003
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:19,970
all these scenarios are about getting
in and getting out. Right. So mine.

1004
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,080
It's like I'm going to get in there and
I'm going to let the Trans Canada Dad,

1005
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:29,030
he's going to be so stoked. Dude. He's
never had a mouth on his penis ever.

1006
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,440
This'll be the first time any woman's
ever tagged is nuts and he's going to love

1007
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,540
it and I'm going to make this guy's life

1008
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,750
dude,
the Transcanada highway.

1009
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:45,830
That's how you see it to get in.
Get it out.

1010
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,500
But what about,
that's the thing in this scenario,

1011
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:56,360
what's supposed to be happening is these
guys are going to town for like hours,

1012
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:00,150
so you can't really think
of it as in and out. Yeah.

1013
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,600
Maybe she's got a good
point. Wait, hold on.

1014
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:10,350
The lady in the front just said the rub
rub guy is going to be counting out like

1015
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:11,184
one.

1016
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,393
Great.

1017
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,470
So you're going to have
to hear this asshole count

1018
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,740
that was racist the way you did.

1019
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:19,263
Wow.

1020
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:24,680
I was doing an impression.
So yeah, that's how it is.

1021
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:29,620
50 time and then he'll go 50
times, 50 times, you know,

1022
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,550
turn in tunnel.

1023
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,720
That guy's awesome.

1024
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:37,720
Yeah.

1025
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,470
But as a woman you can just close your
eyes and like let him get excited.

1026
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:45,250
But let me propose this to you,
sir. Go ahead. Your scenario,

1027
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,040
what you're saying makes sense. If you're
like, the idea is to get in and out,

1028
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,300
but what if in this scenario
that we're proposing, yeah,

1029
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:54,190
you have to spend an hour with the person.

1030
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,460
She would you rather have
the Rob Rob Guy who's like,

1031
01:13:57,461 --> 01:14:00,520
I make you cum fast hot,
or

1032
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:02,863
okay,

1033
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,830
it's true.

1034
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:08,210
Canada. Whoa. Oh,

1035
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,483
that guy

1036
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:17,230
our, yes. You know why? Because I'll
give him a thimble full of whiskey,

1037
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:21,580
which he's never had in his life
and he'll go crazy. He's like,

1038
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:26,140
this is cool and it'll be,
it'll be so much fun for him.

1039
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,160
I would do it for him.

1040
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:31,510
Oh,
the story that this road towels.

1041
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:34,140
Aye.

1042
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:38,690
I would fuck the rob rob course.
Dude,

1043
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:40,880
that guy's going to open your mind up.
You'd be like,

1044
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:44,600
I've never even felt that in my
balls before. And He'd be like,

1045
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:48,280
I know I'm a fucking, I'm the master
of this rob, Rob Guy. I'm the rub rub.

1046
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,590
All right, let's take a poll. Who here
is going to go for the rub? Rub Guide?

1047
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:57,530
Yes. A hundred percent okay. Okay.

1048
01:14:57,531 --> 01:15:00,620
And what about the Trans Canada highway?

1049
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:06,870
Give me my role.

1050
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,850
Oh yeah.

1051
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,810
Thank you. Where's that
from? Give me my real word.

1052
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,250
Give me my reward of porn to come.
The cubs,

1053
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,910
that's the old was really gross.

1054
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:29,600
I want to see all the cum on my face.
I can

1055
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,660
make sure. I don't know
a lot. Okay, so Steve,

1056
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:39,540
it's very Donald.

1057
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,210
Pretty Long.
Yeah.

1058
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,483
Thanks.

1059
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,693
Yeah.

1060
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:08,040
Was there anything else I want to do
it. Would you rather see? Oh, okay.

1061
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,593
Okay.

1062
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,230
Would you rather it's,
let me see what I have to pee so bad.

1063
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,650
Hopefully you guys don't have to pay.

1064
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,110
Drink

1065
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,530
the top layer.
Did she ask

1066
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:42,060
John
or sex with your sister?

1067
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,200
They give a face.

1068
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,340
Grandmother walks on you masturbating.

1069
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:52,710
Never have another orgasm.
Fine.

1070
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:54,060
The play is trying to play with.

1071
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,120
All right.

1072
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:02,410
I'll say this before we get started with,

1073
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:05,710
would you rather you have a
gift for these? You really do.

1074
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:10,100
You've come up with some of the best ones
ever. They come out of you like that.

1075
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,620
It's amazing. Yeah. It's
because I understand suffering
and no, I feel like I,

1076
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,530
I feel like I like what is misery?
The would you rather choose really good.

1077
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:23,600
Thank you. No thank guys. Please, let's
go. Okay. Okay. What'd you rather?

1078
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:28,640
Yeah, I like, what'd you
rather wear? A fart helmet.

1079
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,930
What's a fart helmet?
It's my own design.

1080
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:35,870
So a fart helmet is,

1081
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:40,760
it's a tube that's hooked up to your
butthole and then it's connected to like a

1082
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:44,290
space helmet. Like what?
You were like a mask? Yeah,

1083
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:49,730
so far mass. Oh, they did?
Okay. So, but every Fart,

1084
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,490
it's in your face and
you're smelling it all day.

1085
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,670
Do you smelling your own farts all day,
all day or,

1086
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,820
or you pee in a mason jar,

1087
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:02,060
but you carry it with you
everywhere and you're like,

1088
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,420
you have to do, you have to
talk about it. Talk about it.

1089
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,430
Like I know some giant, you meet
people, you're like, this is my urine.

1090
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,740
Hi.
Believe in keeping all of it.

1091
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:24,790
I can get you a jar if you would like and
introduce you to the lifestyle or just

1092
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:30,110
smell your own farm with a mask
on. Right. Do you realize that?

1093
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,280
Like as crazy as you look
to people when you're like,

1094
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,010
this is my urine.
Uh,

1095
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:41,000
if you walk into the bank with
your fart mask on, it's just,

1096
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:45,990
they're pressing the button under the
desk immediately. Right, right. Well that,

1097
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:50,650
that's what I'm saying is that
either scenario is a life ruiner. No,

1098
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,560
they definitely ruin your life. You're
kind of, you come up with these.

1099
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:58,910
I just think about what will be the
most horrible shit in the world. Yeah.

1100
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,940
Like a fart helmet. It's
gonna it's a mask, right?

1101
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,390
It's hard to perform.
It's hard to carve.

1102
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,140
The performs your standup career is over.

1103
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,450
Like you can't call the club,

1104
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:14,690
make sure you have the mic inside my mask.

1105
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:18,350
So I don't miss any farts
while I'm up there. No,

1106
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,500
they won't. They won't hook
you up with that. Yeah,

1107
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,080
but you could put your
urine mason jar down.

1108
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:26,320
Well then that disqualifies
you from a lot,

1109
01:19:26,321 --> 01:19:29,210
like imagine having to do
Conan and then you're like,

1110
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:34,160
and he's like, what's that tongue?
And then I tell him and he's like,

1111
01:19:34,161 --> 01:19:38,900
we'll be right back. Well, interesting.

1112
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:43,520
You should ask. Yeah. Starred, urinated
on his Mason Jar. Yeah, that's a thing.

1113
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:48,440
Your life is ruined. It's pretty awful,
but I still think you have some chance,

1114
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:52,100
you know, like some people
would not notice your mason jar.

1115
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:56,580
Some people will be like, okay, and kind
of, you know what I mean? Kind of move on,

1116
01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:59,840
move on.
I think you have to go mason jar.

1117
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:04,610
A fart mask is 100% you got it.

1118
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:08,100
You should have tin foil on your
head too. Like you. You can't,

1119
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,250
no one's going to talk to you. I
call it a fart. Hell, you say helmet,

1120
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:15,210
but you're describing a mess. It's
over your, your face is concealed.

1121
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:18,510
And then when people were like, are you
scared about the apocalypse? You know,

1122
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:23,460
or how I have a fart tube going from
the my ass to my mouth and they're like,

1123
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,350
I'll see you later.
And I always walk away.

1124
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,710
So hundred percent mason jar.

1125
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,550
Yeah. I'll take the mason
jar too. It's apple. Exactly.

1126
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:34,770
You have a story and then they're like,
can I have some of

1127
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,380
the essence of it is you have
to tell people like, I've
decided to do this thing.

1128
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,470
I collect my urine. That's
the craziness, and then I go,

1129
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:47,130
have you ever read a urine enema
and then they're like, you have to,

1130
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:50,670
you have to preach the gospel or the
exit over there if you don't mind.

1131
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,310
All right. What are you
going? I'm going to take a,

1132
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,560
I'm going to take the
mason jar to mason jar.

1133
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:59,340
Clap for a Mason Mason jar?

1134
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:01,453
Yeah.

1135
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,880
Fart helmet.

1136
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,240
Wow.
There's some nasty ass girls in the crowd.

1137
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:14,540
How could you what?

1138
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:20,960
You like your own brand,
but your job is over.

1139
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,610
There's no way your boss is like,
it's cool. You worked from home.

1140
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:28,970
Do you have,
are you in a relationship?

1141
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:31,420
You're married?
Are you single?

1142
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:40,893
What?

1143
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:46,010
Yeah, it's a, yeah, that
could be a career. If you're
like, I wear my part mask.

1144
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:49,110
You could incorporate this into
your website and now you're here,

1145
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:51,980
you're making even more money.
You just said that so sincerely.

1146
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:56,280
Well, now I'm thinking like she's
thinking you're working from home now.

1147
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:58,980
You've got fart helmet,
mistress.com.

1148
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:06,340
It's fucking brilliant, dude. It
becomes a lifestyle. It's a brand. Okay.

1149
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,800
All right, moving along. Here's
my second one. Okay. Okay.

1150
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:22,360
Okay.
Would you rather,

1151
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,750
would you rather be Vegan,

1152
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,100
but you're one of those vegans that you
have to fucking talk about it. 24 seven.

1153
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:37,210
I want it to be respectful.
I'm sure there's a few litter,

1154
01:22:37,211 --> 01:22:40,960
not proselytizers, but you're
the annoying kind. Okay.

1155
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:44,650
And you're constantly proselytizing.
Every time someone is with you,

1156
01:22:44,651 --> 01:22:46,500
like a hobo shoes are leather and

1157
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:52,810
rice and you talk about
your smoothies all the time.

1158
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,450
I like bees are,
are uh,

1159
01:22:56,650 --> 01:23:00,060
suffering when you eat honey
and you're like, yeah, yeah,

1160
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:02,500
you're one of those annoying people
who doesn't eat anything on the menu.

1161
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:06,070
So when we go out, you're always like,
is there dairy in at that lactose

1162
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,410
freeze that gluten free is a,

1163
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:10,780
so like all you can eat is like five
things and you're a pain in the ass to

1164
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:12,860
every real fucking fun guide for,
okay.

1165
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,500
Or You have to listen to
me whistle constantly.

1166
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,580
Hundred percent cutting
meat out of my life. 100%

1167
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:31,000
I fucking hate listening to whistle.
Whistle for them.

1168
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,193
Whistle for them.

1169
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,480
That's terrible. That's terrible. No, no.

1170
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:51,510
I'm already listen. No, I'm not having
any dairy tomorrow. I'm not. No,

1171
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:57,930
no. That was terrible. That was
terrible. It was terrible. I know.

1172
01:23:59,050 --> 01:23:59,883
So

1173
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,900
I, okay. That would be rough though.

1174
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,300
That mean what you're proposing is
really difficult. That's terrible.

1175
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,390
I would either I annoy the shit out
of you or you annoy the shit out of

1176
01:24:11,391 --> 01:24:15,470
everybody. That's a scenario and
I would miss that food for sure.

1177
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:19,930
That's what's fucked up. But yeah, but
hearing you obviously sounds worse.

1178
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,780
Waistline. Yeah. This is the thing
is it's not the, her whistle is bad.

1179
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,950
It's that it would be
constant. It would be, yeah.

1180
01:24:27,951 --> 01:24:32,540
But even when I hear the world class
Whistler's I'm still like, well,

1181
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:35,150
you'd knock that shit off,
please. Yeah, it's horrible.

1182
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,810
I hate when people do it indoors,
you know,

1183
01:24:38,811 --> 01:24:41,750
like waiting in line at the
bank and the guy's like,

1184
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,920
and you're like,
are you fucking serious right now?

1185
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:49,820
He's asserting dominance. That's
what they're doing is, yes,

1186
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:54,080
there is that territory is a psychological
reason, you know, 100% starting there.

1187
01:24:54,081 --> 01:24:58,040
This is my territory and
then has to fucking listen
to me whistle dish fucking I

1188
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:01,190
hate them. I said, yeah, I think
you would rather fucking go vegan.

1189
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:05,660
They listened to your cell phone.
That would be a real asshole.

1190
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,530
Would rather listen to Christina
whistling all day every day

1191
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,770
and who would rather go vegan
and listened to her waist. So

1192
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:22,120
it's Kinda close proselytizing
Megan. Yeah, I'd be, I'd be
real annoying. Okay. Yeah.

1193
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,890
One last one. Okay. This is, this is
more gross. Would you rather never floss?

1194
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,030
You're done flossing. Some of you pigs
aren't doing it already. Okay. Yeah.

1195
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:39,060
Or when you dump,
you're only allowed to wipe once.

1196
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:41,663
Ooh,

1197
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:51,630
wow. Wow. Heated debate in here.

1198
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:57,440
Let the conversation just feels
like like a period piece. Yeah.

1199
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:02,370
They're like, we're going to allow women
in the workforce and everyone's like,

1200
01:26:02,371 --> 01:26:07,370
what's going on?
That was such a sincere reaction.

1201
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:11,120
They were like, whoa, lady, whoa.

1202
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,870
I really can't take a big
stinky shit after I go.

1203
01:26:14,871 --> 01:26:19,130
I don't use toilet paper are flush the
toilet and get my hand that get in here

1204
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:24,780
three roughly and then flush again.
84 five

1205
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:31,760
he's nasty as hell. One
white dude. You'd be,

1206
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,010
yeah, these are great questions. Okay.

1207
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,870
Order order here,
here.

1208
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:50,940
And this particular scenario we
are dealing with, but de Lis,

1209
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,320
oh God dammit.

1210
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,040
He's absolutely brilliant.

1211
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:10,050
Would you rather and you will
entertain these thoughts?

1212
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,033
Yes.

1213
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,790
This triple d slept wife has,

1214
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:16,783
boy,

1215
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,480
no,
it is a thing.

1216
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:25,910
The reason I choose a day less toilet
is because those are the every man's

1217
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,160
scenario. Hold on, hold on. What you,

1218
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:34,230
what you propose is so absurd and I
actually forgot what the other option is.

1219
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:37,460
Okay.

1220
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,120
What in the hell was the other?
No flossing.

1221
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:45,710
Flossing
you are.

1222
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:50,300
You are 51 50 if you choose one,
wipe over.

1223
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:55,050
Not Philosophy again.
Are you out of your guide here?

1224
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,000
Hold on.

1225
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,330
I'm going to revise it in
the moment because I feel
there's a better option than

1226
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:03,060
the flossing.
Would you rather have one wipe?

1227
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,220
Yes or not wash your hands for a year.

1228
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:09,540
Okay.

1229
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,130
And that's a better,
would you rather

1230
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:20,300
you could do that? You could
do that again would be, hey,

1231
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:23,030
there's that fucking psycho
that wears gloves everywhere,

1232
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,680
but it's better than being like,
Hey,

1233
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:32,681
here's that guy that smells like fucking
piles of shit because he listens to a

1234
01:28:34,611 --> 01:28:39,400
podcast.
Yes,

1235
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:44,530
a way around such a conundrum of the
one lab is to take a shower every time

1236
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:46,310
you'll make a bowel movement.

1237
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:47,410
That's it,
right?

1238
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:52,340
That's the, that's the
work around. If you will,

1239
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,450
a appeal denied.
That is not acceptable.

1240
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,740
That is not acceptable.
So

1241
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:06,940
well, no, no, no. This is,
this is not the, so now listen,
if you do the one wipe, okay,

1242
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:10,630
this is, you can wash your hands as
much as you like. Now that's the caveat.

1243
01:29:10,631 --> 01:29:13,720
So you can one meaningful
wipe goes a long way. Hey,

1244
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:16,360
there are some shits I
take that only require one.

1245
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:17,870
Get the fuck Outta here,

1246
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,090
man.
What are you thinking Tom?

1247
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:30,860
I mean if you don't wash
your hands for a year,

1248
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:35,150
you're fucked in a lot of
ways. I mean, you really are.

1249
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:40,000
Think about all the time.
Take it for granted. Oh,

1250
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:44,700
that's not crazy. I'm
taking a shower like that.

1251
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:50,180
You're just like
women and men of the GSA in the shower.

1252
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,650
This,
this gentleman,

1253
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,880
you bring up a valid point. What's the
point? What? What do you do to work? Okay.

1254
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:04,700
You may put plastic baggies
over your hands in the shower.

1255
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:05,660
Okay.

1256
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:09,000
To to wash it like you ever have a cast
on your arm and you have to cover it.

1257
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,170
You can do that. What? Sweetie?

1258
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:18,410
I can't hear you. There's, there's,

1259
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,660
that's what the Supreme Court would hear.

1260
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:26,720
How are you going to wash your
asshole if you can't get your hands?

1261
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,370
No, no, easily. Okay. I covered them in
play. I cover them in plastic baggies.

1262
01:30:31,371 --> 01:30:34,580
They're airtight because
it's so serious and

1263
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:39,380
you are have a washcloth, which I'm
opposed to using in regular life,

1264
01:30:39,381 --> 01:30:43,730
but because of this thing I have to and I
wash cloth. My asshole. Easy peasy dude.

1265
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,380
Yeah.
Fucking loofa that shit dude.

1266
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,520
No plastic bags. No, no.

1267
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:58,970
Yeah, that's true. You're suggesting

1268
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,380
what a fucking would you rather,
I mean

1269
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:07,360
this is Charlottesville all over again.

1270
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:08,303
This is crazy.

1271
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:15,520
Very divisive issue.

1272
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:19,020
Why are you choosing hand washing,

1273
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,300
hand washing or one wipe Dapa go forward.
Tom, what's your aunt's or final answer?

1274
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:25,900
We need it.

1275
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,700
Um,
I think one way.

1276
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:34,030
Dot Gov one wipe.com.

1277
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:40,030
I think I would definitely, I
would be the gnarly hands, dude.

1278
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,570
I would just walk around
with unwashed hands.

1279
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:49,120
I cannot be one wipe guy.
You gotta be kidding me?

1280
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,210
There'd be times,
there would be times when you're like,

1281
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,590
I just can't jump in the shower and you
could not, I could not go through life.

1282
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:59,590
Like why you shrugging
like Eh, whatever. There,

1283
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:05,050
there are many one white, but you can
shower after. So that's why I'm saying no.

1284
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:10,820
What's that
number again?

1285
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,760
He shut what?
What happens to demolition?

1286
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,010
He scoops with that.

1287
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,360
All right. This is getting, I haven't
seen in years. All right, look,

1288
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:27,550
look at all the fucking, all right,
let's fucking take a vote. Yeah,

1289
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,170
let's think about, okay. Who votes for
they know hand washing for a one year.

1290
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:32,700
Go ahead.

1291
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:33,533
Wow.

1292
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,500
Who votes for one wipe dumps?

1293
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,300
Do you hear that?

1294
01:32:45,301 --> 01:32:49,620
Sounded like that sounded like
