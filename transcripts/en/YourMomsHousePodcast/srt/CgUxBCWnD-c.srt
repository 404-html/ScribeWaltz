Cool.

44

Yup. Podcast gas.com. And it's
something that you could do.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,040
You could and you could click on a banner
that looks like an Amazon banner and

47
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,840
do your show. But I'll just take
another poop right here soon. Um,

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,040
Yay It.
Eh,

53
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,373
here we go.

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,920
Y'All got that Nigga. Fuck them John
or whatever the fuck his name is.

55
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,180
Cause most of the Niggas
I'm here talking about him.

56
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,410
Hey one of these niggas asked him that
made a status like y'all so perfect.

57
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh God ain't no raw.
We get a Nigga getting his ass,

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,860
a motherfucking females and I ain't saying
that cause I eat Niggas as I'm saying

59
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,080
it because it is what it is.

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,553
Don't bring in

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,160
well go to your mom's house.

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,940
I liked this girl. It's a very
divisive issue in our nation. Where,

63
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,290
I mean this has come up quite a bit here.

64
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,210
Do you think Donald Trump
gets his ass eaten? I don't
think so. I don't think reg,

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,620
I don't think the line you guys like,
yeah,

66
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,160
let me eat your yourself now with
millennia. She's the bottom bitch.

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,990
It's happened before.

68
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,270
I think he demands and I feel like
he would be like get in there though.

69
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,970
I think he's probably like
that's a minus sissy stuff or so.

70
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,540
Oh cause he's of that generation
that's like but by mail, by holy names,

71
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,930
nothing needs to happen there. Do
you think that guys, your dad's age,

72
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,700
a lady butts or even that's considerably
not, yeah, they're probably like no,

73
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,890
that's gross.
You don't need to do it is yeah,

74
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,900
I'm going to side with them on that.

75
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Nothing Nigga you fingers and Annee de
questionable my Nigga buck drill need to

76
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,880
do as did you suck his dick?
You licking his bowl.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,470
You might as well eat that ass.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,570
That's true. That is kind of point
a hundred percent sure God blessing.

79
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,440
There's a lot of that.

80
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,490
Yeah. And I'll just eat niggas acid
so don't be like punch a bitch. No,

81
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:43,370
cause I asked him where I'd
be like she can't, what's up?

82
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,690
Can I eat your last cause I like
him all on his case or whatever.

83
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:50,470
Like he ain't the only Nigga I like
in his motherfucking ass. Aight.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,660
I thought she said she didn't eat ass
before. I know she does. Oh I hear you.

85
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,310
I feel like she was making,
she was clowning on people

86
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,260
that are, you know, saying like
no and making fun of it. Gotcha.

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,110
I think it's in reference to obviously
like some story of some celebrity or

88
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:09,230
someone, I don't know what it's
in reference to, but you know,

89
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,050
making a good point, very divisive
issue in our nation today in our nation.

90
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,910
Is it considered homosexual?

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,870
Of course not getting hit. Why
would that be homeless? No,

92
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,110
it's okay. Well she's telling you that
there's lines to the scrum. So legging.

93
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,170
The scram is not, well, she's
like, if you like extra things,

94
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,230
inserting a finger in your,
in your be hole,

95
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,060
punch a beach.
No,

96
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,590
but she's saying that if he likes
something inserted in his be halls or your

97
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:46,610
questionable, then you're on the,
you're kind of gay adjacent. Yeah.

98
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,380
Which I also think is funny thing.

99
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,950
I don't think if you'd like something
inserted or you're gay excited if it's a

100
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,580
dick than you are.
If you're like,

101
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,060
I like Dick's coming up in my ass,
then you're probably gay. True. Fake.

102
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,260
What about, okay, well let's
follow this logic train. Okay.

103
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:07,730
What about a Dildo or a woman wearing
a strap on? Is that gay? I mean,

104
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,430
that feels more gay
adjacent. I, I've, you know,

105
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:15,431
it's never occurred to me that
that would be a reality that,

106
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,270
uh,
would partake and be like,

107
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:24,140
well you strap a dick on it. But
I mean, but I got the guy isn't,

108
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:28,340
I guess a hundred percent necessarily
gay, but he's definitely, once he wants,

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,280
he wants the virtual reality ride for
sure. You know, cause it, but then again,

110
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,830
it's not attached to a dude.
Right. That's a key ingredient.

111
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,680
But then again it is a dick. It's kind of
like the traffic in a woman. Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:44,180
But see like,
you know,

113
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:48,620
there's always been that argument about
a man that's with a transsexual woman,

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,820
you know? I mean he doesn't
like a straight up other men.

115
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,170
He likes a man with tits.
Yeah.

116
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,250
And but like the presentation of a woman,
it's complicated. Confusing. It's not,

117
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:06,251
it's not straight up black and white
because some guys are really into that,

118
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,740
you know, the, they want
the aesthetic of a female.

119
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,430
So female looking face, female
looking, you know, body,

120
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,530
except genitals that are not, so
that's, that's pretty complicated.

121
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,370
So that this is not that far.
This is, this is like what I mean,

122
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,310
I don't even think that that should
be part of this conversation. Right.

123
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:28,130
Like somebody, not somebody being like,
I like my ass eat and they're like,

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,670
you gay. No, no, no.
That's crazy. That's silly.

125
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:36,290
I mean this is really God Burt special.
Are you playing

126
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,590
the most racist? Yeah. I don't
think that's going either. And I,

127
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:47,530
and again a very polarizing, what's
what sort of course not. Oh yeah.

128
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,470
Yeah it's, you know it's, it's the thing,
it's, it's a, I don't think it's gay.

129
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,200
I think having, like you said, I
wouldn't even say like a strap ons gay.

130
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,600
I would think that as long as it's, if
it's attached to a dude then you're gay.

131
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,970
Right? Right. Yeah. It's clear cut.

132
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,770
But then what is a dude in these non
Barrett Binary Times? Interesting point.

133
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,010
I mean are we being,
what's the word? Binaries?

134
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,970
Just probably if we write,
we're old,

135
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,480
we're binary shaming older.

136
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,010
I mean let's see what else you said.

137
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,390
Oh lot of y'all niggas like in y'all ass.

138
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:28,320
Hey I didn't ate a few y'all niggas
acid so I know for sure you feel me and,

139
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:32,500
and I never just eat it Nigga ass niggas
be asking me or whatever like or I

140
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:35,600
asked him so in a Nigga say he is,
oh I ain't never just sneaky.

141
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:39,190
He's and the guests like sucking his
dick and then hurry up and lick his ass.

142
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:41,260
Hell Nah Nigga cause your
body to go wash that thing.

143
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,910
Oh she doesn't just do it in prompt
to know saying you gotta be clean.

144
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,010
So she'll give him a heads
up like hey I'm Gunna,

145
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,750
I'm Gunna let get and then you take
a shower. What about a wet wipe?

146
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,190
Do you think that's enough or pinch?
But I mean it's better.

147
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,580
It's really better to really get
in there and scrub I think. Yeah.

148
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,070
I mean yeah that's pretty dirty area.
Yeah.

149
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,990
Y'all stay here really like really?
Oh his heels though.

150
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:13,400
Like y'all on that met life shitting
on him cause he like he he got his ass

151
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:16,040

he liked that shit or not.

152
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,820
He came lie that she feel good cause I
ain't got my ass ate a lot of times and

153
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:20,654
that shit feel good.

154
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,540
Crazy talk this person right.
That's why you got a bum bump on your lip.

155
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,080
You know it actually brings a no,
I'm never going to eat your scrump.

156
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,510
Just so you know.
Interesting. Interesting.

157
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,650
Somebody actually wrote in this message,
maybe you can read it. Nope, just read it.

158
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,480
It says all on Mommy's a huge fan of
the podcast and love listening to it.

159
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,100
I have a big problem.

160
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,090
My husband and I have been together for
almost seven years and I've never seen

161
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:56,680
his butthole. You're lucky I feel
because he has seen all of me,

162
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,020
but hauling all that I deserve to see his,

163
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,090
I've asked him repeatedly to show me
his brown eye and even went as far as to

164
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,610
set up mirrors in places
to catch a glimpse.

165
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,050
I fear I might die before ever seeing
it. So my question is, Christina,

166
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:16,030
have you seen Tom's butthole and what do
you recommend I do to see my husband's

167
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,670
by hall? Thanks for taking time to read.
Love you guys. Keep high and tight.

168
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:22,510
The butthole investigator, Natalie.
Uh, I just saw your butt hole.

169
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:26,500
I saw Tom that whole like yesterday.
You did? Yeah, dude, we were um,

170
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,420
we were just playing and you bend over
and spread. Remember, how are we doing?

171
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:32,254
And you kind of,

172
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,580
it's like in the last 72
hours I've seen your ass hole.

173
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,880
It's not pretty.

174
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,930
It's very hairy and dark and
scary. It's kind of like, um,

175
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,390
the upside down a stranger
things. Yeah. Like Wah,

176
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,620
it's all dark and mysterious
and, and um, toxic,

177
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,510
toxic. You feel sad when you see
it. Jesus. Yeah. Stuff like that.

178
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,780
That's not true. Uh, how do I, you know,

179
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,850
here's what you can do to get your
boyfriend to show you or as a husband,

180
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,350
I can't remember, uh, play a
little game called stripper. Yeah.

181
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,040
You know that's true.
Yeah.

182
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,960
Remove. Oh yeah, we're, I, yeah,

183
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,130
I slapped my hands on my butt and then I
run them down the back of my legs and I

184
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,170
bend down like I'm doing
a hot stripper dance.

185
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,500
So you may want to encourage
him. You start, you go, hey,

186
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,730
you want to see my stripper dance?

187
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,000
And then you do it and you
spread your cheeks and then go,

188
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:33,470
now you do it and then make
him do what you just did. Yeah.

189
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,350
It's pretty good idea.
But you don't want to see it.

190
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,760
A man in that position is hideous.
Cause his twig and berries or mashed,

191
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,570
it's not, I mean, it's not
going to turn her on. No.

192
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,930
But she'll get to see what she wants to
see. I think she might regret seeing it.

193
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,160
Yeah. Why do you want to see it? But
again, what would it take for you to eat?

194
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,360
Like that girl saying, you know, right.

195
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,760
No, it's never going to happen. It's
just not for me in this lifetime. I mean,

196
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,980
what if it's something I need though.
You don't.

197
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,130
We've been together a million years.
You know, I don't need it. No,

198
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,800
you don't need it. You've
got, you've gone this far.

199
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,750
I know, but I mean, I need
it. I need that scrum meeting.

200
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,950
I need it. I mean nasty as hell, Tom.

201
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,160
Um,
yeah.

202
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,640
No it's not. It's not on
the table right now. I know.

203
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm just lucky to get my hygiene back.
You know,

204
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:31,361
I have my six week checkup after having
my badge blasted through childbirth and

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,080
we got the green light. I know. And
let's just start there. You know,

206
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,570
you're talking to like
varsity level stuff, man.

207
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:41,840
We need to get back into
just regular old entrance

208
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,520
courses and know, so
tired as you are too. I'm,

209
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,730
I made so much fitness last month,
people don't know this on the show,

210
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:53,320
but I go to this gym where we
were a telemetry strap. Okay.

211
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,850
And,
um,

212
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,280
and that what happens is it assigns
points based on your heart rate, you know,

213
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:04,480
in a workout. So if you
have it spike a lot, um,

214
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,740
you're getting higher points.

215
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,640
And I was working at a bunch
at the beginning of the
month and they're like, oh,

216
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,410
you're number one. I was
like, oh, that's great.

217
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,520
And then the guy at the gym that
my trainer would text me, Oh,

218
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,440
you're number three. I was like,
fuck. I started to get mad about it,

219
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,050
you know?
Yeah.

220
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,120
So then it just kept going and going
and then at the end there I kind of went

221
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,970
crazy.
Right?

222
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,920
Yeah. Yeah. It's a mental
problem. I mean, look,

223
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,250
I'm concerned with feeding our newborn.

224
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,700
I don't sleep either in the
night I wake up every few hours.

225
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:41,600
The dog had diarrhea last night. I was up
and now dealing with that. But you know,

226
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,370
you got your problems too. Like if you
can beat this stranger. Yeah. With points,

227
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,990
with points for your workouts.
So it sounds like you're mocking.

228
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,540
No, no, no. I think it's, you know,

229
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:57,770
you're tired and you gotta work out a
lot to beat this lady and that doesn't

230
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,720
know that I'm competing with her,
which is even cooler. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

231
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,780
That's pretty interesting.

232
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,820
So that last day I did three workouts.
That's fun.

233
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,230
I still feel it. I feel it today.
Three days later. Yeah. Uh,

234
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,770
yeah. You going to do this
again in September? No. 10
I'm just going to do normal.

235
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,610
No, I mean, I'm, I'm going to do it again,
but now that I did it, I made number one.

236
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm like, cool. Just be, uh, be active.
I don't have to be number one. Well,

237
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:30,430
if you were to compete with her,
again, I suggest the scrabble method.

238
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,320
If you've ever played
scrabble with a friend. Yeah.

239
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,500
The key is to get a ton of
points at the top of the game.

240
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,500
Like when you play the electronic version
and you get that assistant thing to

241
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:42,220
help you. Yeah. Just get away. You gotta
stack the points at the top of the game.

242
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,770
Yeah. No, it helps in play. Catch
up. Yeah. Can I let that bitch what,

243
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:51,120
what does she do that so fishy goes. So
what happens is she works out at the gym.

244
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,870
Yeah.

245
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,870
Set my gym is a small gym that has like
a one on one and you can do small group

246
00:15:58,201 --> 00:15:58,531
trainings.

247
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:02,520
You can go with like three friends and
be like train us together or you could do

248
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:06,480
one on one. It's small and
it's just personal training.

249
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,830
Sometimes you could do like
weightlifting core stuff. Um,

250
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,641
boxing.

251
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:16,140
There's like some martial arts trainers
there so you can do kickboxing and

252
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,680
that's it. This lady goes there, does
her workouts with one of the trainers.

253
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,070
In addition to that, she also
goes to spin class a lot. Oh,

254
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,210
what a spin class gets you,
your heart rate really jacked up.

255
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,410
So that's how she kills it with points.
Okay.

256
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah. What's interesting about this,
and I've never done soul cycle,

257
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,960
but people love it and I, and
I'm like, and they pay a fortune.

258
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:41,910
I hear it's very expensive. Yeah. It's
like, um, it's a stationary bicycle,

259
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,380
but with a lot of people. Right. And
you just listened to like cool music.

260
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,550
Is that gas? I've never, I've never
got it. I hear it's fantastic. Yeah.

261
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,510
I mean the whole thing is in or that
environment supposed to help you write,

262
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,040
write, write, write, write the music.
It's a real positive coach. Gotcha.

263
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,210
There's also people all around,

264
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:00,450
you're doing the same thing and I think
you like stand up on the bicycle and

265
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:04,560
then you sit down, you know, like make it
really crazy. Damn. That's hard as fuck.

266
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,150
It's pretty hard. Hardcore
how much you lose weight
faster. And that, um, you know,

267
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:13,260
we were discussing a lot
a forest and Jenny. Yeah.

268
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,720
Whether she's a gutter slot and you know,

269
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,710
abuse this man of somewhat,
uh,

270
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,900
restricted intellectual ability.

271
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,370
Right. Well, let, the debate was,

272
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,960
is it ethical or should you
date the mentally challenged?

273
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,150
Right. Which clearly forest is not,
not mentally challenge, right? I mean,

274
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:39,200
yeah, we don't know what his level pretty
functioning and he's high functioning,

275
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:43,930
but he's not a regular
guy. Right. And he's not

276
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,390
just a normal dude is like, hey,
what's up mom? And Blah Blah. I live,

277
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:52,350
I like chocolate. He could do
standup comedy though. Yeah,

278
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:56,190
he could probably pull off. There's
a few comments. He sounds just,

279
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,040
yeah. Um, so anyway, this is,

280
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,470
um, the messages that came in. Hey,

281
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:07,620
mommy's in Forrest Gump.

282
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,490
Jenny was a calm dog with a heart of
gold who tried to help forest out.

283
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,060
The only way she knew how early in
the film when she snuck into her,

284
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,490
she snuck him into her dorm dorm room. So
we get a handful of hungry tits. Right.

285
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,730
Until he blew his snot and his
dungarees she didn't have to do that.

286
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,290
Her Final Act of bravery was to break him
off some posts while she's still still

287
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,550
had a post to give. No one else was,
there was no tender for tards today.

288
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,760
Forget about the south in the 60s.
Also,

289
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:40,761
him being a single father ups his chances
of pounding some pissed flaps by a

290
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,160
thousand percent Jenny
truly selfless, rob. Huh.

291
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,980
That's an interesting twist
on this ever growing a debate.

292
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,020
Another important debate in America today
is whether or not Jenny abused forests

293
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,230
right to jiff him helped
him. I mean, I can see,

294
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:02,420
I feel like this is a spin
on reality from rob, but um,

295
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,840
that's an interesting point.
Over the last,

296
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:08,520
maybe Jenny was truly giving and just
this is the only way she knew how to give.

297
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,720
She contracted HIV because they
had a biker gang bangs. Right.

298
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:17,310
She was doing gang bangs on her nationwide
dick to her before she ran into us

299
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:21,060
before or after she became the first
lady of the United States of America.

300
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,620
Well before. Yeah. No. Yeah. This is
before her it. Yeah, that's right.

301
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,810
I cannot wait to see.
By the way,

302
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,330
guess what we fucked up last
night when we were like, oh,

303
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:34,730
what are we going to watch Ozark
Susan tease out with her? Fuck. Fuck.

304
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,350
God dammit.
I love that fucking

305
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,150
well, I know we're in a kind of a show
Lala right now. We got our Ozark back.

306
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,450
We've been watching the Shahs
of sunset on Bravo. Silly.

307
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,230
It's kind of mindless fun. Oh my God.
I didn't have chance to set this up.

308
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:53,340
Better Call Saul. I was watching
the, I wonder if I could bring it up.

309
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,820
I was watching better call Saul is even
better this season. It's fantastic.

310
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,510
I fucking love that show,
that serial killer thing last night.

311
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,880
I know I got to fall asleep to that again.
Thanks.

312
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,900
And it was really a dark
one too. It was like, um,

313
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:12,120
how to tell if your kid is
a serial killer. I overheard
that. You miss something.

314
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:14,010
That's fine when you're a mom of two boys.

315
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,990
I was so when they were first
explaining all the different,

316
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,320
you know,

317
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,320
variables that might lead someone to be
this way and they're talking about uh,

318
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,880
you know,
the

319
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,540
CT scans they run and how their
brains are different. Well yeah,

320
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,060
but then they got to a
part, I was like, Ooh,

321
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,610
Christina might like this parcel.

322
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Christine might kind of flip out at this
part and I didn't get a chance to set

323
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,520
it up and I think I can play it for
you here. Hold on. Let me see. Yeah,

324
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:56,500
this just came out. What's
the show called? It's called
inside the criminal mind.

325
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,633
Great.

326
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,450
Just what I was hoping to
hear about Christina. Oh Shit.

327
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,750
You're going to like that

328
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,670
for them.

329
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,670
This area was physically shrunken by
18% this could account for why they can

330
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,920
kill without guilt or
remorse. Oh, hold on.

331
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,880
Just give it a second. Oh, I know. I know.

332
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,910
Criminologists have also found another
possible biological predictor of Danish

333
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,330
antisocial behavior, low
resting heart rate. Oh my God.

334
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,640
They theorize that those with low rates
don't feel fear as strongly as others.

335
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,020
Oh my God,
that's you.

336
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,850
They may be more violent and take physical
risks because they are less fearful

337
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,080
of the consequences

338
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,990
is that life may feel a bit dull
to people with low heart rates,

339
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,010
so that's excitement and
crazy intense stimulation.

340
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh my God,

341
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,660
this is you to a tease over
people that don't know.

342
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:03,740
I have an incredibly low sitting heart
rate because, well, I don't know,

343
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:08,741
but a few years ago it was so stunning
to my general physician that he sent me

344
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:14,411
to Cedars Imaging Institute
and the Cardiac Center and
they ran a bunch of tests

345
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,870
for a couple of days and at
the end they were like, Huh,

346
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,430
you just have a low heart rate.
Like there was no diagnosis? No,

347
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm saying for what
causes the low heart rate.

348
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,920
No, and even we had the life insurance
lady come and she took your blood pressure

349
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:30,860
and she was like, wow, you have
a really low resting heart rate.

350
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,280
It a serial killer husband.
I even have it

351
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,500
getting that old old bit about the
first time my doctor checked it out,

352
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,334
he was like,

353
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,020
your heart rate is like a
Olympic marathon running low.

354
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,950
I was like, yeah, it's pretty low.
And he was like, why? I'm like,

355
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,640
because I run a lot, I'm sure.
Um, no, but you know in my,

356
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,450
at my real deepest rest of the state,

357
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,050
it's in the low forties
sometimes in the thirties

358
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,560
you've listened to your heartbeat before.
Like, I'll have my head on your chest,

359
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,980
go, go, go.

360
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,490
Anyways, I started to laugh
so hard at those lights. Why
you? You are who you are,

361
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,910
you know? I do think that your
low resting. Okay. For instance,

362
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:17,760
I've taken 'em a pill that slows
down my heart a little bit.

363
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:20,370
I forget what it's called.
Yeah. Like many, many years ago,

364
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:25,140
and I used to perform on it and couldn't
because it would slow me down so much

365
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:29,880
and it was like Bra, but that's how
you are where I'm like, oh my God,

366
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:33,020
Tom, you sold out the Wilbur. Isn't this
the most exciting thing? And you're like,

367
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,590
yeah, that's great. And you kind of
sighed a loud noise like, hey guys,

368
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,050
like you totally are.
It totally mellows you.

369
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,650
Oh, also I overheard the
children caffeine all the time.

370
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,040
Oh

371
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,740
yeah, you're, you're almost dead. So

372
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,510
they say that the children of the serial
killers has children. They light fires.

373
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,580
Yeah. Bed wetters Oh, bad. Wetters
and animal harmers now did it,

374
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:02,650
you kill a Bald Eagle?
No,

375
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,200
I did kill an endangered.

376
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,100
A woodpecker. Okay. But
it was not chat for my,

377
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,760
it wasn't for my own amusement.
It wasn't my, it was,

378
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,840
it was because my dad wanted me to,
I also wasn't like a kid torturing it.

379
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,350
It was a bird that was fucking up our
house and he was like, shoot that.

380
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,350
I never tortured animals. That
is actually the one, you know,

381
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,270
they discredited that.

382
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:28,340
They're saying that that was
what they used to tell people,

383
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,370
so what do they tell you now? How do you
know your kids is much more complicated?

384
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,350
But in like that,

385
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,740
that was actually very dangerous because
in the fifties or sixties when they

386
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,280
were telling people that a lot, you
know, you have these parents being like,

387
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:43,520
my kid pissed his pants
and he lit a match.

388
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,860
Oh Hey, I played with fire.
Well, fire is fascinating. Yeah.

389
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm not saying that.
My parents were,

390
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,490
I might say my dad was negligent when
he would drink and fall asleep and I got

391
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:59,210
to play with the fireplace at
the age of seven or eight. Um,

392
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,570
when you get to play with a
little bit of fire, come on.

393
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,010
I used to throw all kinds of shit
in the fireplace. But anyways,

394
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,100
yeah, that's clearly you're the mark of a
real associate star. I was like, Oh shit.

395
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,450
They're like low heart rate.

396
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,450
I wonder what that really is for you.
What this low heart rate,

397
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:22,640
this low resting,
all those tests,

398
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,630
like at the one of the finest medical
institutions, they were just like,

399
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:27,560
you have an effective heart.

400
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,150
You know what's so funny is that you
really don't have like a sense of urgency.

401
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:37,151
I've never seen you like panicked and
hurried even in times when you should be

402
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:42,050
like, I've never seen you like we've got,
you know, like me, like I'm a Jack Rabbit.

403
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:46,190
I wake up and I'm like,
you're not like that at all.

404
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,910
It takes you a long time to wind up
and then like, you know what I mean?

405
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,030
I Dunno if I've never done urgency.

406
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,320
I've never seen you like
panicked and running, running.

407
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,760
You said even when you should be like
free. Like for instance, you know,

408
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:03,200
missing airplanes. Have you ever,
I just don't see you doing that.

409
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,920
I remember one time we were connecting
for Hawaii and you and I had to get to

410
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,340
the thing and like that. You know what
I mean? And I'm not really a runner.

411
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,090
You're just kinda like,
all right, we'll get there.

412
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,940
Maybe that's cause you're a low
resting heart way. Right. I Dunno.

413
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,290
Maybe I don't see myself being late for
a lot of flights, so either, you know,

414
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,150
I'm always on time. It
was a connection. We,

415
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:27,080
it was for our vacation and it was
like the airport was really fucked up.

416
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:30,550
It was a Honolulu and we had to
get to learn and they're like,

417
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,990
you playing takes off in 15 minutes,

418
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,560
but it's on the other side of the airport
and we had to like book ass to get to

419
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:40,190
this 10 hour. She's like, don't worry
about it. No, you are. You are behind me.

420
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:44,310
Like 20 steps and I was
running ahead of you. Yeah.

421
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,220
Trying to think what, I'm trying to think
of times I've seen you like a hurried.

422
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,530
You generally like, no, I dunno.
It's you're lucky. It's good.

423
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,220
I don't see myself. Yeah. I mean I'm
definitely not a panic. The person. No,

424
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,480
that's me. That's I'm high anxiety
and I tend to panic more. Definitely.

425
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,700
You need a good balance.
Yeah. Good balance. Anyways,

426
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,450
talk about your dumps.
Let's talk about our dumps.

427
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,030
It's been so crazy. Crazy. Yeah.

428
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,550
I'm really,
it's been quite an active,

429
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,100
my valve has been active
for the last few weeks.

430
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,200
We've been eating Paleo
these last few weeks and man,

431
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:32,220
the browns are just ridiculous.
It's just all these nutrients.

432
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,350
Everything's clean,
you know,

433
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,630
clean eating and it's a minimum
three a day. But here's the thing.

434
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,770
No slaps.

435
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,650
No, it's not sloppy. [inaudible]
they're just like, yeah, you're healthy.

436
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,240
And the glide ride their gliders.

437
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,210
And I think that's been the
key to my hemorrhoid relief.

438
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,120
I don't have hemorrhoids anymore.
You're eating great. Yeah.

439
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,380
I'm not to push the Brown.

440
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,660
Isn't it nice just slides right down three
times a day? No, I go on. I go, no, no.

441
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,310
I go in the morning. Once in
the morning, but it's just easy.

442
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,490
Like I just sit down in the
brown just slides down. Huh?

443
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,410
Multiples. I know. It's just
unbelief and they're normal.

444
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,730
They're like full normal. I'm
like, how is there this fives? No,

445
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,000
like fours, three for three
and a half, four, five.

446
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:21,410
Is Lute looser on the Bristol stool
chart? These are like healthy. No,

447
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,310
but you're like,
how is there this much inside of me?

448
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,021
I know.

449
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:28,610
And then I like to weigh myself before
and after just to see how it's a really

450
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:31,040
neat,
always weigh yourself after a doubt.

451
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,250
Oh my God. I have something
so amazing. Um, I've,

452
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,310
this guy has sent in,
um,

453
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,200
prank calls before Fort Simpson and he,

454
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:48,550
uh, he sent one here. Um, the talent,

455
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:51,020
I tell you if he's so good,
Fort Simpson

456
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,990
tell you that prank calls and stuff.
Um, it's so hard. Like how do they,

457
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,050
how do you prepare that stuff? How
do you know? Do you know what I mean?

458
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:00,820
When the person says something
in the moment and you're like,

459
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:04,000
I have to find the button to put like
how the fuck do you do that so fast?

460
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,100
This is

461
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,190
not a simple set up.

462
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,460
The ones that he does elaborate.
So I mean, it's really dedicated.

463
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:16,250
It's like writing a song. I know. And
you can listen to his a prank call album.

464
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,263
Um,

465
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,500
it's at Fort simpson.bandcamp.com.

466
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,460
He's got a bunch of calls on
there in addition to some,

467
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,830
um, why mh one. So here is
this latest one. Holy Shit.

468
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,740
And that thing is free. By the way,
I'm going to mute this because the, uh,

469
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,380
the link like, yeah. Yeah.
This, this is so good.

470
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:42,190
I realized that we've
sometimes it with interruption,

471
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:43,510
they should be uninterrupted.

472
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,200
So I'll mute our lines
and you can hear this.

473
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,360
Bart Simpson and this would call
uses top dog, uh, my dad and uh,

474
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:54,490
I'll just let it play.
Enjoy.

475
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,643
Hey Man,

476
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,080
what's your question there? Are you
guys use over there for your truck nuts?

477
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,450
I'm not following you,

478
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,320
but see as all hear your thing and uh,

479
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,920
polysulfide Oh,
is that good to put on skin?

480
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,830
You know, I couldn't tell you cause
I don't do that. Yep. You know,

481
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:22,480
I don't know what they're made out of.

482
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:27,140
Let me see if it even tells me
it my computer system. Ah, but,

483
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,480
but those truck nuts, I
couldn't, you know, it's hard
to say, but let's see here.

484
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,330
I'm hearing my own garage trying to
make my custom truck nuts and my daddy's

485
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:40,400
about to pass away.
He don't got too much longer live.

486
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,890
It's always been a big fan of truck
nuts and I figured the best way to

487
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,790
commemorate him.
Answer.

488
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Remember what an awesome man he was
was just get a nice cast of his balls.

489
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,170
Right? Well, I'm not sure.

490
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,630
Joe's speakerphone.
I got my hands full over here.

491
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,490
This is my dad talk though.

492
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,320
Hey Buddy, how you doing?
I'm doing a fantastic,

493
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,210
can I bring up a question
here that I have on my mind?

494
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,480
G boobs are really gigantic.
If you Google g boobs,

495
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,190
we'll find some big books.
Okay.

496
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,680
There's anything Monday,

497
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,370
large store bee gees size sloppers.
What was it

498
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,000
dad did she fart?
This is another bad

499
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,480
smells. Terrible. We all have our
own fingerprint in the intestines.

500
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,373
Yep.

501
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,233
Hey Daddy,

502
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,980
remember that time you took a dump on top
of that shit pile in the backyard or I

503
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:47,814
remember that.

504
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,620
There you go.
That's an 18 wheeler Jill there.

505
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,460
Me and my dad have a have a shit
pile going all the back yard.

506
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,050
We had to go for past year now.

507
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,790
Yeah, it was gigantic.
Well that's why they make,

508
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:06,090
those are newer things that scoop them up.
Then you get,

509
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,860
then you got one of those loans.

510
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,640
Are they causing little wagons that
they use the haul that shit away?

511
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,200
Oh,
say that again.

512
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,210
I can't help it. My just, mine's
always spontaneous. Spur of the moment.

513
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,410
His balls are hanging through the heavy.
They're a big bowl of plaster.

514
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,290
Well that's one way of hanging around
town. Oh, it's an interesting spot.

515
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,610
Uh, polyurethane is, but it says

516
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:37,880
they,

517
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,880
why you believe in luck yet since ever
is a health these truck nuts work out.

518
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,300
I think I'm all pursued
making little one for women.

519
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,860
You'd be the first

520
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,090
women drive trucks too. Your miles will
hit both sides of the market, you know?

521
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,520
Yeah. I don't know how you're
going to make those for that,

522
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,670
but that'd be a good one.
Yeah.

523
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,990
I'm thinking about doing
truck cuts for ladies.

524
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,380
Start making truck
Lavia from our grandmas.

525
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,880
Well that's how you're
going to have to make the,

526
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:14,260
push the balls and make that work.

527
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,580
Thanks for all the help that are booked.
You guys have a good one.

528
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,710
Oh my God. That was really
good. Bart Simpson. I love that.

529
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:30,010
He um, he got that breathing
joke in there. Just the way I

530
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,140
try. You also got the guy laughing
and it did top talk laugh.

531
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,610
So they had like dad laughing
together at like dad jokes

532
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:46,140
the victim laughs. Oh, so dumb.

533
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:51,310
So good. He has another one that I,
I'm saving for next week, but uh,

534
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,170
another incredible one that
he made. Pretty funny. Yeah.
Really good. Thank you.

535
00:33:56,171 --> 00:33:59,740
Fart Simpson. Um, go to, like I said,

536
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:03,760
Fart simpson.com,
or excuse me,

537
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,230
Fart Simpson's dot bandcamp.com and
you can listen to his prank calls.

538
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,320
Very, very good stuff in d gene. Uh,

539
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,930
it looks like people are
continuing to make FTC or Gtd.

540
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,780
Fgd Rdt. No, that'd be our TV.

541
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:25,960
This is the wrong graphic.
Somebody screwed up. Oh,

542
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,090
she tea RTD. That
doesn't seem right. Yeah.

543
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,890
Other people have submitted their guesses.

544
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,690
Fake Guy tits really teased dicks.

545
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,490
The flaming gay tinks ride.
Tremendous.

546
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,240
That's from a proud female fan rate.
Forrest Gump.

547
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,540
The rape to discuss Justin famish
get Thomas Rectum Troy delicious.

548
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,450
Steve and feels great.
Remove Phil's field.

549
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:59,050
Great tits removed that denim.
Jason, the mystery continues.

550
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:04,051
No one has been able to solve
what that standard JT RTD means.

551
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:09,190
And it's open to interpretation.
It is open to interpretation. Um,

552
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,340
real quick gene, oh, a couple people, um,

553
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,050
wanted clarity on a couple of
things here, um, that we can get to.

554
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,690
One was,
uh,

555
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,750
some people had some blow back on our
fat shaming and I just want it to be

556
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,570
clear. I thought it was clear. So,

557
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,810
but sometimes you got to hold people's
hands through a conversations when they

558
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:38,100
don't understand like what parts serious,
what parts of joke. I think what,

559
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,690
you know, at least what I was
trying to say was that a, um,

560
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,090
I don't think you should just obviously
ever just go harass somebody for their

561
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:51,960
weight. No, I was saying that
fat shaming was effective,

562
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,610
but I also embraced it, you know?
Yeah. Um, the other thing was like,

563
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:59,340
some people were like, yeah, but, uh,

564
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,000
are you trying to say that like
you're not fat? So they know I'm,

565
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,670
I've always said that
I'm still fat and that I,

566
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:10,770
but I'm actively working on it,
so I, I try to eat healthier.

567
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:15,220
I obviously exercise all
the time. And for me, um,

568
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,300
I don't reject fat shaming because I
had an experience with it now that I do

569
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:24,120
think you should, you know,
you shouldn't, like I said,

570
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,100
attack somebody for being fat.

571
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,100
I'm just of the mindset
that is not good to be fat.

572
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,110
Don't act like it's a positive
thing. And you know, if you want,

573
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,050
if you're looking for a tactic
that may or may not work for you,

574
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,520
I enjoyed fat shaming.

575
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,620
It works for you as a fantastic go out
and like fat shame people all over the

576
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:44,454
place.

577
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,700
No, I would ask you, and I don't
advocate know, shitting on people.

578
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:54,200
Oh, it's not that. I think first of all,
I'm overweight now too. I just had a baby,

579
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:57,490
so I'm fat shaming myself
every day to get it back down.

580
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,830
You mean we don't do it on the Shawl Tan,

581
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,170
but it's all we talk about with
ourselves is just like, fuck

582
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,680
yeah.

583
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,300
Well here's why I personally don't
think it should be celebrated to be

584
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:15,220
overweight because being overweight is
not a healthy option. Yeah, that's true.

585
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,930
So, for instance, um,

586
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,250
I know they have like magazine covers now
a cosmopolitan has a really overweight

587
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,260
model on there and it's like celebrate,

588
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:27,580
like she's obese and that's not,
I don't think that that's,

589
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,070
yeah, I understand curvy normal
yet. Got It. Got It. Good. Uh,

590
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,460
but I don't think as a lifestyle
that that should be encouraged. Yeah.

591
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,660
I would say that. But should we actively
share on people know, dude, of course not.

592
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,930
Yeah. No, I don't think it
should be celebrated. Like, uh,

593
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,860
you're clearly embracing an
unhealthy lifestyle. Good for you.

594
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,880
Like I don't think that's cool.

595
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,740
No. And I don't, I don't either.
So it's like I don't advocate, um,

596
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,310
don't harass people just
because they're fat. No,

597
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,840
but what I'm saying is like,

598
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:01,230
when people write off fat shaming as a
horrible thing to do, I'm like, yeah,

599
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:02,064
I don't think so.

600
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,660
And the reason I said I don't think so
is because I've experienced it and I

601
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,550
actually feel like it was
a pretty good motivator.

602
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:08,931
Yeah.

603
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,600
Some of the best thing that sometimes
the best thing that can happen to you is

604
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:16,420
one, a family member or a friend. He's
like, dude, you need to, you need to ring.

605
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,790
I'll tell you the difference.
When I was much younger and fat and,

606
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,340
uh, like I told you, Latins are like this,

607
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:27,880
and I would go to Peru and they
would fat shaming. I would reject it.

608
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,050
I would be like, fuck, I would, you know,
I wouldn't embrace it. Yeah, I would.

609
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:35,500
But I also think that I was being very
much in denial at that time. Yeah.

610
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,160
I was in denial. They were telling me, you
need to lose weight. And I was like, no,

611
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:43,450
I don't fuck them, you know, and that,
but the truth is they were right.

612
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,500
I did need to lose weight because being
heavier contributes to heart disease to

613
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,590
a whole host of unhealthy and
denial's a strong, strong thing.

614
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,410
So that was like, that was kind
of, I dunno for me, uh, uh,

615
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,850
kind of a lesson. No, just
growing in life. When,

616
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:05,680
when it was brought to my attention 15
years later, I was like, yeah, yeah,

617
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:08,980
they're right. You know, let's look up
what being overweight does to your body.

618
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,240
I know. I think we, we, we don't
need to, I think we all get that.

619
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:16,810
It's probably bad for everything.
You know, it's, it's bad.

620
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,630
It's bad for your cardiovascular
system. It's, it's, you know,

621
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,970
even my knees when I was,

622
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:26,971
I'm horse joints pain that
people experience in their back,

623
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:31,350
ankles, knee, all, all that can be related
to being overweight. It's cholesterol.

624
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,610
Yeah, of course. No,
there's, there's nothing.

625
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,260
You don't think that's just helps you
survive an overdose. That's it. That's the

626
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,200
Chris severe car accident.
There's a TV show we watch being,

627
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,580
being overweight saved my life on
TLC and this lady was like, well,

628
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:50,320
because I had 50 extra pounds on me.

629
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:55,110
The seatbelt like didn't cut through me
basically. And there's another good one,

630
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:59,590
like, so there's the possibility that
you don't wear a seatbelt when you drive.

631
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,250
And a, you might live through a
car accident instead of being,

632
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,890
instead of being hurled out of the car,
you might get wedged in it.

633
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,700
So there's the other big plus. All
right, so that's that. The other one, uh,

634
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,910
for some of you dumb dumbs is,
uh,

635
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,630
so many fucking idiots is a,
the Louis CK concert.

636
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,690
Really listen to what you say,
listen to what they want to hear.

637
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,390
And I've already experienced it many times
when they take things out of context,

638
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:29,740
it's like, you know, like when we bring
up other people, other celebrities,

639
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,210
and they're like,
why are you comparing the two?

640
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:35,680
It's like we're talking about what
has happened for the last year,

641
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:41,070
other celebrities and the differences
between what they're accused of.

642
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,270
We were probably one of the most
vocal people about the fact that it's

643
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:51,271
ridiculous to come to actually mention
him as someone that you would compare

644
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,250
what they did. Uh, uh,

645
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,650
Louie did with like what Harvey Weinstein
or Kevin Spacey did mentioning them in

646
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:08,320
the same breath as like, hey, these
guys are all abusers is not fair.

647
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:11,890
It's rich, ridiculous, different
shades of gray of course.

648
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,800
So we can't make it equal.

649
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,740
What you can talk guide as
it's their fucking, yeah,

650
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,320
you can talk about entertainers and
like this guy did this, this guy that.

651
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,970
But that doesn't mean we're saying what
he did was equal to what this guy did.

652
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,770
I mean it obviously isn't and I think
the people who think it's okay to equate

653
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:34,280
them are actually really doing
harm to that whole movement

654
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:39,080
by saying that like what he did is the
same and you should treat those guys the

655
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,510
same. It's really not. We're
talking about like violence,

656
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:44,470
sexual crimes versus his perversion cause.

657
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,620
I think the more specific we can get
in terms of defining those gray areas,

658
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,910
that makes the movement way more
lasting way. More of an impact.

659
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:56,000
If you can start really getting into the
legal nitty gritty of it and being like,

660
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:59,270
well what is it that Louis C k? I said,
well let's, let's get into it man.

661
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,300
Let's define it. And that way the
next time it happens to a woman,

662
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,380
we can really go after the motherfucker,
right? They're not all the same,

663
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,390
of course are not the same.
And it's like peep.

664
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:12,590
Some people were like thought
like you're serious about,

665
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:16,970
he should move to friends. Like do you
really need to be explained the that part,

666
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,400
but you're not being serious about that.
He should move to France. Yeah. No,

667
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,080
I think the, there's two different issues
that we discussed on this show. Right?

668
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,590
There's those levels of seriousness
of what this person has done.

669
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:32,540
We weren't talking about that last week.
We're talking about is the PR here. Yeah.

670
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,670
I mean that was my,

671
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,420
like I'm somebody who we're not even
getting into what's the evil of it.

672
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,640
I'm somebody who has always been like,

673
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,490
I'll just say like I've
been a huge fan of his,

674
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,780
a big admirer of his ability
and talent. Like he's, to me,

675
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,020
one of the greatest, you
know, and when he did,

676
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:54,680
when he came out and did what he did
and you know, had to, to go away,

677
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,480
it made sense to me.

678
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:02,050
I always thought there's a path to
redemption for him. Right. Like that.

679
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,560
That to me it was like, that makes
sense. What he did was a bad swing.

680
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,410
It is come backable.
That's what it is.

681
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,950
And Cosby not come back up again,
come back, you're gone. So I'm like,

682
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,970
that makes sense. He's going away.
There is a path to redemption.

683
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,410
And to me the surprising thing
was not that he did stand up,

684
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,210
it's that he managed the optics so poorly.
To me,

685
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:28,550
that's the part that stood out.
It's just that I go,

686
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:32,390
this is a really smart guy on top of being
a really talented guy and when you're

687
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:35,510
really smart and really
talented and really influential,

688
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,450
there's a higher standard for you.
It's just the way it is,

689
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,700
whether you like it or not.
It's just the way it is.

690
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,950
For him to get onstage after this
break in this climate, in this time,

691
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,880
and be like, no statement,
no addressing things,

692
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:54,740
no like donation,
no own op ed piece about it.

693
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,400
That to me was just a lot of just like
what, you're not going to do any of those?

694
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:03,200
That seems like PR 101 so
that's the part that to me,

695
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,710
you stood out and that is a
discussion we had last week.

696
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,400
It's more about the startling
lack of awareness. Yeah.

697
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,040
Social climate and being like,
I'm just going to do this.

698
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,060
Let's talk about cookies and
candy and like, Whoa Bro,

699
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:22,061
you guys that don't get that by the way
are equally like as out of out of touch

700
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:28,340
with what's going.
Like you seem that out of out of touch,

701
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,480
you seem that disconnected and you're
actually, if you're a huge fan of his,

702
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:37,230
you're doing a him more
harm by being like,

703
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:38,860
so what you still just to like,

704
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,560
because you're actually fueling the fire
of the blow back of the people who are

705
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,340
like never again.
You're making that grow when you're like,

706
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,120
so it didn't do anything and I help him.
First of all,

707
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:55,860
it hasn't been positively received in
our community from what I gather. No,

708
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,610
the p the press has been really bad on it.
Um,

709
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,670
it just shows a lack of awareness and
it does show kind of an obliviousness to

710
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:05,370
the culture, to the climate
is when I'm saying of course,

711
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,300
regardless of whether or not you think
it's what he did is wrong or how wrong or

712
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:13,080
shitty do Stan who get like
as somebody like I remain,

713
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,840
I remain a big fan of course.

714
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:20,870
And I'll tell you all I hope that he
does is digest what's currently going on

715
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:28,310
and take those steps now so that he can
go back with like having put forth a

716
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,420
huge effort and said like,
you know,

717
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:38,340
I checked all the boxes so that people
who are fans go see like, you know,

718
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,120
you're a good guy.
Yeah.

719
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,840
I took all the steps and I think
that's what Americans love.

720
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,850
They love an apology. They love and
they love a come to Jesus and apology.

721
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,560
They love to think that you're a good guy.
Yes. So if you know this about America,

722
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,120
yeah. Give them, take a
page of the Michael Vick.

723
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,920
Vick was like, yes, he went to prison.
He could have come out of prison,

724
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:05,670
like suck my practic for life.
And instead he like,

725
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:10,350
he partnered with the humane
society, you know, he um, he made it,

726
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:14,460
he made donations. He filed for, I
forget whether it's seven or chapter,

727
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:19,020
whatever one where instead of
like doing a way with his debts,

728
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,090
he made it so that he had to pay
back his debts almost in full.

729
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,730
You know, and it's like, it's
like why is that important?

730
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,270
It just makes people go like,
oh, you're not a piece of shit.

731
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,020
Like he did it for himself,
but he also did it so that people go like,

732
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,290
you know what? You did a horrible
thing. But like you're a pretty good,

733
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,480
Americans love to forgive. Of course,
we're Christians. We love a good apology.

734
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,790
That's the part that I go like, what
do you do? Well, here's the thing.

735
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:45,541
Some people say,
well,

736
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:49,350
he already apologized in that letter
and how many times does he have to

737
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,131
apologize?
Well,

738
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:54,570
as many times as it is necessary to
make the women that he harmed feel

739
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:57,240
something. Right. And look, it's just,

740
00:46:57,241 --> 00:47:01,330
it's from a fucking PR perspective,
dummy. Yeah. It's just a,

741
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,670
it was a dumb fucking deal.

742
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:09,020
Do all this shit that Americans like, go
donate money to the women's, blah, blah,

743
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:10,650
blah. You know, and I'll show,

744
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,570
I'll show that you fucking give
a shit and then come back. Yeah.

745
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,120
That's the way to do it. And I do
have this, I know that Tmz and uh,

746
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,630
NBC, they're all going to take this from
us and hopefully they'll credit. Um,

747
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,450
we actually got in touch with
somebody who was on the street.

748
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,560
I guess that's does it Macdougal street
where the club is right after the show.

749
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:32,990
Wow.

750
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,990
They found someone who was walking out
right after the show and it just hasn't

751
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,660
made it anywhere else.
But here.

752
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,560
So this is that post that
Luis said at the cellar.

753
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,210
Pretty incredible stuff here.

754
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,850
So you were at the Louis CK show.
What'd you think?

755
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,000
How big his Dick was?
Real?

756
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,460
Did he masturbate each
act dog board drill.

757
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,940
Wow. Was it a lot? Yeah.

758
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,080
Yeah.
Hot white come.

759
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:14,560
That's really something and it
makes me wish I'd seen him or dread.

760
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,990
Wow. That's incredible.
That's really something. Oh

761
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,070
man, we need a, yeah, Pretty Wild, Huh?

762
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,400
Pretty good stuff there.
Hot and thick. Come,

763
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,660
I didn't know that men
really were invested in the
hotness and the thickness of

764
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:35,200
it. It makes a difference,
doesn't it? Are you more,

765
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,590
are you happier when it's hotter and
thicker? I've never know. I mean,

766
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:41,980
the thickness. Some I never
think about temperature. I
mean, sometimes you go like,

767
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:45,850
wow, this is really, really kind of thin.

768
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,260
And what does that do? You
know, does that mean anything?

769
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,600
It feels like it's you've,

770
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,950
you're draining yourself like thickness
usually I think to people goes like, oh,

771
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:57,550
I'm backed up. This has been sitting in
others. There's more swimmers in that.

772
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:00,400
Yeah. You're like, I'm really
producing some stuff. Well, no,

773
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:05,190
just like I haven't emptied the tank. Oh,
so it's darker cloudier Saudi or brine.

774
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,680
Yeah. And then when it's real thin, you're
like, man, I need to put this thing away.

775
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,080
Something's going on. Um,
do you know where you are? A
big John Landis Fan, right?

776
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,880
Sure. Who's the director of? Oh, right.
No, I don't know. What did he make?

777
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,510
John Landis has an incredibly, he's
like an eighties guy. Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,740
I love eighties movies.
Let's see him. Ivan Reitman.

779
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,930
Yeah.
Fam Course.

780
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,350
I love the woman a Amy Heckerling.

781
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,790
That woman pretty much made every movie
I've ever loved from the eighties and

782
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,390
nineties. Clueless. She did fast times
at Ridgemont, high European vacation.

783
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,700
All good films.
Um,

784
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,530
so here's some John Landis
stuff. Tiny. I know the name,

785
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:51,880
but I like animal house, the
Blues Brothers, all blues
brothers. Great places.

786
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:54,950
Yes.
A twilight zone.

787
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,580
The movie he directed thriller.

788
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:03,190
No spies like us. Love
that movie. Amigos. Yes.

789
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,450
One little movie called coming to America
for my favorite comedy of all time.

790
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:11,470
Definitely. He made Beverly
Hills cop three. Great.

791
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,230
He May, let's see. Oh No, actually it's
the third one. Great. Probably not.

792
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,430
Um, but whatever. I mean that's a
pretty insane list as it is. Right?

793
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,260
Those are a lot of home runs, dude. Yeah.
Coming to America as a perfect comedy,

794
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:29,360
I think. Yeah, that's pretty
Ghostbusters pretty much. Anyways,

795
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:32,060
this is him and I don't know
when this interview took place,

796
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:34,970
but I thought you might like this.
Check this out.

797
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,670
Like my brother and I went
and stayed with them and we,

798
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,510
we met Bundy for the first time.
Bundy told me,

799
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,300
you know the first line
that Bundy told you that,

800
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,890
but the first line of every
Hungarian recipe steal a chicken.

801
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,380
Yes. That's something my
grandfather would say to.

802
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,410
And then he's got more,

803
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:59,030
my grandfather was crazy about Hungarians
Darien's who are the really the

804
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:03,880
Hungarian Polish or the people who
really founded Hollywood. But the, uh,

805
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,750
sell it though. We continue to
think about Hungaria this though.

806
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,570
There's also a Gary.

807
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:13,571
It is someone who comes into a revolving
door behind you and exits in front of

808
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,090
me.

809
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,580
Hey, sounds like he's got some
pen up. Uh, yeah. What's the deal?

810
00:51:18,581 --> 00:51:20,900
Is Land is a hunger.
I don't know if he's a hunger.

811
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:24,280
I think he's definitely talking
to some shit, some shit.

812
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,220
Landis problem. You
know what I mean? That's

813
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,340
first line of every Hungarian recipe.
Steal a chicken.

814
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,360
How dare you know? That's kind of
like when you don't like a group.

815
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,720
Can you say it with a smile
and you put it in jokes,

816
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:42,370
but I don't think he's a fan. How dare
he? How dare he Hungarian shame me. Yeah.

817
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,880
This is racist. I'm finally
experiencing racism. Just is. Yeah.

818
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,300
He's just feels terrible.
And we're going to look,

819
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:51,730
we're going to break here in a moment,
but I've got to tell you, this is amazing.

820
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,830
You're never believed. Check
his privilege. Check your
privilege. John Landis talk,

821
00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:00,160
talking shit about
toxic shows. Um, Landis.

822
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,970
Guess who's been listening to the show?
Oh,

823
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,960
well I'll let you watch and listen.
Okay.

824
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,380
You're going to die when
you see who it is. Okay.

825
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:16,330
There's a some outstanding folks
I can tell. They look very smart.

826
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,180
Okay. I miss him there. He's visiting.

827
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,380
Check out. I don't want somebody
laughing at me or saying I don't belong.

828
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,110
Pulled up so you don't try it out.

829
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,110
Try it out.
Right.

830
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,060
Former president Barack Obama.

831
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,430
Barack Hussein Obama. Play it again. I
tried it out. I can't believe it. Yeah.

832
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,900
Yeah, there's some, you
beat me. Try it out. I mean,

833
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,870
clearly that's a direct,
try it out.

834
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:53,700
I direct reference and he's doing it. He's
doing the show house. It'll try it out.

835
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,410
She couldn't be any,
any more of on man.

836
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:03,720
Try it out. So there it is. 44 is a fan.

837
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,550
Um, wow. Uh, yeah. Thank
you miss him in a way,

838
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:13,110
like just his personality. Politics
aside. I just miss having like a calm,

839
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:16,200
rational person lead. He's got a good
personality, I don't think. Yeah.

840
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,800
Knock his personality for sure. That's
what I'm saying. Like politics aside,

841
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,760
I just liked brack and Michelle. Yeah.
It's part of being a politician as being,

842
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,400
you know, super likable, likable,

843
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,630
nice teeth. I both had good teeth.
Got good teeth. Yeah. Those dogs,

844
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:35,160
those Portuguese water dogs. Nice. That's
right. What does it bow right? Oh yeah.

845
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:39,660
That was the, I don't know. I think Bose
dead now. Those dead, I'm not sure. Yeah.

846
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,610
Um, do you want to break now?
You want to Sasha Malia? Ooh,

847
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:47,130
I want to say something or you want
to take a break? No, no, let's do it.

848
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:51,690
Let's keep rolling. Okay. Um, this, I also
found this morning and made me so happy.

849
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:55,820
You know, when you just are filled with
joy at seeing something pulled off. Yeah.

850
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,270
This fucking guy,

851
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:03,110
he's Asian and he was at a Mcdonald's
and he relies on the walls like of there

852
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:06,660
like posters. It's just white
people. And he was like,

853
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:11,180
I feel like we're underrepresented.
So he made his own poster. Oh good.

854
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,690
And he put it up at that Mcdonald's
and they haven't taken it down.

855
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,500
So your hands are underrepresented
too? It's uh, it's pretty amazing.

856
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,890
I just kind of skim through his video,
but like, oh my God. So he ordered,

857
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,060
this is this kid. He, uh,
he's at Mcdonald's, you know,

858
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:35,061
he notices like this empty wall and he
notices that the posters are just like,

859
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:38,760
you know, white kids. So
he has a picture made,

860
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,710
he throws logos on and he orders it
from like a whatever. What is it called?

861
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,590
The Kinko's or whatever that makes,

862
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,500
that's Rad.
I have to

863
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,210
look at that. Oh, that's awesome.

864
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:00,840
It's like, and he threw like the
same graphics that they have on it.

865
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:05,640
Yeah. Same stupid. And they
throw a Mcdonald's logo at
the bottom here. It's great.

866
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:10,240
And then, and we made a date with
other friends to go hang it up.

867
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,270
The Big Day was upon us. I loaded
the post stroke, my dad's car,

868
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,950
I met our friends there. I'm there. This,

869
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:27,360
I wore a jacket covering my uniform and
wait until the coast was clear from any

870
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:28,530
employees.
He also,

871
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:33,720
he got, he went to a thrift store. Yeah.
And he got to Mcdonald's like an old meat,

872
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,270
like a Mcdonald's shirt that was there.

873
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:40,310
And then he made a laminate that said like
regional. Oh, you know, um, I don't know.

874
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:44,180
Oh, so he's like, I'm, I'm the
corporate bubble by as this new artwork.

875
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,390
Just think place though.
Like he didn't actually introduce himself.

876
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,660
How's The coast is clear? I would take
off my jacket toe Christian, Cassandra,

877
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,590
how to visit you.
That's him

878
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,773
regional.

879
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,500
Teary. Your directory.
That's it. Totally made up.

880
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,060
I love it. It is [inaudible]
it was up. Oh, I need a second.

881
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,740
Okay, so we put the poster up and
I gotta change my shirt. I'm so,

882
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:30,550
I'm like over the main
Cassandra.

883
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,810
This is Christine.
I'm shaking.

884
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,640
I'm changing right now.
Okay. I got this. It's okay.

885
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,470
Right? That was something, wow,

886
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:52,240
that's been upset. I really, oh,

887
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,440
it's been a few weeks.

888
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,040
No one noticed works there that
they added this poster and it's,

889
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,390
it'd be like if we took a picture of
ourselves and you put it up there,

890
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,000
no one said anything. He, he tweeted
today. That's how I found out about this.

891
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,950
It's been 51 days.
51 days.

892
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:17,070
This guy made a poster of himself and
his friend trying to put it up in and

893
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,640
Mcdonald's. Yeah. That's
so good. So great.

894
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,690
I love it. I know. It made me so happy,
so much. Seriously. Watch this today.

895
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:26,180
I was just,

896
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,270
they'll never take it down.
Remember folks,

897
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,590
all races deserve recognition.
Okay. Lab and I guess I did my part

898
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,600
and that's like,
they're just eating at them underneath.

899
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,330
Do we know where in the world this
is? I don't know. They do this.

900
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:52,180
You can see this video. This
guy's a youtube channel. It's, um,

901
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,640
his name is j. E. V. H. Oh my
God. Or you can just search.

902
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:02,650
We became Mcdonald's poster models,
I guess Jeff.

903
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,850
Anyway, I fucking love.
So amazing. I'm loving it.

904
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,853
Ah,

905
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,810
that's so awesome. Yeah,
they're right though. I mean,

906
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:17,670
Mcdonald's is around the world.
It's not just white people. I mean,

907
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,220
you can go pretty much anywhere in the
world and there's Mcdonald's. There's no,

908
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:23,920
you can go everywhere. Yeah.
No, they're, it's an, it's a,

909
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,520
that's probably only not in
Antarctica. It's everywhere. I know.

910
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,630
It's pretty amazing. Right.
And do you know that? I mean
they, yeah. Anyway, they can,

911
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,160
they can build one in like
less than a week or something
crazy. I know. Let's see.

912
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,340
How many Mcdonald's,
um,

913
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:42,840
locations are there?
Let's see.

914
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:48,240
Mcdonald's restaurants
are in 120 countries and
territories. Uh, they operate,

915
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,900
there's 36,000,
899 right now.

916
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,460
Yeah.
Crazy.

917
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,590
That is nuts. Here is the list.
That's pretty funny. Oh my God. See?

918
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:03,090
Pretty much everywhere.
South Africa was going to ask love Africa,

919
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,420
Africa that does that. But there is like,
what is this? This is in Africa and Asia.

920
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,010
It's fucking crazy. Oh yeah. South Africa.
Mom's straight. Leah. I've eaten it a few.

921
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:16,630
They're all over South America it looks
like, except for whatever that is.

922
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,200
America number one. That is,
it's embarrassing. Which one
do you know? I don't know.

923
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:22,310
This one.
He was at believes.

924
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,190
I don't know. I don't fucking
know, but they're everywhere else.

925
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:29,520
It's been a while since seventh
grade. Yeah, it would opa.

926
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:34,180
Yeah. Even those dirty
roof skis. How's he too?

927
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:40,070
Yeah. It's a lot. Pretty
impressive stuff. Yeah.

928
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,890
I'm really,
I'm really amazed by what those you,

929
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,880
but you would think that Mcdonald's will
be really up on that multicultural tab.

930
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:50,150
You know, I just think it's funny that
the manager is that Mcdonald's was like,

931
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,620
oh yeah, they finally got that poster
taken care of that wall. Hey, now,

932
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,700
but people are generally very
unobservant now let's see what happened,

933
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,970
because this is the kind of
thing that that tweet went viral.

934
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,530
They're going to figure out
where that is the coupe.

935
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:08,630
The cool thing is that Mcdonald's
could make it really cool and be like,

936
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,070
hey, you know, we discovered that this
was at this and celebrate it and be like,

937
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,761
guess what?

938
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:17,990
That poster staying up and we're going
to give you free French fries for a year

939
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:22,220
or whatever. Or they could be like,
ah, it's not okay to do that. You know,

940
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,260
vandalism. Yeah. I hope they,

941
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:28,440
I hope they back to PR kind of
manage it in a smart way, you know,

942
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,420
I think makes me happier than
clever vandalism. I know it really,

943
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:37,410
I swear it just tickles my little
taint. I just love it. You know,

944
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:41,410
even something as small as in um, in
school when he used to have, I dunno,

945
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:46,430
they have textbooks anymore and you
could take your eraser and like erase the

946
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:51,450
eyeball on somebody's picture and then
draw a bigger one and like do shit like

947
01:00:51,451 --> 01:00:51,781
that.

948
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:56,781
And so like the next kid gets to your
talents and are just erasing big Dicks,

949
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,460
you know,
you erased it and then you draw the Dick.

950
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,100
There's a poster of a real
estate guy at one of these,

951
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,350
it's like near a high school right here.

952
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,490
And the poster hangs there and they cut
his eyes and they cut his mouth out and

953
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:11,880
he's like,
it looks terrifying.

954
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:15,730
I feel bad for the GAA cause I know he
paid for it and then he replaced it.

955
01:01:15,731 --> 01:01:18,850
But it was like that for a while and
he was like, thanks a lot dick heads.

956
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,070
It's pretty great. But it's
high school kids. You know,

957
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:22,930
they're going to do something like that.
Of course.

958
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,830
Why don't we take a break gene and
uh, we'll be back with our guests. Uh,

959
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,060
Brenda's swab. Brenda, I think
that's her name. Isn't that her name?

960
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,650
You may have heard of the finance here.
Charles Schwab.

961
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,450
He had a daughter Brenda, who recently
transitioned to a man and he's here now.

962
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,220
Brendan Charles Schwab mess things up for
me. I'm sure. Did you look like a man?

963
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,140
Thanks Bro. Good job. Good job. Yeah,

964
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,390
I totally would believe
you. A guy. Yeah. Um,

965
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
real quick before we get
into some other stuff here,

966
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:01,900
I just pulled this up from episode
four 61 of your mom's house.

967
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:05,440
I don't know if you could comment
on this for us at all. He was,

968
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:10,690
then we started talking about
how Tiger Tiger fucking dumb now.

969
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:16,040
Oh no being times, but you hear it. You
had to play this for him. Please do it.

970
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:20,150
Brendan Schaub son's name is
tiger. It is. No, it's not. Yes

971
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,870
it is.
It's a great name.

972
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:27,440
And in this case it's a
nickname. Retinas. This is real.

973
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:39,540
People would have allowed us to get
away with not doing. People tag me.

974
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:40,374
They're like,
yeah,

975
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,450
I'm sorry I forgot your love you.
Here's the thing with that.

976
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,230
This little dude has everything,
man.

977
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:52,800
He's grown up in silk sheets and Santa
Monica. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

978
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:56,000
Pop was rich. So rich

979
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,870
business is booming, so he's,
he has a good life, right?

980
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,110
I need him not to be
the cool kid in school.

981
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:07,210
I need them to have
something to poke fun at me.

982
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:12,120
Like your name's tiger going to be like
Scott, former UFC fighter. You know,

983
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,810
he's got weird ears. Yes.
Yeah. Like they're not,
there's not a lot that can go,

984
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:17,820
there's not a lot brown.
So I figured,

985
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,300
let me push back from the Wa is always,
you know, naming of something is a child.

986
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,930
Obviously. The big thing it's like
was was the wife cool right away?

987
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:30,120
What's she like?
We had all these names picked out

988
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,033
Max.
Again,

989
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:40,530
that Mexican Tiger Woods is
an example where you're like,

990
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:48,790
oh, I figured that assholes
making a comeback because
he was kind of gone and, uh,

991
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,680
I went here.
We had all these names picked out.

992
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,770
This one's going to flinch up first,

993
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:55,410
but now I want you to sit on it
cause it's different. Cause I,

994
01:03:55,411 --> 01:04:00,060
I don't like regular names like
Jim, Bob just hear me out here.

995
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:05,160
Tiger. And she was like,
what? And I'm like Whoa, face
that I fucking mate. I know,

996
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:08,040
right? Most people don't sit on it
for the night and next one she's like,

997
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:11,340
I'm not mad at. And as soon as she was
like starting to feel it out, boom,

998
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:13,020
that's it.
Tiger patch shop.

999
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,470
What's an Alliant pax packs
after my uncle who passed away.

1000
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,180
Who's a good guy?

1001
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:25,170
He's a real piece of card piece of shit
because I really want this kid to hit it

1002
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:26,004
home.

1003
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,050
This is your mom's house.
Do you think we could,

1004
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,020
he would have left and
everyone would have been like,

1005
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:37,260
how did you not bring up the tiger bit?
No loyalty you have.

1006
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,290
But I also knew that he
wouldn't be like, no, hell no.

1007
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,050
I know I had to tell Rogan's
name was talking to on areas.

1008
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:47,570
You never shot a tiger on my,

1009
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,280
please don't be mean to me about the
phone call when we call it. Okay.

1010
01:04:52,281 --> 01:04:54,840
So it's like a big deal
to reveal the name. Right.

1011
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:57,150
And like sometimes you hold onto it,
you know,

1012
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,630
even let's say you know the name a month
before we held onto the second one.

1013
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:02,460
So the first one I'm saying like,
you know,

1014
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,040
like you'll say you knew
tiger at six months for sure.

1015
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,180
And people will start asking you, do you
know the name? And you might be like, ah,

1016
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,640
not yet. Because you don't
necessarily want to tell every,

1017
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,600
you want them to judge like a new tattoo.
Totally. That's a really good analysis.

1018
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,250
So when people like me like tiger,

1019
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:22,960
that's ridiculous. And then
it burst your bubble. No, it's
cool. Yeah. So, but we, uh,

1020
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,890
we held on forever. We kept, we
kept lying about like, like, Nah,

1021
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:31,070
I've just haven't figured it out. And like
family would be like, you have no, no.

1022
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,660
I'd be like, nope, I haven't thought of
anything. You to creative souls, nothing,

1023
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:37,270
nothing. And then
finally it was, you know,

1024
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:40,570
we're at eight months on the
first kid and a we call weird.

1025
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,990
I remember we were driving and palace
fair days and we pulled over. Oh yeah.

1026
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,210
And my parents and they're like,
oh are you going to tell us the name?

1027
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:50,530
And I was like, let's do it. And you were
so excited. I know. I was so excited.

1028
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:54,160
And my mom is Peruvian, you know, so like
heavy accent. Yeah. And I go, she's like,

1029
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:57,140
tell us the name to me.
All, all right. I go,

1030
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,960
we're naming him and this is verbatim.
How is when I go, we're naming him Ellis.

1031
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,660
And she goes, is he gay? No,

1032
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,080
my unborn son. That's
your SWOT. Is he gay?

1033
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,850
I'm like, well I don't know yet. We
could be. And then she's like, oh,

1034
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:21,090
I'm like the fuck man. He's
like, Hey Leese I'm like that.

1035
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,760
That's your fee. I'm telling
you your grandson's name. No,

1036
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:29,390
she goes [inaudible] like Perry
Ellis. Perry Ellis had aids. Yeah.

1037
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:32,550
Damn mom. No, I don't say I'm
still scarred in the pain.

1038
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,300
Yeah, I don't say shit cause
it's my mother in law. I can't,

1039
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:39,390
I can't talk shit to her the same way he
can. So I, yeah. You know what I'm saying?

1040
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,040
Like it's been really fun to share
this with you. Well, you know my dad,

1041
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:46,220
you know my dad said, uh, when I first
found out I was pregnant, he goes,

1042
01:06:46,221 --> 01:06:47,600
you know what's a good name?

1043
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:53,300
Art Are Sir, which is my dad's name. Yeah.
Cool. Thank you dad. Thank you. Fine.

1044
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,210
I got,
he's hitting the worst man.

1045
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,510
He said it like he was telling
you about a name he heard. Yeah.

1046
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,430
So you know what I mean? It'd
be like you're like, Hey,

1047
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,260
do you know what I actually like
a kind of a cool name is cause I,

1048
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:08,030
I don't hear it like all the time. And
you're like, wait, what? Like her name,

1049
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,650
you go like, you know, the day I
told him my name and they're like,

1050
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,480
that's a cool name. And
you're like, wait a minute,

1051
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,760
are you telling me about
your fucking name right now?

1052
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,700
And that's exactly how he told him that.

1053
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:21,890
I told him when my girlfriend was pregnant
and when I came home and she had like

1054
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,470
the test, I'm like, Oh shit, we got to
call someone and get to tell someone.

1055
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:30,240
And I was like, Oh, I to
call my dad first. My Dad's
like very strict businessman,

1056
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:35,230
like super business where I get all my
work ethic from and I call my dad and I

1057
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:38,910
have it on speaker phone. My girls like
in tears, all excited and I'm like,

1058
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:41,460
watch this. I put, Hey Daddy, what's up?

1059
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:46,020
I go join US pregnant silence.
And he goes,

1060
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,430
Damn, uh, why? No,

1061
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:54,330
you don't have to keep it right click,
I'll call you back. And I went, whoa.

1062
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:57,540
I did not think it was gonna go like that.
He said something like,

1063
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,210
he said something like, well you know,
you don't have to get married, right.

1064
01:08:00,211 --> 01:08:04,450
Or something like it was not good
cause were you guys dating? Yeah,

1065
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,600
we were dating, you know,
for like a year or two.

1066
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:09,670
And that was his opposition to
the, yeah. Why would he say that?

1067
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,660
He was just like damn,
just being practical.

1068
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:14,470
I'm saying like young rapper
or something like that.

1069
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,840
You're an adult, but he
said, man, take it easy.

1070
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,790
You have brothers and sisters.
I have an older brother and his,

1071
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:29,420
does he have children? He does
not. He's a psycho. He's selfish.

1072
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,560
He loves my son, but he, uh, I dunno.
He's a psycho. He's my tournament.

1073
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,790
She's on the road with me. He's like,
oh, really? Yeah, he just really met him.

1074
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,710
I'm sure I met him at that fight. That,
that I shared against you on it. Oh yeah.

1075
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:47,780
I told him like, oh, I forgive you. Didn't
know my son's name. He works against

1076
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:53,530
him now. I would be jumping
up and down for him. I know.

1077
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,190
I just mistakenly thought Matt
Mitrione went to Lsu. So mom, bro,

1078
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,020
sometimes to think about
if I took a fight again,

1079
01:09:00,021 --> 01:09:03,160
I'll come out with a comedy store shirt
and have all my Korean friends with me

1080
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,260
and walk to the ring with
you. Yeah, I went to be sick.

1081
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:11,180
And what if everybody like Tuh Tuh Tuh
further in the joke just made a goofy

1082
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:14,450
faces as they walked in and like a
bunch of clones, a bunch of clowns.

1083
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,280
And I get my password. It's all horrible
at night. I was at a fight when it's,

1084
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:22,730
I want to tell it like a dozen of these
fights, uh, opening for Joe for a while.

1085
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,950
Um, so, and I hardly knew anybody,

1086
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:29,951
but there was a guy one time who came
out in a pink Tutu and his gimmick there

1087
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:34,120
was like a joke and he played
lineman, not Ed Herman. Uh,

1088
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,340
Dave Herman did that maybe,
and he came out to weird song,

1089
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,270
he came back to a weird song and he was
wearing a tutu and everybody was like,

1090
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:45,140
well, he better fucking win because
if you lose on this, it's like,

1091
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:48,770
why are you playing games? It's even
worse. And I think he did lose titty.

1092
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,780
Did you ever see the guys who came out?

1093
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:54,890
It was a Australian or New Zealand cat
and they must have studied all night and

1094
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:59,300
they came out the exact men
in black outfits and did
the dance here come the man

1095
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:03,920
in black. Yeah. Loser with I think key
one you got to win if you do something.

1096
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,910
You know what I mean?
If you're,

1097
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:10,060
if you're not focused on your fight
cause you're doing dance routines,

1098
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,520
then you're a meme for the
next 10 years and if you're,

1099
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:16,820
if you're a whole thing is like
I'm going to wear a pink Tutu.

1100
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,810
You better when you got to win or
you're just crazy. Totally crazy.

1101
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,400
I just had a thought back related to like
telling your parents really important

1102
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,234
stuff in your life.

1103
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,230
Doesn't that make it like be really
cognizant now when your children tell you

1104
01:10:30,231 --> 01:10:35,000
something like just killing sided
just always pretend hurts my feelings.

1105
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:41,210
I've told her a bunch of times about
one of my aunts will be like, um,

1106
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:41,811
you know,

1107
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:46,460
she'll come to a show and when like
other relatives obviously are going to be

1108
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:49,790
like you were great, you know the
way a relative does, she'll be like,

1109
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:52,700
I thought everyone was great though.
She'll make the point,

1110
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:55,700
they don't get how bad that
hurts me as an athlete or comic.

1111
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,800
You're sensitive man. Of course.
I remember you saying that.

1112
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:01,790
That just when I played at University of
Colorado had to sit out a year so I red

1113
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,910
shirted so I went playing the
games, not suit up. I remember,

1114
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:07,880
I won't say what family member it is cause
we get pissed and so all the families

1115
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:10,970
there were all the players go and
I went and they're like, oh my God,

1116
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:14,100
you played so great. That
was fantastic. I was all

1117
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,130
fuck you man. I get
hurt. My feelings so bad.

1118
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:21,360
Or I remember my first time my mom saw
me do stand up was at the laugh factory

1119
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,480
at the laugh factory and
sports. It's horrible. Oh my
God. I come out and I go to,

1120
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:30,780
you get it. I go, do you guys
have fun? Goes my mom was, it was,

1121
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:33,920
it was an interesting, you know, and she's
changed it real fast. You went, yeah,

1122
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,220
I saw Kevin Nealon though.

1123
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,170
No,
the right answer is you are fantastic.

1124
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:43,930
I'm so proud of you for trying
something. Yeah. You know,

1125
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,540
my mom's side's me. She saw
me in the belly room and I
did. Well, I didn't do like,

1126
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:52,410
I didn't eat shit. I didn't kill. I did
okay. And she's like, Van, you know,

1127
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:55,700
it's not like what you
are saying is funny.

1128
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:59,900
I like how you say it. And
I was like, thank you. Thank
you. Was that even at that,

1129
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,360
it also gave me like, um, even now,
like God, my dad would be like,

1130
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,733
I,
uh,

1131
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:11,740
I pay attention to the audience and the
moments that they laugh and where they

1132
01:12:11,751 --> 01:12:16,070
don't like that one thing,
they didn't laugh. Oh my God,

1133
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:20,860
he does. Or if I give, like if I do like
pho anger, you know, it's not like, yeah,

1134
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,080
fuck this shit. He's like, I
don't know if I would do that.

1135
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,390
Thank you for the notes. I'm glad to
hear. Thank you Chris Rock for the notes.

1136
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,810
We got to get him doing movie reviews
on this show. That'd be hilarious. Um,

1137
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,110
oh wait, wasn't it? Oh, you know what I
love when he tells you to do, he's like,

1138
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:39,970
you know what you should do buddy is
regional. He'll go reference it. Yeah.

1139
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,480
I'm like, no one's ever thought of
this. He's like, that's brilliant. Pops.

1140
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:44,811
He's like,

1141
01:12:44,811 --> 01:12:48,290
cause you remember that time you're in
Minnesota and you said how cold it was.

1142
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,593
Yeah.

1143
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:54,810
My thought, first of all, why dad was in
Monterey at the car show with my brother,

1144
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:59,490
this is last week, mind you
and sewn goes. Someone goes,

1145
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,210
AH, they're talking about, uh,
kids. And my dad goes, oh yeah, my,

1146
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,360
my son lives in California. And they
guy goes, oh, what's he do out there?

1147
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:10,840
And my dad goes, uh, he
gets on stage and then, um,

1148
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,780
he's like an Internet personality,

1149
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:15,990
but then he'll get on stage and like tell
stories in my brother, you know, he's,

1150
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:19,410
my tour manager goes, no, he'd just stand
up comedy Demo Day goes, no, no, no, no.

1151
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:22,830
He didn't do that. He gets on stage and
like tell stories you didn't do comedy.

1152
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:25,890
And my brother's was like,
that's exactly what he does.

1153
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:28,950
Why would he make that distinction?
I just, he just doesn't. Or by Dad,

1154
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,090
this is like, oh my God. It's
like a year ago goes, you know,

1155
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,980
I think you should do some, I mean, you
should do some bits on Trump. I want it,

1156
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:41,260
dude. I can't believe I didn't stand out.
That's exactly what I should do that,

1157
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,380
wait, did he, when

1158
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,550
you grow up,
when you were growing up,

1159
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:46,850
did he likes to end up like you remember
him watching specials? No, not really. No.

1160
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:50,180
My mom did. My mom did comedy buck.
Who was she into? Do you remember?

1161
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,510
We'd watch Saturday night live every
weekend. She loved it all. Yeah. Oh,

1162
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:56,360
that's cool. Your dad like none of that
was like for sure. Pick a football.

1163
01:13:56,361 --> 01:14:00,730
So fucking stupid street football,
wreck your brain, pick up,

1164
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:05,390
shut the fuck. Think sign me up
for tech. Football on us for that.

1165
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:08,290
Now you're, you're obviously
in a committed relationship.

1166
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:12,040
Now when you were a single guy,
did you request or even demand that

1167
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,090
a woman eat your scrum regularly or no,
you're from behind.

1168
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:19,960
Y'All got that Nigga fuck that up
John or whatever the fuck his name is.

1169
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:25,050
Most of the Niggas out here
talking about him. Hey,

1170
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,470
one of these niggas asks you that
made a status like you also perfect.

1171
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,510
Oh God ain't no wrong.
We get a Nigga gave his ass.

1172
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:34,590
Ain't my motherfucking females and I
saying that cause I eat Niggas as I'm

1173
01:14:34,591 --> 01:14:36,120
saying that because it is what it is.

1174
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:40,810
So here's what it is. It's ass
eaten. Not Ass eight. Right?

1175
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,340
Well I mean automatically you bet
your ass a lot of tomato, whatever.

1176
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:49,320
I mean were you big into this? Not really
my thing, I've had girls go for it.

1177
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:53,470
Go for it. I've had girls take
my linkedin, bend it back,
change your died. I tried.

1178
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,810
Wow. I put up with it for
a little bit and I'm like,

1179
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,990
this is why I put it up so I don't wanna
I don't wanna learn a little more sway.

1180
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,740
That might be my favorite gesture of all.
I've put up with it for a little bit.

1181
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,940
Well my legs, my thighs are big song
about fucking leg drop. A bit like down.

1182
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:11,800
I don't need that big dude.
I know I pinned my legs like that.

1183
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:16,590
Pretty big girls. You'd be surprised
the wiring, the wiring strong one.

1184
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,470
Really? Yeah. So, uh, you tolerated
it. I tolerate weren't into it.

1185
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,920
Uh, not my thing. She
says kind of disgusting.

1186
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:25,870

1191

Cause I like him. He goes, Hey Mitch,
all on his case or whatever light.

1192
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,750
He ain't the only Nigga I like
and his motherfucking ass. Aight.

1193
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:54,820
I bet it's alarming number that do like
it. Oh yeah. I think I've told this

1194
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:59,340
before, but this is when I, when I
worked in DC, after I graduated college,

1195
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,120
I had a job for a few months and um,
uh,

1196
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:08,121
I remember Tracy was a black dude I
worked with at America's most wanted in DC

1197
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:13,250
on Wisconsin Avenue and one day I give
Tracy a ride and he sat in the passenger

1198
01:16:16,081 --> 01:16:19,380
seat. He was like, you
know, like, like what's up?

1199
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:23,370
He's like broke up with my girl man. I
was like, I was like, Oh shit. Really?

1200
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:26,730
I was like, how long were you together?
He's like, three years. I want to go.

1201
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:31,440
Damn man. Like what happens?
Like showing my ass no more.

1202
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:36,330
I was like, Shit. I was like, this is the
reason that you broke up. And he was like,

1203
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:41,160
yeah, Dan is like, you mean
like the foundation of your
relationship piece of it.

1204
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,890
And he was like,
she won't do it no more.

1205
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:49,530
I mean cold if that's your thing though
that if you would like to your main,

1206
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:52,740
if that's like what you guys
are built on its ass and eating.

1207
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,850
She doesn't do it when aren't you gay?
If their main thing is but stuff.

1208
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,380
No because it's just the ass
heating and we would like,

1209
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,120
cause she put fingers in there
like she said if he was like Dicks,

1210
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:08,210
there's always discipline indexes gave
tongues are not are unquestionably gay.

1211
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:11,500
I had a here that's like yeah have you,

1212
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:15,100
if he was left this other dude
won't fuck my ass no more.

1213
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:18,380
So I broke up with my girl.
I'll be like yeah I think you're gay bro.

1214
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,780
You know what's interesting
about ass eating though?

1215
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:26,270
It's like it's having the audacity to
enjoy it because I think I think why we're

1216
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:29,600
so opposed to it cause I'm sure having
your but like just pleasurable right?

1217
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:29,851
It's,

1218
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:33,860
I mean it's nice but it's really being
that person was bold enough to be like

1219
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:34,970
you fucking lick my ass.

1220
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:38,240
I don't care how dirty that should cause
cause I'm so self conscious, I'm like,

1221
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,670
Ooh, there's probably Brown there.
Even though I'm pretty clean.

1222
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:45,530
It's having the balls to be like,
it's fucking Likud.

1223
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:49,520
It's also just fucking, you're the
person doing it. It's like I'm dangerous.

1224
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,070
I'm nasty,
nasty shit.

1225
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,640
It's like freak level declaring it's
waving the flag and then it's like looking

1226
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:00,080
at you afterwards.
Like you know what kind of person.

1227
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,560
But it's also uncomfortable
if they just do it like that.

1228
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:06,920
Nice young lady would ask you
like, I've had it before. We girls,

1229
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,980
they have their fingers done it as as
long fake ones and they'll put them

1230
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:14,530
fingers in the rump pole and
you're Dukie shoot. Yeah.

1231
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:20,600
It just depends. No questions
asked that. Guess what?

1232
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:23,780
That's not her first time doing that.
That's what I'm saying. It's Kinda rude.

1233
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,880
Yeah, it's a little
rude. It's rude. I know.

1234
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:30,881
One of my friends told me about how he
met online lady who came over and it was

1235
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:36,560
like, okay, you're coming over. He
didn't even, so she's new to him.

1236
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,490
He wasn't even prepped, like wash,
showered, and she changed his died.

1237
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:43,450
I went down there on wash be whole.

1238
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,550
I used to know a girl that would
only like to have sex, anal,

1239
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:52,700
like chewed. Only want that.
Really? Wow. Wow. But She Persian,

1240
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:55,430
oh, white girl. White girl.

1241
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:58,810
I believed in the Lord or no doubt it.
Yeah.

1242
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:03,170
I said not that and just surprise Ya.
Um,

1243
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,180
so our 10 year anniversary is later
this year and we got this email. Uh,

1244
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,570
someone said I was delighted to hear
Christina's request for ideas on how to

1245
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:14,170
celebrate your 10 year anniversary
and here are my thoughts.

1246
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:17,840
I can't get all of your friends and
family together for a celebration after

1247
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:18,081
dinner.

1248
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:21,430
Gather them around to show a video of
Youtube scat sex and through a hammer.

1249
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:23,940
Yeah.
That's pooping through the Hummus.

1250
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,900
Get on a Ferris wheel
with some family members,

1251
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:30,950
smoke meth and molest each other until
there is a four stroke. Come. Yup. Wow.

1252
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,690
Then get a funnel cake.
Wow.

1253
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:37,010
Have some hot black guys with cows
over for a month of rape play.

1254
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,350
They can beat you while the cows piss on.
You.

1255
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,160
Offer them to stay with you for
awhile and exchange for being there.

1256
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:48,080
Hot White come dumpsters. I hope this
helps. High and tight Jim. Wow Jim. Wow.

1257
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,500
Really neat offer. I love
the hope. This helps.

1258
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:55,970
I hope this helps suggest like
corporate. Um, I don't know.

1259
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:58,370
Do you feel like any of
those tickle your feather?

1260
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:04,110
I'll marinate on it a little bit.
We're going to be married for 10 years.

1261
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,430
And how long did you guys
date before that? For

1262
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:12,600
long time. So we can get her for a
minute. Yeah. Yeah. He will eat a gene.

1263
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,850
I know we have two kids now.
Isn't that crazy?

1264
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,010
To me that's the part that's even crazier.

1265
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,130
It's weird when you have to get used
to the idea of a child like you.

1266
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:24,600
Like we forget about him. So he's only
six weeks, seven weeks old this week.

1267
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:28,410
Do you feel, I feel like when I had a
kid, life got way more serious for me.

1268
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:32,250
Like so scared of everything.
Think about death daily.

1269
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:36,330
I think about to me dying
daily and thinking about
tragedy happening to both my

1270
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,530
children.
Like,

1271
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:41,070
what if they get that weird meningitis
and ended up in the hospital and need a

1272
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:46,020
spinal tap? I had one of those, uh,
those, it's like two wheels in the front,

1273
01:20:46,021 --> 01:20:49,290
one wheel on the back,
those little a thing called slingshots.

1274
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:52,440
They sent one to try out
and like have fun with.

1275
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,350
When I was younger I
would fucking wheelies,

1276
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,690
take a thing of my buddies
hanging off naked or whatever.

1277
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:59,100
But then I got on that thing,

1278
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:02,370
I was going down PCH and also
having fun with it and I was like,

1279
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:05,260
this isn't a bad thing, just don't
have a helmet on. And then I Florida,

1280
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,990
I put in a third gear and
it swiped around like,

1281
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:13,050
and I'm facing incoming traffic on PCH.
And literally I was like, I can't do this.

1282
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:17,150
I can't die man. I can't die. You got a
kid. So I literally called him the kid,

1283
01:21:17,151 --> 01:21:19,410
come get this thing.
I think about it too.

1284
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:22,460
I know even one of my friends were telling
me about road ratio, the, he's like,

1285
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:23,820
you still have it. And I go, yeah,

1286
01:21:23,821 --> 01:21:26,790
I felt habit with this
thing happens now sometimes.

1287
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:29,070
And I think it's from being a
parent where you'll be like,

1288
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,930
you know when you have crazy thoughts,
you're like,

1289
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:33,630
I'm just going to for sure t
bone, that car, I'm going to go,

1290
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:35,730
I'm like punched in the fucking window.
Drag that.

1291
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:40,260
Like you start having crazy thoughts
and then you're like, look, I'm a dad.

1292
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:43,170
I can't be like Dan. And then you just
like totally calm down. You're like,

1293
01:21:43,171 --> 01:21:45,960
just everybody just go
to these crazy thoughts.

1294
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:49,380
Sorry my thought like Bs.
It is crazy.

1295
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,790
I've never felt older because
now I'm like super into my lawn.

1296
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,090
That's a real dad shit.
Some Dad Shit Bro.

1297
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:02,250
My lawn watering and my focuses and I'm
just my gate. It's like that's my shit.

1298
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,520
That's my shit.
I got real excited about it all too.

1299
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,250
I love it, man. Yeah.

1300
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,040
I get excited about mail.

1301
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:18,300
Anything home related? Yeah.
I just want to be home. Yeah,

1302
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,670
it's of course it's great.
I love being home.

1303
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:23,790
I mean it's obviously our
jobs are all traveling,

1304
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,270
but I really look forward to going
home. It's hard. It's hard for me.

1305
01:22:27,271 --> 01:22:30,970
It's hard to travel. People are way
better at me. I suck at like vacation,

1306
01:22:30,971 --> 01:22:33,210
stuff like that. I don't like hotels
cause when you're on the road,

1307
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:36,390
how many hotels have you
stayed in a hotel? I'm like,

1308
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:40,380
to me like I can't shut down here. Like
I can't relax here in the hotel. I just,

1309
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:44,190
you a rental house? AIRBNB ahead.
Well that's a good idea though.

1310
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,920
That's a great idea.
That was really great.

1311
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,420
When I'm Burt and Ari and I did it for
that national championship game last year.

1312
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:56,610
Oh that's airbnb. The house. It was,
dude, I was talking about on my show.

1313
01:22:56,611 --> 01:23:01,470
Your, I think you watch a
little college football, right?
Yeah, he watches a casual,

1314
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:04,930
I dunno, like in the comedy scene, like
my friends, I don't, I don't know anyone.

1315
01:23:04,931 --> 01:23:06,370
And sports count

1316
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,540
doesn't,
Rogan doesn't Dalea does.

1317
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:12,600
I was super stoked that college football's
back to frank about it came the night.

1318
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,930
Did you let your kids play football?

1319
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:18,370
And I don't know if I don't want
them to on it. I mean the injuries,

1320
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,830
no way. No Way. And our sounds
are cannon balls do like,

1321
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:28,330
here's the difference. There's some good
safe sports, soccer, tennis, swimming,

1322
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:33,520
running. I played sports. I played
all through elementary, middle high.

1323
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,620
You there is really,

1324
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:40,150
there's just as much danger or playing
soccer as pee wee football because

1325
01:23:40,151 --> 01:23:45,040
there's no high, like the hits are not
lying to her fast enough. You're not dude.

1326
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:45,903
They're not.

1327
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:49,480
I still feel like the exception to with
the CT when you see guys come out with

1328
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:52,390
Ct. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, but where's
all the guys who don't have it?

1329
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:55,810
We don't hear from them. The
majority don't have it. Dude,

1330
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,710
a kid playing sixth grade football.
He is not the,

1331
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,140
it's not like Bo Jackson's out there,

1332
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:04,170
you know Lawrence Taylor's
not fucking blind sight.

1333
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:06,970
What about that big kid on the other team?
There's always one.

1334
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,380
There's a Brendan Shab,

1335
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:12,910
you know who's like the fucking enormous
sixth graders once a year. Once a year.

1336
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:16,600
No idea or Jane plan around. Yeah,
and then I take my kiss. I'm like,

1337
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:19,030
kid til you hit that kid in the knee.
You got to take her home and his name.

1338
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:21,970
He was like, what? My head
down crown or he might,

1339
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,640
you might be singing a different tune
though when you see him in high school and

1340
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:28,570
he's this baller than Tom comes. They're
like, damn, we got an offer from Stanford.

1341
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:33,500
They were like, why go pick up
that football? Yeah. I Dunno.

1342
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,150
I don't want my boys to be weenies though.
I definitely want them to be killer.

1343
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:40,970
Fine Line. Well killers is aggressive.
It's a fine line. Oh, killers. She's,

1344
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:46,870
what'd you get a kid into
Jujitsu is fine for confidence.

1345
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:51,760
Kickboxing. No, no, no. Well I wouldn't
let him spar. Right, but you'd love train.

1346
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,430
Well, I'm trained boxing like I
do now and then I hit mits up.

1347
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,800
I never get hit in the head.
I'd love football. The,

1348
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:58,060
the juice is worth the squeeze.

1349
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:00,010
You can take him places they
probably wouldn't be able to get,

1350
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:02,650
they're going to meet a
lot of good people network.

1351
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:07,070
Then getting to school is a great team.
Great team. Camaraderie is awesome. Yeah.

1352
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,680
Um, wouldn't let him fight.
Definitely when I'm flooded.
No. Fighting's bad. Right?

1353
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,000
Terrible. You don't wanna you don't
have to take head shots all the time.

1354
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:16,900
But that's the thing is like
you can play football for

1355
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:20,890
all of elementary, middle, high school,

1356
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:25,930
and maybe have a couple of your bell
rung a few times. You know Jesus if got,

1357
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:30,640
if you've taken it to like one of
these top tier programs in high school,

1358
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:34,560
like where they fucking recruit
and we write the streets.
Taft then no punk. Yeah.

1359
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:35,850
And there's AR,
there's a,

1360
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,390
Oh there's IMG academy and you know
these Hoover highs, these programs.

1361
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,530
Have you seen one of those games? Yeah.
It's nuts. Yeah, I've been to one.

1362
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:47,710
I was like, what tough. He was, might've
been a little beat us in college.

1363
01:25:47,711 --> 01:25:49,780
I did wines. Huge. Crazy.

1364
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,750
But then when you start getting these
big time programs like were where he

1365
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:53,584
played.
Yeah,

1366
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:58,390
you could come out like with a
slur and you're speeding like load,

1367
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:58,961
you know.

1368
01:25:58,961 --> 01:26:03,961
But I'm saying that's the likelihood
that a kid will be playing that it's like

1369
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,880
swimming swimming's need this
women's nice. That's safe.

1370
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,460
Tennis if was a better swimmer,
I wouldn't mind that.

1371
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,430
That'd be great to year round though.
You gotta go all the way.

1372
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:17,450
You think about this guy, this guy is
going to tell us what he wants to play.

1373
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:21,890
We're always mocking the way people look
and the choices they make up. This guy,

1374
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,600
David ferry is a professional, former
professional golfer on the European tour.

1375
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:31,130
He works at a television personality
and he's rocking this beard right now.

1376
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:35,660
What do you think of that? Oh Wow.
I mean look at the, cause his,

1377
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,830
the call line is out here.

1378
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:43,370
He did it across the middle of the chewed.
I look at the gun. I think he fucks.

1379
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,530
You think he's big Dick Energy.
Key fucks Sake Dick Energy. Okay.

1380
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:50,560
Just sticky energy. Do you think he
deliberately got the shading different?

1381
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:55,561
Like that's an idea for 100%
there's a bad guy from the book.

1382
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:59,930
This is a villain cut. Right?
The billing. But now it's,

1383
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:03,200
as Brendan said that I just pictured
this guy getting off an elevator and

1384
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:07,340
walking into the bar of the hotel and
he's like, just so everyone knows here,

1385
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,450
I fucked pretty good. Yes.
That's what I, that's what I,

1386
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:13,460
and he orders his drink from afar.
You know, some people are like,

1387
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,400
I didn't come here. I want
to order my help. Yeah. He's
just like, no, we're just,

1388
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:17,510
we're the table.
Oh yeah.

1389
01:27:17,511 --> 01:27:21,590
And jumped in his Maserati and fuck
[inaudible] thing gets his ass licked.

1390
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,870
Demands on a second.
Yeah.

1391
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:27,200
Do you think like if you're a lady
and you meet him and he's like,

1392
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,550
come into my room,
you're like okay.

1393
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:32,240
And then you go to the shower to freshen
up his bathroom and you like put your

1394
01:27:32,241 --> 01:27:36,170
makeup on and she would come back in the
bedroom and he's on all fours and he's

1395
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:37,670
like,
that's where it starts.

1396
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:41,240
He pushes your head into it points
back to the forest is yours.

1397
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:44,370
Like you know what to do. See I think
he lays down and just scratch this.

1398
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:49,130
Let's do you think he pulls
it back? A baby? He grabbed
it on ankle. On, yeah. Oh,

1399
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:51,170
one is bold.
That's that big Dick Energy.

1400
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:54,860
But you don't want to have a forest
like a towel. That's not sexy.

1401
01:27:54,861 --> 01:27:58,340
It's not sexy balls hanging down the
back. It's a funnier look. It is.

1402
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:03,950
The Big Duke Energy Moves. Lay on your
back and just spread your legs. Yeah,

1403
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,050
it's a girl. The girl's like, oh,

1404
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:09,410
like I guess it a cool Maserati.

1405
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:15,460
He's got those big veneers too though.
Hey does he went full white?

1406
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:18,440
Cause he fucks all day over here too.
That's all he cares about.

1407
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,570
I'm a Maserati and veneers.
Nothing worse. Eight.

1408
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,250
I'm thinking about getting
veneers. He, yeah, my friend too.

1409
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:28,550
They look good. I the best guy. He
makes magic glass. I'll give me,

1410
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:32,250
I didn't even have braces. Check this out.
Okay. I think you had Braille. Listen,

1411
01:28:32,251 --> 01:28:35,870
this guy comes in not
pad, Bro. Let me see.

1412
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:40,490
The bottoms are not bad. They're not
great. I mean I've seen wider. Yeah.

1413
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,180
All right, thanks. Hey,

1414
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,680
that's come from a guy with 50
shades of brown teeth though.

1415
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:48,650
Hold on now let your mind bro. No,
those are good and you've got it.

1416
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:53,660
Yeah. Yeah. What's up?
What's up bro? Hold on.

1417
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,333
Now

1418
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:07,910
you were saying you were thinking
about getting your veneers.

1419
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:13,260
What? Which ones would
you veneer though? Yeah,

1420
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:18,260
your teeth are fine. I just feel like
if I had been there it'd be sick. No,

1421
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:23,280
I looked too much like a giant Mario
Lopez. You think? Oh my God. Yeah.

1422
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:26,730
I never thought of AC slash Slater
vibe going on. I do see that.

1423
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:31,560
Do you think he's got that BD? The big
they Kennedy? I don't get it from him.

1424
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:36,360
No to you later. I did. When
we turn this chair backwards,

1425
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:39,120
big Duke Energy. I was on a
plane, went by him and he did,

1426
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:43,800
he did like the terminal and the gate
and the boarding all with sunglasses,

1427
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:47,160
you know, and like I was like,
okay, alright. Alright Bro.

1428
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:49,680
And he did the inside
like the window seat. So,

1429
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,490
and he had somebody like a handler and the
ILC. Ah, that's not big. Very different.

1430
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:54,900
No,
it's not necessarily big energy.

1431
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:57,900
Very different though than like his
onscreen persona where he's like, hey,

1432
01:29:57,901 --> 01:30:01,920
guess what's in theaters this week? You
know, I did a show with them. He was like,

1433
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,880
hey, how you doing Brandon?
Good to see. I'm like, Bro,
who are you talking to them?

1434
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:10,590
Why do your full makeup? Huh? What are
you talking like that? Good to see you.

1435
01:30:10,591 --> 01:30:13,770
What do you think? I'm like dude,
you got to stop. Yeah, Hollywood.

1436
01:30:13,771 --> 01:30:17,310
Wait too long man. He's got one
of those gigs. It's so visible.

1437
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:21,870
Like it's one of those Hollywood access
is in hotel rooms when you turn on the

1438
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:26,100
TV everywhere.
And it's also um,

1439
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:30,870
you know we take them serious though. No,
I don't think so. He probably knows too,

1440
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:34,020
like this is a good gig in the,
in the grand scheme of things,

1441
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:38,610
this is a gig he's probably
had for fucking 10 years
and heavy and like as long

1442
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:41,310
as you look presentable and
he stays in great shape,

1443
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:46,350
you can just keep being like, here's a,
another new exciting Brian and Schwab

1444
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:51,950
you and stand up again here in Dallas.
Torn box.

1445
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,460
And just to keep his man card, I could
take a picture with Oscar de la Hoya.

1446
01:30:56,740 --> 01:31:00,840
He'll be at all the fights. That's it. So
he has a podcast that's all boxing too.

1447
01:31:00,841 --> 01:31:04,920
So it was it Mario Lopez. He
does. So he really knows his shit.

1448
01:31:04,921 --> 01:31:07,100
Then he must think he like
hangs around the fudge.

1449
01:31:07,101 --> 01:31:11,370
And so you watch a lot of boxing
or no? Um, I do. Yeah, I do.

1450
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,290
You're gonna Watch that fury. Uh,
I'm working it. You're working it.

1451
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,920
I'll be working with what
you're calling it. A,

1452
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,410
I'll have something to do with that
fight. Yeah. I thought you, it's you.

1453
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:25,290
I didn't know you work outside of
outside of MMA. Yeah. Yeah. Work.

1454
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:29,240
Showtime. But for boxing. Yeah. Dude, I
didn't know that. That's awesome. Yeah.

1455
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:32,190
Thank you. What a, so you can't
like obviously give a prediction,

1456
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:34,920
but I think it's gonna be a good
fight. Great fight. Phenomenal fight.

1457
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,330
It's probably going to be,

1458
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:40,090
I don't know if they've announced it
was in Vegas around November 11th.

1459
01:31:40,091 --> 01:31:43,890
It's coming up. It's coming up. I would go
to that. That sounds great. Fight. Great.

1460
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:48,570
Fight. Water's a great, yeah, I
love him. He's really like his, um,

1461
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:51,990
I mean, you know, I guess the knock
people have had is that they're like,

1462
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:56,550
you haven't fought top to your talent,
but he is devastating. Great Dude.

1463
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,260
And then Tyson fury has a personality.
It's going to be a good fight.

1464
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,160
I look forward to the um,
the, you know, the buildup,

1465
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,740
the press conferences,
talking, shooting the shit.

1466

1468

Huge Jeff Lewis fans. We're so
excited for fun. You say no more fam.

1476
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:50,160

a talk show that doing,

1477
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:51,580
it's me.
Jerry O'connell.

1478
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:55,240
I know it's produced by Andy Cohen and
like how could they have sandy happy

1479
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:58,900
Jamaican. How many jobs do
you have man? I Dunno man.

1480
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:03,520
I mean I need to pick a lane who's got
multiple podcasts. He's doing stand up.

1481
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:08,410
He's got a showtime MMA
slash boxing jocks. Awesome.

1482
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:12,910
Nice. I mean, really? Yeah. I'm exhausted.
So what's your, what is your Bravo's fun?

1483
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:17,200
That's fun. That's fun. Fun. The most
fun. What's the most fun stand up by far.

1484
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:22,420
If someone held a gun to my head and was
like, hey, you can only do, or whatever,

1485
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:25,030
if you could only do one thing, it'd
be stand up. And what's your best?

1486
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:28,240
What's the best job for you? Look what's
the most, how you be getting lucrative.

1487
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:32,070
The most podcasting standups right
there, right there. That's great.

1488
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:36,520
Along the wrong, the road business.
A boom booming, but he's doing well.

1489
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,380
He's doing well. Daddy Daddy
bought a purple Porsche. I know.

1490
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:44,340
It's really shit gold rims on
it. So the thing is though, um,

1491
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:49,720
I uh, between podcasts and stand
up, but if I want to go on the road,

1492
01:33:49,721 --> 01:33:53,540
more standard would beat it. But
I mean, yeah. Yeah. That's great.

1493
01:33:53,541 --> 01:33:57,940
We please talk about this bravo hookup.
Are you friends with the shires?

1494
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:59,320

1498
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,620

1499
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:19,210
it's kind of like the think of like
the view, but for due to watch bravo,

01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,190
I would love to do it. Do you know Jerry
O'connell at all? I know who he is.

1502
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:33,360
A great, is it just you two? No, it's
two other guys. Who were the other guys?

1503
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,260
I can't say the other game.

1504
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,720

midnight Tuesday night. Yeah,

1506
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:43,950
I should probably wait just suddenly
you're in trouble. I can cut it off here.

1507
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:48,040
Okay. Okay. Yeah, they're
weird about this, but it's
Michael Davies who did like,

1508
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:51,760
who wants to be a millionaire, uh, below
the belt. All these huge shows. And then,

1509

I Love Bravo stuff, man.
We watch all that stuff.

1511
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:03,320
You really are doing like a
crazy amount of stuff. Yeah,

1512
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:07,490
I know. Yeah. I mean it's good. It's like
this is a time to do it, man. Yeah. Yeah.

1513
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,720
I could do this when you're 50. No, hell
no. I couldn't. No, I couldn't. Yeah,

1514
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,220
I feel like eventually
I had to pick a lane.

1515
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:16,430
Have you ever seen this video of this guy?
You're killing it.

1516
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:23,550
[inaudible]

1517
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,770
Because she'll come over and we'll
buy your badge and mall. Yuck. Yeah,

1518
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:31,140

be fine. Right? Yeah. Those minds.

1519
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:35,810
Jimmy Olsen, I keep allowed to fit down
the others. I keep what to sound. Hey.

1520
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,373
Yeah.

1521
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:45,810
Now that one's fun. Oh, you like no one's,
you know, I like it. Tell me. Right.

1522
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:47,830
Well I can understand what they're saying.
Okay.

1523
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:52,680
And like was Portuguese is
Portuguese. He got 200 volts. He

1524
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:57,990
no way. Oh Shit. Oh God. Yeah.

1525
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:01,330
See Cause I thought that small of a shark
won't kill him. Yeah. So I feel like,

1526
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:05,800
oh wow. I mean he fell down and not doing
well. Have you, have you seen Mr. Herring

1527
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:12,980
[inaudible] get a voice box?
I'll be right back. Oh my God.

1528
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:20,800
See it's a funny screen and it's like
old timey. That was an old asked.

1529
01:36:20,801 --> 01:36:24,130
How's that different than the
Taiwanese guy? I don't know. Oh,

1530
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:27,200
another one they showed. Yeah, there
is a man who had his legs crushed.

1531
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:32,690
Did Not Miss Portside when
he's gentlemen. Uh, you, no,

1532
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:35,320
here's what I didn't like them because
he was screaming in agony and pain and

1533
01:36:35,321 --> 01:36:38,770
then people kind of weren't
helping him and it was prolonged.

1534
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,680
Like that was just a fast, here
it is. This is the fuel, right?

1535
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:43,023
No. See, watch.

1536
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:48,990
Oh my God.
You sociopath.

1537
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:55,620
It just goes on and on like it's too long.
It's too depressing

1538
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:01,430
us guys.
Yeah.

1539
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:05,640
And it goes on and it's too
long. I feel like, oh my God,

1540
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,790
please helping it.

1541
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:15,210
I feel like he's okay though.
He is. Yeah, he's fine.

1542
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:21,500
He doesn't give a shit. No,
he never told Asians. Yeah.

1543
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,513
By the way.

1544
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:29,580
We had an update a week ago or two weeks
ago that I'm from a Taiwanese breast

1545
01:37:29,651 --> 01:37:33,720
where this happened that said that, um,
he just had bruises. He wasn't even there.

1546
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:37,450
How does he know that? We read it on the
shift. I know, but now in retrospect,

1547
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:42,250
because it was in the news, they're like,
he was like, ah, and like looked in wade,

1548
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:45,550
but he's kind of cool and apparently he
was just saying because we were always

1549
01:37:45,551 --> 01:37:46,381
like, what does he say? We don't know.

1550
01:37:46,381 --> 01:37:51,381
He's saying he was saying stuck
could the equivalent of stuck stock.

1551
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:57,210
You don't say that if you die. Yeah, I
know that they snap. No, if you're dying,

1552
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:58,044
you just go,

1553
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,810
you know why I liked the
electrocution wine? Oh, tell me.

1554
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:08,380
Because that one's just like a cartoon
beat. Like it's a fat. It's, it's quick.

1555
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:11,470
You don't see his face. It's a
good quick punchline. That one,

1556
01:38:11,471 --> 01:38:14,680
I get to know that dude. You
know what I'm saying? Oh my God,

1557
01:38:14,681 --> 01:38:17,060
this guy hit the ground.
Yeah, I don't like this. Yeah.

1558
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,300
Better do something.

1559
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:24,220
I would never do this ever. Pros, cons.

1560
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:26,623
I've done it.

1561
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:35,170
That one is way was pretty happy.
It's Hilarious,

1562
01:38:35,171 --> 01:38:38,200
but that's the way it sounds
like he blew out his knees.

1563
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:45,880
It's that super funny to my husband.
That's pretty funny. I don't know why.

1564
01:38:45,881 --> 01:38:50,180
It's funny. See, I don't know why. If I
as I know he's okay. It's funny. Yeah.

1565
01:38:57,770 --> 01:39:00,080
The thing is you can't
control it going to get hurt.

1566
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:02,610
There's no way to be
tough about it. Yeah, no.

1567
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:07,230
It was the most horrific injury you've
had. I've been fortunate, man. I haven't,

1568
01:39:07,450 --> 01:39:12,170
you know, I mean her mom freak
when she saw you doing this stuff.

1569
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:16,070
Uh, yeah. My Dad like wouldn't
sleep at night and stuff.

1570
01:39:16,071 --> 01:39:20,050
I can't imagine my son fighting. I
can't imagine. I know I didn't ever had,

1571
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:23,750
he goes too crazy. He was crazy.
You know that one time when I was,

1572
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,660
when I was in high school playing ball,

1573
01:39:26,661 --> 01:39:30,080
it was like one of those weeks
where my dad was out of town. So my,

1574
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:32,240
my mom doesn't know
anything about football.

1575
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,420
Like she would watch entire
games and be like, oh,

1576
01:39:34,421 --> 01:39:36,950
I was watching the other guy like
that. You know? It doesn't know,

1577
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:41,750
but a game like one of the only games
she went to alone just to be supportive.

1578
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:46,430
You balled out? No, I went to an
ambulance, took me to the hospital. Damn.

1579
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,280
What happened on a punt coverage,

1580
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:53,670
like as the whistle blew and like, you
know you're running full speed. Yeah.

1581
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:57,950
And then you're, you're slowing
down, right? Like you're
slowing your sprint down.

1582
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,710
One of the,

1583
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:03,560
a guy took out my legs and I went up
into the air and landed on my tailbone.

1584
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:04,970
Damn.
Broke the tailbone.

1585
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,720
I didn't break it but they didn't know
what was wrong cause I was like, oh,

1586
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:10,660
when you land on it, yeah. You never know.

1587
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:14,420
Paralyzed and they realize he's
going to hospital. Did you,

1588
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:17,720
did you have aspirations of
playing college or Pro Green guys?

1589
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:22,400
I didn't know how like much I didn't know.

1590
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,700
You know what I mean? Ignorance is
bliss. It is. I was like, oh man.

1591
01:40:25,701 --> 01:40:30,230
Like I'll probably play it like
Auburn or something. I really did.

1592
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:34,160
I had no idea. I'll probably, it's
probably come down Florida state.

1593
01:40:34,161 --> 01:40:36,620
I'll improvement. Yeah. I mean I
really thought that. I'm not kidding.

1594
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,590
That's how everyone is
though, I guess. I mean,

1595
01:40:39,591 --> 01:40:43,220
I've told this story before the
the time that I didn't like,

1596
01:40:43,221 --> 01:40:46,400
because the thing is when you're in
high school it's such a different game

1597
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:50,990
because of the like you can make plays
all the time be like, I mean I'm good.

1598
01:40:50,991 --> 01:40:53,980
Right? Yeah. Yeah. And so when I, when I,

1599
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:58,370
I thought I'm a decent player. I mean
I knew it was above average. I did,

1600
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:01,090
but I didn't know the difference
between an above average and elite.

1601
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,660
And even though there was guys on my
team that were elite and I was just like,

1602
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:06,250
you know,
you kind of are in denial about it.

1603
01:41:06,251 --> 01:41:09,010
It's like being in denial but
anything you're like, well
I beat him in this, this,

1604
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:12,510
this. It's like you see the say I see
the same denial tree doing standup.

1605
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,360
Like sometimes you're like,

1606
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:16,990
I don't know why this person
is still doing this after
like 50 yeah, yeah. Within,

1607
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:17,920
they still do it.

1608
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:21,290
But I do like, I feel like a,
I don't mean to interrupt you.

1609
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:26,130
I feel like in stand up it's very
black and white and you're like, well,

1610
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,770
you're not getting laughs though man.
You're not selling tickets on the road.

1611
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:29,610
The other thing too,

1612
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:34,610
I always measured this in stand up where
it was like year one and then I was

1613
01:41:34,921 --> 01:41:37,080
like, is your, when I got
to year two I was like,

1614
01:41:37,081 --> 01:41:41,670
am I better at stand up and I'm
working more, I'm getting more work.

1615
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,460
And that's how I would measure it.
I'd be like, man, you know, I was,

1616
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,770
I was emceeing and now featuring.

1617
01:41:46,771 --> 01:41:50,390
So like I'm definitely making progress
and all I ever wanted to see was progress

1618
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:51,830
and, and then you know, you,

1619
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:55,050
you can start to measure the
quality of what you're doing.

1620
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:58,200
And there's definitely a lot of
people that are delusional in,

1621
01:41:58,201 --> 01:42:01,290
in all entertainment, singing,
acting, you know, but a standup,

1622
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:05,490
you can kind of see it,
you're like, you're making
zero progress after 10 years.

1623
01:42:05,491 --> 01:42:07,840
And sometimes people
just, you know, they did

1624
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,020
standup,
you can chill a lot longer,

1625
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:14,890
but you cannot do to took Kevin
Hart 15 years. Yeah, yeah. I guess.

1626
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,200
Yeah. But in football it's like,
no, no schools, no school on.

1627
01:42:18,201 --> 01:42:21,400
She played for the team. Now I'm very
black and white. I, you know, I had like,

1628
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:24,070
I got like the d two and
d three recruit letter

1629
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:26,920
and I had a couple of
clicks. Yeah, yeah, sure.

1630
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:32,020
These are people that don't
know that I probably have.

1631
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:35,620
I'm still in it for a million years.
I never knew that they send you,

1632
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,170
they send you form letters
though. So they're like, are,

1633
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:43,210
we were impressed with how strong you
are on the grid iron and in the classroom

1634
01:42:44,001 --> 01:42:47,680
and like, my grades are terrible. It's
like a form letter, but it's, yeah,

1635
01:42:47,681 --> 01:42:50,530
it's kind of thrilling. You Open it, you
know, and you're like, it's kind of cool.

1636
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,520
So I would get some of these, but I was
like, I want to go to holy cross, man.

1637
01:42:53,521 --> 01:42:55,210
I'm going to go to
fucking, you know, Florida.

1638
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,470
My hold out to Mitch and when exactly.
And when I went on,

1639
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:04,530
I went on a trip with a guy in my team
who was a legit baller and we went on the

1640
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:07,870
field to watch Syracuse
play Miami at Miami.

1641
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:12,610
And when those guys came out of the
tunnel and they were standing next to me

1642
01:43:12,611 --> 01:43:16,090
pregame, I was like, there was a
no, I don't look like these guys.

1643
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:19,210
Like I would die on the scout team here.
I would die.

1644
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:21,210
I mean it hit me that,

1645
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:25,330
that it was my level of delusion
went away in an instant.

1646
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:28,850
I was a junior in high school,
so it was a good thing to recognize.

1647
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:32,350
It shows your smarts though. You're
intelligent level. Cause a lot of guys,

1648
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:36,290
there's a lot of guys who even, they
see that and they go I can still do it.

1649
01:43:36,291 --> 01:43:39,920
Then somehow they walked on where they're
just scout team guys and you're like,

1650
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:42,380
dude,
you're never going to play.

1651
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,350
And they're going to put you through
the wringer. Like dude, Rudy did it.

1652
01:43:45,351 --> 01:43:48,650
And like when he had one
fucking play five years,

1653
01:43:48,651 --> 01:43:52,010
they Linde play one play when he's off
sides. You know what I'm saying? Like this

1654
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,240
doesn't, hmm. I would have been massacred.
I mean I probably, if I was one of those,

1655
01:43:56,241 --> 01:43:59,660
because there's these psycho guys that
love the game so much that they'll like,

1656
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:02,270
I'll suffer no matter what.

1657
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:05,540
Cause I love this game and I'm
definitely not that person.

1658
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:08,120
But there's guys like done stand up too.
That's true.

1659
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:12,290
That's got a bomb 5,000 tons so we can
call yourself a comedian or you just suck

1660
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:15,860
it, calm it better. I'm
like, no, that's not true.

1661
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:20,180
I know some of the great say that I don't
agree with it. I think if you bombing,

1662
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:22,820
if you're bombing that much
out of a thousand times,

1663
01:44:22,821 --> 01:44:25,100
you don't have any bits of anyone.
Last night and we all,

1664
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,740
we all bomb if you bomb all the time.

1665
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:33,890
Me and Bert were talking, I think it was
on his podcast. He goes, yeah. He goes,

1666
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:34,401
yeah,

1667
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:37,820
me and Tom realize that you're really
going to do this comedy thing cause we at

1668
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:41,690
the store in the back and you
were bombing and I was like, what?

1669
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:44,870
And he goes and then we came back and
you're like, oh God. That was like, yeah,

1670
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,100
shit happens man. We did. We said that
it's a bird said he's just an exaggerated,

1671
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:52,340
I'm sure it was a rough night though.
They're this rough nights, man.

1672
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:55,730
There are rough nights. Of course you
should have rough nights. Hell yeah.

1673
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:57,110
If you're like,
I've had great shows,

1674
01:44:57,111 --> 01:45:00,350
that means you've done stamp like eight
times all going shows. Shows. Yeah.

1675
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:04,280
But you also shouldn't be bombing every
single on the true, that's for sure do.

1676
01:45:04,281 --> 01:45:08,240
Yeah, that's true, man. No,
it is crap. I mean, you played
at that elite level. I mean,

1677
01:45:08,241 --> 01:45:11,240
I definitely would have died. I would
didn't, they would've have, you know the,

1678
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,800
I could have been that kid who's like,

1679
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:16,820
I could be a scout team full
back or something. Some guy,

1680
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:19,670
just a battery last me.
Yeah. They're just like, oh,

1681
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:24,090
we gotta get you neck surgery this off.
Thanks for your, and then I'm just like,

1682
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:28,400
I just love the team so much. And like
they, they just put it for the team.

1683
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:36,110
I'm like, ah, I'm not gonna
be able to look left or right
for the rest of my life.

1684
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:39,080
This is the benefit.
I have with my kids is a,

1685
01:45:39,081 --> 01:45:41,630
I've been at the high
level in multiple sports.

1686
01:45:41,631 --> 01:45:45,350
I'm like homeboy and prying freshman
in high school. I'm like, dude,

1687
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:46,940
we got to pick a different lane.
This,

1688
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:50,810
you're not getting it right away if
the aptitude is there. Yeah, pretty.

1689
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:54,590
Pretty close. Yeah. Yeah. You
can write. I remember a guy,

1690
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:59,300
a coach come in and he was like,
you, uh, he was like, you guys,

1691
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:01,310
just all you all should
worry about is your speed.

1692
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:06,650
So just working on your speed and like,
what if you already fast? He was like,

1693
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:10,700
yeah, you too man. Got
that check. What else?

1694
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,580
What else man? What else? From the
short while? What else you got Doug?

1695
01:46:15,581 --> 01:46:17,690
You try to put on weight. He was
like, yeah, it's going pretty well.

1696
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:22,850
So anything else? I was like, so
I got it. I'm fast. I'm meeting.

1697
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:28,120
Yeah. No, those people are different, man.
They're totally different. Yeah. Yeah.

1698
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,590
Sick of innate.
What,

1699
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:34,700
what a good segue from sports or what
other shows you guys watch though? Oh,

1700
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:39,380
Bravo. What about Netflix? Yeah, we'd
definitely, where he fucks with El Chapo.

1701
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:44,750
He does. He loves it. Oh you speak
Spanish. Of course. I'm almost done.

1702
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,070
I'm almost done. I'm in season three
episode 11 or 12 come on 12 it's really

1703
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,990
good. The whole, the series is great.
Brilliant. And I was talking about,

1704
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:56,160
I was talking,
I was putting out the doubt when,

1705
01:46:56,280 --> 01:47:00,180
when I was pressing play originally I
was like look, not to talk about of Shit,

1706
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:04,350
but a lot of these Latin
American productions are
whack. Like when you watch,

1707
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:08,860
you know a show that airs on Telemundo
or some shit like man this is,

1708
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:13,800
this is not the same.
That show the writing, the
directing, the cinematography,

1709
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:16,470
everything is tremendous on it.
Do you ever go back and you can,

1710
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:20,000
they'll show some of it but you can go
back and watch like major scenes and El

1711
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,001
Chapo,

1712
01:47:20,001 --> 01:47:24,510
his life where he got arrested or when
he escaped from prison and you watch when

1713
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:28,320
they recreate it and
it is fucking spot out.

1714
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:32,250
Small details to everything. I wonder
how much, I mean you can tell it,

1715
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:35,490
you know what parts are 100% true.
I wonder like if,

1716
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:40,640
how much of that of like other characters
and exaggeration or completely made

1717
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:44,520
like the [inaudible] character, it's
like, which one's the, you know,

1718
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:48,410
the secretary of state,
the gay guy. I mean he's,

1719
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:50,130
he was gay,
you know,

1720
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:52,800
who knows what he's doing that side
piece and if you'd like to get that,

1721
01:47:52,801 --> 01:47:56,490
but is that based on a real guy? That's a
real guy. That definitely is 100%. Okay.

1722
01:47:56,570 --> 01:48:00,950
100%. Yeah. My girls Mexican as fuck. And
I asked her, I'm like, Calvert legitimate.

1723
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,930
She's like pretty legit.
And she'll bring me like the actual,

1724
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:08,390
I never looked it up. Yeah.
We, I get balls deep. Yeah.

1725
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:12,330
I love that guy. That plays, they'll
Chapo. He's excellent. Here's my thing,

1726
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:14,130
what's the,
what is this humble we going to do?

1727
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:17,430
He's like the girl on those
Frickin, you know, on those, uh,

1728
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,440
the insurance ads. Oh, right.
Well, I don't know though,
because like why don't see,

1729
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:25,020
he's going to be cap type,
type it up a chameleon because when he,

1730
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:28,950
when he's El Chapo, um, you know,

1731
01:48:28,951 --> 01:48:32,950
like breaking in to the
business and then when he's, uh,

1732
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:36,940
when they fast forward to the New York
with his head shakes the same at all of

1733
01:48:36,941 --> 01:48:40,590
us. I think it looks all Chapo.
That's it. I think he's screwed. Rowe.

1734
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:43,470
I think he's pretty good.
No about hiring him for my pocket.

1735
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:47,490
Some shit I think screwed
dude. What's our, oh,

1736
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,170
we're going to get back into Ozarks,

1737
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:53,040
which just came down and
I watched the first two. I
couldn't get into it. No Shit.

1738
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:57,360
No really? But I'm also a guy, took
seven years, get on with game of Thrones.

1739
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:02,010
[inaudible] tried twice. I can't, and
that was strange. I couldn't either.

1740
01:49:02,011 --> 01:49:06,180
And then I was denying what happened.
How did you get into it? I don't know.

1741
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:09,300
I would need a show. I was born, I was
like, let me check this shit out. Oh,

1742
01:49:09,301 --> 01:49:12,240
I was on a plane with the, the
writers, the creators of it.

1743
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:15,090
I was on a plane and I thought they
were on there from always sunny in

1744
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:19,600
Philadelphia and then went yep,
we're, yeah, we're shooting in, uh,

1745
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:23,700
and uh, Ireland this year I went Ireland,
Jesus always sunny in Philadelphia.

1746
01:49:23,701 --> 01:49:24,780
You guys really went Hollywood.

1747
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:27,900
He goes bring it all the way to Ireland
and then the, it's a private plane,

1748
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:31,500
just go sign. They go and we do
game of Thrones, man. Oh Shit.

1749
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:34,800
And I started talking to them and they
were just fascinating dudes. I'm like,

1750
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:38,910
yeah, you give it a shot. And then
it was damn good. Damn good. I saw,

1751
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,700
I know it's good. I think it was
the pilot and I was like, man, drag.

1752
01:49:43,701 --> 01:49:48,010
And if I am watching this shit time, I
was bro. Yeah. I like his Lord of the

1753
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,440
one. I know there's people rolling
their eyes right now being like, Tom,

1754
01:49:50,441 --> 01:49:54,250
you fuck dude, I was the same bro. Here's
another thing. I've never seen sopranos.

1755
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,730
Now that's my jam right
there. I love that. Fun.

1756
01:49:57,731 --> 01:50:00,700
I've watched the whole series twice. Not
the whole thing. How you got to watch it.

1757
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:05,500
And so I've never seen any love
it. No, I don't love it. But I,

1758
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:09,250
I recognized like it is
definitely quality. I mean I just,

1759
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:13,420
I never fully embraced,
I'm not that fond of Italians.

1760
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,710
So like I just, you
know, again, your nerves,

1761
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:19,330
I just think they have so much misguided
pride. They kind of just turned me off,

1762
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:23,020
you know? That's fair. Yeah.
Huh. Like you dad said love it.

1763
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,350
Do you watch approaches
of Europe? Oh, aggressive.

1764
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,650
Totally kidding. Awesome.
That's hilarious.

1765
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:42,460
Things like you'd never think of like
Italians know like the cockroaches of

1766
01:50:42,461 --> 01:50:47,410
Europe. I haven't her. Wow.
Wow. See, I'll watch words.

1767
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,720
I'll watch like born this way on Tlc.
You seen that?

1768
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:54,310
The kids with down syndrome.
Oh Gee. You watch that.

1769
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:59,290
Why it's, I don't know. It's interesting.
It's like a bunch of kids with down,

1770
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:03,250
when I say kids so you don't realize how
old their somewhere like 40 45 in the

1771
01:51:03,251 --> 01:51:07,040
first place. The kids now they're grown
US folks. And this is born this way.

1772
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:12,170
My 90 Day fiance. Oh yeah,
no, we fuck with that. We, uh,

1773
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:17,270
we fuck with a transition. We just
transitioned. TLC was amazing. Which one?

1774
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,020
Which one is lessened? Oh,
hold up. It's like when you,

1775
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:23,530
right before you would go Ryan.
Charles Schwab. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1776
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:27,790
That's a really about homeboy who was
just married with a girl baby. I was like,

1777
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:32,580
Yo, baby girl. And he's like, it's
like if I shaved and I was like,

1778
01:51:32,581 --> 01:51:34,780
I'm gonna just put on a dress.
It was like, I feel like a woman.

1779
01:51:34,781 --> 01:51:38,360
And then they go to their friends by go,
Dave is now Dana.

1780
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,630
And I'm like, how come? How come people
keep looking like saying that I'm a guy,

1781
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:49,460
they'd be at the nail salon. Yeah,
he's fucking, he's like you dude.

1782
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:52,660
The dress long nails and then
upset about it. Yeah. He's like,

1783
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:56,590
people are saying it was that guy. He's
like the fuck, you know? And I was like,

1784
01:51:56,591 --> 01:52:00,520
this is so annoying. And
also it's like, I mean,

1785
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,880
I feel like, you know, he,

1786
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:06,040
he went to get that surgery
consultation and they're like, you know,

1787
01:52:06,041 --> 01:52:09,070
we can do this to your eyebrows and your
face and all that stuff. Also, it's like,

1788
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:13,720
Bro, you could take the Diet little
seriously. That wouldn't kill either, bro.

1789
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:17,960
Like I would do the Diet
first. That's what I'm saying.
Just from there, it's like,

1790
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:22,420
he's like, he's like, everybody's
like, you look like a dude.
So it's like, you know,

1791
01:52:22,421 --> 01:52:26,080
but man,
like c'mon dude.

1792
01:52:26,081 --> 01:52:30,280
I mean I go for a morning
run every morning or just
eating crew tons and water.

1793
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:34,330
Dude, that dude, I was in
Spokane, Washington doing shows.

1794
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:37,810
It's taking an Uber like in the
Uber and it's like, I'm like, damn,

1795
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:40,300
that's the biggest girl I've ever seen.
I don't give a fuck.

1796
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,670
It's this little shitty Honda,
but it is,

1797
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:46,100
wreck it Ralph and this
Honda fucking shoulders dress

1798
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,710
big on. I'm like, damn, her
shoulders are bigger than mine, son.

1799
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:53,430
I get in and turns around and it's like,
this fucking,

1800
01:52:53,431 --> 01:52:56,370
you know me with a wig on. But it
just turned around. I was like,

1801
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:59,660
she looked like bill Bellacheck
with a wig. I feel like

1802
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:05,570
when he transitioned and it was new,
it was not a good, it's never good,

1803
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:08,660
but it's like, you know, in
his or her arms are like,

1804
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:12,790
you tell like a little hairy. It's just
like you got to try harder and harder,

1805
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:16,880
but then there's also limited. They're
not even being cool at the gun store.

1806
01:53:16,881 --> 01:53:21,350
To me. Yeah, of course. Makeup on.

1807
01:53:21,351 --> 01:53:24,630
It doesn't mean like, oh,
it's a check. Like there's
some steps you gotta go nippy.

1808
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:28,700
Amazing. It was like, I'm
transitioning. And then they're like,

1809
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:29,920
how's your transition going?
He,

1810
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:33,050
he handled it the same way that he
does football questions. He'd be like,

1811
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:36,840
it's fine. It's fine. We're playing
the chiefs this week. It's fun.

1812
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:42,510
We've had him on the show.
I mean the clips on the,

1813
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:46,990
we had him on a lot of personality now.
Terrible show.

1814
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:49,820
That would be a terrible show.
Maybe that would be the show.

1815
01:53:49,821 --> 01:53:54,770
How terrible can you
imagine if I was gonna say,

1816
01:53:54,771 --> 01:53:57,800
Gee, imagine how heartbreaking and
be, you know, you guys have two kids.

1817
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:03,120
I'm not saying I'm against it. All
I'm saying is if my son, when he's 14,

1818
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:06,870
was like, dad, I feel like a girl,
man. I'm a start rocking dresses,

1819
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:10,940
no more football. And it's not
like, like, oh, this is terrible.

1820
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,230
Get Out of my house.
But it'd take a hot second to accept it.

1821
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:20,770
I'm not sure. Like Bro, it's fuck am
I right? Suck that doors. I'm like,

1822
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:25,380
gimme a Humean you me the night.
Let me sit on this. Yeah, no,

1823
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:30,260
I'm going to be cool though. Is your
son, he's going to be huge. I always,

1824
01:54:30,261 --> 01:54:34,610
when I was feeling bad for these guys
that are just so big and they really are

1825
01:54:34,611 --> 01:54:39,380
never going to pass, you know
what I mean? Well, have you ever,

1826
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:44,420
uh, we had her on our show,
Christina back, Kristen Beck.

1827
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,810
Kristin Beck. Ready for
this one. So she was,

1828
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:51,780
he previously was a male when the top,
uh,

1829
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:56,180
navy seals in the world. Oh, I've heard
of that transition and do, I'm a woman.

1830
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:59,420
I've heard, I've read about this in
the news, straight up Badass navy seal.

1831
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:03,620
What always felt like a woman.
And then one of her, you know,

1832
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,500
Navy seals, he was like, hey,

1833
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,130
this way he told him he was a Katelyn have
drinks on my boat. And he's like, yeah,

1834
01:55:09,131 --> 01:55:10,400
I'll come over.
You just always come over.

1835
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:14,360
And he left his dress on and he just
said his friend came over who was also a

1836
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:17,210
CEO. It was like, all right, it's
cool man. If that's what you like,

1837
01:55:17,211 --> 01:55:20,510
don't let the other guys find out about
it though. Like just do your shit.

1838
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:24,710
But dude on the side, man, it's crazy.
And then now, and we went out to,

1839
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:29,030
went out to lunch after with her and
again it, it's a fucking navy seal,

1840
01:55:29,031 --> 01:55:32,720
man.
It looks like and put lipstick on Mascara.

1841
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:37,250
Here's kind of Iffy, kind of macmillan
a little longer dress and just fucking,

1842
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:41,000
he's sold out and like, Oh man, what the
fuck you're when staring. I'm like, Bro,

1843
01:55:41,001 --> 01:55:44,280
you shitting me?
Like it's a tough

1844
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,113
go man.

1845
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:49,680
With that TV show is that they're makeover
people are in the Midwest and so they

1846
01:55:49,681 --> 01:55:53,910
give them these terrible mom haircuts
and like they make them up and I'm like,

1847
01:55:53,911 --> 01:55:55,800
come to La Dude.
First of all

1848
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:02,980
right Christie, if
you're not in la, not La,

1849
01:56:02,981 --> 01:56:06,310
it doesn't count Bro. Let's go to
Beverly Hills. Right. I do think

1850
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:11,880
it's great. Make over. I mean,

1851
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:15,470
you really should go to one of the big
cities. Don't do it in. You're like,

1852
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,040
I want to look like up chick.

1853
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:20,550
It's my first time in New York or Atlanta.

1854
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:25,920
Yeah, I'd go to the best. Yeah. I
mean you can't, you can't be like,

1855
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:30,460
I'm doing my transition in Omaha.
I hope it goes well. No out.

1856
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,650
They don't know what they're doing.

1857
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:35,030
Also what you do is just get them
fat injections into your ass. Yeah.

1858
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:38,290
So at least you have a blog asks
you got a dress on a summary for you

1859
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:43,160
transitioning to a woman. I mean, I have
some dsls for lips. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1860
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:47,960
yeah. You're very nice. Head of hair.
But you could grow out your hair. Now.

1861
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:53,070
My hair shave my face though. They got
high cheek bones. He's got good structure.

1862
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:56,970
I know. It's like I got like that scar
tissue. I can remember going to a full,

1863
01:56:56,971 --> 01:56:59,250
anyone? No, they're all going to be

1864
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:06,670
big as fuck. Loud ass.
Those nails on his big ass.

1865
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:10,920
It would not be see it all. It's like
sometimes big bitch is just stand out.

1866
01:57:10,921 --> 01:57:13,260
Like if you're at the mall
and you see like a six foot,

1867
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:18,130
I feel bad for those
girls to size like 14 ugh.

1868
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:23,250
Damn girl. Yeah. What do you dress?

1869
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:33,100
It looks like they like sewed together
two pairs of shoes for boots, bro.

1870
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,090
I just feel bad for him.
I'm like,

1871
01:57:35,091 --> 01:57:38,520
you're in front of 421 you know God damn
well there's nothing that fits you and

1872
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,760
they're going to do notice that.
You know,

1873
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:42,500
it's funny because you'll
see the big shoes you buy.

1874
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:45,420
It's a big ass shoes and then your,
well yeah. What she's supposed to,

1875
01:57:45,421 --> 01:57:49,500
she's six too. She can wear size
fives but where did you get those? No,

1876
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:53,620
I know they run it.
I mean she probably goes to stores like,

1877
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:57,870
I'm not like Shrek, but there's
certain shit like stores I cannot,

1878
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:02,190
I can't even walk in some of your nose.
Hundred percent.

1879
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,650
Which ones could you like?
Definitely not go into a,

1880
01:58:04,651 --> 01:58:07,890
I can't go into like Abercrombie
and Fitch. That ain't happening.

1881
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:12,360
I can't pack son that I'm like,
do you have a triple x?

1882
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:16,060
Like that's embarrassing. So I don't
do it. Banana Republic, no way man.

1883
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:19,950
J crew's iffy. Some of their
double x is fit. It's the hate.

1884
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:23,800
I hate shopping for shirts. It, no,

1885
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,970
I like clothes. I'm saying I, I hate that.

1886
01:58:26,971 --> 01:58:31,170
Like my body size is one
where I can walk into a store,

1887
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:36,410
put on XL and it fits almost like fits
big on something and the very next door,

1888
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:42,100
the double XL for just be like a medium.
Like it's always, it's never consistent.

1889
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:45,900
Everywhere I go is, yeah,
jeans, jeans for genes.

1890
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:49,840
That's the worst hang out. It's so hard
to find jeans that fit perfectly is,

1891
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:53,830
oh my God. To find your brand. Do you
think this guy is going to have success?

1892
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:57,730
He decided to not do
the Tinder online thing.

1893
01:58:57,731 --> 01:59:00,920
He just posted that one.

1894
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:05,380
We're really only looking
for a girlfriend. This is
not a joke. Great Vision.

1895
01:59:05,381 --> 01:59:10,330
Just try Jesus. Tired of the single scene
and hoping to meet the right person.

1896
01:59:10,331 --> 01:59:13,990
I'm a professional artist, creative
person. You know who you are. To me,

1897
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:17,370
each and every person's beautiful. Open
to the possibility of the relationship.

1898
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,110
Morphine's something more profound.
Here's the thing, this photo,

1899
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:23,630
he could be a nice guy.
He could absolutely tie you up in a base.

1900
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:28,720
He will wear your face. Yeah, you
definitely could just be like,

1901
01:59:28,721 --> 01:59:33,680
I like to bash people's knees watching
screen. He looks nice. I actually,

1902
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:37,050
he looks
totally be a mugshot.

1903
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:42,430
Who took that picture? Dude, those eyes
are no one. No one was like, hey bro,

1904
01:59:42,431 --> 01:59:46,080
smile.
Look at the,

1905
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:50,350
the width of the eyes open, but
once I like, he's up to something.

1906
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:53,140
He looks like a bank robber.
Okay. Who's crazier though?

1907
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:57,790
This guy or the toothless guy putting

1909
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:04,730
That guy's definitely doing a labor.
That psycho just posted.

1910
02:00:04,731 --> 02:00:06,000
I don't know where that is.
Not.

1911
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:09,090
The sad thing is some lonely girl

1913
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:17,470
You know,

1914
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:20,460
I don't care about race.
That

1915
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,140
nasties by that break your heart.

1916

He's just always putting out, you know,
damn well he don't want a black woman.

1917
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:37,540
He's, he's an Arkansas. Think he's racist.

1918
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:41,830
He looks like he uses the n
word every day. Fine. Yeah.

1919
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,110
It's like you see a guy like this,
like Bert and you're like,

1920
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:49,080
that guy is comfortable with it and
I don't trust that guy, my card.

1921
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:52,880
You know what I mean?

1924
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:08,110

Obliviousness to society and
like, yes, smiling is good.

1928
02:01:19,391 --> 02:01:21,780
It brings people in a little warm smile.

1929
02:01:21,781 --> 02:01:24,310
Maybe put a some sort of holiday
sweater on. I don't know.

in that's coming out in November.

2015
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:51,510
Instant family that uh,
the trivia item,

2016
02:06:51,511 --> 02:06:55,660
Tom [inaudible] who plays Russ in
this film holds the title of us

2017
02:06:55,730 --> 02:06:58,480
water juice.
He and his wife Christina Pr,

2018
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,330
outspoken advocates for wearing one's
jeans high and tight and his free time he

2019
02:07:02,331 --> 02:07:06,500
hangs out with his friends in the four
stroke gang. So really, really childish.

2020
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:08,800
But there's 13 of 13.
Found this interesting.

2021
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:14,750
Really child is inappropriate.
And did you like doing movie stone?

2022
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:16,063
I,

2023
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:19,410
I think it's probably similar to a lot
of people was experience where I had a

2024
02:07:19,411 --> 02:07:23,010
lot of fun, uh, working, doing the,

2025
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,920
when you're working it's all
the other shit around it.

2026
02:07:25,921 --> 02:07:29,700
The hurry up and wait and all
that traveling and like your, Hey,

2028
02:07:32,851 --> 02:07:35,250

I doing tomorrow though? We
are not working tomorrow.

2029
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:35,980
But you're then what

2030
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,791
about Thursday?
Well,

2031
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:41,020
Thursday you're appearing in a montage
that should take like 18 seconds and then

2032
02:07:41,021 --> 02:07:43,420
Friday you have a scene. You're
like, why can't I arc? Okay.

2033
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:47,560
And then what about Saturday? Sunday we'll
stay here cause Monday we might need,

2034
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:49,390
we don't know for shooting
that thing Monday.

2035
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:54,580
Then Tuesday we're probably
shooting movies to want any desire.

2036
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:57,840
Now. Some people just get
shit. You like Tel Aviv?

2037
02:07:58,240 --> 02:07:59,950
I like to be in people's living rooms.

2038
02:07:59,951 --> 02:08:03,760
I don't want to leave my house
for a long time traveling lot.

2039
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:08,350
I don't like leaving the gnostic.

2042
02:08:15,231 --> 02:08:18,640

about the one, I guess that you booked?

2043
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:21,190
Yeah, I can't talk about that.
Yeah. Okay. That one's big,

2044
02:08:23,330 --> 02:08:25,590
but it's different because,
uh,

2045
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:30,430
I think coming from the
world of podcasting and
stand up where you're kind of

2046
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:33,100
the director of the ship and
your time, you know, like,

2047
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,140
I can't be gone Monday through Thursday.

2048
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:37,480
I have to have these other
shows in those stuff have to do.

2049
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:40,260
So if you're just an actor,
that's fine. If they book you,

2050
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:43,540
you're getting paid your fine with those
dates. But in the world that we do,

2051
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:44,374
you can't leave that.

2052
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:46,810
How are you going to manage all
the other stuff when you do,

2053
02:08:46,811 --> 02:08:49,420
let's say the one of these movies
that you can't talk about yet,

2054
02:08:49,421 --> 02:08:50,910
but the one I know about,
I dunno.

2055
02:08:51,330 --> 02:08:53,050
Do you don't even know how you're
going to do that? I don't know yet.

2056
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:56,050
Do you know if it shoots here in
la? I do know. Yeah, it does. Yeah.

2057
02:08:56,110 --> 02:09:01,060
That's a good thing. I did two other small
ones. They shot in La, which was a huge,

2058
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:05,180
huge, I had like two
days. Yeah. Um, but yeah,

2059
02:09:05,181 --> 02:09:08,470
I mean if you have all this other
stuff, you'd do it. I mean they will,

2060
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:10,570
they're not going to be like, all right,
cool man. No, that's another thing.

2061
02:09:10,571 --> 02:09:13,810
They do not play. It's not like too like,
oh, you're doing that. That's fantastic.

2062
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:17,920
We'll work your schedule around that.
And I know we only had a day.

2063
02:09:17,921 --> 02:09:20,410
If you can't do it, can't do, it's
not like that. That's fun to do it,

2064
02:09:20,411 --> 02:09:25,360
but it's not like it's your, it's
your baby. Um, yeah. It's Kinda crazy.
