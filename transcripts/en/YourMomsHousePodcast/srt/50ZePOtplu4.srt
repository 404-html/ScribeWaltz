All right.
Try it out.

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,130
You know how many emails we get and tweets
telling us that they can't even hear

41
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,770
the phrase, try it out now. That's
just a normal phrase. Ruined.

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,100
It's ruined it for people. Try it out.
It really makes me happy. Try it out.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,990
Try it out. Try it out. Yeah.
Weird thing to say about that.

44
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,010
Like, come over and out. Piss
on me. But you also can't
hear about deals. Deal, man.

45
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,240
It's so weird. Try it out. I mean, I
know you've been thinking about it.

46
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,860
Why not try it out? Like that's
the shit inference, right?

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,300
We have a difference in France.
How do you say it? Yeah.

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,530
And it's what you're inferring
in France might be in France,

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,560
might be another one of those weird
foreign things because I was raised by

50
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:46,480
foreigners. Yeah. If I can
say anything you don't talk
in with good. Nope. Um, look,

51
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:51,460
let's get serious. A lot of people
want to talk silly stuff and um,

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,880
you know,
make light of unimportant things.

53
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,370
This is a little more sophisticated show.
Yeah.

54
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,240
And I'm kind of sick of the silliness.
I want to talk about real issues. Okay.

55
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,400
What'd you have on your mind? You know,
let's just have this introduction here.

56
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,450
This is from the BBC.

57
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,690
We're changing the format of the show
now is that whole show is going to get a

58
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:14,230
lot more serious political. We're going
to do politics. Absolutely. Every,

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,831
every week.

60
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:19,570
I went hard hitting geopolitical
international debates.

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,550
I want to talk about
comparative economics and I,

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,770
all right, sorry. I that's you know, you
do what you want to do. I'll do what I do.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,780
Okay. Okay, here we go. And here you go.

64
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,930
Boom. Me Have Tom. It's
typically have sound off.

65
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,630
Sound has a frequency. What is the
frequency of a fart? Find out next.

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,120
No,
bring it in.

67
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,720
Go to your mom's house.

68
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,350
Let's talk about,
so your,

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,650
your thing is what frequency
are your farts? I've, you know,

70
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:10,360
it's funny because we watched that movie
about sounds. Oh God, I hated it. Yeah,

71
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:15,120
I know they didn't have one fart
in that look of all the questions.

72
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,210
Call a quiet place. Quiet place need to
be answered. How are they taking shits?

73
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah, they have diarrhea. How are they
farting? Those are the two biggest.

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,390
Are they burping John Krasinski,
Emily blunt, which I had.

75
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:32,170
They're married in real life, in real
life. Um, the movie was a big hit.

76
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,030
I mean, how are they
jerking off? They're not,

77
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,600
how are they watching porn
and masturbating? Nobody's,
none of that was addressed.

78
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,650
Yeah. None of it was addressed. How loud
he comes. Does he make a lot of noise?

79
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,040
Becomes, because if you don't
know the premise of the movie,

80
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,780
it did very well at the box.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,180
It's that there's these
crazy aliens out there that,

82
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,290
um, kill anything basically
that makes a noise. Yeah.

83
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,890
So the is,

84
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,660
is an utter chaos.

85
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,550
And he and his family are living in,

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,530
out in a field somewhere, basically
in a farmhouse. And they, you know,

87
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,120
if you knock something over,

88
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,800
you immediately have to hide because these
aliens that kill everything are blind,

89
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,780
but they have super hearing.
So they hear every little noise.

90
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,970
Every fart. Yeah. Every
jacket. And if he's like, ah,

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,870
they would hear that,
you know,

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,940
that movie was so stressful.

93
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,003
Yeah.

94
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,390
How are they watching

95
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,410
powerpoints are suiting
Haley's, it killed everything.

96
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,440
She wants it like this.
It's a good movie. I,

97
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm just stressed out
because of the content.

98
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,050
You are super stressed. I was
like, I tap out, tap out. I can't,

99
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,100
I can't watch children being,
I know

100
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,270
there's a lot and again, the big
issues of the film were not addressed.

101
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,050
Um, and that was upsetting. But we
stayed. So we stayed in a hotel.

102
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:21,220
We had a baby moon. Our very last one
before this baby jeans comes into town.

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,530
Right.
And has usual,

104
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,240
we were perusing the porn options
in the hotel room cause we will,

105
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,750
you know, the one was like daddy
loves my big tits. That's right.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,580
I think that's [inaudible] favorite.

107
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,650
You can tell a lot about
the hotels clientele by what
kind of porn they offer in

108
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,130
the room.

109
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,780
A lot of transsexual porn,
lots of transsexual stuff.
But daddy loves my big test.

110
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:44,614
Really stood out.

111
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,570
Daddy loves my big debts.

112
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,600
And what really kind of upset me a with
these titles is that I'm leaving so much

113
00:07:55,261 --> 00:08:00,261
money on the table right now because right
now I'm nine months pregnant and that

114
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:05,361
is such a lucrative porn category that
I'm not even taking a part of right now.

115
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,710
I don't even,
where's my cut?

116
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,460
It's out there. It's out there.
If you're ready to make a move.

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,930
It seems like the natural
money on the table,

118
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,100
desire for a pregnant woman to have.

119
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,060
When you're around men and women a lot,
nine months to you,

120
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:25,680
you realize you're like, why aren't
you doing porn? Right. It seems like,

121
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,970
would they all work? Yeah. It's an
ideal time. Your body looks great,

122
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,650
you feel great.
You're at the top of your game.

123
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:36,510
You are leaving $100 just hundreds
sitting out there everywhere. Yeah.

124
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,230
How much do you think a woman
gets for that genre? I don't know.

125
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,940
I don't know because I know that
without being really keyed into it,

126
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,941
that that whole business model has
taken such a hit because of free,

127
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,710
you know, tube sites. Yeah, so it used
to be when people made a lot of money,

128
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,220
you know,
at first

129
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,400
of all, there was born, used
to be in cinema is that it was,

130
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,760
you had to go by cinema, cinema, cinema.

131
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,560
Then you had to go buy video tapes
or DVDs. Imagine eating popcorn,

132
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,180
watching, going to it as the
most vile, disgusting thing ever.

133
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,960
The whole thing is don't you want
to be alone when you watch porn?

134
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,700
How do you sit through like an hour and
change of a movie and not jerk off with

135
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,250
each other? Even if you
go like, I'm not going to.

136
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,630
It's like then aren't you just always
distracted by other guys drinking at it

137
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,720
had to have just been a jerk fest and
these theaters and the, I'm sorry,

138
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,870
the cinema as you referring
to the cinema. Yeah, but then,

139
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,230
then they got paid money because
they sold a lot of videotapes.

140
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,770
Put you on the cover and you
know you were, you were selling,

141
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,660
you were selling copies and then
DVDs. But now with, with free,

142
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,420
I think it's really driven the money down.
So,

143
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,400
but I think you're at least making a
few hundred bucks for your pregnant porn

144
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:56,280
scene and the good news. But
it's not, it's a niche thing.
It's not like, you know,

145
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,540
but that's why it's even more in
demand. I don't know, is it? I Dunno,

146
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
but the good news is I
can't get pregnant again.

147
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,670
So I feel like I should be working a
lot right now. This is an ideal time.

148
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,190
Would you do like the airtight,

149
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,300
the two and you three and you tied
again at one in every hole. I mean,

150
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:16,490
I'm already pregnant. So
what's to lose? You're,

151
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,150
the cool thing is you have something
to show that kid too, you know? I mean,

152
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:24,840
right now you can show your kid that you
just stand up pregnant. That's exciting.

153
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,790
Not really. Not compared to three decks
in you and being like you're in there,

154
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:34,680
you're in the scene. Yeah. It's a
really cool thing to share with a child.

155
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,350
It is.
And also that would be a good clip.

156
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
And also who is that? That's
an Natasha. Oh my gosh.

157
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:44,790
Can we talk about these two by the way?
First of all,

158
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,300
let's let go or drop it all
over the tunnels. Seriously.

159
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:52,380
You really do have to be hard up.
Did you? Nine month pregnancy porn,

160
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,410
like you gotta be in Dire Straits. Well,
or just really committed to the game.

161
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,030
Really committed. I think that
there's a level of commitment there.

162
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,880
I know it kind of reminds me of
the crossfit games, right? Those,

163
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,640
those people work out a lot.
You know,

164
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,610
I follow fit moms of Instagram and there's
all these lunatic women who are nine

165
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:19,130
months pregnant doing dead lifts. Is
that what that's called? Where the um,

166
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,260
over their bellies and shit
and jumping up on boxes.

167
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,700
Power cleans and snatches. Yeah.
It's my favorite. It's so crazy.

168
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,950
One of my greatest motivators.
I know it sounds super sexist,

169
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,020
but I look at it and I'm like, Holy Shit,
I do, I do think of it as motivation.

170
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,160
I know someone will take it the wrong
way because this is the era of taking

171
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:46,161
everything social justice
warrior well deal with it.

172
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,730
We got to tweet about this.

173
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,000
Some women that are like
workout warriors that are

174
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,010
like 125 pounds that are stronger than me.

175
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,300
Sure.
So I look at it and I'm like,

176
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,540
this chick is out
squatting me out cleaning.

177
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,860
Like it's out. I look at it and
I'm like, Holy Shit. I mean,

178
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,660
it sounds like I'm saying, you
know, this is certainly possible,

179
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,010
but I'm really just amazed by
it, you know? I think that,

180
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,010
I think I feel your amazement too.
Yeah.

181
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,020
And I see like a tiny check and
you're like, how is she so pi?

182
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,550
I saw a Instagram thing,
I should look it up who it is.

183
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,790
But this woman was, I mean like
it looks like she's about five,

184
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,290
325 pounds. I mean, totally yoked,

185
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,420
but throwing around real weight,
like cleaning real weight.

186
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:48,370
And I was like, oh my God, I need to get
into the gym more. It's amazing, isn't it?

187
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,590
She's a fucking half my size. It's
amazing. And people are capable of, yeah.

188
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,470
I mean obviously I'll never work out
to the degree that she works out of her

189
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:01,090
whole life is working out,
but it still was amazingly motivating.

190
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,630
Yeah, of course. Uh, my
favorite are the Instagram,

191
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,440
the fit moms of Instagram and
there'll be like four days postpartum,

192
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,150
totally flat stomach six pack. You're
like, are you fucking out of your mind?

193
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,370
Like it's okay. It's just relax here.
Give yourself a minute. That's a lot.

194
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,110
You don't need to go back
to the gym right away.

195
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,500
24 hours after you had the
babies be fat for a minute. Look.

196
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:28,300
So we were talking about those.
Finish this a frequency thing. Okay,

197
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:32,770
so, so that, that whole movie,
I don't want to give it away,

198
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,240
but they're just trying to find,

199
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,300
you know what can defeat
these super sonic aliens.

200
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,090
And it got us thinking about sounds
and frequencies because there that's,

201
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,460
that's what they're dealing with.
I mean just try to learn a little bit.

202
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:52,240
Try to open your mind and learn a little
bit here. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Human

203
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,750
farts come in. All ranges of
sounds. There are popcorn farts,

204
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,900
which sounded like their name
typically have the same note.

205
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,130
There are also longer farts ones that
slide up from one note to the other.

206
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,730
Typically doing the musical scale.
That's right. That's really interesting.

207
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:09,160
So if you want it to find
the frequency of a Fart,

208
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,260
how would you go about doing that?
First off,

209
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,690
you would need to find out
which note you're farting.

210
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,950
It might be a good idea
to record the park.

211
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,790
Then using a piano or if
you're a trained singer,

212
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,360
you could use your voice to find the
note or notes. Once you find the note,

213
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,840
you can then consult this chart to
find the corresponding frequency.

214
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,010
How much,
oh,

215
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,340
she did not like farts at all.
What is the average farmer?

216
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:40,660
Sequency science has not yet provided
the answer to the average fart frequency

217
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:45,661
as of 2015 and while this is a rather
unscientifically provided hypothesis,

218
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,790
the average fire frequency likely ranges
in between note c two and c six or

219
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,030
130.81 and 1040 6.5 hertz.

220
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,030
Huh? Well, hold on a second. I
mean this is just fascinating.

221
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,770
I don't even know what that means,
but would it be important for snow,

222
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,010
the frequency of a fart? Yeah. Well,

223
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,700
there's probably no real reason to know
this information other than to entertain

224
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,860
yourself or your friends or is that still,

225
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,830
this video actually gives you
a lesson in sound engineering.

226
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,600
This is similar to the
technique recording. Engineers
use it, unwanted sound,

227
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,350
so they can cancel them out in the mix
by finding the frequency of a tone,

228
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,640
or in this case,

229
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:27,641
a fart one can remove the sound or boost
it by finding that frequency in an ICU

230
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,890
and manipulating it from there.
Okay. He lost, I was like,

231
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,080
why are we removing frequencies of words?

232
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,663
Okay.

233
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,480
That sounds like a d minor.
Is that the,

234
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,160
I don't know anything about chicken on
frequencies and sounds, any of that.

235
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:51,130
But I just feel like king after ever
it would blow away this engine. Yeah.

236
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:54,130
This is bullshit.
Bring in some real farts.

237
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,950
Bringing some of those as far
as for like children's, my,

238
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:01,080
our toddler farts like that. Yeah. But
back to what you were saying. So we,

239
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,410
we had Moshe and Natasha n
they have a special on Netflix,

240
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,131
uh,

241
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,360
the honeymoon tour and
they were delightful and we
learned so much about them,

242
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,340
but I think the real carry away and the
thing that's been kind of sticking to

243
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:19,150
you and me is the fact that
they don't fart in front of me.

244
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,773
Oh

245
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,780
yeah. I mean, a great drop.
Yeah. Um, yeah, I know they, uh,

246
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,290
they don't, here's, wow.

247
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,880
Six years of med carts.
Listen,

248
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:39,690
I can't even wrap my brain around
something like that. It's crazy.

249
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,560
It's really wild. I mean, I dunno.

250
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,500
Here's the thing is like now
you can't, I mean, I think it's,

251
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,810
I think in a way the woman leads,
right?

252
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,750
Because what would make
this clear to a man? No.

253
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:54,840
If you make it clear that it's not excel,
like really not acceptable,

254
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,880
where she's made it clear, it's
not going to happen. Right. Um,

255
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,600
then you're only doing that because
you want to really upset that person.

256
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,260
I feel like I started that lead and our
relationship and then it was completely

257
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,210
disregarded. It was this regard. Right.

258
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,410
But it was also met with a
embracement and joy. I don't know.

259
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,370
I don't know about that.

260
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:21,371
I just know that I had wishes I had
things established and those wishes we're

261
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,190
just done away with.
I waited months

262
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,900
three, four, three, four,

263
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,110
and he put my hand in your lap.
We were watching TV together.

264
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,030
You're sitting in your boxers as usual.
Yeah.

265
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,010
And you farted on my hand
and just started laughing.

266
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,320
Well, I thought that was,
that was bold. That's bold.

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,390
And it was a, it's like, why I just
sneak one out. Why not just go for it?

268
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
Yeah.
Well I

269
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,000
think, oh, are you break up immediately?

270
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,210
I think even if you had a kid
together should divorce you. Really?

271
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,370
I don't think she's done that move.
She's not.

272
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,140
What if he did that move now that
that'd be grounds for termination.

273
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,810
I don't think that would be cool for her.
Yeah,

274
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:10,950
because they're not even doing
the lean over and fart well. Well,

275
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,550
and what's really interesting about
their interview is that they don't even

276
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,800
announce when they have to take
dumps in front of each other,

277
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,170
which I find so hard. I mean, how do you
live with somebody every day, day to day,

278
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,830
and you, you just disappear for five.
Fascinated though. Because yeah,

279
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,110
it also has insight into understand
how other, I mean that's first of all,

280
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,390
it's not,
we're not talking about three months in.

281
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,180
This is six years and a baby,

282
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,690
which generally breaks down
a lot of those barriers.

283
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,810
If you've seen a woman give birth,
you generally then you kind of admire it.

284
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,640
Right. But they stay that committed
to keeping it. I honestly,

285
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,880
yeah. I mean look, I'm not
trying to pass judgment on them.

286
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:55,881
I'm just trying to understand how you can
go without farting and she didn't want

287
00:18:56,151 --> 00:19:00,400
to talk about shitting for six
years. Well that's fine. It's jump.

288
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,080
Well that makes you 40 even more.
It's a good point. A lot of veggies.

289
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,320
I feel like he eats pretty
healthy, right? Yeah.

290
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,760
I feel like he's holding a lot
of farts. I mean, look, my,

291
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,960
my ex, step mom and dad,
my stepmom had this policy,

292
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,320
this no Farnese she ever
fart in front of you? Never.

293
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,840
Not in the 17 years I knew her.

294
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,290
Now my dad on the other hand would
disregard it from time to time when I was

295
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,124
around at least.

296
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,420
And then we would have a good laugh at
the fort and she would get very upset and

297
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:33,210
she would leave and get
really, really, really mad.

298
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,000
So I think they had that no fart policy.
Right.

299
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,720
What about the sneak outs in the middle
of the night? Oh, those don't count those,

300
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,370
those, those anybody would forgive.
That's a completely unreasonable,

301
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,110
but I'm talking about you're
awake. You got to Fart. I mean,

302
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,480
how many a day are we?
Oh my gosh.

303
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,100
And then what if you ate Korean barbecue
and you've had Kimchi and the farts are

304
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:01,950
just a lot that day. So what do
you, you're holding it in all day.

305
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,220
It's gotta be very definitely. My favorite
parts are the ones that wake you up

306
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,570
parts all the time.
Nice.

307
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:14,430
I was just asleep bar.
Can you do it all the time?

308
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,300
You do it constantly makes me, it
makes me laugh a lot. I don't know.

309
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:22,590
I mean again, I'm not judging them.
That's totally their decision.

310
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,220
I'm just trying to wrap my head around
how it would be even possible for us.

311
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:30,210
I'm saying [inaudible] I'm really just
thinking about us. It can't happen.

312
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,570
By the way. Speaking of
your, uh, your porn quest,

313
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,250
your pregnancy porn,

314
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,310
the mommies are flooding
some comments in porn hub.

315
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,630
There's a comment section there.

316
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,220
This is like if you keep your
jeans high and tight, 250 thumbs

317
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,600
up here. Oh Wow. Um, then someone
wrote, try it out in 92 thumbs up.

318
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,740
So it's like we have a
fan base here on pornhub.

319
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,380
Pornhub he should have taken
about 10 to 12 Benadryl.

320
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,150
That stuff makes you horny or than
you've ever been in your entire yeah.

321
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,430
Buy it out. Piss on me. Beat me. Try it
out. Hey, Hitler's, I mean, these are all,

322
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,960
what clip is this form? It doesn't
mention here. I Dunno. Hmm.

323
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,070
It's black guys who like to fuck and
fuck. Good. It's pretty good. Yeah. Oh,

324
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,410
it's one, it looks like it says it's one
of the, uh, a ball hog videos. Oh yeah.

325
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,910
That would make sense.

326
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,460
So said I had to check out the porn hub,
a ball hog videos,

327
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:32,350
horrific. Who wants to see someone
slur pound balls for 80% of the video.

328
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,830
Anyways, she just wanted to let you
know that Mommy's took over the comment.

329
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:40,150
So it is, it is on the, um, the ball hog.

330
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,960
Hi, I'm Payton Lafferty and
Bajan Lafferty. Yeah. Before,

331
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,420
I forget, uh, movies.

332
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:51,060
We were watching a trailer for that movie.

333
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,860
Mamma Mia came on for something like
say, I know and I, it's so funny.

334
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:57,630
It's like an all star cast
too. It's fit. I'm sure. Yeah.

335
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:02,170
Meryl Streep share and all
these, you know. Um, but I,

336
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,070
I can't think of something I'd want to
watch less. Pretty fucking terrible.

337
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,730
I mean,
and then I got to thinking,

338
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:12,810
what are the other horrible movies I
can make you watch? So would you rather,

339
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,750
would you rather sit
through Mama Mia and I mean,

340
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,840
you got to go to theater and really
sit down and watch every stupid thing.

341
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,620
I enjoy all the Abba songs or Chicago.

342
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,230
He had a comment Danna it's all
like the crime that you know,

343
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,210
is Queen Latifah's in there.
It's really hard for me to say.

344
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,230
It's really hard for me. When we saw a
little bit of Chicago, we saw six seconds.

345
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:43,200
It was on TV. It is unbearable.
That's right. It was through the TV.

346
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:47,490
Fuck it out the window. But
I mean, they seem terrible.

347
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,300
They're both terrible. I
hate musicals, so I see why.

348
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,170
And it musical movies or even worse.

349
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,840
I lasted literally the first,

350
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,930
not even to the completion of the first
scene of La la land because they started,

351
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,120
oh, I forward it through all the songs in
that. I just like Ryan Gosling hate it.

352
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,670
I walked out of the movie about PT Barnum.

353
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,880
I didn't know that fucking was
a musical. It's a musical. Yeah.

354
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:14,780
I went to the theater to go see it and
then halfway through the first song I was

355
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:18,380
like, I don't know if I can do this. I my
the third song, I was like, I'm, I'm out.

356
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:22,630
Down. Yeah. Got Go. I don't like it. I
was pregnant. I walked home cold. Really?

357
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,930
Like I can't fucking,
I can't you walk. Yeah.

358
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:30,710
It was an out Puto was I proud?
Yeah. No, no. I wasn't pregnant then.

359
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,610
Hmm. And Short Lake shortlink
shitty happening mean.

360
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:37,240
How do I pick one of these awful
fucking thing? I don't know.

361
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,190
Here's my mamma mia has a chick flick,
so chicargo. Yeah, but Mama Mia is Arba.

362
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,253
Do you like Aba?

363
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,040
I can tolerate it. I guess.
I think I probably like

364
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,970
Aba more.

365
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,340
Then the straight up Chicago
musical songs for that,

366
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,650
for that movie.
Yeah.

367
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Those are terrible because those are like
traditional songs for a musical story

368
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,520
I could tolerate. Ah, but more, you
know what I don't like about Chicago?

369
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:08,020
I will say what I did watch it for
like the Queen Latifa St Louis.

370
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,780
She's like the boss, the prison
guard who like runs stuff. Yeah.

371
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,740
It's sort of the repetition
of the chorus or whatever.

372
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm the boss lady.

373
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,410
They call me the boss and I'm the boss
and our boss you around and you're like,

374
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:24,410
I fucking heard you say that. Like
I get it. You're the boss. People.

375
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:28,040
Some people love this shit.
The repetition. Well, you
know, here's the thing. Yeah.

376
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,460
I, I, the older I get,

377
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,890
the more I understand that people like
all kinds of different things. Yeah.

378
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,750
And you know,

379
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,560
it enrages you sometimes. Yeah. Um,

380
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,220
what's funny to me is that they don't,

381
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,370
the people that love that get
mad at you for not loving it.

382
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,630
That's the funny part to sure.

383
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,670
Because I remember when we talked about
slam poetry and we made fun of that and

384
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:58,590
then people would write in like, I
love him. Like go love it. Why are you,

385
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,960
why does it affect you? What I like,
I'm just telling you what I like.

386
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,650
I know they get so personally offended.
Yeah.

387
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,310
It's like these are just opinions
of here's one or two people.

388
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,400
I like Alba's music.
I actually you could tolerate that.

389
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:15,960
I grew up listening to it because
both my parents are euro, you know?

390
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,770
They liked that stuff, so
I like Fernando. I like,

391
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,370
I like a lot of the Aba song then you
other than this, an easy choice for you,

392
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:27,600
but it's an annoying fucking movie. It's
annoying. Yeah. It is a good cast though.

393
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,510
And I don't want to
hear them sing my songs.

394
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:35,160
I want to hear Aba singing Meryl
Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin firth.

395
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,080
It's a good, it's a good, yeah,

396
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,700
but it's so lame how they incorporate
the music into it, you know? Yeah.

397
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,960
So this must have been it. Was this a
huge hit when it came out originally?

398
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,620
The original one? Yeah, I think
it Mama Mia has been out for,

399
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,680
I was a musical for a long time and
then they did these movies of it and now

400
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:56,700
there's a sequel to the first
Mama Mia. Yeah, she's pregnant.

401
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,350
So those were my mom got her pussy
blasted out. Right. Yeah. Uh,

402
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,870
but yeah,
it's a lot of us euro trash.

403
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:08,871
There's Love Mama Mia and I'm pretty
sure my stepmom went to go see it.

404
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,300
Yeah. You think so? Yeah. Yeah.

405
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,020
There was something. He liked that. So

406
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,270
Fernando,

407
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,460
I like Fernando and there's no regrets.

408
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,010
It's kind of Nice. Right. Okay.
Yeah. That's fair. My belly. Oh,

409
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,240
this check vote. You've
got an email. Yeah. Um,

410
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,633
yeah.

411
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,950
It's amazing. Just listening to episode
four or 53 about female super burps.

412
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:44,250
Yup.

413
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,020
Yup. My girlfriend of three years always
burps this way. She doesn't even try.

414
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,160
Just how it comes out,
to be honest.

415
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:54,080
This is one of the things that sealed
the deal on that relationship early on.

416
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,190
That's a beautiful eastern European
redhead. Burping loud, a super sexy.

417
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,190
I've always had super far. It's, I love
spicy foods and have huge farts every day.

418
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,940
We had the perfect balance in our
relationship. She's 39 weeks pregnant now.

419
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,780
Oh my God.
Your grants.

420
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,900
The end of our second trimester,
she's had super far. It's as well now.

421
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:18,440
She is totally dominating me in the gas
gauge and I'm feeling a little jealous.

422
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,910
She even had a supersonic double
pipe classic a few weeks ago. Wow.

423
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:25,400
Congratulations on that.
More so than the baby.

424
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,210
What do you suggest I do about
this blatant emasculation Mommy's.

425
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:32,060
I love the show. Love you both
keep those jeans high and tight.

426
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,450
Piss on me and beat me home here now.
David.

427
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,860
I, I'm here now. Yeah. What
do you mean emasculation I
think you need to celebrate.

428
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,580
No. Why? Why does it have to? Well cause
he's feeling makes what you're doing. Oh,

429
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,080
he's feeling a little left out. She's
trumping hardcore in this stuff. Yeah,

430
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:51,080
but pregnancy is kind of an unfair
advantage and the double, that's not true.

431
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,520
I would say this,
David,

432
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,360
you better celebrate for about another
week because it's about to be over.

433
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,530
So just know that it's
temporary. You know, it's almost
like she has a cheat code.

434
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,980
She does have a Chico. Yeah. And
once that baby jeans comes out,

435
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:07,850
the baby's going to have more farts and
both of you so time to get over it. Yeah.

436
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:12,590
It's, um, get over
yourself. She's, it's, it's,

437
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,220
it's time to, uh, let
her know that, you know,

438
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,970
she can enjoy this while it lasts because
it's not going to last much like she's

439
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,340
39 weeks pregnant. She's right there,
man. She's right at their door.

440
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,500
That's so funny. Uh, this female were
far too. We'll be back and you'll,

441
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,450
you'll don't you worry. Yeah. Um,

442
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,410
I love the idea that women are strong in
the burb game. Yeah. It's pretty cool.

443
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:33,681
It's good.

444
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:37,550
Could start a whole gender war now
between who's better at burping the men or

445
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:41,990
the women? Yeah. At the BURP challenge.
It's pretty quiet. Pretty crazy. I mean,

446
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:44,930
sometimes I feel like mine are better
than yours and sometimes years are better

447
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:49,790
than mine. You feel like sometimes.
Yeah. I, the fort game is really yours.

448
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:53,030
Like I'm going to give it to you. I
feel really dominate, but the verb game,

449
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,220
here's why your farts are
consistent. Yeah. Over time. I'm,

450
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:03,050
I'm more regular. Yeah. But
sometimes my burp game is strong.

451
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,120
Sometimes yours is,
if that's true,

452
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,040
it's kind of go here and there. Um,
another reminder before I forget,

453
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,050
they try to remind people
that new episodes are going
on twitch before youtube.

454
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,910
So, uh, we will be experimenting a little
further down the road with live ones.

455
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:24,140
But for right now,
Youtube uploads at 11:00 PM Pacific,

456
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,090
Tuesday evenings twitch,

457
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,300
we'll do 9:00 PM Pacific and it's
twitch.tv/your mom's house podcast.

458
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,830
So there is that reminder.
Yeah, I mean, I dunno what,

459
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,100
well, I just feel like, I feel like
far it's kind of go back and forth too.

460
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,410
Well, it all fluctuates. It's all
cycles and seasons, you know? Yeah. Uh,

461
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:51,411
so we were driving yesterday home and I
saw somebody walking their dog shirtless

462
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:57,180
as usual, which I find horrifically
disgusting. I don't know.

463
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,920
I don't know why guys think it's okay
to go shirtless if I can't go shirtless.

464
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:05,910
It's kind of unfair.
Anyways,

465
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,410
I had one of those things,
Tommy,

466
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,030
where I've been saying something one way
for 42 years and then you pointed out

467
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:14,760
to me like smart and final. I
remember when I was like, dude,

468
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:16,230
I don't even know what's
in smart and final.

469
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,510
I thought it was like office supplies.

470
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:23,300
Like yeah you're smart but all sales are
final. I had no idea that smart finals,

471
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:27,390
like a grocery type of store.
Well Anyway, yesterday I go,

472
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:31,530
that guy's wearing a sun visor. How
fucking lame is that? Like a sun visors,

473
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:36,300
the fucking most useless thing cause
you're top of your head is burning and you

474
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,910
go,
it's not as nice or you dork.

475
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,330
It's just called a visor and my fucking
head exploded because I'm like my whole

476
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:49,380
life, my parents have called
it a sun visor and chewing gum.

477
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,090
I've heard chewing gum my whole life.

478
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:55,140
So I thought everybody calls it chewing
gum or a sun visor. I mean it might be

479
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,320
what I told you was that it might
technically have started as started out as

480
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:02,670
people saying a sun visor,

481
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:06,270
like in the 70s maybe like when if first
came whenever they first designed them,

482
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,860
but my whole life,
whenever someone is referring to that hat,

483
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,300
no one says son,

484
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,160
it's just like a Pfizer.
Are you sure?

485
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:20,170
100% because both my foreign parents call.
Like I said,

486
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,970
I thought it made sense.

487
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:26,960
A sports visor also call these sun
visor or visor cap is a type of crown,

488
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:30,760
let's hat blah blah blah.
It's a visor, Pfizer,

489
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,130
but, but you're more American than I am.
Right, and I would take your word over.

490
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,043
Well,
it,

491
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,420
like I said, I think technically
it might be called a sun visor.

492
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,960
Maybe makes sense that
that was the original name.

493
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,110
But if you're talking to people here,

494
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,530
you would just say advisor,
like you know

495
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,230
you wouldn't, you wouldn't say hand me
that son. You'd say, Oh really? Yeah.

496
00:31:56,231 --> 00:32:00,320
You wouldn't say, give me a
piece of chewing gum. I've
been saying that for four.

497
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:04,470
Know that you're, you're, you're standing
out as not being from here. Yeah.

498
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,850
I mean, everybody would know what you
meant. My, everybody knows what you mean.

499
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:14,750
But they also are like, this person just
learned English. Like, yeah, it's advisor.

500
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,400
I've been saying chewing gum and sun visor
my whole life until, until yesterday.

501
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:23,080
So I'm wiser for me and I've never
sell, but that, that's interesting.

502
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,030
I just never heard,

503
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,000
I guess I've never been around
people who use that word enough.

504
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,050
My mother called it a sun visor,
so I called it a sun visor.

505
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,620
This looks like that.
The thing for your windshield,

506
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,120
they're coming that have sun shade.

507
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,980
Uh Huh.
But remember those were popular in

508
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,390
the 80s everyone has a seat.

509
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,350
Not even that mission that's
come up here for Sun visor.

510
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,570
It's interesting. Yeah. That was
funny. He did go, hey, a sun visor.

511
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,120
Look at that. Look at that lady walked
by. It's like, give me an advisor.

512
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,480
They're so lame. Sun visors though, just
makes the top of your head hot. So dumb.

513
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,510
Why would you bring your wine? I
Dunno. Like, yeah, if it's hot,

514
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,720
it implies that the sun's
out and cook in your head.

515
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,440
So why would you leave that
part of your head uncovered?

516
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:13,690
And then why don't I just
wear a cap, right. Um,

517
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,690
should we pause for a moment? Cause our,
our guests should be here any moment.

518
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,800
Press pause.
Can we do that?

519
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,260
It's like a quick pause and
we'll be right back. All right,

520
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:24,770
we're back.

521
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,770
We took a quick break and our guests is
joining us now he says here you've done

522
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:35,420
some acting. It says there, I've done
some acting. Yes, that was proofreading.

523
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,120
Yes, I have done that. I have done acting.
When I first got into stand up, um,

524
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,800
that's all I wanted to
do with stand up comedy.

525
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,030
I was hanging up the Improv and
stuff and, and um, one day mark Leno,

526
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,050
who was bud Freeman, so partner business
partner, uh, sat down next to me, he goes,

527
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:54,450
hey, you ever think about acting? And
I said, not really. I just kind of,

528
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,600
you know what I'm want to do. Stand
up. That's all I want to do. Yeah.

529
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,381
You don't think about acting.

530
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,290
Cause sometimes there'll be a casting
agent will come in and see you in the back

531
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,620
room and want you to come in and do a
cold reading for their pilot or whatever,

532
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:07,910
you know, it could be a good thing.
So I'm also, he taught acting,

533
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,110
so that was his good. But I did take up
acting and I did a lot of workshops and,

534
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:16,610
um, and I'm glad I did. Yeah,
I mean you've made a quite,

535
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,430
I should probably say your name. It's a,
it's Kevin Nealon. Everybody who is a,

536
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,600
who's listening to us.
Thank you first of all for coming over.

537
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:28,980
I really appreciate it. It was easy. I
live upstairs. I didn't know, you know,

538
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,120
you were going to ever come
down. That's the thing. I mean,

539
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,460
I heard a lot of noise down here and I
thought there must be people that live

540
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:38,150
down there. Look, it's so real that
you're sitting in front of me. Um,

541
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,660
because first of all, first of all,
what the fuck are you taking? Is it,

542
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:45,710
is this how you don't look older? This
juice? What? What's going on? We know.

543
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,360
I just started drinking orange juice.
Yeah.

544
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:50,240
Never used to drink that much of it
because it had a lot of sugar in it.

545
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,950
And I'm trying to cut down
on my sugar intake. But,

546
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,520
and also I used to have oatmeal every
morning and that changed about two weeks

547
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:59,240
ago. Right now I switched over
to eggs. Why the sudden change?

548
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,970
I think I just got tired of uh,
oatmeal,

549
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:05,490
the oatmeal over and over flavor
it or just plain. Oh well I'm,

550
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:07,670
I'm the king of oatmeal.
I'll go back to it too.

551
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,600
And I'm just taking a little
hiatus, a little lunch. We've been,

552
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,460
we've been on eggs for a while. I hate
him and I ate them. I forced myself to.

553
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,990
What do you need to, well, I
mean, okay, I even asked you this.

554
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:21,050
I think when I saw you laugh factory it,
is this just genetic.

555
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,760
This is why you look like you, you did in
1994. Well, I am rotting on the inside.

556
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,410
You'll ask the problems, see that makes
you happy. Cause it really upsets me that,

557
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:33,710
um, that you, you maintain
so well. How old are you?

558
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,100
I am 20 Kevin Guess how

559
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,280
old do you want to guess? Um, I
have, you're like one of those,

560
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:45,870
you look at Golfer, I can't tell how old
you are. I mean your eyes look young.

561
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,640
The rest of you, it looks
really, really decrepit.

562
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,350
I we're going to go ahead and say

563
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,513
40

564
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,100
that's pretty good.
Guess I'm 39

565
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,440
I used to call him the
Albert pools of comedy. Yeah.

566
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,310
Cause you know a lot
of the baseball player,

567
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:10,080
especially with Dominican guys would
lie about their age when the recruiters

568
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:10,501
went down.

569
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,770
So they'd be the only like 17 in the
scouts would show up and they'd be like,

570
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:18,250
I'm 14 and then they would get signed and
pool halls was the guy who [inaudible]

571
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:20,760
17 was too old. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah,

572
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,500
they would because they'd be playing in
these like little league teams and then

573
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,800
then the guy would finally get in the
majors and really some of them really

574
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:33,180
start to show their age and they'd
be like, your 23. The guy's like, no,

575
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:37,290
I'm actually 31 but you know, they just,
they did whatever it took to get in.

576
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,140
Well, I think genetically I was kind of
lucky because when I was on high school I

577
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:44,940
looked like I was 12 when I graduated.

578
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,750
If you look at my high school yearbook
picture, I really, I had no body here.

579
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,460
I was so embarrassed because I was so
far behind everybody. And um, and I have,

580
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,610
I was five, eight when I graduated
high school. I'm six, four,

581
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:59,010
nine what you were finding when you
graduated high school and I had a lot of

582
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,860
baby fat on me and stuff and um,

583
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,860
and then I just shot up after a
high school, you know, I got to,

584
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,860
I went to college and I
got a job lifeguarding and
they was sitting out in the

585
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,610
sun where I just started
growing. Yeah. But, um,

586
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,060
you actually graduated high school as
what would be considered a short guy if

587
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:17,880
five. Eight is the average
size? Maybe a little lower.

588
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm not sure what a c has a tall person.
You don't really think about height.

589
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,830
You just,

590
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:26,010
the only time I think about highest when
I see a really tall guy and I think,

591
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,950
man, that guy's tall. Oh,
am I that tall? I hope not.

592
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:30,990
And I'll stand next to
him without him knowing.

593
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,320
I really thank God I'm not that tall.

594
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,260
I think I'm like just a
hair below freakishly tall.

595
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,960
And that's what I get a lot from people
when they first see me, they say,

596
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,600
I didn't realize you were
this tall. I said, I know.

597
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:45,450
I just realized that the other day.
It's so genuinely upsetting too.

598
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:49,320
It's another thing about it,
you know? Yeah. It's upsetting
how tall you are. Yeah.

599
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,990
Because yeah, it's like when
you expect to have like a, uh,

600
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,510
a nice big corn on the cob and all
they have is like a corn dog. Oh man,

601
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,820
you weren't, you didn't have that
picture in your head. And I see.

602
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,750
Trying to think if I've ever imagined how
tall you were, because I remember, um,

603
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,733
you know,

604
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,060
my first exposure to you was weekend
update and I don't think you have when you

605
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:11,290
were watching that. Yeah,
of course you don't have,

606
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,940
yeah. You had your TV's not
that big either. You know,

607
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,670
I tell people they need to get a bigger
TV that way they'll see how tall I am

608
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,200
and how tall you are. I'm not like five
inches tall. Where did you grow up?

609
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,200
I grew up in Connecticut. Bridgeport,
Connecticut. Not Proud of it,

610
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,760
but I heard they just got
a new comedy called bear.

611
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,570
I be first comedy club in Bridgeport.
Bridgeport? Yeah. Where's bridges factory?

612
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,470
It's um, it's about an hour and 15
minutes north of New York City. Oh,

613
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,040
it's really long island sound.
Yeah.

614
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:37,930
So would you go in there a
lot because there's no, I was,

615
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,890
I was really afraid of New York City,
uh, growing up in Connecticut because,

616
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,580
because it was a big city and there was
all these one way streets and the New

617
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,700
Yorkers were tough, you know, and so I,
and it was hard to drive in there too,

618
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,670
cause you had to get on the merit
parkway and then get over to all of these

619
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:54,280
other freeways and stuff and
the traffic was going fast.

620
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,820
And so I didn't go into that much that
really the first time I went in there on

621
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,960
school trips to the museum. But
the first time I, I, I, you know,

622
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,370
looked at a comedy club. I drove in
there and I went to see the catch,

623
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,550
a rising star and the comic strip and,
um,

624
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,470
um, the Improv. And it was just,

625
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,770
I was like a farm boy going into a city,
you know,

626
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:21,940
it was just lights and cars
everywhere and you know, but, um,

627
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,310
but, but getting back to the
genetic thing, I think that, um,

628
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,541
I really am,

629
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:31,540
my body has taken a toll because I played
football and rugby and soccer growing

630
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:35,230
up, so I have like hip like three
years ago. Did you really? Yeah,

631
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,220
my right side and, um, my
shoulders are like really sore now.

632
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,250
I think there's probably
arthritis in there and, uh,

633
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,600
and then when I pee I get this pain
in my back. It's like a kidney stone.

634
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,530
Every p no, only kind of like, after
I worked out I did a hike, you know?

635
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,680
Um, yeah, that checked out or you
guys doctors, I can hear, okay,

636
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,220
I can do it. No, I did have
it checked out. Well again,

637
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:04,520
I'm at that age now where they don't
find anything wrong. It's just a muscle,

638
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,410
just like you're dying slowly, but
you're decomposing. Yeah, yeah.

639
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,040
No, but I have had kidney stones
before and that's not fun. Really bad.

640
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,440
Does the Jews help the
juice helps? Yeah, no,

641
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,810
I'm a water helps a lot of water.
Thankfully I won't have them.

642
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,430
I drink a lot of water drinks,
Brown coffee all day long.

643
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:28,600
Does that help with kidney stones? Coffee
actually they say is good for you now,

644
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:33,480
isn't it? Yeah, it's mostly water.
That's the thing. Yeah, it makes you pee.

645
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,630
I thought it was dehydrating. You don't
know what that word means. So Pete,

646
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:41,200
now you know what? PBNS pains,
but I did get a, here's a,

647
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:44,530
here's a word you need to familiarize
yourself with and you want to avoid this.

648
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,440
It's called a cystoscopy.
Cystoscopy.

649
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,900
It's what you get after you've had a
kidney stone. It's through the Cody.

650
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,000
Your knowledge as urologists. Yeah.
And you don't really know what it is.

651
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,230
They say it's not pleasant,
but you'll be okay. So yeah,

652
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,030
you sit back and they
take a, uh, you know,

653
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:11,650
a tube and they numb your penis and um,

654
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,080
they didn't have the
numbing solution was there.

655
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:16,420
So I had to sit on it for like a
half hour to make it go to sleep.

656
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,530
Oh my goodness. And then they shoved
that thing up there into your bladder.

657
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,820
Oh
yeah,

658
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:29,200
they got a little ritual,
Dick. Yeah, yeah. That's,

659
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,560
but so anyway, I did that one time
and they found nothing up there.

660
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:37,090
How painful was that?
Yeah. You know what it,

661
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:40,490
it was kind of like, um,
even though they numbed it,

662
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,570
it was still kind of like, uh, I just
stopped short of saying take it out,

663
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,140
take it out. Yeah. You know, I had a
catheter in one time in the hospital,

664
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:51,910
I was in the hospital and
the nurse tripped. Oh.

665
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,820
And it pulled out like,
how, and I was like, ah.

666
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,210
She was like, ah, I'm sorry. It
wasn't supposed to happen. I was like,

667
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,100
don't say anything. Don't tell anybody
breathing. So yeah, don't get me fired.

668
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,220
Gosh, you guys talking about all these
painful things. I hope I don't have to.

669
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,420
Yeah. Here's the funny thing.
Here's a fun one. When I was 23,

670
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:13,520
I had a bump on my neck. Yeah. And uh,

671
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:15,890
I went to some doctor back then
in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

672
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,770
And this is when you could
smoke in the doctor's office.

673
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,990
And he was smoking a big cigar and he
reaches across his desk and he feels it

674
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:28,010
with his two fingers. And he goes, okay,
what you have here is a, a a tumor.

675
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,700
And when he said tumor that
mixed with a cigar smoke,

676
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,110
I started to get narrow vision.
Yeah.

677
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,300
And I was starting to feel faint and he
looked and he was talking about it and

678
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,010
he, and he saw it how I
looked because you all right,

679
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,370
you want me to open a window? I said,
yet, please open up one window. So

680
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,973
I said the, the, the,

681
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,310
the tumor thing kind of like
pushed a button on me right there.

682
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,130
I was 23 of course. And he
goes, well, I call it a tumor,

683
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:54,810
but it's just fatty tissue, fatty
tissue, but we'll take it out, you know,

684
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,860
just to do a biopsy on. I'm sure it's
nothing. So I went to, in the hospital,

685
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,090
I just got out of college.
You know what, I'm ready for
my whole life. Yeah. And, um,

686
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,940
and they put me in a room with another
guy who would just come out of surgery

687
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,070
and they wheel him in and he starts waking
up and, you know, he's awake and he's,

688
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:13,010
uh, you know, kind of recovering.
And like an hour later,

689
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,450
I'm going in the next morning for surgery,
the nurse comes in and says to him,

690
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,970
have you, uh, have you peed yet? He
goes, no, no, I haven't. He goes, okay,

691
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:24,170
well,
you're going to have to pee soon,

692
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:27,620
otherwise we're going to have to
catheterize you. Yeah. He goes, he says,

693
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,630
w w what's catheterize me? Oh boy as
well. And she told them, hey. He said,

694
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,620
ah, no, that's not going to happen.
There's going to be a battle in here.

695
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,110
I want Ginger Ale. Give me a lot of
ginger rail right now. Ginger Ale,

696
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:43,250
tres or Ginger Ale. And I'm thinking, oh
Geez. Oh my God. And then I told them,

697
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:46,130
I said, hey, would you do me a favor
when I come out of surgery tomorrow?

698
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:48,180
Which you please make sure
I drink a lot of territory.

699
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,550
That's what they do do after childbirth.
What am I at first son?

700
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,240
The minute that epidural wears off,
they get around you and they're like,

701
00:43:57,241 --> 00:44:00,480
you have to pee and if you don't, we're
going to put the catheter back in. Oh boy.

702
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:04,020
You Push that pee out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's hard as you hit that epidurals.

703
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,260
The greatest though, isn't it? It's
the best. Oh, my do drags. I love it.

704
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,680
My wife had one at one centimeter. Yeah.
That's what you want to barely at all.

705
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,100
That's what I'm going to do.
People are usually one centimeter,

706
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,390
one centimeter right now.
Yeah. That's what I said.

707
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,810
Every time I see my doctor, I go,
when do I get the drugs? And he goes,

708
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:25,480
whenever you want. You know, I
think the epidural would be, uh,

709
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,320
an epidemic like opioids.

710
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,220
If it wasn't so difficult to put in that
needle right now know that would be,

711
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,060
but you're so grateful for it.
I don't even,

712
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,680
I want to feel where you're
feeling that you want. Yeah.

713
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,710
The childbirth or the epidural.
The epidural. It's pretty Rad.

714
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,400
You just take a nap and stuff and they
wake you up and they kind of got to know

715
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:47,760
what you're doing to get an epidural.
Like when you, if you do a home pregnancy,

716
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,530
don't let your husband give you
the Epicor. Yeah, I've heard,

717
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,780
I've heard
married 12 years.

718
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,330
Oh Wow. And we had a couple in here, uh,

719
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:06,590
last episode and they've been together
for six years and they last it off

720
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,090
and we were so surprised to find that
they don't fart in front of each other.

721
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,300
My wife doesn't Fart in front of me.
At least

722
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,440
my son and I, we are creative
artists. Yeah. I love it. We,

723
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:27,360
um, we make it a entertainment
thing. It's like shooting the gun.

724
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,330
Oh yeah. Tickling something, you know,
pulling the finger kind of thing.

725
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:33,150
That's the initial,
but we've taken it to new heights,

726
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,330
you know, lift the leg up or you don't,
and whenever I do it, when he's with me,

727
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,450
yeah. He outside, like he'll get
really embarrassed. Sure. Look around,

728
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,390
make sure nobody's look, I said,
buddy, buddy, I'm a pro man.

729
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:49,990
I'm doing this for years. No one's
around. I love, I love the movement.

730
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,420
I like to do like fun
in bed. I'll do like,

731
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,270
I'll kick it off. But yeah, my wife has
never fired one time she let us weaker.

732
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,200
But I'm imagining you don't
like sit on her and but,

733
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:04,750
but I mean like if you have to,

734
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,530
if you have to fart in your
weft around like do you, do
you leave the room? No, no,

735
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,750
no. But she's from the south so she's
very proper. Where's she from? Nashville.

736
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,180
You know, she's a southern Belle so I
try not to kind of do it around her.

737
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,770
Do you get up and leave the room or what
I do is I cut back on the sugar cause

738
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:28,170
that's what does it. You like
sugar, don't you? Of course.

739
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:31,370
And I've tried to eliminate
it. You can't, it's, it's a,

740
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,720
I went without it for a long
time. How long? As long,

741
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:37,230
cause I did it for six months.
Ones. Oh, I did a year.

742
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,570
But you know what happens?
You a congratulations
first of all. Yeah. You Go,

743
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,120
oh maybe I'll just have a little
piece of that scone of course.

744
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:47,970
And that's a trigger and then it
opens up the gate. It's like a,

745
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,100
it's like cocaine. Oh it goes
crazy. Someone was telling
me that if you had, um,

746
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,570
if sugar was just discovered now,

747
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,420
they would never approve it
cause it would be too addictive.

748
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,950
I totally believe that. And the sugar
lobby is massive. It's so powerful.

749
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,130
It's in everything. It's in
everything. And it is like,

750
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:08,010
it is horrific for your system.

751
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,370
It does nothing but dancer feeds on
it. You know, it's horrible. It's,

752
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,470
you see how much people consume it. It's
really crazy. Here's a great thing to do.

753
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,860
Go to the movie theater, like going
to crowded, you know, screen. Yeah.

754
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,090
And um,
about 10 minutes into the film,

755
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,000
just walk up in front by the
screen and look at the audience.

756
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,110
They are shoving so much food,
junk into their mouths and I'm,

757
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,610
I'm one of those people, you
know, and I just, you know,

758
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:36,100
and I say the first 10 minutes,
cause everybody plows through their stuff.

759
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,400
I usually finish my popcorn
before the trailers are over.

760
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,860
Yeah. Most people, yeah.

761
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:44,580
Like if you get it beforehand at the
temptation to just go through it because

762
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:47,400
the $20 popcorn is so good.
It's so good.

763
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,610
Penny counter. Every time I take a kernel
there was 5 cents, 25 cents right there.

764
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,400
So you're just running,
you're running that tap the whole time.

765
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,390
Speaking of cinema, do
you remember, did you,

766
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:03,810
I don't know how long you been in La for,
but I remember in like the eighties,

767
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,120
the late seventies,
there was like the pussycat theater,

768
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,720
which they would show
pornography in movie theaters.

769
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,650
Did you ever go to one?
Like what we're trying to like,

770
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,600
like basically we were saying how the
money has been driven down for the

771
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:19,950
performers and actors,

772
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,200
cause he used to be in cinema and then
people would buy videotape to DVDs and

773
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,310
now it's like free on
youtube. It's not, you know,

774
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,130
really well people are stealing
it and just playing it.

775
00:48:29,131 --> 00:48:33,540
So did you ever go to cinema to a movie
theater? Was that a common thing to do?

776
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,540
To See Porno? Yeah. No, but I remember
peewee Herman that time. That'll be, yeah.

777
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,830
You know, um, no,

778
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:44,040
but I've worked in theaters before and
I'm sure you have too, where they say,

779
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,350
you know,
this what used to be a Vaudeville thing,

780
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:50,350
and the last thing was a porno
theater. Yeah, that's true
model. Yeah, that's true.

781
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,890
Um, but, um, but I will tell you,

782
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:55,510
I used to be a bartender at the
Improv when I first moved out.

783
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,890
It's so crazy to me too
that you're actually one of
those because there's always

784
00:48:58,891 --> 00:48:59,880
these stories about,

785
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,700
it was just the job I got as I was
trying to become a standup, you know,

786
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:05,730
it wasn't like I was a bartender and
then they said all this frequenting the

787
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:09,990
Improv when you were, let me tell you
and then remind me about this story.

788
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,360
Let's got theater. Um, I was, I,

789
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,380
first night I walked in and I knew
the Improv was the place in La.

790
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,240
So I came out here and I got a job. Uh,
I befriended the bartender and he says,

791
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:23,310
Hey, we need a bartender for
like Sunday, Monday nights.

792
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:27,030
I can get you a job if you want. And I'd
never bartended before. So I kind of, uh,

793
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,300
you know,

794
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,630
boned up on that and I got the Boston
bartender's guide and I kept it behind the

795
00:49:30,631 --> 00:49:32,520
bar and I refer to it a lot,
you know,

796
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,330
but I'm the first night I went in there
to sit at the bar or even to my right,

797
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,690
I'm looking in the mirror and it's this
weird looking guy and I'm looking at him

798
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:44,100
and it's Marty Feldman
and then there's a guy sitting next to me,

799
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:47,010
we start talking and he tells me
he's the original Ronald McDonald.

800
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,960
Later I find out he wasn't,

801
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:52,380
it was Bob's and Buddha Kaufman's
a kind of right hand man, you know,

802
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:53,310
and he was just messing with me.

803
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,190
But I would see everybody
come in there as I bartended.

804
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:58,560
I would see all these comics I used
to watch on the MERV Griffin show.

805
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,070
I'm like Douglas and the tonight's
show and all these, you know,

806
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,420
like Dadi Archibald and
George Miller and you know,

807
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,690
Jay Leno and Letterman and everybody,
Steve Martin call one night said,

808
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,310
looking for Bud Freeman.
He wasn't in,

809
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,280
you want to know if you'd come
down to a spot. I said, yes, yes,

810
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,650
you're on the phone. Yeah. And
then I see, you know, like,

811
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,740
and then the back room was
packed with comics that were,

812
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,390
had such a charge to them. Like, you
know, like Andy Kaufman would come in,

813
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,960
Robin Williams would come from Mork and
Mindy with the suspenders on still. And,

814
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:28,820
um, and, and I, I hear myself talking this
now and it seems like yesterday, yeah,

815
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,760
it seems like yesterday and all of a
sudden we've jettisoned like, you know,

816
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,890
38 years from then and, um, Jay Leno
would ride in and his motorcycle,

817
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:41,270
um, uh, Richard Lewis packed a lot of
these ex pats would be in the back room,

818
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,170
New Yorkers,
you know,

819
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,920
and then placed the front bar became
a real hangout for a couple of years.

820
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,350
It was like that dance club so hard
with their model that, that was so,

821
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,370
so long ago. Yeah. So I
mean, but, but back in the,

822
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:58,320
like the early eighties, it became like
a dance hall, you know? Yeah. I mean,

823
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:02,390
I remember one night, uh, Roy
Scheider came in with, um, um,

824
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,170
pop flossy from all that jazz.
Yeah. You know, I mean the people,

825
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,710
Timothy leary came in one night. Really?
Yeah. The people that came in there,

826
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:12,470
it was just stacked.
That was a spot that was the spot.

827
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:16,310
And I was there at that time,
you know, and to see that. Um,

828
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,900
but yeah, there's just so many, well,
it's this cool too because you know that,

829
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,020
you know,
you go into any place now,

830
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,340
there's so many staff that
are like, oh, you know,

831
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,500
like if you're in going to a comedy club,
they're like, I'm, I'm a comic, but I'm,

832
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:34,670
I'm working here, you know, to pay the
bills. Yeah. Yeah. And that, you know,

833
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,750
but obviously for the majority of, in
any field, it's not going to work out.

834
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,980
It's just the way that that
whole business works. Right.

835
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,610
You're one of the guys where
it really did. It's pretty

836
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,820
well. Yeah. I got to, um, you know,
when you start off doing standup,

837
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:51,240
you go to as many open Mike nights as
you can and you watch as much comedy as

838
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,910
you can,
you know,

839
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,610
on top of what you've watched growing up
and that she watched everybody's style

840
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:59,310
and you try to create your own style
and get off the one you were emulating.

841
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:01,140
You know, when it started,
you know, I was emulating,

842
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,620
well I loved Andy Kaufman and Albert
Brooks and Steve Martin because there are

843
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,740
so different, you know,
they're so unique and yeah,

844
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,980
you really couldn't tell where they're
going with their bits and you were doing

845
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:14,110
your version of that. I was kind of
doing my version of it. And, and I,

846
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:19,140
I always like in comics too, I'm like
verbal magicians cause it's misdirection.

847
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,020
Sure. You're not really, you know,
they try to, part of the laughter,

848
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:24,040
it's a surprise of what
they're about to say, you know,

849
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:24,900
cause you didn't think about.

850
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,110
So is that where like the subliminal
stuff came from? The subliminal stuff? Uh,

851
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,050
interestingly it came from,
um,

852
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,860
I was getting late night spots
at the comedy store. And, um,

853
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:39,540
things weren't really working that well
and, um, but I was making friends, um,

854
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,700
at the club and not just comics,

855
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:46,140
but actors would come in and actors I
would recognize from doing bit parts on

856
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:48,750
shows like Laverne and Shirley and Mork
and Mindy and happy days, you know,

857
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:49,584
back then.

858
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,280
And there's this one guy at peck would
come in and he was this tall guy with a

859
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:56,870
deep voice like that. He did, but he'd
done it. I Lowenbrau commercials and,

860
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:01,380
and he also played a cop character usually
on a, those, those uh, those TV shows.

861
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,730
And he took a liking to me and, um, we
went to canter's one night and he said,

862
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,330
I'm going to do a thing called
tagging, tagging. He call it tagging.

863
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,930
And it was subliminal base of lay where
he would talk to the waitress and insert

864
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:16,200
a subliminal word in there when she
wouldn't hear it cause he would bury it,

865
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:20,100
you know, and, but it would be
real profane, you know, it's
a like, uh, oh, let's see,

866
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:22,530
how do I think I'm going to have
a cheeseburger, a hooker in,

867
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,770
why don't you also give me Yo some French
fries with it without your dirty whore.

868
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,530
So to me to do with that in my act.

869
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:36,470
So I started doing that in my,
I love it so much. Thanks man.

870
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,620
And then when I get to SNL,
Al Franken kind of, um, um,

871
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,750
associated with subliminal advertising,
you know,

872
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,180
we thought that would be kind of funny
to write up a sketch where I was a

873
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,600
subliminal advertising guy and you know,

874
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,910
inserting those words into my conversation
to get people to do what I want.

875
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,780
And it was the first sketch I
did an SNL and um, you know,

876
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:58,200
it's terrifying enough to go on that
show for the first time and do a sketch.

877
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,620
But this one had like two conversations
going on. I don't remember.

878
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,070
I was about to go on,
I'm not sure where it came in the show,

879
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:10,130
but it was my first sketch and maybe
only sketch on that show and we're five

880
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:13,590
seconds away coming out of commercial.
And Lauren Michaels comes up next to me.

881
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:17,370
He puts his arm on my shoulder and he
goes, are you sure this is what you want?

882
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,480
Fuck yeah. But you know, they, it's,

883
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:25,950
it's funny the way thing people try to
make you feel comfortable before, uh,

884
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,820
a pressure situation, but getting back to
the pussycat theater. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,000
I was a bartender at the Improv.

886
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,830
I would usually finish up
about two in the morning,

887
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:38,400
two 33 o'clock by the time I counted
all the money and made the bank receipts

888
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:38,671
out.

889
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:41,790
And then I had to drop the money off at
the bank and a little canvas bag with a

890
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:42,624
lock on it.

891
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:48,080
And I did that one night and I was driving
down Melrose to my $135 an apartment

892
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,030
down by paramount down Melrose and in
front of me. It was kind of foggy out,

893
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:53,310
you know,

894
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,260
and I see this figure walking down the
middle of the street and I was like a

895
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:56,581
closer,

896
00:54:56,581 --> 00:55:00,420
I see it's a girl and a white dress and
she staggering and she's crying and her

897
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,690
makeup is all running and she's,

898
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,810
she's a massive disheveled mess
and she, I can't, you know,

899
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,130
she's trying to stop my car.

900
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,580
So I slowed down and I put my window
down just a little bit, you know,

901
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:15,060
cause I don't know what she's
all about it. Yeah. And she, um,

902
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,460
she's crying and she goes,
roll down your window. No.

903
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,530
So I kind of rolled it down
more, you know, and she goes,

904
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,470
they threw me out of the car,
they throw me out of the bastards.

905
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,260
And I said, I'm so sorry. You all right?
She goes, yes. Could you take me to the,

906
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,620
I think it was a pussycat theater was a
kit Kat club. It was a strip club maybe.

907
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,840
I said, oh, okay. And she
gets in the car, big mistake.

908
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,490
And I don't know where the Kit Kat
theater, there was one on Melrose.

909
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:47,650
I thought that's where she wanted to
go cause I would go buy it all the time

910
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:50,530
going home. But she wanted to
go to the one on Santa Monica,

911
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:55,080
I guess there was one. And
uh, and we're driving and uh,

912
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,890
so I get her to the, uh, the one on
Melrose. I say, here you go, because, no,

913
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,710
that's not the one. She's drunk,
you know, and, and she goes,

914
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,090
I'm seeing I'm a, and now
I'm thinking, Oh, this is a
mistake. I said, you know what,

915
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:11,230
I, I, I, I'm gonna have to let you
out here. She goes, I have a gun.

916
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,710
I said, we're on Santa
Monica, is it? Exactly.

917
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,370
But I dropped her off and she kind of
fell out of the car and I ran around and

918
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:24,010
picked her up and got her on the
sidewalk. I mean, it will look bad

919
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,470
for me, like if I'm dropping her off,
like I was like her kicking her out.

920
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,240
Yeah. She blames me. That
guy. That's so, yeah.

921
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,880
So when you said the pussycat theater,
I thought that maybe that was

922
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,900
my mother going on a date with a man.

923
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,740
Like in the 80s she was single
and she went on a date with a guy.

924
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,450
Your mom partied like taxi taxi driver,

925
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:54,350
want to go see a porno movie again. Yeah.

926
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,550
So there's a lot of movies like
that. He's like, what? He's so crazy.

927
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,470
It took you to a movie. My mom dated
this guy for like 10 years after.

928
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:06,740
So obviously it was a good thing.
Yeah, of course. Yeah, I was so,

929
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,500
I was so influenced by the tagging
and subliminal thing in class.

930
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:16,510
I used to be like, um, so if you can,

931
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:19,270
we carry the four there
with the nipple that,

932
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,700
and I would say it like that and like
just my friend next to me would like turn

933
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:27,580
it. She would never came, you know?
And then she'd be like, yes, of course.

934
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:30,400
I was like, oh. Then people would start
because they would hear it, you know?

935
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:34,480
But like she would never pick up on it. I
love that stuff. It's such a funny word.

936
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,460
That's a great word to use.
Nipple.

937
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,250
I know like a Carl Reiner Mel
Brooks were talking about,

938
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,280
or maybe it's crawl around and talking
about, they had to have a number.

939
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,890
I could some script for maybe the
Dick Van Dyke show or something.

940
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:46,420
Your show of shows maybe.

941
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:51,010
And they were trying to think of what the
funniest number was to say and I think,

942
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:54,650
I'm not sure what it is, but I think
he said 43 is the funniest. No,

943
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,420
43 60

944
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,530
is the funniest number. I
think so, but I'm not sure.

945
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:07,531
But it sounds like 40 maybe 43 45
45 is the funniest Irish numbers.

946
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,830
45 for sure.

947
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,030
Tom and I did this thing where when we
go through the Starbucks drive through

948
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,250
and then you go in your order,

949
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,980
you can call people mommy like wage were
waitresses are people and they don't

950
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:28,660
even pick up on it. People
ended up taking, so this
is our game was to go like,

951
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:33,520
hey mommy and orders about bucks and then
at the end go, thanks jeans. I love you.

952
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:38,530
Thanks. Thanks jeans. It's like a name. So
thanks genes love you. And they're like,

953
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:40,420
all right,
two 65 at the window.

954
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:45,310
And then we started to tell our audience
about it. And the whole thing was like,

955
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,700
could you, how many? Cause
there's so many inside jokes,

956
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:52,730
like its own lexicon in
this, in this show. Um,

957
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,270
that like how many could you get it?
And people,

958
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:59,430
like we played a girl one time
who was definitely disturbed, um,

959
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,720
and she would, uh, she would say
hi to Hitler before she played she,

960
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:07,750
before she spoke at the blog to Hitler.
Yeah. That's not a touret thing.

961
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,990
That would be horrible to have that
Tourette's syndrome. Like, yeah,

962
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,460
this was like, that would be
a bad one. But, but anyways,

963
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:21,290
people would go in and go
like, uh, or the n word.

964
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:26,360
Yeah. Well we did have a documentary
about that. Some girl did say that.

965
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:30,770
Big Words we did, she was, she would go
to summer camp and say that more. Yeah.

966
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,843
I'll tell you that.
You know,

967
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:36,850
I have a real problem with drive for is
I cannot resist like doing some screwy

968
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:42,140
character. Oh, you know what? I'm ordering
and even if nobody else was in the car,

969
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,510
you know, I get in there, hey,
let it tell you. I'll, let me see.

970
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:49,511
I go into AA though to ice cream called
ca one chuck a day and then one of that

971
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:54,680
ne and beat. Okay. That's
it. Nothing to drink.

972
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,690
Okay, so he's thinking of the vanilla and
the chocolate chocolate. That didn't a,

973
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,020
I took all to wine,

974
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:04,250
the white one brown and then I'll drive
through and they'll hand it to me and

975
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:06,980
I'll go with which one? One is a
chocolate though. Which one is chocolate?

976
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,810
And they'll point it. It's this one
here, sir. Right here. Dot Brown.

977
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,243
Thank you mommy.

978
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,510
It was really the most people start when
we started sharing that we did this.

979
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:23,780
People started to make them like record
themselves doing it and they would throw

980
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:29,250
in the fucking most insane requests.

981
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,540
And the thing that stood out to us
is that those drive through people.

982
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,930
So many of them are on autopilot though.
No matter what you're saying,

983
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,810
they're just like, yes sir.
You got it. Got It. Yeah, sure.

984
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,340
This is a Hitler's order here.
You go give it to him. It's a,

985
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,300
the fries are still hot.

986
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,100
Yeah. That's the great
thing about Starbucks too.

987
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,640
You could write anything on that cup name.
Oh yeah,

988
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:55,920
I was trying to find that. Yeah, thanks.

989
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:58,860
Jeans kind of sounds like it's
a regional kind of a thing.

990
01:00:58,861 --> 01:01:02,550
Someone might say like a Minnesota
or something, you know. Thanks jeans.

991
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:06,750
Thanks James. Found it.
I think this is it. Okay.

992
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,090
Can I get a

993
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:18,050
[inaudible]?

994
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:26,570
Hi Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

995
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,920
What's Your Pronoun? Uh, yeah. One
second. I'm just glass and look for last.

996
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,500
Hi Mommy. Can I get up like
second? She's on a sub came Bagel.

997
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:47,810
No thanks. I don't want to be found
like Bert. Excuse me one second.

998
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,513
Sorry about that.

999
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:57,410
Can you do just a little bit of ice and
I'm talking about filming real stuff

1000
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,120
and they kiss my pussy chicken
if

1001
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,100
you know what I'm sorry.
Could we make it Combo?

1002
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:17,840
Thanks James. Thanks genes.
All right, thank you Hitler.

1003
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,400
That's great. Thank you. It's
my pussy chicken might be,

1004
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:28,770
it's so crazy. Good subliminal
rather. Yeah, it is right. Oh Man.

1005
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:32,730
That's the best influence that,
I mean when we really think about it,

1006
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:33,930
you definitely influenced that.

1007
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,470
That's fun.
Um,

1008
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:42,500
it was just thinking something like the
drive through, so, yeah, it's crazy.

1009
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,540
There's people work all the time,
so they're not thinking

1010
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:49,050
no. Yeah, no, that was just like,
yeah, cause my posts chicken shirt.

1011
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,810
Yeah.

1012
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:56,310
Which is all by the way things that like
we have a lady who was in the bank and

1013
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,320
she,
she just yells out like,

1014
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:04,321
I want my money got damaged and then she
goes kiss my pussy like in Wells Fargo.

1015
01:03:04,511 --> 01:03:07,840
So we had that drop that would just
play for a while. So people would just,

1016
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,770
that's hilarious. I remember the
original submission he goes, gets,

1017
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,480
I put plus a chicken and she goes,
Kung Pao chicken. Oh yeah. Right.

1018
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:17,570
So they think like, like he
must be trying to say, um,

1019
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,150
so you've, you've been
working for awhile. Uh,

1020
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,060
do you have any advice for Johnny
Depp? Um, for Johnny Depp? Yeah.

1021
01:03:25,061 --> 01:03:28,750
So I don't know if you are
familiar with what's going on.

1022
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:33,910
You read about that or no? Yeah, I think
so. $650 million he's earned thus far.

1023
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,630
He bursts through a lot of cash. I
mean, they said he's nearly broke.

1024
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,000
He spends in excess of 2 million a month.

1025
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:45,990
Wow. Yeah. Well, you know,

1026
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:49,160
when you're at his level and you've
had that much money, I mean, you know,

1027
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,790
it's like when you start making money,
right?

1028
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,170
You stop looking at what things cost,
right. Pushing them in a restaurant.

1029
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,940
You know, when you're just
starting out, you're like, oh,

1030
01:03:56,941 --> 01:04:01,050
that's $12 I can get this for
$8 I'll have the $8. Right.

1031
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,250
Or I'll just order off the menu and
not do the buffet. Right. Right.

1032
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,380
But so I guess at his
level, he's, it's so long.

1033
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,370
He knows he's made a lot of money and
he's just a little bit at a time you start

1034
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,480
spending left and right.

1035
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,280
It's like compulsive. They said
it's like a disorder. Well,

1036
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:17,460
what were some of the
things you listed like, oh,

1037
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,850
he shot hunter s Thompson's
ashes into the data. Yeah. Yeah.

1038
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:22,890
My friend,
you know,

1039
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:27,080
Dana Carvey says his biggest fear in
life would be how horrible it would be to

1040
01:04:27,081 --> 01:04:31,820
be famous and broke. Oh yeah.
It's gotta be Oh yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,360
And he's not famous broke, but he, that's,
that was a thing he thought about a lot.

1042
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1043
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:42,010
Were you like really when you started
to make money where you very, um,

1044
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:46,600
you know, aware? Like I gotta
Save, I gotta keep this or
you. Yeah. Yeah. No, cause

1045
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,433
I, you know, I,

1046
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,970
I grew up in a middle income
household and we weren't poor,

1047
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,480
but we lived in a blue collar neighborhood
and stuff and I went to public

1048
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:59,590
schools. It's mostly high school. I went
to a private school, but, um, you know,

1049
01:04:59,591 --> 01:05:01,780
I paid for my own college,
bought my own first car and stuff.

1050
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:05,140
So I kind of knew the value of money
and worked in a factory and yeah,

1051
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,470
you don't wash dishes, all those
kind of jobs. So I kind of like,

1052
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,690
and that's what I want
to still my kid too.

1053
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:13,600
Like I hope he didn't have to
work the crappy jobs I did. Right.

1054
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:17,100
But I want them to know the value
of money. Yeah. Yeah. So, um,

1055
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,320
I'm always kind of aware you are.
Yeah.

1056
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,720
Oh wait, but being famous
and broke, that's what being
on a reality show is like,

1057
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,640
right. It was that in the 90s I did a
show called road rules back when MTV was,

1058
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,270
you know,

1059
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:34,740
MTV and it was terrible because people
could just have access to you and they're

1060
01:05:34,741 --> 01:05:35,221
like,
hey,

1061
01:05:35,221 --> 01:05:39,060
you're the fucking girl from Silento and
you have no money to like protect her,

1062
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:42,330
insulate yourself from anybody.
Yeah. I like being a reality star.

1063
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,630
The Look, you know, I still look at
prices and still doing it, but you know,

1064
01:05:45,631 --> 01:05:50,000
I don't spend, um, crazily, I
still buy things that I like.

1065
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:50,843
I don't want sure.

1066
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,420
I'm pretty good with the
money. It is. There's nothing,

1067
01:05:53,421 --> 01:05:54,710
I don't know if you think about this,

1068
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:59,711
but the longer you do this and you have
like some exposure to some success,

1069
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:04,130
the more you look at people who've done
it for a long time and you're like, man,

1070
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:07,700
how do they do that for so long? Like
the fact that you've been, you know,

1071
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:12,620
working and creating stuff for this
long, it's amazing to me. It's amazing.

1072
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:17,350
Me Too. You know, I, I, um, but
the thing is I love doing it.

1073
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:19,690
I love what I do. So it's
not, it's not hard. You know,

1074
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,280
I'm always looking for things.
I'm just trying to,

1075
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,400
trying to stay engaged and I've,
you know,

1076
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,280
I've just talking to somebody about this
before, I know a couple of billionaires.

1077
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,910
Do you? Yeah. And there, you know,

1078
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,920
like billions of dollars and they
are really good with their money.

1079
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,440
They're not like, you know,
they're, I won't say they're cheap,

1080
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,250
but they're very kind of thrifty,
you know,

1081
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:45,610
and they know they're not going to just
throw away a bunch of money to invest in

1082
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:48,880
some film or something. You
know what I mean? Yeah. Um,

1083
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,840
they know where it's going and that's how
they became billionaires, I guess. Oh,

1084
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,140
yeah.

1085
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:55,380
Yeah. Well, Johnny Depp would, uh,
invest like 4 million. And, um,

1086
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:59,080
so here's the record label. Here's how,
here's some of the spending. Yeah. Let's,

1087
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:03,020
yeah, he lost four. First of all, I paid
5.6 million in late fees to the IRS,

1088
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,930
which he blames the business manager for,

1089
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,470
but the business manager says they were
always late because he never had enough

1090
01:07:09,471 --> 01:07:14,471
cash to pay on time so that cause he was
ripping through cash so much that they

1091
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:18,650
would always be late and have to
pay penalties and fees. Hmm. Uh,

1092
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,850
over 30,000 a month in wine you
learn about that. Makes Sense. Yeah.

1093
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,440
He said that was more than
that. Don't insult them. Yeah.

1094
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:29,600
He said don't assault him. Um, let's
see. Court documents filed last year.

1095
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:31,240
You claimed the actress spent,
uh,

1096
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,670
around a hundred million on
maintaining his 14 residences,

1097
01:07:34,671 --> 01:07:37,220
which include a 45 acre
chateau in the south of France,

1098
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,650
chain of islands in The Bahamas,
multiple homes in Hollywood,

1099
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:45,230
several Penthouse lofts,
downtown La Horse Farm in Kentucky.

1100
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:49,190
He went to Singapore,
Singapore and spent 120,000 on suits.

1101
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,890
Well, in Singapore. Really? Is that
the place you get the suits? Yeah.

1102
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,000
Get them handmade.
Maybe a,

1103
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:00,650
he's collected 70 of vintage guitars.

1104
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:04,190
He has 14,
um,

1105
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,220
storage facilities for like
Hollywood memorabilia here.

1106
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,590
It's good that he got divorced because
his wife has saving half of his money.

1107
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:13,400
Right.

1108
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,880
He'll have to remarry her later and at
least still have some kind of a savings.

1109
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:21,770
It's 3 million for Shah
firing the, uh, the rocket of,

1110
01:08:21,771 --> 01:08:26,540
uh, uh, what's it called? Hunter
has taught his ashes into the sky,

1111
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,290
which he said something he needed to do.
Yeah.

1112
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,850
Now he a depth that it wasn't 3 million
was actually 5 million. Oh my goodness.

1113
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,210
200 piece art collection, which
yeah, I get why you would do that.

1114
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,220
He apparently spends as much as 200,000
a month just on chartering flights,

1115
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,880
uh,
worth every penny,

1116
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,100
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
to employ a full time sound engineer to

1117
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:53,270
feed him lines during filming.
Oh, 45 cars he bought.

1118
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,540
Uh, yeah. I Dunno, it just
kinda goes on and on. Yeah.

1119
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:02,320
The storage facilities, it's like,
it's hundreds of thousands. He's uh,

1120
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:07,040
he has a personal doctor. I like that.
I'd spend money on that million a year

1121
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,560
to live with you then I do a Mizzou.
Yeah.

1122
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:14,930
2 million a year annually
for around the clock.

1123
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,630
Security for himself and his
mother prior to her death.

1124
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,440
I would hire somebody just to
remind me of my passwords. Yeah,

1125
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:26,210
that would be great idea.
Um, and let's see. Oh, Anna,

1126
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:31,070
40 person staff that he keeps up
with more than 43 million a year.

1127
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,400
Yeah. So it really is really
crazy that you can read it

1128
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,273
through that much money.

1129
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:40,280
I'm more amazed at how it's gotta be crazy
to be that attractive and that famous

1130
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:44,490
for that long like, yeah.
When he was on 21 jump street,

1131
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,930
w what was he like maybe 18 years old or
something. Yeah. And like he's the guy,

1132
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:52,500
like I had a poster on my wall,
like a life size poster of that dude.

1133
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,850
He's been hot for that long.
I know that's going to be crazy.

1134
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,320
How are you even normal,

1135
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,560
I can tell you from my experience.
Yeah.

1136
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:05,290
You just got to come out with creative
posters. Yeah. That's what it is.

1137
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:09,830
It's not that hard. Just be in
that hot. Still hot. Yeah. Yeah.

1138
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,890
I'm still hot. I haven't even
peaked yet. How much was it a thing,

1139
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,100
an SNL to like translate the fame
of it to crushing box all the time?

1140
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:23,470
Like especially in New York,

1141
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,070
like would you guys just be
on a tear cause you were on,

1142
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,190
I think everyone has an era.
Yeah.

1143
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,060
Kind of that they follow the most
depending on their age. Yeah. Yeah.

1144
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,390
Depending on your age.
Cause like I couldn't list,

1145
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,660
I couldn't tell you the
last 10 cast of that show,

1146
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:40,390
but I know the,

1147
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:44,410
especially the early to mid nineties
cast real well because that was the era

1148
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:49,150
that I never missed. That was must
see TV and when you were on a,

1149
01:10:49,151 --> 01:10:53,890
but you were on with like
if I can Farley's Sandler
rock and all those guys were

1150
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:55,620
on during your era. Right, right.

1151
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,190
I was chasing tail like a big
part of life for you guys. Uh,

1152
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,520
for those guys it was for Sandler and
really and those guys. Yeah. But I was,

1153
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:06,930
you know, I think, um, by then I was
married. Oh you were? Okay. I mean,

1154
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,760
the first couple of years I wasn't
married. I was dating Jan Hooks. Yeah.

1155
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:13,200
For a couple of years. Yeah. And
then I was dating another girl in La.

1156
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,290
I'm in New York for like six months,
and then I got married, you know,

1157
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:20,970
so I didn't really have that much, a
singular freedom, you know, on that show.

1158
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:25,480
Marrying kind. I am, I really am.
I like that kind of stability.

1159
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:31,620
I like monogamy. Yeah. Yeah.
Um, but Kevin leads with it.

1160
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:35,280
I mean, when I met him he was like,
just so you know, I'm married. Okay.

1161
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,960
All right. What, what kind of jobs did
you have before you were to stand up?

1162
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,380
Okay. Um, right before I moved out here,

1163
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:47,340
I was a researcher for America's most
wanted the television show. Where are you?

1164
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,990
Yeah, so I any research that,
so they would just give you, um,

1165
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:55,780
you know, potential. You've heard
this story before and she's like out,

1166
01:11:56,490 --> 01:12:01,490
so they'll give you potential crimes
or crimes and potential suspects,

1167
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:06,270
find out more. And then you pitch the, um,

1168
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,680
basically the editor of the
show. Uh, not like editor,

1169
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:15,060
like written editor, but you know,
like the, like the, like the,

1170
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:19,260
like a newspaper, editors, stylists,
bullpen. And we would pitch this guy,

1171
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:23,520
I guess he's an executive producer. So we
would just go like, Hey, I got this guy,

1172
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:27,600
he's a fucking rapist. He's in
Costa Rica. He skipped out on bail.

1173
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,960
Could be really good.
Like it was really dark stuff.

1174
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,740
I read his whole diary. He's
really fucking horrible. Yeah,

1175
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:35,970
I think we should do this one.

1176
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:40,080
And then you try to make your
case for why it would be a good,

1177
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,740
a good guy to profile. I did that for a,
when did you make money on commission?

1178
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,560
They got him. You get points?
No. So that was um, that was,

1179
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:54,690
I dunno that was but as it like a teenager
or you're early. Oh, I mean I did.

1180
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:58,020
Uh, I, I remember I was telling
her the other day, cause they're,

1181
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:02,310
they're redoing a bathroom
here and they're going to
put some Thailand and I go,

1182
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:06,120
man, when I was, uh,
in, in high school, my,

1183
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:11,070
my friend's dad bought these
apartments are like a shitty area.

1184
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,140
And this is in Florida,
south Florida.

1185
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:18,710
In the summer we had to relay tile in
all of them with no air conditioning.

1186
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:24,680
In the summertime. It was fucking
brutal, man. Mosquitoes. I did that. Um,

1187
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:28,140
I worked at Granger,
the industrial supply place in college,

1188
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,780
just doing menial office stuff.
Yeah. Then when I got out here,

1189
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,320
I was at transcriber for reality shows.
You transcribed everything.

1190
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:41,970
Someone says you're a good typist. I mean,
I'm okay. I don't know. It's a fucking,

1191
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,320
it's not worth celebrating.
Then I was opposed coordinator.

1192
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,170
Then I worked at a restaurant
for a little while, um,

1193
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:53,010
on sunset place called Chibo.
I worked there for a little while,

1194
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:57,900
then a cheapo cheap Chibo Chibo Kibo.

1195
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,650
Then it was a site rep, which was
actually one of the, it's a site Rep.

1196
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,810
So let's say you own,
um,

1197
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,290
what of your house and you're like, I
want, oh, that would be great. Uh, you go,

1198
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:13,330
I want production to be able to
shoot here. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah.

1199
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,460
So when you do that,

1200
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,880
the company that represents your house
sends a rep to make sure the production

1201
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:26,830
doesn't destroy your house because they
will. I know, I know. And like I would,

1202
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,920
I would be working in a
fucking historically protected
church and I'd see a guy

1203
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:36,250
like, no. Oh, like nailing into the wall.
What the fuck are you doing? He's like,

1204
01:14:36,251 --> 01:14:39,940
we need the hand in this fucking light
here. I'm like, dude, you can't nail.

1205
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:42,460
And they would just always play stupid.

1206
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:44,830
And I'd run around and
like try to tell somebody,

1207
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:47,440
don't let that guy do they like the
SAG representative. It was horrible.

1208
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:51,570
There's a house, my neighborhood where
they're always shooting commercials there.

1209
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:54,190
Yeah. I know that thing's got
to be just torn up by the horn.

1210
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:57,520
But they pay well when you get the
real productions in there. Yeah.

1211
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,720
But they also protect it a lot.

1212
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:01,200
They put a lot of that stuff
down on the floor too. But,

1213
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,840
but I've worked in homeless before.
Other people's homes. Um, you know. Yeah.

1214
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,540
I'm using their bathroom. I'm
not using the Porta potty. No.

1215
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,960
I step over that yellow crime
tape thing for sure. Yeah.

1216
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,500
People don't give a fuck man now.

1217
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:18,490
And then it's put the best business
is when you own a building.

1218
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,510
So that was really a home.

1219
01:15:19,511 --> 01:15:24,010
But just a building and it's perfect for
shooting for whatever reason. Oh my God.

1220
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:27,460
They rake it in. Oh, I'm sure now
it's like you just get like a fee,

1221
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,440
like your talent for your building.

1222
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,640
Maybe we can make a lot of money by just
building a building that was perfect

1223
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:37,180
for a lot of different shoots. Why don't
we do that? What are we waiting for?

1224
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,340
One of those who do you
know the guy crazy Gideon?

1225
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:47,650
Yeah. He owns two buildings in
downtown La that I've shot stuff in.

1226
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:48,850
And it is that they're like,

1227
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:51,670
it's a huge building full of different
is that you're talking about, sorry,

1228
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,560
different scenarios. Like
one's like a cop. Remember the,

1229
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,710
was it the Herald or the,
the uh,

1230
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:03,340
they used to be a newspaper building
downtown and then they have building sets

1231
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:06,190
in there and then to
the year had that big,

1232
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:09,130
that big building down there
by the freeway. So you could,

1233
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:13,480
you could actually use the,
the old school newspaper bullpen look.

1234
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:16,720
Then they built a fake courthouse in
their jail cell. All these things.

1235
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:20,560
I shot a movie called Grandma's boy
down there. Oh yeah. That building.

1236
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:24,850
That was part of it. That's where the
money is, man. What are we waiting for?

1237
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:28,760
How are we doing this stupid joke.
Shit suck away. Before I forget,

1238
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:33,360
are we managers? Oh my God, I love it.

1239
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,560
Managers like it was funny
because I went to her taping,

1240
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:40,120
she did a Netflix thing a few weeks
ago and I show up and I'm like, oh,

1241
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:42,700
when you're not recording but
you're at one of these things,

1242
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,450
you never feel the stress. You know? Like
I showed up and she was like, she's like,

1243
01:16:47,451 --> 01:16:50,230
Hey, you know, I'm just going over my
stuff. I'm like, it's fucking great.

1244
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,830
I enjoy it. You don't have
fun talking like managers to

1245
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,770
look. You don't feel it at
all. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.

1246
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:03,400
Just have fun out there and be
yourself, Kevin. So when you did SNL,

1247
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:09,950
I dunno, where does it hit you? When you
get nervous, like what do you do? Well,

1248
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:10,130
here's

1249
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:14,420
what my psychology was on that show.
The first time I did it,

1250
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,271
the year we came on,

1251
01:17:16,271 --> 01:17:19,330
I came on with Phil Hartman and Dana
Carvey and Jan Hooks in North Korea.

1252
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:23,770
Although seen those people.
Yeah. And I'm heavy hitters.

1253
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,390
The show before that also had a good cast,

1254
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,830
but the synergy wasn't
there with the writing.

1255
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:30,620
You know what it looks like Robert Downey,
Jr Anthony Michael Hall,

1256
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,770
I think Julia Louise Dreyfus.
You know, it was a great cast,

1257
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:36,830
but the writing was in there and the show
was plummeting and there were about to

1258
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:39,230
cancel it.
Excuse me.

1259
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:44,000
So they brought our cast in as kind of
a last resort, I guess. One more chance.

1260
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,400
And so we lived at of our suitcases,
like every week.

1261
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:48,380
We weren't sure if it was getting
a cancel or not, you know,

1262
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:53,410
so we're doing our best and
this was a consideration for me.

1263
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,650
Am I going to like just freak out
because of the stress and being on stage.

1264
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:00,650
It's SNL, you know? So what I did was,

1265
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:07,000
excuse me, I, I pretended that nobody
was watching the show anymore. You know,

1266
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,760
nobody's going to watch it and this is
going to be the only show they're going

1267
01:18:09,761 --> 01:18:12,220
to do. Then they're going
to cancel it. So, you know,

1268
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,300
just go out there and have fun.

1269
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,870
So that was my mindset and I thought the
cameras and didn't have film in them,

1270
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,850
you know,
and um,

1271
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,570
and I was used to playing in front of
a live audience from stand up and that

1272
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:25,850
audience is not that big there.
It's only like 300 people.

1273
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,610
And so it was kind of fine.

1274
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:34,100
And then the next day I found out a lot
of people watch. Yeah. Was that, um,

1275
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:38,070
was there a particular
sketch where you realize, um,

1276
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:42,830
the next day or the next week that, oh,
this has made me way more famous? Like,

1277
01:18:42,831 --> 01:18:46,000
cause you're walking around
people are, well, yeah. Um,

1278
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:48,860
it was my first sketches
subliminal. Oh, subliminal. Yeah.

1279
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,320
I just came out of the gate with
that and I wasn't even a cast member.

1280
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:55,280
I was a featured player the first
year and a writer. So, you know,

1281
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:59,840
I was walking around with Jan Hooks
who was amazing, you know, sketch,

1282
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:04,400
player, impressionist,
everything. I really,

1283
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,730
I mean she's right up on the top of the
list right there for everybody that's

1284
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:11,030
been on that show and people
weren't recognizing her.

1285
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,220
And I was getting recognized last stand
up who had no experience as a cast,

1286
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,290
you know, as a, you know, a sketch
player, characters or anything, you know,

1287
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:23,290
and I was getting recognized. So that kind
of was baffling her a little bit. Yeah,

1288
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:24,260
it was a good sketch.

1289
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:27,910
Then there was a good sketch
and people thought it was funny.

1290
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:31,920
Was fever pitch of fame
from that doing like the uh,

1291
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,050
well obviously we can update.
It's gotta make you,

1292
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,750
you're in people's face and came later.
For me though, I had done like a,

1293
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:38,603
I had done

1294
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,840
five years at that point without
doing weekend update. Oh, okay.

1295
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:49,670
I did a weekend update for three years
and then a year not doing it, but um,

1296
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,340
it,
it was interesting to watch the um,

1297
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,670
the evolution of being
recognized, you know? Sure.

1298
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,430
Cause I had done like the tonight show
and let her minute stuff as a standup.

1299
01:19:58,431 --> 01:20:02,630
So I had some recognition but with
Carson, yeah. When I got an SNL though,

1300
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:07,070
it was like, um, it just took off,
especially in New York City. You know,

1301
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:11,520
you kind of felt like the mayor, but
you know it, it went from this like uh,

1302
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:17,490
uh, a u. Dot dude from NBC. Hey, did not
do what you got dude from Mec. Right?

1303
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,950
And the next week, Hey, uh, hey, you've
frozen hands. You guys are Hans and Franz.

1304
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,730
That sounds frons I'm just
standing there alone. Hey,

1305
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:27,810
your hands in friends and
then it's a a Kevin Neilson

1306
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:33,570
SNL or, and then it was Kevin Nealon
and now it's back the other way.

1307
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:40,440
Oh my God. We did it on the
school yard hunts and Friday.

1308
01:20:40,441 --> 01:20:45,040
A lot of people on Halloween costumes and
stuff we're doing in the space shuttle

1309
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:49,170
that that is the era where we
would go to school on Monday.

1310
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,840
It would be, people would be reciting
sketches. That sketch in particular.

1311
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:59,760
I was like, that's exactly why when
I was doing, we can update people.

1312
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:02,820
I really didn't like to write
for weekend update the key,

1313
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:05,790
the writers didn't like to write
specifically for weekend update because it

1314
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:08,970
wasn't a glorified job like a Monday.
Nobody was talking about, hey,

1315
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:12,660
did you hear about that? Do you get that?
Push to go to Clinton joke, you know,

1316
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,990
and so they had to entice them
to come write jokes for me.

1317
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,520
They would put out a breakfast spread
like a buffet in the writer's wing on

1318
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:23,820
Saturday morning and they'd
have newspapers all over
the big writers' table and

1319
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:28,620
you know, and AP photos cause there's
no Google back then, you know. So,

1320
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:32,850
um, I feel by the way that it's super
intimidating of all the things to do,

1321
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,360
weekend update. It is, it really
is a lot of pressure. Right.

1322
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:39,090
There's a lot of pressure. Uh, but
people would come up, you know,

1323
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:40,020
a few writers would come up,

1324
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,180
the newer writers would come
up who weren't that good.

1325
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:44,010
And then some of the other writers,

1326
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:47,430
like Al Frank would always come because
he was such a political junkie, you know,

1327
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,970
and um,
and Norm Mcdonald would come up,

1328
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:54,570
but he would come up just to have
breakfast and read the paper. And then,

1329
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:58,800
so I had to like hire people outside the
show to fax me in jokes and I would pay

1330
01:21:58,801 --> 01:22:01,600
them out of my own pocket. 15. Yeah.

1331
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:05,340
And I mean it was important to
me to do and we can update and a,

1332
01:22:05,341 --> 01:22:07,260
and then I write my own jokes too.
But you couldn't,

1333
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:11,280
you really couldn't start looking to
write material until Friday night.

1334
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:13,800
Maybe after the late night
talk shows were done, you know,

1335
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:15,420
cause they are recovering everything.

1336
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,440
So Saturday morning it's like you wake
up and you get like five papers and you

1337
01:22:19,441 --> 01:22:22,440
start looking through them and you
start writing jokes and you know,

1338
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:24,210
and hope that the writers
come up with something.

1339
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:27,060
Now that did it because you
were busy with weekend update,

1340
01:22:27,061 --> 01:22:30,750
would that buy you the freedom to not
have to do like if you're like no.

1341
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:34,920
I was also writing sketches for myself.
Hey Man. And I was in another sketches.

1342
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:36,240
Dennis did a great job,
uh,

1343
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:39,870
Miller and we can update did it I think
for seven years and he was fantastic but

1344
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:42,720
he wasn't really in a lot of sketches.
He was, we could focus on that.

1345
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,890
I was juggling,
you know,

1346
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,910
I wasn't my full focus and I was working
with herb Sargent who was a segment

1347
01:22:47,911 --> 01:22:51,660
producer of that show and he was
up at a seven, you know, and, um,

1348
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:56,010
and I would meet with him like a in
between, um, the dress rehearsal,

1349
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:59,790
showing a live show and go over the
jokes that worked. It didn't work and,

1350
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,400
you know, and then I had to get back
down to like working on my sketch and,

1351
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:07,510
and so I go back out to weekend update
during the live show and some of the

1352
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:09,100
jokes that we had talked about losing,

1353
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,790
we're still in there because he didn't
cause either he wrote them or he liked

1354
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:14,260
them.
And,

1355
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,710
and I didn't really realize it until
the next morning I'm laying in bed,

1356
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:19,030
kind of going over everything,
you know,

1357
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:20,680
and taking the chuck
wasn't supposed to be,

1358
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:26,130
so he knew that I was not focused and
he could do kind of wow sometimes.

1359
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:30,160
Not all the time, but sometimes he would
do that. Yeah. Yeah. So it was, um,

1360
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:34,000
but it was fun. I loved it. I loved,
um, Saturday nights were just,

1361
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,920
they went so fast,
you know,

1362
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:39,570
and I always avoided like the parties
at the after parties. You did? Yeah.

1363
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,480
At first they were fun,

1364
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:45,240
but then it became more of just them a
thing for your guests to go to. I got you.

1365
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,130
Because you were exhausted from work
and you didn't want to be out till like

1366
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:51,940
five in the morning. And as I must say,
yeah, they must be tilt late. Oh yeah.

1367
01:23:51,941 --> 01:23:52,451
Because you know,

1368
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:55,570
you don't get there until after the show
and the show ends at one o'clock and

1369
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:58,060
then by the time your clean up and
everything and getting the limos,

1370
01:23:58,061 --> 01:23:59,040
we each had our own limit.

1371
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:02,710
It would take us to this
different restaurant each
night. He'd Saturday and then,

1372
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:02,861
you know,

1373
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:05,830
cause that was a big deal for your
friends that were in the guests or the

1374
01:24:05,831 --> 01:24:07,390
biggest problem on that show,

1375
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,960
you worried about them getting their seats
when you should have been focusing on

1376
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:14,440
your sketch or whatever. Yeah, you were,
did they get it? Okay. Are they in okay.

1377
01:24:14,441 --> 01:24:16,630
You're okay. You can't
go good. All right. Yeah,

1378
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:18,670
I'm gonna meet you down by the
Limo afterwards. Okay. Okay.

1379
01:24:18,671 --> 01:24:22,840
We're going to go to the park. And then
the parties weren't even really parties.

1380
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:26,410
I mean, they were fun, but you know, it
was at a restaurant and you go there,

1381
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:29,710
you sit at your own table with your guests
and their necks were crane the whole

1382
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:32,890
night looking, um, you know, celebrities.

1383
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:36,790
And then you pay the bill for everybody
and then you get home at like four in

1384
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:40,090
the morning and then you, you're
wasted on Sunday. You're only free day.

1385
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,950
I'm always curious about it.

1386
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:48,080
Sunday is your one down day and
you must just collapse on a Sunday.

1387
01:24:48,311 --> 01:24:52,060
Right. And like to even get out of bed,
I get out of bed. Yeah. Because, um,

1388
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,510
because I, I, I love that it's a free
day and I want, I don't want to waste it,

1389
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:58,660
you know, but I'm exhausted, you
know. And the next thing, you know,

1390
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:03,550
it's Monday evening in your meeting
with the next host for the show the next

1391
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:07,820
week. It is. But it was great. I had fun.
You know, I was young at the time and I,

1392
01:25:07,821 --> 01:25:11,270
I could, I could handle it. Did
you have a least favorite, uh,

1393
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,900
guests that you don't mind?
I didn't like any of them really.

1394
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,790
I'm not really, everybody was really on
their best behavior. People ask me that,

1395
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:19,511
who is the worst house?

1396
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:23,140
But everybody is terrified and so
they're on their best behavior. Right.

1397
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,420
And they want to be your friend.
So they're making friends.

1398
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:26,620
It's like you were like,
you know,

1399
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,620
in the battle somewhere with
somebody you want to, hey,

1400
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,900
watch out for my back though.
That must be so intimidated to walk in.

1401
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,000
And they're like, you're doing
SNL this week. Oh, I know.

1402
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,020
Especially the actors that weren't
used to live performing. Sure.

1403
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:42,170
Like the film actors, they were
terrified, some of them. And um,

1404
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,203
I felt for them.

1405
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:48,310
But the first one I did was with Sigourney
weaver who very first one, first one.

1406
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,630
And um, and I remember a such a hard
week as so much work because you know,

1407
01:25:52,631 --> 01:25:55,000
you're putting everything into
it. You want to, you know,

1408
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,710
it's like your last show
you're ever going to do.

1409
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:00,250
And I remember at the end of the week
she was saying goodbye to everybody and I

1410
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:05,090
thought, wow, she gets to go on with their
life and do things. Yeah. Stay in here.

1411
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:09,490
Yeah. The week like that, nine,
nine years of those now I,

1412
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:14,890
yeah, Matt on them. That's my mom. Yeah.

1413
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,950
Yeah.
But you know,

1414
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:19,460
when I see those people that hosted
every one of them from those nine years,

1415
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,940
even that, some of the musicians were
like best buddies. It's like they,

1416
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:26,410
they remember the value because it was
such a moment for them. Sure. You know,

1417
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:30,680
a bonding, um, just everybody
that's been on that show,

1418
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:34,520
it's like a lifelong friend. Where before
I forget, you're going to San Francisco.

1419
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:38,300
I'm going to cobb's in San Francisco.
This is it this week. This weekend.

1420
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:44,180
So how was San Francisco last week?
I'll be at the helium.

1421
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:49,640
Funny. I'll be at the helium, uh, what's
it called? Them Comedy Club Portland.

1422
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,790
I'll be at the helium comedy club in
Philadelphia. Affiliates is a great one.

1423
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,410
Yeah. When is that? That is
going to be, I can pull it up.

1424
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,160
You could edit this.
Yeah. Yeah. Let me see,

1425
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:07,100
Kevin. It's Kevin Neilson. Uh,
it's the guy from SAP, from SNL,

1426
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:12,020
NBC, and we say, yeah, let me see.
He's going to be there August 9th,

1427
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:16,310
10th and 11th.
Um,

1428
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,800
that's Kevin, this is you,
right? Yeah. Kevin Nealon. Uh,

1429
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,020
and I tell 11th and then in
Annapolis the next day. Yeah.

1430
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:27,410
Ram's head onstage. What's that? Yes
sir. It's a theater. It's really nice.

1431
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:30,960
They have one to key west to check
you out. Check it out, right? Yeah.

1432
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,560
Before I forget though, you have to tell
us about Carson and what that was like.

1433
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:40,520
Oh, I feel like it's comics. We
got gypped on the late night.

1434
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,270
We didn't get to do anything. Well,
when I first started doing standup,

1435
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,460
Johnny Carson was the game in town.
You know,

1436
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:50,300
he was really the only late night
talk show and that's what you, uh,

1437
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:53,420
you know,
wanting to do.

1438
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:57,410
And that's like passing your bar exam
as a lawyer, you know, for a comic.

1439
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:01,850
So everybody wanted to get on the tonight
show with Johnny and it was getting

1440
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:04,670
near the end of his run. So, you know,
everybody's getting a little desperate,

1441
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,670
you know, they wanted to get in the
door at least when I came on the scene.

1442
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,780
And so Jim Mccauley was the talent
coordinator at the time and he would come

1443
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:14,660
into the clubs, he'd be around the clubs,
you know, watch them, different people.

1444
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:19,010
Whenever he was in the room there was
a heightened anxiety because the comics

1445
01:28:19,011 --> 01:28:21,860
knew that he was there and some people
would cancel because they didn't want him

1446
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:26,350
to see him. Wow. Or someone what tried
to get on so they could see him. Yep.

1447
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,900
And I think I auditioned may be
twice for him or I didn't make it.

1448
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:33,600
And I was so nervous. I'd only
been doing standup for, you know,

1449
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:37,460
four or five years. And I had sweat
running down the back of my legs.

1450
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:41,360
I was so nervous and I never could
pass the audition for the tonight show.

1451
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:47,030
And He, did he give you
notes? Sometimes he did,

1452
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:50,630
sometimes he did. Awesome. He
didn't really for me though.

1453
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:54,230
But I remember at the Improv at the time,
if you were on the tonight show,

1454
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:57,320
everybody would be in the club that
night and they'd be watching it on the TV

1455
01:28:57,321 --> 01:29:01,710
over the bar, you know, just the
one TV and the room would get quiet.

1456
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,280
You know, you bring up the comic who
would be working at the end problem,

1457
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:05,511
you know,

1458
01:29:05,511 --> 01:29:09,900
it was a regular and the comic come out
and people would just be cheering and

1459
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:14,250
they'd be applauding. Wow. So
I auditioned again for him,

1460
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:16,470
but it was for another show
is for the Mike Nesmith show.

1461
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,810
The guy from the monkeys,
you know the band,

1462
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:23,100
he was a producer and I thought, well,
this time, and it was Jim Mccauley,

1463
01:29:23,101 --> 01:29:24,890
that same talent coordinator.
Um,

1464
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:28,230
it was casting for the Mike Nesmith
show and also the tonight show.

1465
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,360
So I thought I'm going to do the material,

1466
01:29:30,361 --> 01:29:35,361
I think makes me laugh for then I notice
Michelle and I don't care about Jim

1467
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:39,120
McKellar. There's tonight show and I get
a call from them the next day saying,

1468
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,630
good news and bad news.
Uh,

1469
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,410
the bad news is we don't think you're
right for the mezze Mike Nesmith show,

1470
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:47,220
but we loved your set and we'd love for
you to do the tonight show with Johnny

1471
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:51,210
Carson. And I almost dropped the
phone. Really? Can you do it on Monday?

1472
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:55,800
This was Friday and I was going on my
way to Houston to do a comedy club there

1473
01:29:55,801 --> 01:30:00,180
that weekend. And um, so you know,
you've got to do five minutes.

1474
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,860
So I would do my five minutes,

1475
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:06,880
like in front of my real
set and all I would do 24,

1476
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:11,460
seven for those three days was go over
my act over and over and I could be

1477
01:30:11,461 --> 01:30:14,210
talking to you now. You think I'm
listening to you. You're nodding.

1478
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:18,630
I'm going over my act in my head and I
invented the tonight show a lot of times

1479
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:19,920
when it first came out to la,

1480
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,320
I would go there because the
tickets were free and I knew the,

1481
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:24,570
I knew the routine.
You go to the guest relations building,

1482
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,690
they'll give you a ticket and you
come back at three 30 you get in line.

1483
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,610
And it was like watching a Vegas show.
I mean,

1484
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:33,240
I saw so many people that I knew exactly
what the format was. I knew that Fred,

1485
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:35,250
to carve it, a producer would
come out and talk to the audience.

1486
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,880
Doc Severinsen would come out, you know,
I knew that the song the band played,

1487
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:41,760
Johnny would come out and say a quick
hi and then they start the show.

1488
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:45,930
So I knew exactly what I was getting into.
Smart of you to do that.

1489
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:49,970
So you weren't nervous for well as
nervous as nervous maybe. But um,

1490
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,990
so Monday rolls along and
I, I, I am, I'm white.

1491
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,300
I'm driving out to the tonight
show. I can't believe it, like park.

1492
01:30:57,301 --> 01:31:00,150
And I see Johnny's car parked in his
spot there right by the entrance.

1493
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:03,810
I walked by it and my heart's
just like beating like crazy.

1494
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:08,520
And I go to my dressing room and I
get into my, my, you know, my suit,

1495
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,050
my jacket and tie and I go into makeup
and Johnny stops in real quick and he

1496
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:15,660
wishes me good luck
and I can't believe it.

1497
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:18,750
That was Johnny Carson and
now Jim Macaulay's there,

1498
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:22,050
they talent coordinator and a behind
the curtain. I know the band is playing.

1499
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:25,230
I know every member of that band cause
I watched them so many times and they're

1500
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:30,231
coming back from commercial about to
bring me out and Johnny introduces me and

1501
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:34,440
the curtain opens up and they're
applauding and I go blank.

1502
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,320
I can't think of the opening line at all.
I don't remember any material.

1503
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,650
And I'm walking out and I know the
floor is shiny black, you know,

1504
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:45,690
and the band is finished and yeah,

1505
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:49,770
there's still saliva dripping out of
the trombone players instrument and,

1506
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:51,990
and they're applauding still.

1507
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:57,050
And I'm standing on my mark and the
last clap and it came back to me and I

1508
01:31:57,961 --> 01:32:02,650
started doing my act and I started
getting laughs. Laughs, applaud breaks,

1509
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,580
you know,
laughs.

1510
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:06,670
And I hear Johnny laughing at Ed
Mcmahon back there over my shoulder.

1511
01:32:06,671 --> 01:32:09,490
I don't look though, cause
that's not cool. And I'm,

1512
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,790
and I'm thinking to myself as I'm
doing my, I'm on the tonight show,

1513
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,390
I'm doing the tonight show and I know
my material so well, you know, by rote.

1514
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:17,350
I don't even have to think about it.

1515
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,890
I'm just doing it and I'm
thinking I'm on the tonight show,

1516
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:25,850
I'm on the tonight show.
And it ends in the applauds and it,

1517
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,670
and it was supposed to be five minutes,

1518
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:31,230
but because there's so much applaud
breaks and it went like eight minutes and

1519
01:32:31,231 --> 01:32:34,960
I'd get behind the curtain. Johnny gave
me the, you know, the signal, great job.

1520
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:37,270
And I go behind the
curtain and I'm thinking,

1521
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:40,480
I did the tonight show and Jim
Macaulay's back there all smiles.

1522
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:44,860
He did you great, you did great.
Happy. I think Johnny's don't go, wait,

1523
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:48,880
Jonny I think wants to talk to you because
it went a little long and they don't

1524
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:49,631
have time for the last guest.

1525
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:53,320
So he wants you to come out to the panel
and he goes, what can we talk about?

1526
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,470
And I felt like saying, get out of
my wage, Johnny wants to talk to me,

1527
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:59,080
I don't need you anymore. But he
goes, oh, don't worry about it.

1528
01:32:59,081 --> 01:32:59,860
You've got plenty of stuff.

1529
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:03,760
So I went out there and had extra stuff
that I hadn't talked about and it was

1530
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:08,380
like, I was like in heaven,
I never had experienced this
before. Nothing like that.

1531
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:10,510
Even with, that's Anelle and
weeds, any of those shows.

1532
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,340
And I'm sitting there and I'm doing,

1533
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:15,080
he's setting me up perfectly
without even having any, you know,

1534
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,790
questions they just fell into place.
That's how great he was.

1535
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,120
And I remember him throwing his
head back, laughing, a little smoke,

1536
01:33:22,121 --> 01:33:24,400
still coming out from a cigarette,
from the break, you know,

1537
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:27,130
and for 30 years of smoking,
you know,

1538
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,850
and I got off of this
show and I was floating.

1539
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:36,180
I felt like I was injected with some
kind of a drug that has never been

1540
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:40,780
experienced before. And it was a
natural high. I've never had that again,

1541
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:41,860
but you know,

1542
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:46,390
I went home or to my friends house so
I used to write with and we just waited

1543
01:33:46,391 --> 01:33:51,310
and we just, we sat there with smiles on
our face, you know, just smile, smiles.

1544
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:55,020
And then it aired and I watched it
with a pillow in front of my head,

1545
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:57,550
but I knew everybody was
at the Improv watching.

1546
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:01,420
Like I used to watch everybody else and
I still have the answering machine tape

1547
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,780
from my answering machine now.

1548
01:34:02,781 --> 01:34:07,300
All the comics that called afterwards and
all the people that Kinda got in touch

1549
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,010
and you got the couch, you got
applause break. Not only that,

1550
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:16,570
I started dating the girl that I
bumped the actuaries on after me.

1551
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:19,990
Really? Yes. For six months we dated.

1552
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,410
It was like a home run in every way,

1553
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:28,400
but he had never kind of like took
me on such an emotional story.

1554
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:32,350
It was, like I said to this day,
it was the highlight of my day.

1555
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,450
I literally froze for a moment.

1556
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:39,451
You were about to say and I can
remember and then I couldn't do stand up

1557
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:45,700
the fuck are you doing,
I was so scared that you,

1558
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,810
but you know at that time you didn't even
have like bullet points on a cute card

1559
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:53,830
next. Totally let you do now give
you a cue cards for your act.

1560
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:58,580
You just, and I had, I didn't even
have my in my pocket, you know,

1561
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,320
I was just going,

1562
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:04,620
I'll sell with this. The uh, one
of the Times I did stand up on,

1563
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:08,190
I think it was on Conan and maybe the
first time when I was behind the curtain,

1564
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,470
I go,
how much time do I have?

1565
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,520
And I meant before I,
they bring me out.

1566
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:20,580
So the guy, no, the guy goes, oh, he goes,
he wants to know how much time he has.

1567
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:25,290
And I see him radio it, he goes, you
have like five minutes. And I'm like,

1568
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:30,070
all right. So I'm like, I have five
minutes to stand here and contemplate.

1569
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:33,720
I was starting to get like,
you know, anxiety five minutes.

1570
01:35:33,721 --> 01:35:37,290
And then I just hear like, and he's
like, ladies, gentlemen, my next guest.

1571
01:35:37,291 --> 01:35:40,320
And I was like, Hey motherfucker, you
just said five minutes. She's like, no,

1572
01:35:40,321 --> 01:35:42,870
you're right now. Right now.
And then, but it was like,

1573
01:35:42,871 --> 01:35:47,700
it threw me into walking out
with like a panic, you know?

1574
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:51,960
But it was okay because I don't know,
I was able to just kind of regroup.

1575
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:53,700
But I remember thinking like,

1576
01:35:53,701 --> 01:35:57,660
I have five minutes to stand here and I
have yet ruined like 10 seconds later.

1577
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,750
That's a surprise.
I thought it was gonna go the other way.

1578
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:03,860
How much time do I have? You got
two minutes. Oh, two minutes.

1579
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:08,660
I thought they said fine. Then you cut it
short. I could did a minute and a half.

1580
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,060
That would have been horrible.

1581
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:15,410
I'm so envious of you though to have
that because that really is like the,

1582
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:18,950
that was it easy to get Carson
and tell the couch and to,

1583
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,140
to make it through that hoop is like

1584
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:24,840
great thrill for me. And I don't know
how many times I did that show. I mean,

1585
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:27,080
some people know exactly
like Tom Driessen,

1586
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,390
they know exactly what the tonight show.

1587
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:33,460
And I don't know how many times I did
it. And I, I did it with a lot of guests,

1588
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,960
the hosts too. And I think, I think
he stopped having me on his show.

1589
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:40,360
Yeah.

1590
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:44,890
After one of my appearances there
because I didn't know he had a Dui,

1591
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:49,810
you know? Yeah. And I came out, it
was around the holidays. I said,

1592
01:36:49,811 --> 01:36:53,380
my opening joke was, I'm getting ready
for the holidays. I don't know about you,

1593
01:36:53,381 --> 01:36:54,580
but I'm getting ready for the holidays.

1594
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:57,030
I've been doing a lot of
drinking and driving, you know,

1595
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:02,800
and I finished my set and
then, um, now there would be,

1596
01:37:02,801 --> 01:37:07,060
by the way, a think piece about
Kevin. Yeah. But Jim Mccauley,

1597
01:37:07,061 --> 01:37:10,750
that coordinator calls me, he
goes, oh, I w the opening joke, um,

1598
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:14,500
we didn't go over that. I
said, Oh yeah, I believe me.

1599
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:17,650
I know I don't throw anything in at the
last minute. That was part of the set.

1600
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:21,490
He goes, yeah, that was, you know,
cause I, when I watched it, they,

1601
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:24,940
they gobbled it all up. Okay.
Did my opening joke, it says,

1602
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:25,691
I don't know about you guys,

1603
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:27,640
but I'm getting ready for the holidays
I've been doing with Albert Liberal.

1604
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:30,310
I'll Laura what? I thought, what was that?

1605
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,140
Okay.

1606
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:35,200
And, and then I find out that
Johnny had a DUI and you know,

1607
01:37:35,201 --> 01:37:39,280
there's a lot of problems with that and I,
and I don't specifically remember,

1608
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:41,530
but I, that may have been my
last time on the tonight show.

1609
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,370
He was, I mean they, there was a,

1610
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:46,630
a number of stories about
how you don't cross him.

1611
01:37:46,631 --> 01:37:49,260
He would like Joan Rivers in any way.
It perceived,

1612
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:53,630
yeah. Believe me, had I known
he had a Dui, it never would
have done that, you know,

1613
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:58,440
but, um, but I don't even like to,
I cringe when I think about it.

1614
01:37:58,441 --> 01:38:02,550
The conversation you might've had with
McAlary afterwards, you know, my idol,

1615
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:06,330
like say, what the hell was that all
about? You know? Right. Well look,

1616
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:09,270
speaking of smiles,
I got a fucking,

1617
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,010
oh my goodness.

1618
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:22,020
Yeah, we're kind of obsessed with dental
care. Yeah. You have a very nice smile.

1619
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:24,030
Thank you.
I know that you know that already.

1620
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,770
I know it because I've been
in the dentist's chair for
half of my life. Really?

1621
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:31,880
Yeah. Really tell us about dental stuff.
Oh. Oh. I've had, you know, when I,

1622
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,470
my teeth came in when I was
eight, I fell on a, you know,

1623
01:38:35,471 --> 01:38:40,190
a payment and I've broken both
all brown. Oh. So I've had like,

1624
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:44,210
you know, crowns on the front. Really?
Yeah. Yeah. So that, and uh, you know,

1625
01:38:44,211 --> 01:38:48,910
I've had six root canals, six
two implants last year. God,

1626
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,510
yes.
I've been in the dentist's chair a lot.

1627
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:53,690
Which teeth are root canal
does it Moore's back?

1628
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,420
Mostly molars in the back of then one
of the front ones. Cause I can kill it.

1629
01:38:56,421 --> 01:39:00,980
You know, I died, I died. So these
two are fake. Well the, the crowns,

1630
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,880
the crowns. Yeah. Little nubs
underneath them. Yeah. Really good.

1631
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:07,590
I remember when you got your, they
up. Do you down remember when? Yeah.

1632
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,210
I got nubs to these front two or veneers
because I knocked out half of this one

1633
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,230
as a kid. I know it's a pain
in the ass when he knocked.

1634
01:39:13,231 --> 01:39:15,860
Got Your teeth for the rest of your life.
You have to replace them.

1635
01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:19,460
I felt bad for my parents or my
mother's. I would have freeze. You know,

1636
01:39:19,461 --> 01:39:23,040
when your kid knocks out his teeth
and as soon as he hasn't. Yeah. Yeah.

1637
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,940
So I've been in a lot of dentist chairs.
I've had a lot of Nova came to my,

1638
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,820
in fact when I went to audition for a
man with a plan on the show I'm on now,

1639
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:33,560
and Matt Leblanc had chemistry read with
him. I was at the dentist that morning.

1640
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,520
I was at that with you, by the way. Where
are you really? Yeah, I was at the, um,

1641
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,660
like when they first were seeing people,

1642
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:44,040
I came in like at the end when they
could, you know, but when they were first,

1643
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:46,260
yeah, when they were first
seeing people, I'm saying,

1644
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:51,480
I remember I parked next to you and I
didn't really know you and I was going to

1645
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:55,380
a reading. Oh, I saw you. I remember
you. Yeah, there was, it was a while ago.

1646
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,920
You had a bigger beard at the time, I
think. Yeah, probably a bigger body too.

1647
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:04,020
But I remember because I ran into, I
definitely remember you, cause I mean,

1648
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:07,350
I remember one of the three arts guys
I remember was walking around and I

1649
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:10,020
remember talking to me and he was like,
Kevin,

1650
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:11,590
I like that. Yeah. Like that.

1651
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:17,170
But my mouth was all numb with
Novocain at that, at that thing. Yeah.

1652
01:40:17,171 --> 01:40:19,620
Because they had more work they
had to do than they thought.

1653
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:23,040
And I barely got there in time.
I was like zipping over Laurel Canyon,

1654
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:27,350
trying to learn my lines and I go in
and, uh, and I read with, uh, you know,

1655
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:29,380
the side room with Matt Leblanc.
He comes in here,

1656
01:40:29,381 --> 01:40:33,690
you want to read the lines a little bit.
So, yeah. And, uh, my mom is all like,

1657
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,960
I couldn't, can't move this side. I'm
just trying to do my best, you know. And,

1658
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:40,410
and then he said, lady told me later, you
want go into the producers. And he said,

1659
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:43,620
uh, they said, how was he goes, you know,
he's pretty good as time is good. But,

1660
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,970
you know,
I think he might have had a stroke,

1661
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:51,600
but it was like Kinda really numb. But I
do remember seeing you there. I wasn't,

1662
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:55,810
but I remember thinking, man, I hope,
I hope, I hope he has a good audition.

1663
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:57,160
You know, because I, I really,

1664
01:40:57,290 --> 01:41:00,020
I feel for anybody who's going in
for an audition because I know how,

1665
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:02,330
how stressful it is. Stressful. I mean,

1666
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:04,690
you must've had a good audition
cause you got the part right.

1667
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,870
So I did get the part, now
that I think about it. Yeah.

1668
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:14,230
You worked out. Um, do you
floss? Yeah, we do. Yeah.

1669
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:16,480
What about the uh,
picked you did the waterpik thing.

1670
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:21,490
Don't do the waterpik cause we just got
a bad day toilet seat and that shoots up

1671
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:26,200
some nice streams of water.
But I do floss.

1672
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:29,240
But somebody, my friend,
you know, who, uh,

1673
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:34,220
likes to kind of like give me information
to debunk what I'm doing. He says,

1674
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,800
I just read a report where they say
flossing doesn't help bull shoals. Yeah.

1675
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:42,610
Even if it doesn't help, it gets the
food out from between your teeth.

1676
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:46,570
It can get old and smelly. Yeah. Cause I
don't brush. Floss. Yeah. There you go.

1677
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:51,640
Now wait a minute.
How we're big fans of the builtin today's,

1678
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:56,470
how happy are you with it? Well, I
got it from my wife for her birthday,

1679
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:59,110
which is a lot better than the Porta John.

1680
01:41:59,111 --> 01:42:02,320
I got her for mother's Day year before.
She did not like that. No, none at all.

1681
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:07,080
She was insulted. But um, loves it. She
loves it. I don't use it that much. What?

1682
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:12,050
Cause I used the office, the
bathroom in my office, but uh,

1683
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:15,570
I did sit on a few times. I love the
heated seat. He didn't see, it's nice,

1684
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:17,080
but it's got a mind of its own.

1685
01:42:17,081 --> 01:42:20,530
It's own up and down all night long and
there's water fizzling out and stuff.

1686
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,990
And sometimes when I'm
going to the bathroom,

1687
01:42:22,991 --> 01:42:26,080
the Siedel go down automatically
and I got to hold it up, you know?

1688
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:31,300
But it's a great, it's a great machine.
It's a lot of it at all different speeds.

1689
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:33,910
I don't know if here's, has the speeds
that we have, we have different speeds.

1690
01:42:33,911 --> 01:42:34,541
We have a few.

1691
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:39,520
We have a toto washlet three 50 e and
then this company bio buddy send us one.

1692
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:43,960
Uh, really a washlet here. Yeah. Well
where ours is a black and decker,

1693
01:42:43,961 --> 01:42:48,490
so our highest speed is
fracking. Yeah. You can frankly,
hydro, jet cleaning, I mean,

1694
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:51,640
and fire hydrate and nothing says I'm
romance when your wife must be like, wow.

1695
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,410
He's really, yeah. So you know, when our
guests come over, we don't tell them.

1696
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,480
All of a sudden they got water shooting
up their ass. Yeah. It's nice. Yeah.

1697
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:03,040
I love it. I put it on high
pressure. Yeah. But you know,

1698
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:04,330
nobody comes out in the bathroom,

1699
01:43:04,331 --> 01:43:08,830
they're in there for hours or Waterville
has really gone up. Has It? Yeah. Yeah.

1700
01:43:08,831 --> 01:43:11,750
Yeah. But those are a great
invention. They really are.

1701
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,730
I recommended for anybody
watch the chocolate away.
Save money on toilet paper.

1702
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:18,820
Yeah, for sure. Um, anything else, Jean?

1703
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:23,920
I don't think so. Um, we had a lot of fun.

1704
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:26,530
We had some good memories from
this show. This was great, man.

1705
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:31,600
I would love for you to come back again
and do it again. Oh, I think we lost.

1706
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:34,780
You know, that'd be great. I would love
it. I would love it. Do you ever travel,

1707
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:35,920

1709
01:43:40,601 --> 01:43:43,030

to do it? You're half.

1710
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:44,320
But do you ever do it at a comedy club?

1711
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:49,060
If we have and that wasn't satisfying
or it's fun. It's fun. It's just um,
