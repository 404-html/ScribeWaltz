00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:52,430

I forgive me for the person who sent it.
I didn't put it them on Twitter.

121
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,810
We'll figure it out.
It's a clip from cameo.

122
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,220
It's cameo where you get celebrities to
make videos that you pay them a certain

123
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:15,240
amount of money. And this video
came in. This is Beverley Mitchell.

00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:19,050
Remember that show? Seventh Heaven.
Yeah, this is, I'm a potter.

00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:24,720
she looks the same.
She looks great.

127
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,320
She plays like one of the younger kids

131
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,870
That was the best thing ever. She looks
great. She's still, she still looks nice.

132
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,900
Never that fucking show. Seventh Heaven.

133
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,200
I never watched it. Neither

137
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,910

now. Yeah, I'd be in a couple of weeks,

138
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,980
but he's,

139
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,750

like the PDF,

140
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,340
which shows like here's where you turn it.
It's really like explicit.

141
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:26,341
It's to give anybody who's trying
to find the place clear direction.

142
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,140
And he's like, so when I get off the
highway, oh, I go right. And I go,

143
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:35,800
yeah, like right. Like, so you're
going north away from the cities,

144
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,090
like don't start with the fucking
north and south. All right. He goes,

145
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:45,020
I'm not a fuck a boy
scout. All right man. I go,

146
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,130
what? I don't know what to tell you.
He's like, do I go right? I go, yeah.

147
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,300
And he's like, and then at the other
street, another right. And I go, yeah,

148
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,540
I have no idea. I'm just like,
yeah. And he's like, and then what?

149
00:10:55,541 --> 00:11:00,170
Then left at the other thing and I go,
I'll just be out in the street.

150
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,740
Does have a gps. Come on,
who are you talking now?

151
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,930
He won't even accept text
message. He's like, tell you why.

152
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:09,670
If I've been drinking the shit, my ass was
going to be on file. I can't wait. Yeah.

153
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,090
Oh good. We got them Fart Mc for, I don't
know if you want to give that to him.

154
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,260
I don't know if you want to
start that. I do. I actually,

155
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,910
you know what we haven't had
against, yeah, you're setting,

156
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,900
you're sitting pretty close.
Just a reminder.

157
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm used to Joey's farts and he's
like my kid at this holy shit.

158
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,570
Anyways, uh, we, we lost track
here. So this is Beverley
Mitchell. Um, I was saying,

159
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:29,770
I remember Jessica Biel,

160
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:33,670
she cause that's what she got famous on
and everybody was enamored with Jessica

161
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,710
w worse. So, um, but then this
cameo things kind of, it's,

162
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:41,020
it's an APP. If you guys
don't know it's an APP, right.

163
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:43,870
And all kinds of people have
signed like are doing it where you,

164
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
you can pay them to send a measures
and they have different tiers.

165
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,040
So like there's Instagram people and
then there's TV and then like Farve,

166
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,090
you know,
Hall of fame.

167
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,750
Superbowl winning quarterback is uncanny
and I think you have to pay him 500

168
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,500
bucks just to be like happy
birthday. Yeah, exactly.

169
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,430
There. Jim, your friend
Bob, he lucky you love,

170
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,670
he said her tail bone ready.
Uh,

171
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,020
wranglers are good pants. There's
another thing. Don't forget about that.

172
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,300
Go go packers. I just, I don't know.

173
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:20,680
I feel like if I was going to start
making, I just do it for free for fans.

174
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,480
You know what I mean? Well,
I mean, you know, I'm not,

175
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,900
I'm not hating on the whatever.
Yeah. I don't want to do it,

176
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,730
but I think it's fine that people do it,

177
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,330
but I really liked the people are
hitting up people and having them do your

178
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:35,910
mom's house stuff. That's
hilarious. That's a good investment.

179
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,770
You know what's so
funny is seventh heaven.

180
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,000
That was like a blatantly
Christian value show. It was. Yeah.

181
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,060
I think the far right,
the father was like a priest on the show.

182
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,620
It was like a minister and I think they're
like, oh, you used to watch the show.

183
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,600
Really? Wow. Scandalous happen on bill's.

184
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,600
Really the only thing I remember, I
mean, is that why you watched? Yeah.

185
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,230
And you're like, God, let me marry you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like she, you know,

186
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,580
she seemed cutting young on that show.
It was like, oh, that's kind of I work.

187
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:11,890
Do you remember when I worked as a
site rep? We were married, so it was,

188
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,660
it was less than 10 years ago.
I worked as an adult man,

189
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,010
I don't know if I ever told you, but
there was a guy, so as a site rep,

190
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,570
you would go to a building that they're
shooting a movie or production in and

191
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,571
you just represent basically the building
so that the production doesn't just

192
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,170
destroy it because they will don't
give a fuck. And you'd be like, Hey,

193
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,060
this is a Christina's house.
I'm just here to make sure.

194
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:40,660
And then they'll start like nail and shit.
So you had to kind of protect it.

195
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,820
And one of the other site reps,

196
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,180
it's guy was like 26
27 was legit obsessed.

197
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,830
Obsessed with Jessica Biel
boy. And he was like, yeah, my,

198
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,730
I have pictures of her all over
my room and oh boy. He's like,

199
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,120
I know I'm going to marry her one day.
And at first, like if someone said,

200
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:05,470
you're like, ha ha, yeah. And then he
was like, no, for real. When I was like,

201
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:09,100
you're gonna Marry Jessica Biel? And he's
like, yeah. He's like, well, he's like,

202
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,440
we're meant to be together.
And I was like, fuck,

203
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,420
this dude is seriously delusional.

204
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,660
And I would bring it up like
I wouldn't see him for a week.

205
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,960
I'd see him at the office.
I was like, Hey Jessica,

206
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,770
plans coming up.
And he would be like,

207
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,660
oh no, I know you make fun of me for
that. But was he a gang banger to know?

208
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,570
He was kind of about though. He had
like someone bought the blood, he was,

209
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,660
he was from Ventura and he likes to serve.
He was like,

210
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:38,110
where it's like we're like a perfect
match, you know, like it's a delusion.

211
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,120
Get the level of delusion
that it wasn't like,

212
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,960
it's one thing if you see like a
teenager like that stu was a grown man.

213
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,290
I used to think that Ricky Schroeder and
I would fall in love and get married to,

214
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:52,040
what were you like 31 silver spoon?
He was my first love.

215
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,600
My first crush was Ricky Schroder. Yeah,
I mean he was well off. Good looking.

216
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,430
Yeah. I mean I hadn't, I had that
crush on Alyssa Milano course.

217
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,960
And then what was the blonde,
the beautiful blonde on the other,

218
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,340
the one that Scott Bayeux finger.
Yes. Yeah. Yes. Her Nicole,

219
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,950
Nicole Agricor. Oh, call Acre. Used to,
I used to think if you learn their names,

220
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,820
there was a good chance you
didn't have together. Right.

221
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,070
Cause I was an advanced level for a
kid, for a kid. And you're like, oh,

222
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:26,350
I read the credits and I
know this person's name
calls with me. And I used to,

223
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,320
I used to buy like those
big bopper magazines,

224
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,810
remember those stupid
magazines for like teen girls.

225
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,030
And then Ricky Schroder
would be all over it.

226
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,700
And I have like the poster on my wall.
It's just loved him.

227
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,870
And then it became Johnny Depp when
21 jump street came out. Oh my God.

228
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,700
21 jump street. Johnny Depp. It's so
cute. Yeah, he's still looks great though.

229
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,350
Yeah. For total look great. I know. Crazy.

230
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:56,310
He was wild to dude. I
know. I wish she would, uh,

231
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,040
hit the craziest thing. Is that a article
about him? The, the spending article,

232
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,470
he's like, he's like really has, um,

233
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,680
like diagnosed, you know, spending
impulsive. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

234
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,730
He's like, buy 30 of those. Okay.

235
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,820
The craziest thing to me still
is that he smokes in his house.

236
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,650
Rolling cigarettes. Guy Spends 30 million
a month. I'm like, yeah, it's Kinda crazy.

237
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:25,370
And then he's like smoking cigarettes
and sound like this guy's fucking nuts

238
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,410
right now. I wish you would come on our
show, but our show is invitation only.

239

240
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,370
but unless you want to,
you want to issue an invitation.

241
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,750

I'm agreeing Johnny Depp to be

243
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,210

don't know if you even know.

247

Do you know that I'm hard rock.
Nick was on tosh 0.0, oh yeah.

248
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,320
And we got a shout out and they
played footage from our show.

249
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,510
That's pretty solid. Cool. I'm a little
upset because they only mentioned Tom.

250
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,410
They're like, and Tom Segura is podcasts.
I'm like, what am I chopped liver?

251
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,650
What about Christina p two
Netflix specials. Hello?

actually very upset. The Daniel Tosh,

257
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,890
I'm offended. Josh says in radio that that
role is called the whole on the whole,

258
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,580
Oh, the Gash. The girl, I dunno.

So do I. No, no, no. I've talked
to him backstage before. Yes.

263
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,490
Now I fucking know down. I know. I
know. Nick Wagner. That's his guys. No,

264
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:21,170
that's not who worked for him. That's
a different, it has different guy guys.

265
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,520
I'm 10 years behind. Yeah.
Catch me outside. Cat know.

266
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,220
I've toured with Danielle though.
That's right. I forgot. Yeah. But still,

267
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,540
it's fucking disrespect.
There's just some blonde chick there.

268
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,040
Just some fucking dumb bitch and then a
cool jacket. But anyway. Unbelievable.

269
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,520
What the level of disrespect aside
from that little hole. Disrespect.

270
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,540
The segment was very funny. It
wasn't very flattering. And they did,

271
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,330
they gave a shout out to they,
yeah, they did say cite my name,

272
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,380
but they played a clip from
our show, correct? Yep.

273
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,850
The two of us talking about hard rock the
whole time and hard Rudnick to in his,

274
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:57,110
uh, defense was, um, was game
and was very fun on this.

275
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,130
I have to give him credit. He, he
reacted differently than I would.

276
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:07,020
I would maybe at the expected
from somebody so attractive
and so muscular and so

277
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,660
wealthy. I would think that
somebody like hard rock,

278
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:14,520
nick wouldn't even give them the media at
the time of day. Yeah. He's a busy dude.

279
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:18,900
He's very busy.
I thought he was hilarious too,

280
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:22,710
that he has not broken
on his claims so on.

281
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,860
I saw him on a rider
and then they're like,

282
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:30,760
and you really are worth like 100
million. He's like, he's like, Yep.

283
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,350
Doesn't he doesn't bend at all in
any of those claims. Pretty Fun.

284
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,390
That's been at least having a good time.

285
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,680
I think he's having a good time and he's
on cameo by the way. It hard, right? Yeah.

286
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll plug it. Okay. Shit. Okay.
Go check out. I don't know
what he's charging though.

287
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,830
I know. I wonder guy that rich shouldn't
be charging him. He's a millionaire.

288
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:54,540
He could be doing this for free. Yeah, I
know some other people do. Kathy Griffin,

289
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,220
she does thumb.
Yeah.

290
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,050
Lance Bass approached me and I said,
dad, no thanks. Yeah, it's not, you know,

291
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,580
but I don't know. It's not for
me. I personally, like I said,

292
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:09,000
if I wanted to do videos for fans,
I just fucking do it for free.

293
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:14,001
I give shout outs to people on their
birthdays and happy birthday to,

294
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:18,480
yeah, we should start doing birthday
shout outs like on the radio, you know,

295
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:22,950
like that's fucking dumb. Whose
birthday's today? Nothing.

296
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:27,780
I hate more than a happy birthday.
Fucking I get emails all the time.

297
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:30,960
We'll be at your show on Friday.
And uh,

298
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,210
my friend Cynthia, her, we
give her a shout out also.

299
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,980
She, uh, she's got big ear lobes.

300
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:42,660
If you want something to make fun
of her about like, yeah, I know.

301
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:45,630
I can't wait to stop my
show brought to do that.

302
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,980
It's my adult friends birthday.
The

303
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,500
only thing is that crazy to me.
Like you're an adult.

304
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,740
No one compares more insane than
like we'll be at your show sometimes.

305
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:00,370
It's like, it was a group of us
coming. Uh, ted is guys crazy.

306
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,660
If you want to fuck with him, you know
he's always got a truck. You never,

307
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,810
it's all dirty and shit. He never,
if you want to make fun of them,

308
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,170
Ted here, why don't you wash
your truck? Everyone was like,

309
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:17,240
that's hilarious.
So fucking stupid.

310
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,250
No are my favorite is I get
people emailing me, hey to,

311
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,890
hey Tom's doing a show in Fort Lauderdale.

312
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:28,630
Can you ask him to help me get proposed?

313
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,430
No. That's the one that I
hate the most. And by the way,

314
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,520
just so you know how unoriginal you are,
it is every week,

315
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,790
every week I get multiple emails.

316
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,320
We're going to be at the show Saturday
and I wanted to do something really

317
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:44,771
special,

318
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:49,540
like what I want to propose
to my girl at your show,

319
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,450
hoping that maybe you
could bring me up on stage.

320
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,880
What do you realize how little
everyone at that show cares?

321
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,910
Nobody want you getting
engaged and nobody, no, I just,

322
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,210
I had to stop myself from writing back.

323
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:08,090
How much I hate them when they email
me that, but well, it brings the worst.

324
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,990
Also brings the comedy fun
to all of, yeah, let's stop.

325
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,040
Let's stop the entertainment.

326
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,560
Let's make this show that
has 1800 2,500 people at it.

327
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:21,680
Let's make everybody stop
and watch you go Alyssa.

328
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,280
You know,
you mean the world to me.

329
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,340
You're a girl and he's all
nervous and shaky and then,

330
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,460
and then he has the story of,
remember we were at that show,

331
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:32,710
everyone hated us for stopping the show.

332
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,750
So I could propose to you remember,
am I going to say the club?

333
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:41,740
But they would. They would. I
had it happen twice. And clubs.

334
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,540
I've had it happen several times.
Yes.

335
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,770
But then the owner wants you to plug
the blowjob shots. Oh yeah, yeah.

336
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,380
Before you're set. Yeah.
Does Dallas Fort Worth yet?

337
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,410
It's so stupid.

338
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,860
Just go ahead and plug these blowjob
shots and then just go worse.

339
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,750
That's the one where the guy goes,

340
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:00,730
you're the only guy that's
ever said anything about this.

341
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,350
He told me I was the only guy
that's ever, I was like, okay,

342
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,280
all right man. Yeah, no, I had, um, I
had proposals. Here's what I had though.

343
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,800
So the first time I ever had it happen,
I was working at club and they were like,

344
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,400
some like they basically informed me,
they were like,

345
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:18,130
someone's going to propose
that. I was like, okay.

346
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,970
It was as bad as you can imagine.

347
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,230
Guys all nervous and like people
and then people are getting,

348
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:29,770
when I realized how much everybody
hated it by the next time it happened,

349
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:31,060
they had to ask me.
They're like,

350
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,590
do you mind if somebody proposes during
the show? And I go, I absolutely do mind.

351
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,100
And they were like, hmm, what
can we do? And I was like,

352
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:43,090
you can wait until I'm done with my show
and I go, you can do it after the show.

353
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,800
And that was the compromise.
I was like,

354
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:48,650
once I'm off stage and back in
the green room, I don't care.

355
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:51,990
You can have the guy take a shit on
stage and people are filing out. Yeah.

356
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,230
So that's what they did
finish with their Nachos.

357
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,270
I've had people ask me to
marry them a lot and um,

358
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,650
I'm not going to do it just cause
I don't, you don't want me. Yeah.

359
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,160
I mean I appreciate the, no, the
offers. Nice. That offers. Nice to say.

360
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:09,140
Would you like to be the
efficient of my wedding?

361
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,600
The offer is insulting and selfish to say.

362
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,840
Do you mind if I propose during your show?
Because it's just so you know.

363
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:18,170
You're fucking rude. Okay.
Oh my God. You're selfish.

364
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:20,720
Your balls are freshly shorn,
but they're back down.

365
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,260
You need to get your Dick Mount tonight.

366
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,690
No one wants to snapping
already had started.

367
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Can propose price testosterone
running through you right now.

368
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,130
No, you're right, and again, I don't,

369
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,260
I appreciate the offer to
officiate your wedding, but I,

370
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,490
I'm not the right candidate.
That's different. That is
different. That's saying,

371
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,690
would you like to come to this thing?
It's an invitation like this podcast.

372
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,350
It's invitation only. That's absolutely
right. It's the same thing. Not just any.

373
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:52,580
A whole can come on here and you can just
send me a fucking thing, you know? Hey,

374
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:55,030
why can I be, no, no, no.

375
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Of course we have to Ordain you
worthy of being on our show right now.

376
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,220
Who is he getting text
message from sexting?

377
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,360
Can we try it out your beard and trying
to fuck and I knew that would upset you

378
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,740
know that man.

379
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,130
So in that ever since I've been going
like real short with with a haircut and

380
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:22,964
everything,

381
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,040
I have to do this horrible maintenance
of getting it clipped all the time

382
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,630
because it starts to look shitty.
Would it has any growth on it?

383
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:36,470
Like getting haircuts like every two weeks
when the beard is a little wily look.

384
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:39,500
Well I like it a little look dirty.
I like, but you don't understand.

385
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:43,460
That was my attraction to you is that
you look dirty and gross and homeless.

386
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,580
I like it.
Don't you get that?

387
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,800
I've always loved that about you.
That you're just nasty, stinky bear.

388
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,160
I like it. Oh Harry and
stuff. I love your soul.

389
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,880
Have whiskers for an image
of myself. Yeah, of course.

390
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,090
But I like it when you're a little
unkempt. It's masculine. All right,

391
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,310
well I just meant that like, so here,
obviously in the front it's thinned out.

392
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,820
So when you have thin hair in your front
of your head and you're doing the buzz

393
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,020
cut, you got to keep it short.
Otherwise when it gets any growth,

394
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,790
it just highlights how thinned out
it is. You know what I mean? Sure.

395
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,890
So it started to get there and I was like,
I seem to go and get it cleaned up.

396
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,310
I keep calling these two places
to do it because they're near us.

397
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,750
One of them is always packed and I
never remembered to call ahead of time.

398
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,660
I always called day of, we'll call it like
nine in the morning. And they're like,

399
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,760
we're completely packed at him.
Like Jesus Christ.

400
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,310
How many people are getting their damn
haircut? I Dunno, they, they're like,

401
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,240
you want to come and wait
and I'm gonna go. No.

402
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,380
So I called the second place and there
was a lady who did a pretty good job.

403
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,850
Of course she's not there.

404
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,120
So I go in yesterday and I tell the dude
what I want and I mean it's not totally

405
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:54,800
fucked up, but he fucked your beard.
He fucked my beard up. I'm not,

406
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,550
you're the one that said that when you
came. I know, I know. Just so you know.

407
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,360
The funny thing is I gave him like,
I give them all a nice, I'm nice,

408
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,620
but I go with them like really explicit
instructions and he was like, yeah,

409
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:11,070
I get it man. And he did it and I
was like, that's not what I wanted.

410
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,870
But the good news is you're,
it grows fast. It does.

411
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:19,920
So in a week it'll be normal again.
He cut the line, he took it up.

412
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,780
Here's what's wrong, is that he cut
like he gave you the dad line like your,

413
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:28,920
your beard grows. It's got to go
further down here and the chin.

414
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,300
I know he's not American.
Oh, he was of course not

415
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,760
unexplained was he did, he did.

416
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:43,080
He was sitting microwave
is curry fucking morning.

417
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,690
I had my coffee yet.

418
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,730
Fuck, fucking morning says
that fucking morning. Yeah,

419
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,640
that's what I want. That's how I
would want a boss to talk to me.

420
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,120
Me Til you get to work. And
he's like, it's fucking morning

421
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,920
now. It's time enough with the
business. We're going to get into it.

422
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,670
We had the great pleasure,
the joy,

423
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,560
the benefit, the wonderful
time to have Sean Evans here.

424
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,660
So delightful and invited him on the
show. Yeah. And he was like, yeah,

425
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,570
just like hot ones. You know,
Sean is the host of hot ones,

426
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:31,230
the wildly popular online show,

427
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,290
a youtube show,
a that first we feast.

428
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,840
It was on the last season.
Um, yeah, it's a, it's a,

429
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,680
it's a big show and Sean is
like just the sweetest guy,

430
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,950
I think the best host and
interviewer in the game.

431
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:50,550
He's absolutely my favorite person
that's ever interviewed me and I love

432
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:53,790
watching him hosts that show.
If you've never watched hot ones,

433
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,810
you can do a deep dive on that.
It's so fun.

434
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,990
They might Shaquille O'Neal episode.
Yeah, we just watched that one. Um,

435
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,300
he has usually has, you know,
a mix of like athletes, actors,

436
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:10,560
rappers and comics. Always plugging
a comic and every APP every season.

437
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,610
Um, and it's great. And so I'm
thrilled that he came here.

438
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:15,690
We had the best time with them.

439
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,840
We played our own game with him so
we played wet ones with them. So, uh,

440
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,050
hope you enjoy it. Here
is Sean Evans. Everybody.

441
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,570
Hey,
what's going on everyone for why?

442
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:31,020
Mh I'm Thomson [inaudible]
and you're watching wet ones.

443
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,380
The show would land water
and even blend or questions.

444
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,820
Our guest today is Sean Evans.
John,

445
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,890
you are the CEO, chairman, host

446
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,600
president and director of,
what's it called?

447
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,710
Hot one's hot ones. Yeah,
that's another show. Anyways,

448
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,160
that show is much better. So first
up we're going to give you, um,

449
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,420
this is a shit water for shit.
People that don't know any better.

450
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,420
Go ahead and crack it open.
All right.

451
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,250
I won't even taste mine cause I
think it tastes like dog shit. Yeah.

452
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,090
You know that tastes like, what
does it taste like? Hold on. Jam.

453
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,420
Like it's disgusting trash.
Do you have like a,

454
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,880
do you ever have a hose attached
to your house? Yeah, yeah.

455
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:23,770
I used to do that and pull that move.
Yeah. Now it does taste like hose water.

456
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:27,160
I agree. Sean, what's your favorite color?

457
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,930
I was actually thinking about this the
other day cause I think I just wear

458
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,750
creams and grays and blacks all the time,

459
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:39,040
but I feel like those are boring colors.
It's like I'm happy that orange exists.

460
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,360
Do you ever, do you wear it though?
No, cause it looks horrible on me,

461
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,570
but orange I think is my favorite color.
I can create it though.

462
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,980
You at the point now where then you start
to appreciate somebody who will wear

463
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:54,130
colors. You know what I
mean? Like bold. Yeah.

464
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,180
Sometimes I'll see somebody and like an
orange or like a a real blue that pops.

465
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm like, Yo, I wish I could be you. I'm
not. It's aspirational. It's aspiration.

466
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:05,200
I won't do it. Yeah, we
won't get there. Next up

467
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,770
is aquaponics,
this natural spring water.

468
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,900
You know the difference between that
bullshit Disani in this minerals. Oh yeah.

469
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:19,970
You can taste the minerals
for real. Yeah. No, I,

470
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,430
if I would reach for this when I'm wanting
to quench my thirst and then it's an

471
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:25,900
exotic drink.

472
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:30,850
But if somebody offered you this bottle
of pis or this this a hundred times,

473
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm going to put this,
I think we should square them off.

474
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,050
I'm going to put this to the my right.
That means a preferable place. Shawn,

475
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:42,430
did you ever think in a million years
that you would be doing what you're doing

476
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:46,330
now? No. I mean we didn't
even think that, uh, you know,

477
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:49,990
we didn't even have that high hopes
of for the show. Like just in general,

478
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,000
what do you think it was a one off or no,
no,

479
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:55,690
I thought that we could make this quick
fire Internet side show, you know,

480
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:59,830
like celebrities coming in, burning their
face off. I thought, you know, even,

481
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,670
I didn't know if necessarily it would
have a host or that you'd see the host or

482
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,730
that it would play that role in it.
Originally,

483
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:10,000
our idea for it was it for to be this
like swinging light interrogation show

484
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:14,560
where we'd just be like interrogating
the celebrity and forcing chicken wings

485
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,410
down their throat and they'd just be
like fighting through these questions and

486
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:20,320
the wings maybe by themselves.
Like, maybe I don't even eat.

487
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,730
And it was Tony [inaudible] from g unit
who helped us workshop the show and he

488
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:26,710
was kind of like,
you know,

489
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,760
no self respecting famous person's gonna
come in here and just choked down wings

490
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:33,310
while you pepper them with questions.
Like if you want this to work,

491
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:34,630
I think you have to eat the wings too.

492
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:38,700
And it was really like the best and that
was like unintentional that that worked

493
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,070
out like yeah.
But it clicked for us.

494
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,860
Like I remember the light bulb going
off or like, oh yeah, I like that.

495
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:47,390
Makes a lot more sense. And then hot ones
was born. Dude, it's an amazing show.

496
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,700
Thank you to the amazing shape.

497
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,860
And the best part about it 100% is you
because you are a gifted broadcast or an

498
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:57,950
interviewer. I don't know how
you'd do it. I really don't.

499
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,840
I think part of it is that you actually,

500
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,770
it seems like you take genuine
interest in your subjects,

501
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:07,310
which is like what you realize
if when you watch, you know,

502
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,530
a talk show or radio interview,
especially at like,

503
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,690
we're always the subject of
interviews, you know, where you go in.

504
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,590
And like a lot of times with
radio there'll be like a,
they're just reading like,

505
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,970
like a bio line. They'll be like, you
went to University of San Francisco,

506
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,800
Wikipedia and you're like, this is
the second line in my bio and says,

507
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,840
here you did Netflix special.
What was that like?

508
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,380
But yours like yours or are way,

509
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,350
way more researched in depth.

510
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:39,230
It feels like you actually
take an interest. Well,

511
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:41,810
I think that it's such
a competitive space.

512
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,700
Like the interview
space is so competitive.

513
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,490
So if it's like you're going
to get eyeballs, you know,

514
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,660
and you're going to compete for those,

515
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:50,480
then I think your show has to
be that exceptionally good.

516
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,780
And then I think the other thing that's
played into that as the audience,

517
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,140
so many people are
cult-like with hot ones.

518
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:00,320
They're hot ones fans and they're just,
they're there every single time.

519
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:03,740
So you feel like you have to impress
them every single time. So it's like,

520
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:08,720
let me respect your audience. I, you
know what I am, I'm scared of him.

521
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,150
I'm scared of that audience.
I'm scared of them.

522
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:15,830
I think they put such pressure
ones. Have a Fart Mike. No,

523
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,470
but we need one.
This is a fun one.

524
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,820
You should have a farm or
a show needed a fart Mike.

525
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,683
Wow.

526
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Giving you permission to take the idea
because I thought you'd cornered and if

527
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:34,320
we, by the way, if you please, if
you have to Fart, I'm grabbing. I'm,

528
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:38,210
I've got you. Thanks. Gotcha.
The only thing you know,

529
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,970
you never know. You know, you always
have to be ready. It could at any,

530
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,910
although as a, as a, an alum
of hot ones, I got to tell you,

531
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,120
when you're in, when you're in
that room and you feel a Fart,

532
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,810
you're not sure what's behind it.
Oh yeah, I know. It feels like,

533
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,810
it feels like this might
be a shit Mike real soon.

534
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,120
Cause I remember asking after
you did hot ones, I'm like,

535
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:03,770
how was your Brown after? And it was,
I took my, uh, I'll tell you this,

536
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:08,600
you can pass this advice on to future
hot ones who are hesitant to go forward

537
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,520
with the game,
so to speak.

538
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,480
When I worked at Chibo
on sunset many years ago,

539
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,110
which I think is still around the
all Mexican and Guatemalan staff,

540
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,740
they would make crazy hot
dishes all the time for us,

541
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,640
everything was like super spicy and
a lot of us, you know, would be like,

542
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:28,520
man that looks spicy as it's
going to kill me on the way out.

543
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,650
And they were like most
of what you gotta do man,

544
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,500
you get bread and you
butter up that bread.

545
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,170
Heavy butter lines the track.

546
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,450
Like if you know you're going eat
spices and that would completely,

547
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,010
and now a lot of times when you go out
for something spicy, you weren't in,

548
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,180
let's say planning on it. So you're
ruined. But whenever we did that,

549
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:51,610
when we ate the buttered like thick
buttered bread, it like, I dunno.

550
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,650
So did you do that before hot ones
though? No, of course not. I'm not smart.

551
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,270
I'm saying I remember
that. Yeah. But you know,

552
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,460
it's weird that I come across somebody
on the other side of hot ones,

553
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:08,080
but I always do ask them like one, what
was like the next couple of days like,

554
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,020
and then do people come up to
you in the wild and they're like,

555
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,090
oh no, cause yeah, I mean the,
yeah, I mean fish. I remember, okay,

556
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:20,380
go in and do hot ones. As it got closer
and like it was really first we did,

557
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:23,460
first of all, we did the, um, the
burger thing, which we'll get into it,

558
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,640
but when we did the hot ones,

559
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,890
I definitely had some apprehension
and I was like, I was like, oh man.

560
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:32,890
Like how bad is it? So then you
start, you know, you're watching them,

561
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,710
then you get distracted
by how good the show is.

562
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,970
You forget that there is going it.
But then like day of or day before,

563
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,930
I remember I called Bert because he
had done, yeah, yeah. And I was like,

564
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,270
I was like, I mean, what's going to happen
here? He's like, it's hot. It's very hot,

565
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,960
but he was like, it won't be that
bad. Just so fun. And if it hurts,

566
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,990
just let it hurt. That's what he told me.
He, that's good advice. Yeah, it was good.

567
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:58,780
He was like, just like, he's like, you'll
recover. And I was like, all right.

568
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,220
And then I still remember being there,
like, I dunno it, it kind of feels like,

569
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,500
you know,
there's a parachute in a way,

570
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,850
but you're still like a
little worked up about it.

571
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,120
And then the thing was that for me,
from my personal experience,

572
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,150
I was like four or five weeks in like,
this isn't bad at all.

573
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,520
But then there was that
the bomb. Yeah. Yeah.

574
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:23,200
And that was worse than what I had
imagined it could be. Right? Yeah.

575
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,840
That wrecked me. Yeah.
There's no period for that.

576
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:28,390
But then it's funny because when
I watched, when I watched it,

577
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,550
and I'm just watching it as let's say,
try and take myself out of it as content.

578
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,380
I go, this is like one of the funniest
parts, watching someone's struggle,

579
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,640
sweat. Can I actually remember
that? I couldn't remember.

580
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,940
You would ask me a couple of times.
It gets loud.

581
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:49,290
You feel like that a speaker feedback
situation or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:53,490
So I was like, ah man, I don't know where
to go with this right now. All right man.

583
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:58,080
Just stop ruining my shot.
Next water. No, go to Fiji.

584
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,750
Just jump ahead to Fiji. Yeah,
this is dog shit too. Yeah,

585
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,320
we just put the dog shit out
there to remind them that
they make dogs your water.

586
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:08,670
But this one, oh this is garbage. This is
that. They put that all over the place.

587
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:11,790
Like I feel if you're like
getting her high g model chick,

588
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,880
you product place with Ascensia.
Yes.

589
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,100
That's very specific and
accurate. Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,300
They have like a real
online marketing strategy.

591
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:25,080
I feel like that one we learned that the
Ph stuff is nonsense. Bullshit. Yeah.

592
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:28,830
Martin Risa is a American is Waterstone,
Yay.

593
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,530
Of German descent. Of course. Um,

594
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,320
but Martin taught us a lot and
one of the things you've told us,

595
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,800
you know how when you Fiji

596
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,510
there's like a silkiness to it on
your roof. Like, that's the mineral,

597
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,790
I think it's called Silica.
Silica or you could feel it.

598
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,223
Yeah,

599
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,190
it's smooth. That's minerals, man.

600
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:54,020
That's silica and that is delicious.
And that leads us to our next question.

601
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,260
Fedex or ups,
Fedex or ups.

602
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,960
Fedex, you know, like not,

603
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:07,650
I've been next day and some stuff
lately and every time I hit the FedEx,

604
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,450
I feel like in New York you hit a
FedEx like every third or fourth door.

605
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,570
Yeah. So it's just in that, you
know, I mean ups, I'm always like,

606
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:19,630
are we fucking really doing this right
now? I agree. It's such a third world. No,

607
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,650
I don't think it's, I don't know
if I've every been funding into a,

608
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,570
Fedex has the u s on lock,

609
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,550
but then you go international maybe with
ups or what's the DHL? They do that.

610
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:36,930
Like DHL ships on the Zimbabwe.
You better do it to DHL.

611
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:42,270
Fedex is really got it down here.
Yeah. Yeah. I don't fuck with ups. No.

612
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,403
You know what I mean?

613
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,363
Yeah.

614
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,670
All right.
Are we moving on

615
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,570
is real bullshit,
but it's crap.

616
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,690
The reason I bring it up is
that it's brilliant marketing.

617
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,100
It's probably in the running for the dog,

618
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,230
shittiest of the dog shit waters.

619
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,000
And we learned a lot about
this from Martin as well.
It's like triple distilled,

620
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,830
which means it's stripped of all
minerals. So again, it's like,

621
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,130
you know, I don't know. He might
as well drink pool water. Right.

622
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,050
Do you like straws?

623
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,730
Well, you know straws. I feel like there's
a lot of bad PR with straws right now.

624
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,180
I feel like I'm a bad
person if I use a straw.

625
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:29,520
But then at the same time I wouldn't,
you know,

626
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,080
like the metal Straw situation and the
substitute, like who has time for that?

627
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:35,310
Those you do? I do at the house, yeah.

628
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:38,400
But then I have veneer so I'm always
afraid they're going to chip arm or

629
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:41,910
claiming. Yeah. But then do you have
to like think ahead and plan, you know,

630
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,260
like a straw, so impulsive, like there's
just a million straws on the counter.

631
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:49,650
You just grab the Straub when
you're drinking something.
Yeah, I have him in the,

632
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:53,670
in the cupboard, bunch washed, ready
to go. Yeah. And I just pawn down,

633
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:56,760
put it in my smoothie, whatever. See,
I know I'd have a hard time doing that.

634
00:40:56,761 --> 00:41:00,780
But then at the same time Strawser good
because I feel like I have bad teeth.

635
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:05,310
Like I feel on a genetic level really.
Parents handed down bad TC that smile.

636
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:07,350
How are they bad? No, I think I'm like,

637
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,340
but I think I'm just like a on a cavity
level. Like I feel like I get 'em

638
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,720
they're just, they're softer and
weaker than most people's teeth,

639
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,280
but a straw it'll help, you know, cause
like if you're drinking something straw,

640
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,430
it'll bypass the teeth. You know,
you don't take on that contact.

641
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,310
Do you use Sensodyne sensitive?

642
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:29,280
Not just a straight crest three d,
You know,

643
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,550
I'm very be stripping your
teeth even more. Really.

644
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,070
I would argue you should switch to a

645
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,070
sensitive tooth paste like
a Sensodyne. Well, I'm sold.
Yeah, no, that's dope. Shit.

646
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,370
I feel like your Straw wise,
I feel like there's some type of like,

647
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,380
so you know how like basically
a few months ago there
was like the real big push

648
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:50,190
back on the straws and you started,
they started to like,

649
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:54,330
we're going to take straws
away. Starbucks. Uh, I
went into the one of these,

650
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:57,260
so I go every day to one. And
one of them was like, oh yeah,

651
00:41:57,261 --> 00:42:00,270
there's probably not gonna be Straw as
soon. So now they're doing, uh, for,

652
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,010
for ice drinks, for cold
drinks, a lid with an open.

653
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,540
And I was like, well, I just
go like, well, this is just
the new reality, you know,

654
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,450
I just like, this is what it is. Like
we're all becoming children. I mean, I,

655
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:15,320
and I just kind of was annoyed, but I was
like, you know what, I, it's not that bad.

656
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,240
And then the next week they're like,
not a straws again. I was like,

657
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:23,150
what happened? And I was like,
people must have been like, fuck you.

658
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:27,740
I'm not not using a straw. Right. Just
it went away like immediately. Yeah.

659
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:31,640
I Dunno. They were basically
announced that, no, you're a child.

660
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:34,330
And then people were like,
no, I'm not. Okay. Well,

661
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,470
I like when the people when it back.
Yeah. You know. All right. Christina,

662
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,660
what water you want to go
through a straw, I guess? Well.

663
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,580
I'm a huge fan of Avion.

664
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,900
I would argue with all these waters
and this is the highest quality.

665
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:51,650
I like the taste. I will pay the extra
money in the airport. It's a drink.

666
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Also a specific taste if you really, I
feel like we grew up on it. Really? Yeah.

667
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:01,220
You grew up on this. Wow.
Damn. A lot of money.

668
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,350
I didn't grow up on this shit.
Okay. Offset. We'll call him on.

669
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:06,920
You're talking about dog town hot ones.

670
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,620
I feel like it's a good water but water
champ or are you going to bark this one

671
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,700
down? Excuse me? Are you referring
to him as a minor? My bad.

672
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:20,600
You saw the eye contact. Wow.
Looking when he said that. Wow,

673
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,300
and guess what? Guess what? We
have a new water champ bottle.

674
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:27,170
It's in the store now.

675
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,380
Go to emerge method.com/thompson garage
and look up the new water champ bottle

676
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,530
where you can pretend to be
the water champ in your house.

677
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:40,040
Just like she pretends to him. Pretend
water champion. Watch the footage.

678
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:43,700
Watch every episode of this show. I'm
constantly drinking more water. Your town

679
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,410
might smell sad.
What does she say

680
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,190
about that now?

681
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,990
Do you feel like here you
are this good looking guy,

682
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,720
you're making money,
you're getting famous,

683
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:03,610
more famous everyday you're in this
relationship. How dumb does that for you?

684
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,260
But I don't know. I feel like
I'm, I'm playing up in that.

685
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,250
I feel like if you,

686
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,600
if you pulled a hundred people
and you showed a picture of,

687
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,210
of me and,
and go ahead and put all the stats,

688
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:20,900
go ahead and put the resume there
and then you throw one up of her.

689
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,170
I bet 96 out of 100 are going to say
he's lucky to be with her or not.

690
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:28,220
She's lucky to be,
yeah,

691
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,160
I bet it would be like in the nineties
the nineties your lady, what's going

692
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,461
on?

693
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:36,720
Who is Shama Fram Onoway and know what
our first date was actually at your guys'

694
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:37,800
show.
Yeah,

695
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:43,070
the store let the end of
the commedia and yeah,

696
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,330
yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And she's
a fan actually. You know what?

697
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:52,470
She likes the, she likes the eighties mom
bit. No, a lot of people do. Right now.

698
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:56,790
I'm going to have to expand on that.
It's cool. So what's her story?

699
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:00,690
What does she until uh, she does
like this sort of thing to not, um,

700
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,100
not comedy podcasting,

701
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:07,101
but she does like OnAir hosting red
carpets and so she's very pretty,

702
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:10,320
she's got to be stunning to
do that kind of stuff. Yeah.

703
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:14,520
She was like a Laker girl.
Miss California. See now
you now you will end jeans.

704
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:19,460
Really not, you'd walk it back though, you
know a town, you know. Hold on, hold on.

705
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,090
I want to look up. I'm sorry
about what I said. Laker girl.

706
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,550
So she saw a Lotta these, I'm
assuming. I don't know. I don't know,

707
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,530
but allowed to. I don't think so.
I think that, I think that, uh,

708
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,510
are you reading about the cheerleading
and stuff that's coming out? You know,

709
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,840
I feel like it's, it's such a tough
job. Like they don't get paid.

710
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:43,500
They have to pay their own.
Uber's out to like whatever our home,

711
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,930
they have to go shake hands
ad or whatever. You know,

712
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:48,810
I think it's a tough gig being a
cheerleader. And then I think, yeah,

713
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:53,190
if you like talk to somebody on the team,
you're, you're, you're out of there. Wow.

714
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,110
I think it's like that.
That's crazy

715
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,090
to a Laker game. And, and this is not too
long. It was like a couple months ago.

716
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,740
And first of all,

717
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:10,550
this is somebody who together
15 years basically, right? Yeah.

718
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,190
Sports, zero interest, no games.
Like never. She's like, oh,

719
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,610
you're watching a game. Just walks
away. I take her to the Laker game.

720
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:23,200
She's got a pool of drool on her shirt.
Her mouth is open and she's like,

721
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,200
she's like, she's licking her lips and
then we get in the car. She's like,

722
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:30,280
I really liked his Laker games. And I
was like, Oh yeah. She was like all the,

723
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:35,281
and they're so big and strong and you
can see everything and the shorts.

724
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,330
And I was like, okay. And we couldn't
see enough. And the shorts, yeah,

725
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,283
yeah,

726
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,800
yeah,

727
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,250
yeah. That was, you want to tell
him what happened that night.

728
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:53,080
Oh, and then so then she
was like, anyways, the next
Laker game you can set up,

729
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,820
that'd be great. And I'm like, okay,

730
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,810
I'll keep it in mind that that's your
new favorite activity next morning.

731
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:02,470
She's like, guess what? I had a dream
about. I was like, what? She goes,

732
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,390
I dreamt that I was with you,
but instead of you having what you have,

733
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,540
you had a big black cock. And I'm
like, whoa. But he had a big black dog.

734
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,600
Yeah, it was cool. She was like,

735
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,680
okay, so how long have you been
with this lady? So, I dunno.

736
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,470
I think that show would have been like,
I don't know,

737
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,720
like 10 months ago or something. Yeah.
That was really your first date. Yeah.

738
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,960
And I remember he was texting me, you're
like, oh, it's sold out. No, I know.

739
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:36,160
But that's,
but that was,

740
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,510
I think he made me look cool because
then you put my name on the list and then

741
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,870
do the comedy store's credit. They're
very old school that way, you know,

742
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,670
they're very, like, these
are toms guests, you know?

743
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:48,400
And then like three people come down
from the ceiling and they're like, oh,

744
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,250
let me show you your seat. You know?
So it's nice. You know, like they're,

745
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:55,720
they're very, uh, they're very cool that
way. And then we, uh, went backstage.

746
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,370
Okay.

747
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,300
Member. Yeah. Yeah.

748
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,970
We went backstage and we chatted for
a little bit and then Hannibal rolled

749
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:05,050
through with Thundercat. Yeah.
It was a good, it was a good,

750
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:09,290
I was just telling him dire state.
I've been like, yeah, you looked super

751
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,460
slender cats album on repeat. That
was what you asked me yesterday. Yeah.

752
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,980
What is it? Because you've been on a loop
for, I dunno how long. I'm such an idiot.

753
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,810
Oh, sorry. I was just saying that like,

754
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,170
I've been listening to that album
on a loop for a year and a half.

755
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,460
And then when I met thunder cat, I had
no idea who he was. I was like, hey man,

756
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,770
and then I just walk out of here.

757
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:37,030
It's true that southern famous
singer were in there, beautiful girl.

758
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:38,740
And Hannibal was with them.
And I was like,

759
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:43,730
what do you guys do like for musicians?
And I was like super famous. Oh No,

760
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:48,610
you are. Yeah. No, that's a, that was par
for the course. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay.

761
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,220
That's cool. Yeah. Just coming
full circle married. Yeah.

762
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,090
How it'd be pop the question stuff.
Jesus.

763
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,230
Why don't you fucking lay off
a little bit? I love it. I
can't wait. Hot seat. Yeah.

764
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,450
Yeah man.
All this shit away from my face.

765
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:04,600
How many seasons are we into a
hot ones now? Eight. Eight season.

766
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:08,860
Eight finishing in a couple of months.
150 episodes.

767
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,310
Can you announce anybody that's coming up
or no. Is that like top secret? I don't,

768
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,910
I don't really care. The only thing is
like, fans get sold like Wah Blah, blah,

769
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:20,040
blah, like when they're like
looking for a, their episode. Um,

770
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:20,861
but I don't really care.

771
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:23,700
I think so this week we're
dropping Billie Eilish next week.

772
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,030
Shack.
Hmm.

773
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,120
Wow, man. That's got a big one.

774
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,810
That's where I live with Shawn.

775
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,340
Can you imagine?
Imagine that though on Tom's body.

776
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,420
I know what dreams are made of when,
when?

777
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:48,520
Funny question to ask you that.
Okay, fine. Any questions?

778
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,870
Yeah.
And the

779
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,860
Theo van after that. Yeah. And then

780
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,470
we shot one with Chelsea
handler. Oh, good. There you
go. It was good. It was fun.

781
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,850
I like. Um, I liked it by the way that you
keep the comics in the game. Thank you.

782
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:08,720
Bad. Like you've had the, you have the big
movie stars and then you have athletes,

783
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:10,640
rappers.
But I love as comics.

784
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:14,270
I love that you keep comics in the loop
and I think that's just good for a show

785
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:17,480
to just cranking the cops,
you know, like people,

786
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:21,350
I think sometimes people want like a very
specific kind of viewer experience all

787
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:21,651
the time.

788
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:25,370
But I think that that's what makes it
good as when it's like this sort of island

789
00:50:25,371 --> 00:50:26,390
of misfit toys,

790
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:30,140
you kind of know what expect but at the
same time don't know to expect a week

791
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:30,801
over week thing.

792
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,830
So thank you for saying that because we
take a lot of pride in that. Absolutely.

793
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,860
Yeah. And then we booked
like a big finale today.

794
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,940
I'll keep that hush for now
and then and then and then we,

795
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,890
and then the show is, so I did, I did.
That's a good one. Yeah. And then,

796
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:50,360
and then we'll take like a couple of
weeks off. I was fair to you after,

797
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,250
I guess the NFP and then,
um,

798
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,170
and then we'll take just a couple of weeks
off and do it again. You know, it's on,

799
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,480
it's on fire, you know. Thank you.
I appreciate that. And there's a,

800
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,700
you guys are actually, you have
hot sauce out there. What's game?

801
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,540
Yeah, yeah. I show.
Can I bring you a gift?

802
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,390
Yes. Oh my gosh. That's awesome.
We use hot sauce. Oh, snails,

803
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,310
plastic hot sauce. Got The classic. Bam.

804
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,700
What else we got here?
We got the lowest Kelly and just

805
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,303
the way

806
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,200
he would have been. Oh,
last DAB that, you know,

807
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,300
this makes you go caca and your pumps.

808
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,930
The last Dab. I love it. Yes. Twila pain.

809
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,340
When you do the show, that's what you
throw on the last week. You want to die,

810
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,290
go for it. And then you'd
do it. So it's here. My,

811
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:54,920
it's funny to watch. I think that's the
best part is watching people react to,

812
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,470
that's half the find is like,
oh my God.

813
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:02,420
And it's watching famous people hurt is
pretty funny, right? Because I think too,

814
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,000
uh, it's, that's the
most common man thing,

815
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:07,700
like celebrity is inherently
this unobtainable thing.

816
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,920
And it's like everyone's always
trying to make these like,

817
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:12,260
what's it like to have a beer
with them shows, you know,

818
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:15,920
but like really the most common
man thing is dying on hot sauce.

819
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:16,790
It's like something that's like,

820
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:22,130
nobody knows and it's like the only legal
way to like physically harm someone.

821
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:26,720
It's, it's such a great
concept and it is like this,

822
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,260
it's relatable in a weird way, right?
Yeah, exactly. Like you're like,

823
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:34,040
I know what it's like to eat something
spicy and then to see the different

824
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:37,760
levels of suffering is like
amusing and entertaining too.

825
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,990
And that's been such a, an
education for me because, um,

826
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,730
now that I'm thrown into this world,

827
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:47,060
it's not like I was some hot sauce guy
or chili pepper guy before all this

828
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:50,270
happened. But it is crazy. The
range people have, you know,

829
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:54,080
some people can eat a curry and it's fine.
It's just chill.

830
00:52:54,081 --> 00:52:57,770
They might as well be eating cereal and
then some people like one bite and they

831
00:52:57,771 --> 00:53:01,720
completely start to melt down. You know,
so that's even interest tolerances.

832
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,620
It's incredible all over the place. Yeah.
People really, some of them, you know,

833
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,300
if you, if your life is spent eating
certain foods, it's like you can't yeah,

834
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:14,270
you can get there. Yeah. You can't
even scare them. Right. And even now,

835
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:17,930
like having done this so frequently,
like now I can, you know,

836
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,990
the tolerance is definitely gone up.
Are you sure?

837
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,520
You know when I was in Korea
I would go eat in the more

838
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,810
authentic, you said Korea,
Korea. I would train myself.

839
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:32,460
I would order Soondubu in there,

840
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:35,820
hot as soups and I would just blow it out.

841
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:39,270
I get like diarrhea every day and then
by the time I came back to the states,

842
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,610
did you see me eat? I should. All
the time Korean food came cheating.

843
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,200
I would say 2012 but I
don't get diarrhea anymore.

844
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:53,070
You can really train yourself.
Your biology completely flips.

845
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,850
How has this work going to ask? Doctor
drew this question? You don't know him.

846
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,470
It starts with a B last
name with a k because it be
alcohol, drink, drink, drink,

847
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,810
drink, drink. Nothing happens. He's fine.

848
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,400
He can drive one of the most
racist Faddis you've heard of him?

849
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:19,560
[inaudible] hot wings though.
Is that it is a, it's sadistic.

850
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:21,420
When you want to hurt
yourself or masochistic.

851
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:25,890
I always forget how to say
it as to which one anyways.

852
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:28,170
It's self punishment going into it.

853
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,710
Is it masochism when you hurt your
baby and I love him. I know anything,

854
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,280
I don't know.

855
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,120
But it's like you looked like you'd know
you're really into that stuff but you

856
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:42,930
order it just to punish herself.
You know it's like the most,

857
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:44,790
it's the most bizarre
meal and I do it a lot.

858
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:48,120
Like I eat them a lot in airports and
stuff. Do you like working on planes?

859
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,050
I'm like,
why am I doing this?

860
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,950
I throw a hot sauce sometimes when I
don't want hot sauce because it's offered,

861
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,160
I order a lie, a lot of eggs and
on the road and they're like,

862
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:59,630
you want a hot sauce? And in my mind
I'm like that really? I'd be like, Yup.

863
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,110
And then I don't know.
And then like sometimes I'll be like,

864
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:07,080
that's not enough hot sauce and bottle
and drown it. And then I'll be like,

865
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,650
this is going to hurt. And then I
eat them like off, everything hurts.

866
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:11,490
Now my stomach hurts.

867
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,860
Do you ever catch a buzz off
it in a weird way, right?

868
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:21,780
It's like a high catch, a little high.
Sometimes. I like it to hurt my mouth.

869
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,710
If it's sour too. I love sour.
I'm like, oh fucking burns.

870
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,770
I love to,
I hit you up about this stuff.

871
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,390
I love studying the
business of, of, you know,

872
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,610
we do like entertain, I love the
numbers on the phone and I, you know,

873
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,390
as soon as you owe that Gordon
Ramsay, uh, episode, uh,

874
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,530
blew up. Yeah. You know,

875
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,160
I was hitting you up like you believe
this shit cause I was excited for,

876
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:50,430
you know, it's crazy too
because, uh, you know,

877
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,490
from the time that we put up the first
episode with Gordon Rate or without

878
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:55,170
Gordon Ramsay first episode ever,
everyone's like,

879
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:56,190
Gordon Ramsay has gotta get on the show.

880
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,170
He got to have Gordon Ramsey on the show.
And then like,

881
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:01,830
that pressure was so loud all the time.
Like every tweet,

882
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:03,300
people would respond to it as like,

883
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,570
when's Gordon Ramsey on the show
and my ige comments, like whatever.

884
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:11,280
So there was so much pressure that like
forced us both in the room together and

885
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:14,580
then you feel like you have
these ridiculous expectations
for it. But we're like,

886
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:17,550
all right, well we'll just going to throw
the kitchen sink at them. Just try to,

887
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,210
um, you know, just make this just
the most outrageous experience.

888
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,070
Then he went to Bristol farms
and like picked up all that stuff

889
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,790
that he was like using like the lemon
and lime juice. Did donuts. Yeah.

890
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:30,370
And he's just like fighting
off the spice that way.

891
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:34,210
He was really aggressive with it.
And we'll, the Brits, the Brits are,

892
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,460
they have like a real aversion.

893
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,760
Their palates very bland.

894
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:42,400
Every person from the UK that we've
ever had on the show has always been

895
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:46,630
struggle city. Yeah. Cause I run
Russell brand funny to see him.

896
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,460
I mean it was like doughnut bite
every, like the sweet, you know,

897
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,170
it came from an educated place to, as
a, as a highly trained to showman level.

898
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,660
I A showman level. Um, but the other
thing that's fascinating is like,

899
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,220
obviously I know he's super
famous, you know, like, you know,

900
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:07,780
he's a well known person, but to see
that response to that degree is like,

901
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,750
I got excited just seeing
that response mean to like,

902
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:14,020
we'd never had anything that crazy,
you know,

903
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:18,130
like we knew we'd drop it and it
would do well. Like we knew that,

904
00:57:18,131 --> 00:57:21,760
but the way that people just took
with like the way people took off,

905
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:25,570
I don't know, probably like 30 million
or something. Isn't that fascinating?

906
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,610
That's crazy, man. It's wild. It's great.

907
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,500
Good for you. Yeah. So crazy. That
is crazy, man. That is, that's nuts.

908
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,630
Um, eh. Oh, do you wish
you were taller? Yeah,

909
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,960
I think like if I think about
things I'd change about myself,

910
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,890
adding two or three inches would probably
be in the top five. Yeah. I would love,

911
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,840
I think I would take six to and just be
like, how tall are you? Are you six foot?

912
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,720
Yeah. I'm like right at it, you know?

913
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,770
But I feel like six two would be like,
you know,

914
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,540
you're like one of these
guys who's like six, eight,

915
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:04,240
you just like a fucking monster
walking around and you don't want that.

916
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:06,420
Especially if you can't
ball then you'll know.

917
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:09,820
Then it's like your hand is way over
there. Like how would you even control?

918
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:13,390
I've got one. Okay. Would you rather
be taller or have your peanut B Baker?

919
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,770
What's up with how dissatisfied are,

920
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:21,350
I'm just asking.
It's just rather

921
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,580
your answer for me.

922
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,430
I'm just thinking because I was just
thinking women don't want to be taller.

923
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,610
Generally. I don't want to
be tolerant guy. Absolutely.

924
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,080
I wish I had a smaller boobs,
but I could buy that.

925
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,170
What would you want from me?
What would you want from me?

926
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,330
What would you want from me? For,
for you? For me? Yeah. Perfect.

927
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,240
I don't want anything that's called
a wife John. I wouldn't want,

928
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:53,380
why would you want taller or a bigger
pener taller. I feel like I feel good.

929
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,990
I'm like a Dick level. I feel good.
Like I feel like I just have like,

930
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,700
like one you draw.
Like I feel like it's very like,

931
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,590
like what they'd sell in the
store, you know? It's very,

932
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,870
it's like factory standard and I
feel good about it. And then a,

933
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,530
it's nice,
but then yeah,

934
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,620
I would like to get taller.
What do you want?

935
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:19,360
Would you like to have like hair,
like surfer dude hair?

936
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,010
You know what? I don't have, I
don't if I would either. I don't

937
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,510
know. Like, like people are
like, oh, you know, you're like,

938
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,280
we have a similar thing going on.
Right? Yeah. And You keep it close.

939
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,740
It doesn't bother me in the least same.

940
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:33,560
And I kinda like it the way that
I cut through the air, you know,

941
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:36,170
the way I feel the breeze, you
know, it's, it doesn't perspective.

942
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,310
I actually liked the way it looks. I
don't think I'm in the dance. I'm good.

943
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,820
I mean if somebody told me like,
Hey, would you rather be like,

944
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,330
like her perfect physique or taller,
that's one where I'd be like,

945
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,090
perfect physical. I'd take perfect
physical cause he can, I can I, you know,

946
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:53,360
I made it this far. I don't,
I don't obsess about the
height. Whatever. Who can I,

947
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,370
I'm sorry.
Were you going to say no,

948
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,460
I was just going to say
I wish I had awesome.

949
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,980
Do you wish I had like another
couple inches down here

950
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,890
in a movie?
So little more growth credit.

951
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,680
Kind of like the water bottle
where you're like, okay,

952
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,360
okay, I got this from a movie
I get. Again, I can't take
credit for it. Would you,

953
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,840
would you trade five years of your life?

954
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:28,280
You lose five years of your life to be
in perfect shape to have like a model's

955
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:29,114
body.

956
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:34,380
Even hesitate on that five off the end.
Um,

957
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,970
I'm not going to tell you which
five could be five prime years.

958
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,210
I'm going to take five prime years.
How does this work?

959
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,770
They've just go into a coma or whatever
and then you can like take away 30,

960
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:49,130
you go to sleep at 30, you wake
up 35 and that's, that's a coma.

961
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:54,200
Sure I'd take it, but your body's
Rad. Like you, you look perfect.

962
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:58,910
There your whole life. I think
I'd take that. Take those
years gone. Yeah. Fuck it.

963
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,850
Yeah.
Now check out right now.

964
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,250
Where do I sign it and then I'll
just come back and you're like,

965
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:05,870
the boys are in school.
They're doing well.

966
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,480
Your children's lives just for the first
five years, nothing important happening.

967
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,080
I'll come back to like, who are you?
I'm like, your dad, who was Lebron?

968
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:17,914
And I'm like,

969
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,840
oh my God. Yeah. Okay.
What about you? Yeah.

970
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,700
You check out. Yeah. I don't give
a shit. If someone were to be like,

971
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,230
now because of my children,

972
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,910
like if you go back to being like 30
to 35 fuck those years. Yeah. Take Em.

973
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:41,450
Fuck those years, those years you've got
married. Don't care. Don't care. But I,

974
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:45,260
you know, when you come to the realization
like I just have in your brain,

975
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:48,200
you always have the hope that one
day you'll have a perfect body.

976
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,440
I'm going to work out and
I'm going to look perfect.

977
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,890
It's never going to happen for me. But
you finally, are you there, right? Yeah.

978
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,460
Like I had that realization this
morning. I was like, oh, this is,

979
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,880
this is all racked today.

980
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,280
But you had the realization that this
is as good as it's gonna get. This is,

981
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,220
this is it. I had two children.
The, this has ravaged, this is gone.

982
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,740
You feel like it's all downhill from here?
Absolutely.

983
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,440
I mean I'm going to maintain and do plot
these twice a week and I'm going to eat

984
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:18,350
well, it's not going to get
great. It's what I'm saying.

985
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,130
I'm never going to look like a model.

986
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,190
Yeah. You know what I mean? I kind of

987
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,380
do you still hold a delusion that you're
going to be how you look when you were

988
01:02:26,381 --> 01:02:31,060
20? Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. I think I get,

989
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:33,910
I think I do. Yeah. And then what
will happen is like, you know,

990
01:02:33,911 --> 01:02:38,130
you have like a couple of good
or decent naked days, like yeah,

991
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,910
you go to the show,
especially if it's like, uh,

992
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:44,080
worked out like three days in a row.
Yeah. And I just came from listening.

993
01:02:44,081 --> 01:02:45,870
So if the muscles are a little swollen,

994
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,510
like just like blood in them and you're
like, you know, this is pretty good.

995
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:54,040
And then maybe like a, you have a day
off and then the next day you're like,

996
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,710
how did my body go to shit in a day?
You feel like,

997
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:00,340
I mean it must be obviously
all in your head, but like
I'll feel like, oh no, it's,

998
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:01,450
it's back to shit again.

999
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,900
But maybe it makes it kind
of lazy sometimes I feel
like it does that where I'm

1000
01:03:04,901 --> 01:03:09,040
like, Oh, well I could snap this back
in at any time, so fuck it. You know,

1001
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:14,140
now I feel like I'm, I'm pretty far
from it being even decent, you know.

1002
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,170
No, no, it's good. That's good. That's
nice. You're a nice guy. I mean, no baby.

1003
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:24,000
You are. You're beautiful. Beautiful to
me. Thanks man. You're a handsome man.

1004
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:29,250
Appreciate it. I'm on, I'm in movies.
You are, you're in perfect. I love him.

1005
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:36,090
I just booked another mood.
It's not a PT now. All my parts,

1006
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:40,680
by the way, in the last I just
booked apart. I did three last year.

1007
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,510
The parts were like
obnoxious brother-in-law,

1008
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:49,320
a corrupt city councilman.
Yes.

1009
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:54,180
Corrupt police officer and
coming up, uh, corrupt.

1010
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,240
Uh,
or like asshole tech guy.

1011
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,460
The family one with Mark Walton.
That's, that's good. He's just tall.

1012
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,460
It's got a good rotten tomatoes though
town that does it pretty well. Right?

1013
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,290
But I've told you this, that you're
going to flourish as an asshole.

1014
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:12,320
You're character is asshole.
My style. You're good at it.

1015
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,260
But that's what he's good at. Camino.
Yeah. She goes, you know what your key is?

1016
01:04:15,261 --> 01:04:16,790
You know the way you've said it
to me? She goes, you know what?

1017
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:20,060
You're really going to really do well
in and I'll be like, what? She goes,

1018
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,360
you're a fucking scumbag. You
scumbag. She's like, you're a, well,

1019
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:28,070
she knows he's a shows casting.
Yeah. Aesthetic like, you know,

1020
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:30,860
you don't know how you look.
You look like a scumbag.

1021
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,600
Homeless, degenerate. You married this.

1022
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:42,800
I love it. Well, why do you
think, who are my types? Yeah,

1023
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:44,310
she likes Benicia and
I'll tell you what I mean.

1024
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:48,110
So what's the guy with his dick in
the girl's mouth? Vincent Gallo. Ah,

1025
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,490
I like crazy homeless, looking
smelly. Lifterlms all catcher.

1026
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,380
I'll catch her at a stoplight
looking at a homeless,

1027
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,990
kind of licks her lips a little bit.
I'm like, oh, stop. It was like, oh,

1028
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:04,430
he needs a hand stop. No, his legs. Sean,

1029
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:07,280
do you ever play this game when you're
on an airplane and people are filing

1030
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:11,370
passed you? Um, when you see a woman,
do you go like, that could be I,

1031
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,500
I think I could love her.

1032
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,770
And then you find something
immediately wrong with her or like,

1033
01:05:15,771 --> 01:05:18,280
could that be my spouse? And
then you go, no, I'm because

1034
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,590
she's got like her hair is
parted poorly or three toe rings.

1035
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,380
Yeah.

1036
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:28,330
I think I am like a people watcher foyer
at heart and sometimes I find myself

1037
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:32,290
staring at someone and then trying to
think about what it would be like to walk

1038
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,420
a mile in their shoes or something.
Yeah.

1039
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:37,660
I start to like wonder what
they're like or how, you know,

1040
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:41,770
if I see somebody walking by carrying
bags of stuff, I'm like, you know,

1041
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,200
how did they end up in this position in
their life where they're carrying those

1042
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:48,040
bags on this street and stuff.
And then I find myself thinking about it,

1043
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:52,870
I think a little bit more
than your average person,
your average walker by would,

1044
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:57,460
you know? Yeah. But I don't
do that specifically in the
plane. I'm not like, oh,

1045
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,430
I could marry that person. Then trying
to find something to disqualify that.

1046
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,150
Oh that's pristine. And saying, that's
my game. I think I could love me.

1047
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,170
I can never love you.
And then I'll find a superficial reason.

1048
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,270
Do you find yourself going a rooting for
who's going to sit next to you and all

1049
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,570
these all the time and praying.
It's not that person,

1050
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,830
but it's always that person
that smelling next year.

1051
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,340
So I've got to ask you this
because it seemed like,

1052
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:25,580
I actually think you have the best
gig going in entertainment. You know,

1053
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:29,840
it's like such an awesome job and the
show keeps getting better and the,

1054
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:32,630
you know, they get, it's like, it
feels like it's a perfect gig. Right.

1055
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,091
You know,

1056
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:38,950
and a lot of ways it is everything that
I always wanted and it's a small team,

1057
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,640
you know? And every time
I talked to somebody else
who's doing some other thing,

1058
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,050
I popped the hood on it and I realize
like I'm happy that I'm in my lane doing

1059
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:51,700
my thing and nine that lane doing
that thing all the time. Uh,

1060
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,690
it's labor intensive.
Obviously we travel so much.

1061
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:58,390
There's so much research built into it.
Uh,

1062
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:02,230
the postproduction in the show plus like
the frequency with which we like crank

1063
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:03,070
these things out,

1064
01:07:03,071 --> 01:07:07,230
which the edit is like the key one of
the most amazing components. Thank you.

1065
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,470
Yeah,
I appreciate it.

1066
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:11,830
We worked so hard on that because I
kinda just want everyone watching it to

1067
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:15,130
really feel that pain in those moments.
You know,

1068
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:19,420
like I always think like the evolution
of it is some imax experience where like

1069
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,170
they spit out the water and you get like
sprayed with water or something. Like,

1070
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:26,860
I always think like it could be bigger
than that. Some sort of like oculus rift,

1071
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,491
you know,

1072
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:31,630
a experiential thing is like when I look
into the future and think about what

1073
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,840
the show could be or whatever.
Um, but there is the wings,

1074
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:39,130
there is constantly eating death wings,
you know, it given a take. Yeah. Okay.

1075
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:40,630
That's the part I get.
But I feel like

1076
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,730
most too, like the part
where I go, you know,

1077
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:47,630
there's gotta be either it's floated
to you or it's in your own mind like,

1078
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:52,070
well then you know the TV show, the
talk show, right. It's a natural,

1079
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:56,750
you'd be a total obviously natural host
at it. Thank you. But then you go like,

1080
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,380
you know, and you know, maybe
there's a time and a place for that,

1081
01:08:00,381 --> 01:08:05,120
but I feel like every time like for us
will, you know, be like, oh, you know,

1082
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:07,520
you need to be doing TV and more,
you know,

1083
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:12,530
stuff that like traditional shows
closer, you are around it. You're like,

1084
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,780
oh, there's so much shit
you have to deal with.

1085
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,070
And then we come here and we're like,

1086
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,510
oh,
we get to do whatever we want,

1087
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,790
bring out stupid water bottles and the
crazy club, no one tells us anything.

1088
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,380
That's the thing,

1089
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:28,380
kind of the great gig and I think too
is we've made this team like as we've

1090
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,370
conquered every single
day added to this team.

1091
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:35,180
So now I love everybody that's
around me and yeah, creatively,

1092
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,880
there's nobody who's going to get
them my way about anything. You know,

1093
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:42,860
like I could die on any hill that I want
to and I feel supported by the people

1094
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:47,861
that are on the team and I'm really proud
of the show and what we do and the way

1095
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:51,530
that it's just sort of done laps and laps
and laps around everyone's expectation

1096
01:08:51,531 --> 01:08:54,500
and then just completely changes
your whole perspective on everything.

1097
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:57,230
So all of those ways, like, you know,

1098
01:08:57,231 --> 01:09:00,380
you kind of want to soak
in this moment and uh,

1099
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:05,000
stay on track with it and maybe even try
to help that train go higher and faster.

1100
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,760
Uh, but yeah, I think about that all
the time because people, you know,

1101
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:11,360
like whatever, my agent or like whoever,
they'll always be like, oh, what's next?

1102
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:12,980
What's next? What's
next? You know? Or like,

1103
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:15,440
that's just people and that's like nature.
And I'm like,

1104
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:19,130
I kinda just wanna this is tightened my
grip. Yeah. And just this thing right now,

1105
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:23,370
especially if you've got a successful
thing, ride the fuck out of me. I know,

1106
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,720
but don't you feel like people
are always like, well yes, let's

1107
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,850
do I want to rip all the cords out and
try to put it into something else and

1108
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:35,600
then try to get this whole thing
back? Like, yeah, fuck no, no.

1109
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,120
It's the silliest thing. If you find
lightening in a bottle, which he,

1110
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:43,340
you clearly have and people want to
watch it, just keep doing it right.

1111
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,750
And people show up. So I'm like,
what do I want to fuck? Yeah,

1112
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,880
but love the people fucking that Mia fund
that people like our fanatics for hot

1113
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:55,150
ones and, and people like, you know,

1114
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:59,720
I've experienced the people coming
up to me just from being on hot once.

1115
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:03,560
It's like, you know, and they'll
quote lines from it and yeah,

1116
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,210
yeah I get emails about it and you
know people and the they love that.

1117
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:09,140
They love that.

1118
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:13,310
Like I brought up trick daddy cause then
they're like you not only were guests

1119
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:17,180
but you clearly had been watching the
show and that trick daddy episode is like

1120
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:20,780
a super debt to me is the
most underrated episode ever.

1121
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:23,660
It's not like this coin amz
like tens of millions of views,

1122
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:27,140
but it's arguably like one of our
best interviews and check daddy.

1123
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:29,540
What I love about it is when
he first got there, he wasn't,

1124
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:34,570
he didn't know what hot ones was looking
at it like how are we rolling like

1125
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:35,060
that.

1126
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:40,060
But then you kind of see his shoulders
drop and he just falls into the show so

1127
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:42,080
effortlessly.

1128
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,950
And then we're having this like deep
dive career spanning interview on Trick

1129
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:49,190
Daddy. And he started to
rock with it in that way.

1130
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,760
And then that acid in part that
you referenced is one of the,

1131
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,040
one of the moments we're most proud of at
the show. Barn away, eat a Buddha gang,

1132
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,260
eat a booty gang life.

1133
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,290
You seem like a pretty together person.

1134
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:06,910
Do Your parents support
your career? Yeah, uh,

1135
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,990
my job with the gifts he's given them now.

1136
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:12,890
It was a good Christmas
for my dad. But yeah, like

1137
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,700
they've always been super supportive.

1138
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,110
My mom passed away when
I was in high school,

1139
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:22,710
but my dad super supportive even like
coming out to New York cause at first it's

1140
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,890
like hard to explain even uh,
you know,

1141
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:29,190
he's not watching youtube and stuff
so he's like, oh you're going to do,

1142
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,370
you make a web talk show on
the Internet and you know,

1143
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:37,050
like the exactly a little bit like okay.
But he was super supportive and then,

1144
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:40,530
you know, once we got people like
Ricky Gervais' and the chair,

1145
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:41,790
once I did cold bear,

1146
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:45,480
like that was a big deal for him because
he was such a huge Letterman fan.

1147
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:48,720
So like that being in the same
theater and the Ed Sullivan Theater,

1148
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,700
that was like, it was like, oh
okay. Like bear to play your game.

1149
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:54,670
I know that was,

1150
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:58,470
you know when he spit milk on the stage
of the Ed Sullivan Theater. I was like,

1151
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,240
that was such the, it's such a
top of Mount Kilimanjaro from me,

1152
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:08,310
you know? That's awesome man. Now you're
originally from Chicago? Yes. We love,

1153
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:12,330
we were big fans of accent.
Chicargo. Have you noticed my drawl?

1154
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,170
You all like your professional
broadcasters? So smart.

1155
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:20,310
Did you go to a good college? I went to
a pretty good college. Where'd you go?

1156
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,070
University of Illinois. Yeah,
but you couldn't see ivy. Oh,

1157
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:26,340
we were just studying on the wire.
They get top dollar.

1158
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:32,160
I do. What did you study? Wait, Brian
Broadcast. Broadcast Journalism.

1159
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,590
Have they had you come back yet?
Well, I want to go back and yeah,

1160
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:42,480
they've kind of hinted at it and I get
like tagged and like the school's Twitter

1161
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,460
and stuff and then kids that work at
the newspaper. It's a buzzing thing.

1162
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,140
Same with like at my high school.
Well,

1163
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:54,141
what I think is weird is that I grew up
in a northwest suburb of Chicago and I

1164
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:59,790
see that the like local newspaper there,
they've never said a damn word about me.

1165
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,010
You know, like they, I
don't know, maybe, you know,

1166
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:05,970
like the hometown has never been like,
it's never even acknowledged it.

1167
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:10,230
But um, whatever. Like I'd love to
go back to University of Illinois.

1168
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:13,410
I think it's like, uh,
cause that would be cool.

1169
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:16,500
I think that if I were a student
there now and I watched the show,

1170
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:20,810
I think that that would be so cool. Yeah.
Like I think Hugh Hefner went there.

1171
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,820
Some good broadcast is I went to
u of a Roger Ebert and me will,

1172
01:13:26,431 --> 01:13:30,090
the accent is like the,
when someone has a hardcore act,

1173
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:32,600
like all types of were just
fascinated by it. Yeah. Yeah.

1174
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,550
But one thing that's really
interesting is if somebody,

1175
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,360
I don't know if you've ever heard,

1176
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,360
let's say somebody with a hardcore
Chicago accent who's actually really well

1177
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:46,200
educated.
It's a pretty amazing juxtaposition.

1178
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,120
So check out this guy speaking and just,
you know,

1179
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,080
just give us your thoughts

1180
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:56,310
reserve on Duis. San Joaquin
Delta. It's a, it's pretty amazing.

1181
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,250
It's nice to see too much of willows.

1182
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:03,251
You get their mesh of coast live oak
growing on the shore as much invasive

1183
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:05,820
blackberry brambles.
And despite the,

1184
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,880
the metastatic tumor of modern society,

1185
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,510
there's still a couple endangered
place which haven't been knocked out.

1186
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:18,590
I mean, this guy really knows tumor
and he's kind of philosophical work.

1187
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:23,690
It's not just about the plant life,
right? Yeah. Um, it's like that.

1188
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:28,440
You remember that Snl,
Chris Farley, uh, like the

1189
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:32,510
bears go bears dot bulls.

1190
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,980
He met Jordan 242 the rest of the guys.

1191
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:37,970
Six six.
Yeah.

1192
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,290
It wouldn't be antioxidants.

1193
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:43,510
Primrose and there's just supposed
to be a wallflower are risks,

1194
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:47,260
some of which is in a Brassica family
brand stick of fame. We might've,

1195
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,390
I think it might have bloomed already.
Dude,

1196
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:54,020
I've never heard anything
smart come out of that accent.

1197
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:59,750
Do you think he knows he's funny or do
you think he's just a second? I'm like,

1198
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:02,900
this guy thinks he's Farley in
the sketch and then I'm like, no,

1199
01:15:02,901 --> 01:15:04,910
I think this guy really just
knows this shit. And he's,

1200
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,600
he's one of these guys who's fascinated
by something. No one else's, you know,

1201
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:13,100
like he's really laying out what plants
are out there with enthusiasm I think is

1202
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:17,150
genuine, which makes it smart guy. The
towns down with the accent. Yeah, exactly.

1203
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:21,400
But like I love when somebody is
enthusiastic about something that was just

1204
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:24,740
fucking plants. He's like,
hold on a second, let me
give you the fucking details.

1205
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,650
He'll persuade you. Like know I'm
into it a little bit more. Right.

1206
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,480
When you guys play these clips,

1207
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:34,840
do the people in the clips ever
acknowledge sometimes guests

1208
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:43,580
ever reach? Yeah, like either that's
so funny or stop doing it sometimes.

1209
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:48,290
Like always a lot of people who you're
like, look at this fucking shit show.

1210
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,720
They're like, can I come
on? And they're like, no.

1211
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,670
And then the people who you're like,
I wish we could figure out this is,

1212
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,450
you never ever hear from the lens of
our desperate like king ass rapper.

1213
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,310
I don't know if you're
familiar with his work.

1214
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,760
He's a gentleman that farts
on food and eats the food,

1215
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:14,990
which we could find that guy. He's
another one. Like the elusive. Yeah,

1216
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:20,210
I mean it's another celebrity.
We'll never know. We've,

1217
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:22,340
we've, believe me, we've
tried to find this guy.

1218
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,460
Not a chance king atrip where we
actually do have him on the podcast.

1219
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:29,090
I feel like that would be to
try something. Try that guy.

1220
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:32,840
I would be the move.
Yeah. I would send a car.

1221
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,860
I've put them in the trunk
of the car. I'd be like, yes,

1222
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,740
please come talk to some.
He beat me.

1223
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,790
I don't really hire security
for that day though.

1224
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,440
The guys out front I don't think. Yeah,
no, no. I think I'll try it out guy.

1225
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:47,690
We'd need to be like, Hey, can
we have an armed officer here?

1226
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,610
Cause I don't know where
this is going to go,

1227
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:53,840
but I would really love to get to
the bottom of that video. Yeah,

1228
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:56,950
that's my favorite video of us. That's an
interview on the you guys could do too.

1229
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,000
Now. Uncle Pete, uncle
Terry would come on now.

1230
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,540
I don't know if we could have one.
We couldn't really,

1231
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,880
couldn't we have more than you think?
I don't know man.

1232
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,030
I know we can't even plays clip

1233
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,160
anymore. We should probably, yeah,

1234
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,400
actually. Right. If, uh,

1235
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:15,370
like if he's talking and he's
not shoving stuff up is asked,

1236
01:17:15,371 --> 01:17:17,870
then I don't see us getting
flagged for that. But

1237
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,930
I mean we've lost so much money
because of that guy already.

1238
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,620
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. He's
really fucked us. But um,

1239
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:29,550
yeah, basically we're not allowed to
play for people that are wondering,

1240
01:17:29,551 --> 01:17:33,750
cause we had to cut him out of a
couple things. It's because, uh,

1241
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:37,470
people are the video.
People were like,

1242
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,230
you can't have that guy
putting stuff in his ass.

1243
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,770
Yeah.
That's how you lose the Mcdonald's.

1244
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,630
You're really out there listening
is gracious. Yeah. He, um,

1245
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,000
Terry really forced drug gang.
Yeah.

1246
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,180
Oh.

1247
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,760
Oh. He's a ride or die. This right here.

1248
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,410
Oh, Nasdaq. So that's, that's
Terry having an orgasm.

1249
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:13,640
It's super slow. Mo. We're
allowed to, I found that we're
allowed to so nasty. Yeah.

1250
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:18,050
Now is your girl, is she
cool? Is she in a farm board?

1251
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:23,850
She's, uh, she's chill. She's
cool. She do foreign, not I, I,

1252
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,280
I'm trying to keep the romance
alive as long as I can.

1253
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,630
I'll keep hearing this from,
this is modern though. What
is this? Tom has no idea.

1254
01:18:30,631 --> 01:18:33,860
That's pretty good. Now, did you fart
in front of other girlfriends now?

1255
01:18:33,861 --> 01:18:37,100
He's not fine.
He's no gentleman here town.

1256
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:42,020
How long before you started
just freely? 14. No, it was
a three week. No, no, no, no,

1257
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:44,690
no. It wasn't. It was a
few months because I was,

1258
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,240
I remember the first time it was a,
I would,

1259
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,880
I would spend the night at
your place. I was, you know,

1260
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:54,710
next morning watching TV in your
boxer shorts. It was a weak one.

1261
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:58,010
It was a few months. It was a few
months, but what I did was to,

1262
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,790
to break the fart barrier. I went,
I did, instead of being like,

1263
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:06,450
here's a little Fart, I just decided to
go for it. I didn't think about it. Yeah.

1264
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,400
But I took her hand.

1265
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:11,090
I put it between my legs and have Fargo
on her hand for the first part and she

1266
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:14,300
goes, smells like garbage, smells
like garbage. And then I was like,

1267
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:17,390
well at least we're getting there now.
I think that if you're going to do it,

1268
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,130
that's probably the way to do it I think.

1269
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:21,890
So to wake somebody up with
just the bucket full ice water,

1270
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:25,350
like that's exactly what happened.
What did you think about that afterwards?

1271
01:19:25,351 --> 01:19:28,880
I never really know. It's another
red flag that I chose to ignore

1272
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,720
your, so, uh, you know, it was dad
in the serial killer talk early on.

1273
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,730
It was a red flag and I was like,
I don't know.

1274
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:42,710
There's so many good things about yeah,
yeah, yeah. Um, I just pushed past it.

1275
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:47,450
I just liked yet, you know,
Tom, I'm so attracted to him.
It's like this just thing,

1276
01:19:47,451 --> 01:19:51,500
this, this unconscious thing. I can't
control it. No matter what he does.

1277
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:56,330
If he farts out, he could shit on my chest
and I would just be like I ear to ear.

1278
01:19:56,331 --> 01:20:00,380
I would just adore him, feel, come on.
I would adore you. That's really sweet.

1279
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:04,580
And you can do sweet. Besides cheat on
me, I would fucking cut your painter off.

1280
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:08,610
But other than that,
she meant that I'm meaning.

1281
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,270
That's like the only thing you could
do. What counselors cheating? Oh my God.

1282
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:16,380
I don't know. Have, I mean we have our,

1283
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,340
I have my tour bus permission. You're bang
blast privileges. I'm allowed to like,

1284
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,680
I know you told him, make it, throw
it around on the bus. Oh my God.

1285
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:24,820
I never told you that. Oh Shit. Alright.

1286
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,210
And condoms are a must.
I always wear a condom.

1287
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,650
Okay. And then, you know. Right.

1288
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:38,520
So what did your dad do growing up?
Are you, were you, are you fancy?

1289
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:43,130
Did you grow up fancy? No. Uh, he's
a judge. So like you grew up fancies

1290
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,040
smart and fancy. I'm not
fat. I didn't grow up fancy.

1291
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,030
It didn't feel that he has a
federal judge. He's like a,

1292
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:57,300
he works for the Human Rights
Commission. So, uh, you know,

1293
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:01,890
civil rights cases, she's smart as
hell. He is smart. He's smart as fuck.

1294
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:06,360
Yeah. Wow. He is super smart. He's
like, did you do the wing guy? Huh?

1295
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:08,930
But that's fine.

1296
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:13,100
Me and he was never, you know. Yeah.
But yeah, but I mean now and yeah,

1297
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,760
but now I think,
but that's,

1298
01:21:14,761 --> 01:21:18,380
it's like kind of crazy about youtube
in the world and stuff is cause now when

1299
01:21:18,381 --> 01:21:19,460
guy makes more than the,

1300
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:24,800
the judge for sure now are
their expectations for you
to go to law school and

1301
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:28,430
follow in his footsteps. And I don't
even think that he'd want that.

1302
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,530
He didn't really put, you know, I didn't,

1303
01:21:30,531 --> 01:21:33,650
I didn't have that kind of pressure on
me. I was like, Eh, you know, if anything,

1304
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:37,550
because he worked so much. And then
so I feel like I was like almost head.

1305
01:21:37,551 --> 01:21:41,560
Are latchkey childhood a little
bit more. I was very lucky. Yeah.

1306
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,900
It was very like $40 by the phone
sort of childhood, you know,

1307
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,540
like that sort of situation,

1308
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,070
garage door combination
go sort of childhood.

1309
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:56,060
And how old are you if I may I
euphoria 32 Jesus, where you're young.

1310
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:59,810
I shouldn't even be a latch key kid, but
I thought you were 50 you're not 40 yet.

1311
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:02,670
Okay.

1312
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,010
But that's great because
that's really the, I mean,

1313
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:09,210
look gen x or is traditionally we
were latch key kids and you know,

1314
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:14,211
we created the fucking Internet and now
you guys are creating cool content on

1315
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:16,650
the Internet and taking it to the
next level. That's so great. Yeah.

1316
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:21,150
I want to do the dad thing where he
like, dude, without getting into it,

1317
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:25,410
do you do the finances where you
tell him when he was like, well

1318
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,870
a little yeah, a little bit, a little
bit, a little bit without getting he's,

1319
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,160
he's more,

1320
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:37,160
he's the it side of that that he shows
is more of like he's proud of me and you

1321
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:38,820
know,
he,

1322
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,440
it is good to have somebody whose opinion
you can trust when it comes to stuff

1323
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:47,760
like that, you know, because whatever
people will tell it. Yeah, exactly.

1324
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:50,160
So I actually like that my dad will be,

1325
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:54,430
he'll come from a place of just trying
to help me, you know, of course. And uh,

1326
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,710
he would be like excited.

1327
01:22:55,711 --> 01:22:59,280
Like if I moved to La and I
had to get a car or something,

1328
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:03,630
like he would be excited
to go car shopping with me
because he's like a car guy,

1329
01:23:03,631 --> 01:23:06,250
so he could, you know,
like live vicariously

1330
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,310
or something like that. Be An experience.
I'd be like, I'd like to show him,

1331
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:11,740
you know. That'd be cool. Yeah.
I hope you do do that. I know,

1332
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:15,730
I hope when you move into Leo, I think
within the year, oh that's great. Yeah.

1333
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,530
This time, you know, cause
whatever the show, uh, the
way that it runs is on these,

1334
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:20,720
you know,

1335
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:24,790
12 episode seasons and these three months
on one month off sort of production

1336
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,624
schedule.

1337
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:30,130
So I'd be able to finish season 10 by
the end of this calendar year and then I

1338
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:34,480
could make like a nice clean break with
everything. And then just whatever,

1339
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,450
either repurpose or either
relocate the shot here,

1340
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:41,350
which isn't that big a deal because it's
basically just an editor would have to,

1341
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:45,010
we didn't have to like take our editor
who's already a California kid and bring

1342
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:47,170
them to Kelly. And then, uh,

1343
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,080
and that would be kind of all that
we'd need to do to make that happen.

1344
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:55,240
So I think like January,
2020, I'll be in Los Angeles,

1345
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,230
not in New York.

1346
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:00,350
Hey Sunshine.

1347
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,140
And now in your body,

1348
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:04,280
hey,
have you seen gene?

1349
01:24:04,281 --> 01:24:09,281
This clip is from one of the documentaries
that I've been watching do full

1350
01:24:09,981 --> 01:24:10,380
volume.

1351
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:10,621
Yeah.

1352
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:15,621
And there are two types of personality
features that you have a great deal of.

1353
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:21,090
The first items called antisocial
personality disorder. Yeah.

1354
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,900
Nearly as someone who does
not have a conscience,

1355
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,890
does not have remorse,
does not feel a sense of guilt

1356
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,000
is impulse of

1357
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:43,280
the typical things we see before age
15 and people who are in that label are

1358
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,040
cruelty toward animals,
cruelty toward people.

1359
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,560
[inaudible]

1360
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,890
yeah, I think you're acting
range. You could widen the scope.

1361
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:59,090
You could play a psychopath,
serial killer,

1362
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:00,800
cool wall.
Easy.

1363
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:04,460
And then the kids making these memes
are getting borderline too good at them.

1364
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:09,410
I know you realize where
technology is going next. Like
you saw that guy. Oh good.

1365
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:14,400
The one you see the one where
like he had like Rogan the bikini.

1366
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,220
It was on my Instagram, Z, Christine
and p if he want to see it.

1367
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,740
That was it looked spot.
I mean,

1368
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,550
that didn't even look like anything,
but you know, like, like it,

1369
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:29,680
it really happened. I couldn't see
the seams, you know? Yeah. It was.

1370
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,550
And this was a Jenna Sunday.
Thank you Jenna.

1371
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,920
She's done a bunch of these by the way.

1372
01:25:35,921 --> 01:25:39,130
Somebody on Twitter posted
one and they're like, Hey,

1373
01:25:39,131 --> 01:25:42,160
Christina is this Hawaiian road rules?
And it was a girl in the shower.

1374
01:25:42,161 --> 01:25:45,340
There's hits. And I was like, oh my God,
is that me? That's what I thought too.

1375
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:48,820
I was like, Oh man, I'm a jack off
to this old footage of my wife.

1376
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:50,373
Oh,

1377
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,750
it's not me. I know, but

1378
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:56,500
duff, no, it wasn't you at first.

1379
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:02,110
I started such a savage.
I didn't check off,

1380
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:05,240
but I did think it was you at first. And
I started writing to, but I was like,

1381
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:08,000
those aren't my tits. Yeah. But
she had like your expression,

1382
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:11,490
your shoulders and you know,
ah, here we go. Here we go.

1383
01:26:11,491 --> 01:26:14,150
And I was reaching down and
then I didn't. Jesus. Well,

1384
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:18,350
I'm flattered that you still want to jerk
it to me. Yeah, I do. Sweet of you. Bed,

1385
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,370
do it all the time. Really. Sure. It's not
even the truth, but they're sweet to say.

1386
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:26,500
So. Oh well homie on out
homie on Ya. Yeah. Yeah.

1387
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:31,310
Comedy content collective.
A person that creates that.

1388
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:35,420
That's where they all get together. The
uh, all those great meme makers. I'm like,

1389
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,420
they do all that network.
They,

1390
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:41,100
so they created like this comedy content
collective where like there's like, oh,

1391
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,580
dcis and Jenna and oh my gosh.

1392
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:48,140
They all put their stuff together
tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. So it's great.

1393
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,400
Without them,
there's no silliness names.

1394
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:57,290
They do all the Photoshop songs,
you know, just hilarious stuff, man.

1395
01:26:58,270 --> 01:27:00,890
Um, so what, uh, what's
coming up next man?

1396
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,190
Just a finishing out the season. Then
I'll take a little vacay and then, uh,

1397
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,530
yeah. Tell us, talk about it. And
you don't want I want to do, no,

1398
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:15,000
not that I want to. Well, I always feel
like I have to go back to Chicago. Um,

1399
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:18,720
say what's up to the family and you
know what I want to hit this year.

1400
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:21,990
Have you guys been to Yosemite?
No, I want to hit a national park.

1401
01:27:21,991 --> 01:27:25,590
I want to see a bear in the wild.
That's cool. This is my new move.

1402
01:27:25,591 --> 01:27:28,140
So this is my new move for this vacay.
You're gonna take your lady?

1403
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,900
Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Oh, give
her pose to her at Yosemite. Yeah,

1404
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,200
I'm getting a jet.

1405
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,100
I'll give you a discount on the charter
if you're looking at you. Okay. Yeah.

1406
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,340
All right, cool. Yeah.

1407
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:44,850
Cool. That's a pretty, uh,
exciting trip. How long, how
long are you going to go for?

1408
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,520
Well, cause I only have like 12
days or something, so whatever.

1409
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:52,200
Maybe I can sneak a day on each side,
stretch it to two weeks pop. And uh,

1410
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:52,651
you know,

1411
01:27:52,651 --> 01:27:57,420
Chicago for five days at
Yosemite for like a long weekend.

1412
01:27:57,421 --> 01:28:02,250
And then right back to wolfen down
chicken wings. And what do you do for fun?

1413
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:07,410
What's your advice? Um, well I
think now I just work so much,

1414
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:10,230
but I find myself when I'm in La in that,

1415
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,350
in that West Hollywood vibe
where there's that, you know,

1416
01:28:13,351 --> 01:28:14,490
there's the comedy store,

1417
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:19,890
you may have been in dudes when you said
that was really even after the whole,

1418
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:23,630
all right girlfriend that you know
know shit. That's weird. You can ask.

1419
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,840
But there's that uh,
there's that um,

1420
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:31,830
hotel triangle there and like Andaz like
I'm a big fan of that pool on the roof.

1421
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,540
Yeah. Popping into the pods. Margarita,
you know, some chips and salsa.

1422
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:40,560
That's such a vibe up there. But then
like the summer scene at the Mondrian,

1423
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:43,490
I liked that whole, I liked that
a, I like that pool scene. Yeah.

1424
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:46,740
And then there's some hot ones fans
that like work out there by the pool but

1425
01:28:46,741 --> 01:28:49,920
they're like, like pool
towel, grunt sorta.

1426
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,840
But that's like that's the best
connection. That's the best thing.

1427
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,750
Cause they make that whole thing run
beyond like those a day beds or whatever

1428
01:28:57,751 --> 01:29:01,680
that are like have like a $4,000
a drink, drink minimum, you know,

1429
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:04,560
that are usually reserved for like
whoever is in there popping bottles.

1430
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,920
I'll just be like eating Nachos on those
things, you know. Yeah. That's awesome.

1431
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:09,180
Those are the bets.
A good vibe.

1432
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:13,530
The working class person that like
listens to this show is my favorite to run

1433
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:14,151
into,
you know,

1434
01:29:14,151 --> 01:29:19,000
like say the dude who's driving
the FedEx truck or you know,

1435
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,100
sometimes they even like, you know,
drive by and you could say, you know,

1436
01:29:23,101 --> 01:29:26,640
it's like the Orkin man,
the guy cutting grass and like they,

1437
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:30,600
it's my favorite shout out to get you
one time I was at the pharmacy getting my

1438
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:35,520
prescription found Christina. I go, yeah,
he goes, I'm listening to you right now.

1439
01:29:35,521 --> 01:29:40,290
And he was stocking drinks at the
pharmacy and I was like, this is crazy.

1440
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,940
They, whenever we do a show
and uh, or like whatever,

1441
01:29:44,941 --> 01:29:46,620
if I'm speaking at some thing,

1442
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:51,390
it's like the people that work backstage
that have the ear pieces and they're

1443
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,150
like pushing carts or like
making food or stop or something.

1444
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:58,470
Those guys are always hot ones fans and
it's like the biggest point of pride for

1445
01:29:58,471 --> 01:30:01,920
the show. Like for the people who make
it like we love, we love that scene.

1446
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,980
Plus those are the people that can make
it happen for you. You absolutely. Yeah,

1447
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:08,900
it was absolutely. Then um, Sean,
thank you so much for coming today.

1448
01:30:08,901 --> 01:30:10,020

stab you in your sleep. Get your ass
out. My face. Suspect my pregnancy.

1457
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,760
I don't feel I get what I need to eat
less siphon gas when you're outside,

1458
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:12,680
you ain't shit. I pissed as shit
where I want it bad enough for good.

1459

That kind of Danielle and they
would stop giving me so many gifts.

1460
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:19,270
So they got to pay up.
You could get kidnapped,

1461

uh, yeah. Or New Code.

1462

from the Honda's

1465
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:55,980
from the hunters
play around.

1466
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,330
I didn't live outside for three years.

1467
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:05,760
I lived outside cost stepping up the game.

1468
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:11,060
When the fuck are we going
