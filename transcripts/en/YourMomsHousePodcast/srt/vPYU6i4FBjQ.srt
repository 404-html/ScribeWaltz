bless the Cincinnati far. Okay.

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,110
Okay.
Pretty impressive.

21
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,000
I was a little nervous in the beginning.
Yeah, cause it was a little aggressive,

22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,590
real aggressive. But then we
know this guy. What's his name?

23
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,943
This is the,

24

this is Lord Columbus.
It's called triple pipe montage pizzas.

Could I have a pen name? Yeah, maybe.

27
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,670
I feel like it's the same guy. Yeah. Oh,
that's really good stuff. Yeah. A lot of,

28
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,160
a lot of old school

29
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,340

All right. I got my fancy a
green jacket on. I get that.

32
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,940
You didn't even really acknowledge.
I mean it's kind of, it's,

33
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:18,290
it's throwing me off so much
that my brain's processing it.

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,610
What about it is throwing you off?
Just the awesomeness of it. Yeah.

35
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,720
It's bold. It's bold fashion
choice. Well, I was at,

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,250
was this part of the new Gucci Collection?
No,

37
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:34,790
I was at the mall getting my phone fixed.

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,680
I walked through Macy's or as you
call it, the garbage dump. Yeah.

39
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,450
It's not really up to your standards,
but I saw this and I thought, why not?

40
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:48,240
So I got it to Macy's purchase
and then they had that

41
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,480
Macy's. You feel like? Do
you feel like Macy's is,

42
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,600
it's not as bad as like a Sears?

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,150
No, of course not. No. Neither
one of them. I mean, they're fine,

44
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,040
but it's fun to mock
them. Yeah. Not Nordstrom.

45
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,460
Is that what you call it? Not Nordstrom.
Not Neiman, no, definitely not.

46
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:14,310
And even not Barney's.
Who really shops at Neiman Marcus though?

47
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:18,240
I feel like that's so fancy.
That's fancy.

48
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,580
Barton used to Barf. Fuck
Barneys, dude. I went there.

49
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:27,210
It was like in a, you know, in a rush.
I was like, oh, I need, I forget what.

50
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:31,950
I needed a belt or shoes and it was one
of those things where a quick stroll

51
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,980
through the store,
it's almost like they look at you like,

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,430
do you really want to get to here? Yeah.
Like the guy was sympathetic. He's like,

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,750
we have this discount one
for 400 and I was like, ah.

54
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,850
I think isn't there another store?
He's like, he has other stories.

55
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,810
You should probably check them out.

56
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,560
Barneys is ludicrous.

57
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:52,561
You can't get out of there without
spending four or $500 on one fucking sock.

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,240
It's preposterous.
It's fucking dominant.

59
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,060
You gotta be an idiot if
you're doing that call that,

60
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,370
but it's for a certain
people that want to do that.

61
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,100
A certain level of mommy.

62
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,730
Yeah. Well it's like, I think you
want, your thrill is in spending a lot.

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,893
That's what you mean.

64
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,780
Even if even if I had
the millions to spend,

65
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm not sure I would do it. Like
I don't, it's just not, it's a,

66
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,800
it's an ethical thing.

67
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,650
Yeah. I Dunno. I think that's some
people's rush though. It definitely,

68
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,830
I know it's some people's rush.
Do you like to yeah, they go.

69
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:32,400
Like I spent all in,
I spend a $500 on a belt.

70
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,240
You see them with the shot, you know, 10
shopping bags. You see people like that.

71
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,540
Yeah. They're getting, they got together.
They got a rush from it. Yup. Yup. Um,

72
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,200
all right. We should do
a, a proper show open.

73
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,250
We did our fitness today,
man. We'll get into it. Fuck.

74
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,370
And we'll get into fitness.
I'd been down for two weeks.

75
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:58,160
I know there's a lot to cover. Fuck.
Um, here we go. Let's open the show

76
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,750
proper.
Like

77
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,730
hello my little Munchkins and
welcome to my channel. I'm sexy.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,410
And today's topic is
of course no leaching.

79
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,290
You came here because you're curious,

80
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:18,291
you clicked on the link to see what the
heck is vaginal leaching and why would a

81
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:23,340
woman put out of all things
leeches in her vagina?

82
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,810
No,
bring it in one loving.

83
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,210
Well welcome
to your mom's house,

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,300
Christina pushes.
It's interesting.

85
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,073
Is

86
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,060
this for you?

87
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,393
No,
I know.

88
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,870
And I looked at all the clips when you
were gone this morning and I thought this

89
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:25,000
one, he's really going to
get a cake out of an eye.

90
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,430
I was this close to asking
you, Hey, what did you,

91
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,410
what are you thinking for the
opening clip? But I was like,

92
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,930
I'm going to give him the benefit of
the doubt that he's going to choose

93
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:35,670
something different than
vaginal leaching or um,

94
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,580
reading national discharge
off of a panty line.

95
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,900
While you should checked your doubt at
the door. Cause that's what we're up to,

96
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:47,740
right? Yeah. Yeah. I
think a little bit of, um,

97
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,510
I don't know what the word,
what's the word,

98
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,390
like a infantilism or something
happening here where she's,

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,810
she's very much a little white girl.
You see Minnie mouse in the background.

100
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,470
That's what she is. That's her
little doll in the background. Right.

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,050
She's got Minnie mouse and then
pink, pink pig, the heart hangers.

102
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,130
Then I just noticed that
now her titties. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,570
And she's got a necklace this pointing
stripping ges into her titties, you know?

104
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,200
Yeah. So she wants you to see
him, but that is a thing. Um,

105
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,780
psychologically when a girl,
we're like,

106
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,990
still wears a lot of pinks and
they're an adult. I think it's like,

107
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,870
that's why like those porno girls,
they talk like really girl hi blighted.

108
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,480
It's like that. Your feet refusing to
be a woman kind of thing. Of course,

109
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,730
it's terrible.
Of course you put them

110
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,923
the China,

111
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,560
the amazing women would put leaches
in the vagina is to treat some kind of

112
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:39,940
condition or to improve
their health and wellbeing,

113
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,240
um, to improve their sensations,
whatever the reason may be.

114
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:49,220
Mainly it's health
reasons, of course. Yeah.

115
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,760
Of course it is. Duh. It's like drinking
your P to, to cure a cold. And I just,

116
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:55,740
cause I haven't seen any of this.

117
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:59,310
I just noticed that those are leeches
right there in that jar. Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,630
You think so gypsy? She kind of looks
like Roma. Yeah, I can see it. She's like,

119
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,520
she's my tribe. Yeah,
totally. She's my tribe.

120
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:15,660
She's somewhere like Romania
or something. Right? Yeah.

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,940
It's fucked up. How did you discover
that that's what your vagina is not,

122
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,150
you don't think it would be good?
It's not just for health reasons.

123
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,140
It helps sensations.
Helps everything.

124
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Sensations. I came across a very, very

125
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,090
interesting,
should I say article

126
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,770
placing leeches in her vagina in order
to conceive a child at the age of 50 so I

127
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,360
thought it was quite interesting and I
thought I'd bring it to your attention.

128
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,510
Yeah. Very nice. He didn't
bring that to our attention.

129
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,390
Seriously though in the, this is would be
considered an educational video. Right?

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,050
Right. Cause she's trying to really
look at the hangers for real,

131
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,910
but they really are
out there, right? Yeah.

132
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,940
I mean there's how many unbuttoned
buttons you see? One, two, three,

133
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,390
possibly four is on the fourth
one down. Yeah. I mean, well babe,

134
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,600
did you think that she was a scientist?
Well,

135
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,650
I think she's trying to
give off the idea that this,

136
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,350
that she has knowledge to share.
So if your video is about

137
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,490
how dare you, you're so misogynist.
Well, no, I mean I liked that.

138
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,720
I like him.
Why can't she be hot and smart?

139
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,420
Why can't she be a doctor and
slutty at the same time? Tom,

140
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,570
Gabby, I'm in totally in favor of her
tests. Painting her with that brush.

141
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:45,350
Just because you're, you're funny doesn't
mean you can't be sexy. That's true.

142
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,933
Sorry.

143
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,860
I know I'm going to also
do real life demonstration.

144
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,570
Not using myself using the site.
A little doll.

145
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,093
Oh,

146
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,780
so your pussy get leads. That's
the whole test to show, man.

147
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,580
That's a science pushing legion show Dan.

148
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,030
Well then do it on fucking live league
so we can see your snatch. Yeah, man.

149
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,620
That we get a lot of use.
I know that clip and this is gypsy

150
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,260
meaning explained that her first treatment
was like having a pap smear. Okay.

151
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,110
The doctor plastic device
known as a speculum,

152
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,010
a stock kilo.
This is what the device gets.

153
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,310
Slide straight triggers out of her mind.
No Shit.

154
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,040
God Damn it dude.

155
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,240
And the doctor inserted this baculum
into her vaginal canal and then proceeded

156
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:52,481
to add three leeches and then
allow them to do their job to do

157
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,610
to her uterus. Oh, we always nasty
is healed. That is so foul, man.

158
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,910
That's fucking,
it makes me cringe.

159
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,180
Y what can be more natural?

160
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,890
Look a bit more love and then
putting it leaches and your vagina.

161
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,150
I uh, just knowing what vaginas are like,
I just don't think that's a good idea.

162
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:18,260
I don't have one, but I can, I've seen
a few. I don't think that's a good idea.

163
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,230
Just what do you mean? I don't think
it's good to put leeches in your puss.

164
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,410
What I'm concerned with,
I think it's okay and your puss,

165
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,050
but then it can go into your
uterus and then it's like, well,

166
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,080
how'd you get the leach out? Leach wants
to. That's what I'm saying, cause she,

167
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,910
it sounds to me like you're really opening
up the badge and putting something in.

168
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:38,990
It means it can go through your cervix
and into your uterus and probably cause

169
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,560
massive damage to the elite doesn't have
a pager. Right. You can't be like, hey,

170
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,020
you got to get back here
now. Do what it wants. Right.

171
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:48,140
Unless you're tying strings to all of
their next and then you pull them down.

172
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,940
I mean this is the crazy sharing.

173
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,130
Really comfortable with
why he wasn't he was doing.

174
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,210
Nina said that in an interview.

175
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,520
We just basically attracted themselves
to the inside of her cervix hatched. Oh,

176
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,560
inside of her cervix sound very
pleasant when the therapy was over,

177
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:11,240
the leeches dropout. Sam coming out
fatter than a bottle of nail Polish.

178
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,270
Oh. Oh. So they were really enjoying them,

179
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:18,140
sucking the blood so they suck the blood
out of your cervix. That's, I can't be,

180
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,590
I can't, sounds like a nasty
sounds like those leeches Kinda.

181
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,180
Yeah.
Lot of Stan.

182
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,860
A maybe just a little bit of glass glass.

183
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,480
Oh man, bitch, you crazy. Now,

184
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,620
why doesn't she do it if she's so
stoked about this man? I don't know.

185
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,150
Let's see if she explains why c

186
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,630
side effects for the curious and Manju,

187
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,500
you might be surprised to know that
the vaginal leeches did their job after

188
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:51,180
eight months of using just covered
that she was pregnant at the age of 45,

189
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,550
much more energy than before,

190
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,940
but that wasn't the only side
effect of the leach therapy.

191
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,930
Eight months. What every day. I got
to explain more than that and I don't,

192
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:06,910
I really can't see how that would help.
Fertility has nothing to do with, uh,

193
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,670
does it give you better egg quality?
Does it as she's in they're nuts.

194
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:13,504
This is nuts.

195
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,630
I also noticed that my orgasms
were longer and more intense.

196
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,460
She confessed in an interview stating
that she had some of the best orgasms

197
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
after each different around of treatment.

198
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,890
That's awesome. You know, I know this,
I mean, we all know why she's crazy,

199
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,560
but again, I have this
theory about the makeup. Uh,

200
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,130
whenever you see a girl, first of all
that color is bananas. Lipstick. Yeah.

201
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,920
But when you see the liner of the lip,

202
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:44,860
Lennar going above the
line of the lip there,

203
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,900
you see that trick and she
think she's fooling over here.

204
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,280
That's how you know bitches cray
like crazy. She's on a visual,

205
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,630
like you just glass a bitch. And if
that make up goes up over the lip line.

206
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,070
No good hound. Or she got makeup
tattooed on like tattooed eyeliner. Oh,

207
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,630
we also saw last week the shadow

208
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,390
eyebrows like into the eyebrow.
Like if a bitch for eyebrows are too thin,

209
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:13,340
I mean tiny pass could tell.
He has a joke about that.

210
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:18,230
But if your eyebrows are all fucked up,
you know, you color them different colors.

211
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,440
I knew a girl who had purple
eyebrows and like Booboo,

212
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,880
that shit does not look good. Nobody likes
that. No dues aren't gonna like that.

213
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,580
I have my little friend here

214
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,050
to help us demonstrate it.

215
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,890
I have my jar leeches and
our little Minnie mouse.

216
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,160
Johnny's going to help us
demonstrate how not to damage.

217
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,940
Like you imagine if you're on a
date with this woman, you know,

218
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:53,050
and like you're just like, oh yeah, she's
attractive and you're having dinner.

219
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:56,250
And then she's like, come over and
then, you know, all right, uh, what,

220
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,000
what do you want to do? And she's
like, have you ever heard of valley?

221
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,790
Imagine will leach therapy. They're
like, wait, what? He's like,

222
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm going to show you
on my Minnie mouse doll.

223
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:09,601
I sliced her pussy open so that I can
show you on her as opposed to help for

224
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:13,750
health and, and also orgasms. At that
point you're like, you know what,

225
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,760
I have a meeting in the
morning that I forgot about

226
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,810
when the woman
looking at her whole,

227
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,880
she cut the fabric out of her legs
need to be put together like this.

228
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,780
Knees have to be opened
to open up your knees,

229
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,720
put your legs when you're in labor,
check you.

230
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,130
And if you can play some
mirror and shine a light,

231
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,330
I wouldn't advocate that self belief
in yourself to do this.

232
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:47,700
She's telling you how to
do the shit at home. Bitch,

233
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:52,550
you crazy this. Um, no, no, that's true.

234
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,380
Once it's inserted,
you will then open it up

235
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,090
at, first of all, it's really simple
to open yourself up with a speculum.

236
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:06,900
Right?

237
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,280
The instrument keeps the
vagina entirely open.

238
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,660
Yeah. What's, I mean, even
just doing that to yourself,

239
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,530
probably not easy. No, it
doesn't seem easy. Well,

240
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,510
it doesn't feel good when
someone else does it to you,

241
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:23,340
let alone doing it yourself.

242
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:27,060
Like there's no way I can imagine that's
just like you're at your Thursday night,

243
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,290
you know,
it's horrible.

244
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,330
Once a year I got the
speculum and putting these uh,

245
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,310
leeches in my purse right now,
where do you even get the leeches?

246
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,540
You go to a pet store

247
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,950
and this will come out really,
really huge. When it's fun.

248
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,240
So with the knees or feet together,

249
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,500
like her smile,

250
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,120
you will then proceed to place.

251
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:56,121
The leech all the way is in your
first step all the way inside.

252
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:58,890
So

253
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,780
unless you're all the way deep inside,
at least the Leech.

254
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,673
Thank you.

255
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,210
Shouldn't do it.
I don't think you should do it.

256
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,670
I don't think you should do want
to go ahead and say that I will.

257
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,780
I don't trust this lady,

258
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,730
but what if the what if leaching your
penis could make it bigger for you? Do it.

259
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,590
Everyone would do it. If you told
the Dude, hey here, Dick Hole.

260
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,220
If you put a legion there,
it'll grow.

261
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,330
But you could tell them all you gotta do
is slice it up your deck off and put a

262
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,910
leach in there. And guys
like all right. Yup.

263
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,960
The ers would be full of dudes at
leeches on their dicks. 100% yeah,

264
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,350
that's definitely a Leech is
definitely not going to make it bigger.

265
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,390
I don't think so. I think it's
going to make her dick smaller.

266
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,840
Well what if you could be like, but it
sucks the, the nutrients, the blood.

267
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,670
It replaces it with whatever you can
say anything. You can make it. Yeah.

268
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,820
Tell him to put it in their asshole and
then they would put a leaching your ass.

269
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:03,450
Will you typically at beggar?
What? Honey? Honey. Honey,

270
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,430
help me out here. Here. Hold. Hold my ass
open real quick with this thing. Yeah.

271
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,990
Yeah. Tighten the knob. It
can you see a real big good.

272
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,360
Now put like 10 or 12 leaches up in there.

273
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,570
What if it gets stuck inside my uterus?

274
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,500
I won't be able to come out.

275
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I'm here to tell you that
there's absolutely no chance
the leach getting inside

276
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,420
the cervix.
There's no way because the walls,

277
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,440
the lips of the cervix or like shut
closed and there's really not much passing

278
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,613
through.

279
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,260
Yeah. Except when you opulate
or when you make a baby like,

280
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,930
well how do you think sperm gets through
the cervix? You Ding Dong, it opens,

281
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,930
it opens and it gets her.
Yeah, she's so sneaky.

282
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:58,840
I don't know where she got
her medical degree from.

283
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:00,910
Harvard I think is what I
was reading in the little.

284
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,280
Um,

285
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,840
and then once they're finished
they will crawl out on their own.

286
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,180
Ah, girl, Don, you too. Um,

287
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,100
how long have you tried anything open
again to remove the leeches that's now

288
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:19,890
going to be happening? The leeches
are going to crawl out by themselves.

289
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,160
Okay.
So you just,

290
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,670
you're just sitting there and then a
leach cross it or coach it just slithers

291
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:30,600
out. I'm done. Oh, you're done.
Oh, there's three more in there.

292
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,100
Just give it a minute and they're
all fat. Oh God. It's so nasty.

293
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,880
So glad you shared that.
You know,

294
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,440
we got a bunch of emails and messages.
People were like,

295
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:49,570
do not make fun of this guy last week.

296
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,770
The cook the chef. Yeah. And I don't
even remember how I even know who he is.

297
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,600
Chef John. They're like, don't fuck
with chef John. Yeah. Because he has,

298
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,160
all we're doing is saying this guy
has up speak like very, oh that's,

299
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,950
that's the chef I, yeah. Yeah. This
guy, for some matters we probably be,

300
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,850
you're one of the great mysteries
of the culinary world since,

301
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:14,330
how can there be a recipe for re fried
beans when there's no such thing as a

302
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:17,820
fried bean recipe? See Fried
bean recipe. Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,440
I'm going to go ahead and soak one pound
of pinto beans and cold water overnight

304
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,210
and like everything these days,

305
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:26,450
there's a lot of controversy on whether
you should do this or not and I'll let

306
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,350
you do your own research. But I've
been a been soaker from way back. Yeah.

307
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,920
So I did that. Mine Soak in cold. What's
a bunch of Bursa really love this guy.

308
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:35,660
I don't know.
I don't know anything about him.

309
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,060
I mean the been soaking controversial.
My God,

310
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,620
I guess some people don't soak their
beans. I like the sub mine plenty.

311
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:46,290
You Soak your beans all day
in your hands like this?

312
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,750
Uh, yeah. I didn't know
that guy was famous. Yeah.

313
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,850
Oh look how the tables have turned
no wrong here. You have a Zvm. No,

314
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,870
I have h two o I have my bottle
and then at Fiji is mine too.

315
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,340
So yeah.

316
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,880
Well anymore for me it's probably
the first time you drank water today,

317
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:12,790
so I understand. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
Um, anyways, so yeah, a lot of people,

318
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,200
chef John I gotta heat for Chef John, Huh?
Yeah, they, yeah, they were really real.

319
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,050
A lot of people have chef John.
But then we got this, uh, from a,

320
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,490
uh, an Ozzie listener of
ours said that this guy,

321
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,600
Frank Walker,
whatever he talks about,

322
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,610
he does have speak in Australia.

323
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,200
Hello Frank Walker from
national tiles this week.

324
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:42,900
National Tiles had a beautiful range of
polished porcelain floor tiles slashed

325
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,830
by up to 30% or more.

326
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,110
Hey, he draws out every single word. Yeah.
Or one out of every fight. He was, whoa.

327
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,010
It's definitely, it's
definitely a hook. Yeah.

328
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,990
It makes you remember that how that
guy speaks. Yeah. Well, you know, it's,

329
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,210
to me whenever any Australian
person speaks, I'm like,
oh, that's funny. It's not,

330
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,680
it's not American.
You know,

331
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,090
it all sounds different to me when
I hear him talking. I liked it.

332
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:10,560
It definitely sounds different, but
yeah, there you go. That's funny.

333
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,140
It's that in America I think they all talk
like this is what I'm saying. Like, oh,

334
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,820
I don't hear the distinction
so much. Whenever I hear an
Aussie speak, I was like,

335
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:20,760
yeah, uh, uh, yeah. It
just sounds wacky. My,

336
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,460
they all sound wacky cause it's
not American. Yeah, I hear Ya.

337
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,430
It's until this Sunday
only at national tiles.

338
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,290
Beautiful range of polished porcelain
floor tiles, but only until this Sunday.

339
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,970
Right. International towels now and
save go do I website for details.

340
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,540
National tiles.com. Dot. EU.

341
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,490
If I was a producer in the booth with him,
I'd be like, Hey, you keep these words

342
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,890
and you should stop doing that,
and he would probably be like,

343
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,960
that's what I always do.
I pick,

344
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:55,340
I pick a word and then I make it eight
syllables when it's to do not like it and

345
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,980
I'd be like, no, I don't fucking
like it. Stopped doing it. Wow.

346
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,720
Hello.
This week,

347
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:06,770
national tiles had a beautiful range
of polished porcelain floor tiles.

348
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,870
It's weird. It's definitely
weird. I kind of enjoy it though.

349
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,100
I like it more than a, yeah.
People really liked that guy.

350
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,000
He kept getting messages about him.
He sounds like he's genuinely sweet.

351
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,380
I think that's what it might be. Oh,
here we go. I think you said this great.

352
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,890
You called him a Gay Lord.
Oh yeah, that's right. Hey,

353
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,040
do not call chef John and up speaking
Gaylord chef John was created by God

354
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:37,990
herself.
Her share seven minute video recipes.

355
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:42,160
He taught me proper knife techniques
like what does that she full nod.

356
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,060
Do you even know what that shit
is? Doubt it. Well, obviously no,

357
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,760
I keep my knife technique high and tight.

358
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,210
You spit in the face of cuisine and art.

359
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,440
Chef John's angelic Singsong
cadence is evidence.

360
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,300
There is a higher power in this world.

361
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Comparing his cherubic delivery to
vocal fry is an affront to humanity.

362
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,970
This is the lowest looses thing I've
ever seen from your mom's house.

363
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:14,800
My balls are dry and I'm
slightly sweaty now by Hitler.

364
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,520
Dustin. Ps, I'm off to make a sell.

365
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,140
I salt crusted beef tenderloin.
And what does that mean, la? Uh,

366
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,170
I dunno for dessert that you barbarians
would not know anything about this guy

367
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,710
seen die hard. Die Hard. They
love him. Sorry. Sorry Chef John.

368
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,250
You talk like a retard but
tiny like a Gaylord retired.
Okay, Lord. Stupid Retard.

369
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:40,880
But you're apparently a great chef.
Speaking to that. I was going to be sweet.

370
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,820
Yeah, you were in the bathroom. You came
in. I go check this out and on my own.

371
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:50,090
I just had the thought can
retarded people drive right?

372
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,060
And the answer is yes. It just blew
my mind. Really blew my mind too.

373
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,770
I did not think that. I don't know.
Remember what I remember why it happened.

374
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,770
Now I went to the Fedex to drop off a
package and as I was walking back to my

375
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:10,390
car, I saw the car that was
parked, you know, head to head.

376
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,940
And I go as high retarded
guy in the driver's seat.

377
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:16,680
And I thought that cause I retarded guy.
And then I got in the car,

378
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,720
I looked at him and it wasn't,
but at that moment I go,

379
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,680
I wonder if retarded people can drive.
He just looked retarded.

380
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:27,010
He looked retarded for a moment. So I
just kind of, I looked at him and I go,

381
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,760
hold on here. I just kind of
looked put together that he wasn't.

382
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:34,360
But then the question was in my mind,
the burning question,

383
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,240
and I looked it up and the,
here's what I found out,

384
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,190
there's no rules anywhere
preventing them from driving.

385
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,980
It's crazy.
Here's the thing,

386
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,650
if they can pass the test,
that's what it's all about.

387
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:51,180
So if they pass the written test and
they pass the actual driving test,

388
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,800
nothing says, well you pass these,
but you're, you know, retard drive,

389
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,190
Corky Thatcher on life goes on. Was
he able to drive, he was able to act.

390
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,660
We know that that guy could realize and
memorize them. Yeah. That's fascinating.

391
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,690
I think it probably is all all about
down to the degree of your disability.

392
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:16,710
In other words, how, how, well it was
looking for another way of saying,

393
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,060
but yes,
how severe your retardation is.

394
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,480
So if you're like super retired,

395
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,980
then you can't drive. But if you're
pretty put together, you know,

396
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm trying to think in my Rolodex
of retarded people that I've known,

397
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:36,750
if any of them could drive again,
you know the guy in life goes on.

398
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:39,300
He was pretty highly functioning.

399
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:42,420
He could memorize lines and
do things like that. Yeah.

400
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,350
I'm wondering if that guy can drive,
I mean some of them have jobs,

401
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:50,700
you know that this before and so whether
or not it would be pleasurable to be

402
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:55,140
retarded, if you would know that you
are retarded. What? That's horrible.

403
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,370
Horrible. Is a genuine question.
Pleasurable to be retarded.

404
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
Maybe if they don't know they're retarded,

405
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,240
then they're just kind of living in alone.

406
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,970
There's no such thing as not knowing.
It's all I do is eat lots of sweets.

407
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,490
They all know. Stop saying
they don't know. They know.

408
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,240
They don't know what they're
missing though, by not being
retarded. Um, all right.

409
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,050
Maybe to a degree,
like they don't,

410
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,490
they don't know other pleasures besides
masturbating and eating. What else?

411
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,890
Ultimately that's all you want.
That's what I'm saying too. I agree.

412
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,150
But there's others, there's more refined
things like, uh, enjoying a film,

413
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,160
reading a book, going to be like
a watch films retarded. Yes.

414
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,240
But they don't understand.

415
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,420
They're not going to watch the same
white bummer movies that we watch or you

416
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:41,120
know, hey, yeah,

417
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,940
no bureau watching a real
bummer the other day.

418
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,830
Well, I was sick so I though,
you know, what could I do? And I,

419
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,120
I got roped into 13 reasons why the Hannah
Baker suicide show and they rubbed me

420
00:28:55,591 --> 00:29:00,150
in because they played joy division on
the first episode and I was like, oh fuck.

421
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,740
I love it. I love depressing teenage shit.
That's my, that's my jam. It's to me.

422
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,060
I didn't watch the whole thing,

423
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:10,590
but I watched probably half of one episode
and then half of another episode with

424
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:13,080
you. It just seemed like
an afterschool special,

425
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,580
like the way that the writing and the
acting like it was telling a story,

426
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,730
but it was like, it was
really like, you know,

427
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,250
kind of doing it for
kids. Right? Well, yeah.

428
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,180
I mean the show is about teenage suicide,

429
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:31,500
so they have a moral obligation to make
it palatable, I think, to that audience.

430
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,140
So when I walked in I was like,
what are you watching?

431
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:38,400
Like a fucking afterschool though.
That's interesting that uh, you're like,

432
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,160
what are you watching? This is
depressing where your favorite stuff is

433
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,990
like, and she came home and
found her husband murdered.

434
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,260
There was blood everywhere.
Becky was terrified.

435
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,790
Little did she know the murderer was
still in the house. What the hell is that?

436
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,370
That's your show that you watch.
Watch.

437
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,220
That's what I hear as I'm falling asleep
at night. It's all your murder, whatever.

438
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,480
Murder shows you like.

439
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,250
It's always about like reenacting or the,
they are not,

440
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:09,130
they haven't found the killer yet.
Which is even more terrifying for

441
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,670
reality crime rate. Yeah. You love
that stuff. Like the real depressing.

442
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,990
Like I watched fakes suicide like
fake murderer, but your jam is like,

443
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,730
I like real killing, like real
human suffering. You know?

444
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,550
That's true. Real hardship. I
started uh, the new Fargo. Yeah,

445
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,650
you did.
I fell asleep so fast during that.

446
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,560
I gotta tell you I don't have as much
of a hard on for that show as you do.

447
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,500
Maybe it's the mid like admitted what?
You relate a lot to that place. Cause you,

448
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:43,270
you lived in the, in Minneapolis, it's,
yeah, it's your, those are your tribe.

449
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:47,770
But I'm telling you, I really feel like
when you break down the whole thing,

450
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:52,600
the writing, the storytelling,
the cinematography,

451
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,970
the directing and the acting,

452
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,980
I don't think I've seen a better
show in 10 years plus than Fargo.

453
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,650
The great British baking show.
I mean it has drama stakes.

454
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:09,651
Cinematography I duck is a rope off
Chris and Marie Battery Chemistry.

455
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,650
We did finish it. No wait,
wait. How was the FARC go?

456
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:17,380
How was the first of the stuff?
Should we have better call Saul? Dude,

457
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:21,610
we haven't even fucking seen that.
The new new, yeah. So Americans,

458
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,390
can I tell you something? I'm watching
the Americans, I'm not dazzled to Csun.

459
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,700
The Americans has maybe turned a corner.
Yeah.

460
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,600
It's not first of all,

461
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:35,350
last season we had so many
compelling stories on this law,

462
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,590
on the episode that I just, we'll finish
the one that started to fall asleep on,

463
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,370
they did just hit a holy shit moment,
good storyline.

464
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,200
But I feel like they kind of dropped a
lot of the storylines from last season,

465
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,060
like page putting them in jeopardy by
talking to that asshole pastor and her

466
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,490
fucking the neighbor boy. And
it was like, I didn't like it.

467
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,840
They never killed that guy. I mean they
should have killed pastor Tim. Yeah.

468
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,890
Fuck him.
It doesn't make sense.

469
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,060
It made sense that they would
give the diplomacy a shot,

470
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,130
but then that should have failed
and they shouldn't. I agree.

471
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Because like he's going to keep the
secret there to have that happen now.

472
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:16,300
I was very excited to see
the outcome of season three.

473
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,730
Spoiler alert if you're
watching on Netflix

474
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,940
of the victor was Nadia.
Yeah.

475
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,870
And you and I were rooting for it.
Tamale and Nadia, the two outliers,

476
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,850
both young, both Muslim
bakers, uh, she wears her full,

477
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,684
he job,

478
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,620
her head dress made sure it makes her
look very different than everybody else.

479
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:42,920
But I her because she was an outsider and
I like that she's like a housewife and

480
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,280
the best part is, uh, the bummed out
husband when they did her package,

481
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:50,690
like your interview and the husband was
like, uh, we've all been missing Nadia.

482
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:54,560
She's been doing this bike and show
and I've had to do everything for the

483
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,930
children. You can really
see that. He's like,

484
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,170
I respect her a lot more now know that
she used to come home and stop baking on

485
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,730
your bullshit show is what I took.
But also he's like,

486
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,660
I didn't realize what she did. That's
what I got. She was like, guys alive. Oh,

487
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,940
realize how much should
she does? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,100
He was more upset that she wasn't, uh,
still cooking and cleaning at home course.

489
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,130
It was nice to see that she won
and it really meant a lot to her.

490
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,220
That's the thing that I took
away. US Gray. She cared
so fucking much about that.

491
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,270
I didn't think I could do it. And
then I did do it again. She goes, oh,

492
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:33,320
I didn't think that I could do it
under no phone could do it. And No.

493
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,840
I said to myself,
I can do anything.

494
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,310
She speaks with a 100% British
accent. Yeah, but I did British.

495
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:45,020
That was British. Pakistani. Yeah. You
had a little bone job in there. Okay.

496
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:49,250
Well she's from Bangladesh. Yeah.
You're hearing is Bang Bangladeshi.

497
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,810
Hmm. I was throwing it in there and she's,
she doesn't really have a Bangladeshi.

498
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,130
Yeah,
and she does a little bit.

499
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,250
Okay,

500
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,840
well do you do her then
do her victory speech.

501
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,853
Oh,

502
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,590
to when sweet chocolate.
There you go.

503
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,530
That's not how she sounds.
I think so.

504
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,370
That's how Mary Berry's hounds more.
You're doing Mary.

505
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,360
So glad to Paul.
Hollywood

506
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,160
does. I don't like this. I don't like it.

507
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,720
I don't like it, mate. No, he
got it. He goes, I don't like it.

508
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,380
I'm not tasting the rhubarb. I'm not
tasting the almond. If you're gone,

509
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,200
if you're gone and put pineapple in it.
I'd like to taste the flavors.

510
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:37,310
I like your layers. Nice
bike. It's under bike.

511
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm not getting on flavor.
Coconut wiped out everything.

512
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,700
Too much moisture in the bike.

513
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,530
Yeah.

514
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,380
I love when they say oh no, he,
yeah, he went to Channel Four.

515
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,940
It like a rival show. Yeah. Yeah.
Big, big controversy and UCL. Yeah,

516
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,080
we'll see what happens.
But all the wood,

517
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,760
I really hope there are more seasons
that we get to see cause I'm just, ah,

518
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,600
it's a, it's a great
show. It is a great show.

519
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:06,160
We started watching the Zombie show that
everybody's fucking was in love with

520
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,520
this. We're good at at
um, a show becoming a hit,

521
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,270
like a really big smash hit.
And we go so,

522
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:18,250
and then six years later we're like,
I'll check it out. It's like, okay,

523
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,870
I see what you're saying.
So we just started the walking dead.

524
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,710
Yeah. And it's fantastic. And we're
like, man, I guess people had a point,

525
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,460
those 12 million or so people that
said watch it at a point. Now,

526
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,450
here's the problem with the show is
that we like to watch before bedtime,

527
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,980
and I find that it stresses
me out. I don't stressful. Can

528
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,900
I say my least favorite genre is like,

529
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,190
we have to keep running
from the evil thing, right?

530
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,270
Because I have nightmares about running
and all shows. I don't like that.

531
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,760
Those evil running and chasing things.
Hey,

532
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:51,480
chase shows usually end on a cliffhanger.
So they end with like,

533
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:55,860
wait til next week, Huh? Like you, and
then you feel like, sorry, the next one.

534
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,160
And that's what the whole fucking thing's
going to be is them running for the

535
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:02,900
next 10 years. Right? Yeah. This is
shows years and years in now. All right.

536
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,110
So what they've built like a,

537
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,520
a human land like on the Matrix and
the second we were total newbies.

538
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:12,750
Now we're fucking two episodes in.
What can possibly happen?

539
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,780
They have to kill all those.
That show is so good.

540
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Big that they started a nother show
where they talk about that show that airs

541
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:25,640
regular, like it's called like after
or beyond. Yeah, something like that.

542
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,390
And then it has,
I think it doesn't Hardwick Kosta,

543
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,110
retired week show Jesus Christ and they're
just talking about another show and

544
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:36,290
then the networks like yeah. Err
that err, err us talking about it

545
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,700
that show bananas. Yeah.
Well we have to stick to it.

546
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:42,880
I guess if I watch it early in
the evening, maybe I can do it.

547
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,800
I wish there were more movies.
I like movies,

548
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,920
my heart pounds so much when I
watched that Zombie show. Yeah. I get,

549
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,310
I get really emotional. Like I, you
guys have to run. You just keep going.

550
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:56,080
Like I hate it, but yeah, I agree. The
movie selection or fucking crap shit.

551
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,910
Yeah. When his fucking, uh, John
Debt, my WIC Dick to coming. Yeah.

552
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,290
You know, we bought it, we bought
dip my Dick in the WIC and it,

553
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,090
I remember it said April.
I Dunno,

554
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,140
I can't wait to see that one. I'm
excited for that one. That's a good one.

555
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,360
Dip My Wiccan Widdick come.

556
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,443
Um,

557
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,540
we asked you and will continue to ask
you to write reviews on iTunes because

558
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,200
it's what's fair and we deserve it.
Here's one that somebody sent into us.

559
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,890
Uh,
Mommy's,

560
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,210
I thought you would appreciate my review.
Here's what he wrote.

561
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,200
Calling all come dogs and ugly suck pigs.

562
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,960
Your Mom's house podcast is here for you.

563
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,870
Have you ever wondered if
there's any common those balls?

564
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,420
Everyone is just fluid bomb with Jesse.

565
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,200
Ever wished a mentally ill
girl could talk to Hitler

566
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,960
as a child? Did you make your own
poop pile for the neighbors to admire?

567
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,080
Do you have big old mushy purples?

568
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,210
What about sloppers meet hangers? Tits
for days. Do you have Dick for days?

569
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,190
Do you find cops to be all bald and shit?
When you're Puerto Rican,

570
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,970
you are just Puerto Rican. Uh,
excuse me. When you're Puerto Rican,

571
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,780
are you just Puerto Rican?
Are you dirty and disgusting?

572
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,180
Do you find yourself
farting on all the haters?

573
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,730
How do you feel about Lincoln Din?
What's with the jeans?

574
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,440
Um, do you often instruct
strangers to kiss your pussy?

575
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,490
Have you on occasion bellowed
bikes in the presence of strangers?

576
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,380
Do you ever wonder which you are
if you answered no to any of these,

577
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,060
I don't give a shit.

578
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,380
Listen to your mommy's and you'll find
that you've been the water champ all

579
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:49,090
along. Stay thirsty. Come Dogs
Ryan. So Ryan wrote that. Ryan,

580
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:52,060
that review made me want to listen to
our show. Yeah, that was really good.

581
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,580
If I read that, I'd be like, I've got
to check this shit out. Intrigued.

582
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,040
I like all these subjects. Yeah. Good job.

583
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,510
Check this out.
I don't know if have you seen this?

584
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,460
This is um,

585
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,180
this came in with regard to our discussion
last week about taking a pilot's

586
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:16,480
license off the table. For
Fuck's sake. Here we go.

587
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,850
Dear Mr. Thompson grew up.

588
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,480
My name is Barry Brown from the law
office of Brown and Yellow family law

589
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:27,070
attorney. I am Christina possessed keys
official negotiation representative.

590
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,730
This letter is in regards to the
negotiation of ceasing and desisting from

591
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:34,420
acquiring a pilot license.

592
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,810
We would like to officially reject your
first offer of one blow job per week for

593
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,680
the sum of three years.

594
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,040
This would equate to 156 blow jobs to
be delivered over a sum of 1095 days.

595
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,000
This amount of fellatio
is extremely unreasonable.

596
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,320
We consulted a professional and
April 20th doctor Throat Zilla.

597
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,360
She deemed this activity to be excessive
and dangerous for an amateur and only

598
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:03,730
to be attempted by a
professional sex worker.

599
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,260
My client and I would like to present a
counter offered to be paid over the sum

600
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:10,230
of three years,
50 blowjobs to completion.

601
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,770
These blow jobs will be accompanied by
verbal stimulation with such sayings as

602
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,650
where's the com?
Do you have any come when those balls,

603
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,980
five of these said blowjobs will be wake
you up in the morning. Bj's, Oh wow.

604
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,830
50 hand jobs to completion,

605
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,720
cheese lubricant of your choice and as
a bonus on Thompson for his birthday and

606
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:32,290
the third year of the agreement,
Christina participates in pup play.

607
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,950
This will include fitting Tom for a tail
and they walk around the neighborhood

608
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:38,740
on a leash in parentheses,
nothing sexual.

609
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,580
You feel this is more than generous
and I'd like to remind you that your

610
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,390
relationships are about compromise and
look forward to finding a resolution.

611
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,280
The two parties can agree upon.
Sincerely,

612
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,450
Barry Brown from Brown and yellow
family law. I love, I didn't,

613
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,500
I didn't know. I know, I didn't
know you retain counsel retain.

614
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,240
Yeah, he's working on
retainer. It's, you know what,

615
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,230
we sat down and we came up with these,
I hope you're okay with these terms.

616
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,060
Well you'll be hearing from my attorney.

617
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,320
So I mean that's fair is fair.
This was,

618
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:16,321
I'm also very surprising to me and we
had a pretty impromptu but in detailed

619
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:23,350
conversation with each other
and then with my dad and uh,

620
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,620
with Charro about folding
or scrunching paper,

621
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,230
it's a no brainer.
And guess what?

622
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,980
Guess what I found out from my mother
and then they called me little Jane

623
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,270
went home. She's a scratcher. No, yes,

624
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,040
no. My mom called me. She goes, just
would not believe this. And she said she,

625
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,770
I guess she poked in or you know,
Jane's on the can and then she's like,

626
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,710
she uses a mountain of paper,
like,

627
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,400
like just tons of it and she's
a scrunch or I don't have a,

628
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,850
it's not a moral thing.
It's not a waster thing.

629
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,670
It's about scrunching versus folding.
I don't care about the environment.

630
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,060
My problem is it's not practical because
the pool can touch your fingers if it's

631
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:13,550
scrunched yellow, brown all
over your feet. Guess what?

632
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,530
This is apparently a worldwide discussion.
You're kidding.

633
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,770
Have you seen this?
You mean we started a worldwide debate.

634
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,570
Debbie squared

635
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:37,510
[inaudible] Scott

636
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,130
are a

637
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,390
nation divided,
some scratch or this full crazy where,

638
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,410
what country is that? Uh,
obviously that's fucking the UK.

639
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,840
You just looked in the title. Yeah.
You said what country is that?

640
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,260
How many could it be?
Because it could be Ozzy.

641
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,660
It could be Kiwi because
that was a playful UK accent.

642
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:05,660
It wasn't a strict Royal British accent.

643
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,580
I mean you as a low quote master of all
people should know. Of course. I know,

644
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,440
but it's, yeah, they're
usually, I'm tired.

645
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:16,850
I thought for sure
Australia cause you know,

646
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:18,620
they're kind of more fun
about stuff like that.

647
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:21,560
But you could tell that accident was in
Australia. I don't know. Like I said,

648
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:25,340
it was a very playful, very playful fuck.
You live there and you don't even know.

649
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,550
No, no clue. It's a, it's hard.
It's, and then you got your,

650
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:32,720
well she got your Yorkshire. Good,
good Yorkshire Lass. You, by the way,

651
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,680
I am soliciting,
uh,

652
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,730
for the benefit of our
show to your mom's house.

653
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,340
A Nice,

654
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,040
we want you to write reviews on iTunes.

655
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,390
It is a benefit to this show.
We want it,

656
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm asking you to write a review and uh,

657
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,080
you know, we'll keep learning
the industry fucking retarded.

658
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,060
Can I tell you the thought that I had
while I was sick? Sure. First of all,

659
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:13,490
I just want to share this, that, okay.
So I was sick for like fucking 14 days.

660
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:17,060
I didn't, I wasn't getting
any better really. That was,

661
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:18,620
that was weird and gnarly.

662
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:23,450
And then one morning I woke up and I
blew my nose and it was like fluorescent

663
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:26,600
yellow. It was like a
highlighter marker. Dude. I,

664
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:31,100
I'm in 40 years of existence. I
have, I wanted to show you so bad.

665
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,980
It was one of those things

666
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,390
I was so proud of and I've, I panicked
and went to the doctor immediately. Um,

667
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,360
but in that,
in the interim of like having this cold,

668
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:43,170
I was picking my nose and awful lot and
then it was like almost to a point where

669
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,810
like, I knew something was wrong.
Like I was, I was definitely,

670
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,050
it was becoming too much of a habit.
And then I thought to myself like,

671
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,400
am I going to stretch out
my nostrils forever? Right.

672
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,050
The Google that because my texts and my
friend, uh, and she was like, oh my God,

673
00:44:58,051 --> 00:44:58,290
Dude,

674
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,590
I've been picking my nose a lot too
because of allergies and I'm wondering if

675
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:04,080
I'm going to permanently
stretch out my nostrils.

676
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:08,390
And my dad told me when I was a kid that
he's like, don't pick your nose so much.

677
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:11,430
Are going to widen the nostrils.
Yeah.

678
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,140
What did you find going gonna look like
your uncle Steve because he used to pick

679
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:16,974
his nose.

680
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,420
That's what my dad said that because
my uncle picked his nose a lot,

681
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,030
his nostrils became bigger and you know,

682
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,490
here's something in your formative
years and you believe it.

683
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,410
So I googled it and it said no.
The fact that it's not possible.

684
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,110
You'd have to be doing it like all day,
every day to make an impact.

685
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:39,750
And I can disagree with me.
I feel like you look in my nostrils now,

686
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,550
aren't they enormous?
I think pregnancy made them bigger.

687
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,750
Get bigger. Your coach, you can
gauge your ear Lobes, right?

688
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:53,820
People stretch out ear lobes. That's
what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.

689
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,770
I have enormous nostrils.
Yours are big and hairy,

690
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,670
but I feel like I grew in the last,
I'm serious since I got Prager's.

691
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,210
My nose grew and I feel like my nostrils.
Oh, look how big they are. Yeah.

692
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:12,110
You're just kind of look like, let's look.
You have a prosthetic nose. Really? Yeah.

693
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:17,050
It looks like it's so, you know like
Steve Martin in that movie? Yeah.

694
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,960
Movie Ponzel Roxanne.
Yeah.

695
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,860
No,
yours is big and uneven.

696
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,550
It looks like the right nostril is
twice as large as the left. Actually,

697
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:33,630
everyone's nostrils are different.
Sides of my face is perfectly symmetrical.

698
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,610
I'm the symmetrical champion. I don't know
about that. Yeah. My body, my everything.

699
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:41,550
Symmetry. I'm like a
model. I'm perfect. No.

700
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,090
Do you know that one of my legs is
significantly shorter than the other?

701
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,500
My right leg is about
an inch or more shorter,

702
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,030
and I went to the chiropractor.

703
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:53,800
You're going to get one of those a
handicap placards for the corner.

704
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,730
I wish. God, do you think I
can? Does this qualify me?

705
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,870
So it's about time.
I wonder if it's hard to be,

706
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:08,370
we'll need retarded placards. Let
everybody know. Jesus. Wait, so you,

707
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,790
you agree with me that, that
picking your nose a lot? Definitely.

708
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:15,140
If you do it enough,
I mean,

709
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,960
I guess it also depends on the
size of the finger. I mean,

710
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,110
you shove a big dogs in a bunch
of big old dogs and your coach,

711
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,040
you can stretch it out.

712
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,280
Why can't you shove a big a finger in
your nostril and stretch it out? Well,

713
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:28,020
here's the difference, Tom,
and I like your reasoning.

714
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,370
I like your train of thought.
Yeah. The Vagina, however,

715
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:34,920
is a muscle and can go back to,
it's some kind of losers.

716
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:40,120
Loser. Poundings yeah,
multiple accounting's all
day. This isn't a nostril.

717
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:44,420
This is cartilage. And so again, I just,
I feel like that again, the ear lobe is,

718
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:48,250
seems to be more, most similar to
this. Yeah. If you're a doctor,

719
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:53,170
can you write and let us know if I've
made my nostrils bigger by picking and if

720
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:57,610
pregnancy can in fact make your nostrils
bigger. I feel like it, I feel like it's,

721
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,230
yes. Yeah. Yeah. He just
intuitive of course. Of course.

722
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,060
It's one of life's biggest questions.

723
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,140
It's, it feels like it should be an easy
answer. And I think that answer is yes.

724
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,810
Um, this is kind of a dad
Boehner thing where I kind of,

725
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:18,150
I've got to tell you, this is one of
the first Dad Boehner clips where I,

726
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,250
I feel like I'm aligned with this person.
Really stoked about,

727
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,040
look at that.
Look at that in a shine in us of that.

728
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:35,370
It's an ounce. It's amazing,
isn't it stuck and what a
feat of engineering. Yeah,

729
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,680
I agree. E I t five p I. E.

730
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,240
Chief five pain.
Haley.

731
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,850
I did staggering

732
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,100
tiger.
He's,

733
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,250
he's holding up if you're listening
is that he's holding up nail clippers.

734
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,200
But I feel like I've had this,

735
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,180
that type of thought before about things
like that and maybe even nail clippers

736
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:59,230
themselves.
But you're like,

737
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,560
this is an incredible tool that is mass
produced that we would have no idea how

738
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:10,000
to do this without that. Um, and wouldn't,
none of us could build one of those.

739
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,530
Yeah.

740
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,350
Can we make it so cheap? Did a
shine in. I shed that match. Oh,

741
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:18,570
look at the engineering. I know.
I agree. The inclined plane.

742
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,580
It's amazing.

743
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,980
Oh Shit.
He's so good.

744
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,040
So just start in a day saying go
make one of them be there for a week.

745
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,200
I know for a month. I know Mike
[inaudible] is good as I know. Yeah.

746
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,220
Awesome Metaphor for life. This was
such a amazing, it's staggering.

747
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:42,890
It knows no bounds, but it's cheap. Cheap,

748
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,800
cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap,
cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap,

749
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:51,490
cheap, cheap light. Check in check.

750
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,690
Like fucking chicken.
Oh,

751
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,460
oh, oh. Why

752
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,170
I t five bay last.

753
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:10,280
What life is worth us.
What fucking line.

754
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,323
Yeah.

755
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,560
Yes. The first time a dad
boner. I've nodded along.

756
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Hi. Great. I love his enthusiasm. I
share his enthusiasm for that. Yeah,

757
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,990
that was rad. I mean, what other
things are there where you're like,

758
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,710
holy fucking shit.
Pens. That was my first,

759
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,140
that was my first thought
when I was thinking,

760
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,050
what else is that like you take pens
for granted, pair, amazing paper clips.

761
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:41,300
Some motherfucker was like, let's make
this shit then and then do that like that.

762
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:45,440
And now I can hold fucking papers to
talk about a stapler. Scotch tape.

763
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:50,180
Amaz hairbrush Amaz
like everything we use,

764
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,323
uh,

765
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:56,280
bandaids so that you booboos
don't get infected toothbrushes.

766
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:00,080
How are low or Ular,
but that,

767
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,610
that is a feat of human engineering
for sure. I mean, how he's right.

768
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:09,410
If someone was like, hey,
build a Nalco, no fucking idea.

769
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,870
And it looks simple and
that's why it's deceptive.

770
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,100
Remember on the Great British baking show?

771
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,080
Because everything leads back there
at when they're like, make a pretzel.

772
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,250
And that's something you see a
hundred times in a mall. Right?

773
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:25,940
Because we were there a lot. I couldn't
recreate the shape of a pretzel.

774
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:27,410
I don't know exactly how,

775
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,200
but you see it somewhat that
some version of it be be like,

776
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:31,210
that doesn't look right.
Right.

777
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,770
It's like the thing you take for granted
all the time. It looks so simple,

778
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:37,280
but it's not coffee.
I want a coffee right now.

779
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,810
I know you drink a lot of coffee.

780
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,350
Does your piece smell all the time like
it does cause one time you peed in the

781
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,780
shower with me and it smelled like
someone. I'll be honest, coffee.

782
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,370
I was probably drinking too much coffee
and I focus on the counterbalance more.

783
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:54,290
Now you bounce it out more. Yeah. You
have to rehydrate after you dehydrate.

784
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,070
You Nasty.
I love this guy.

785
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,840
I love him. I love it. I love it.
I had the horrible misfortune of,

786
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:11,120
of all the millions of times I've
dropped my iPhone and I'd do it a lot.

787
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,500
I can't believe that. Go ahead.
That it finally shattered.

788
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,030
I broke the screen on my iPhone and
you know when you do it at first,

789
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,550
like there's a moment of disbelief.
Like I,

790
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,960
it took me about a week to come to terms
with the fact that I broke it, you know,

791
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:31,070
like to just, it was like the stages
of grief. Like I have to do something.

792
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,260
You know why I,
I had the stages of grief,

793
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:36,560
that Kubler Ross thing because I don't
want to go to the fucking apple store.

794
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,790
Like that's my nightmare is making
the fucking appointment showing up.

795
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,930
And then the,
the,

796
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:46,250
the search for who works here
and then just making eye contact,

797
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:50,780
hoping that that person's an employee
with a ponytail and then just go stand

798
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:54,470
over there. That's my family knows
stand over day and said, by the way,

799
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,520
the lack of structure, goddammit, this
is what is upsetting the apple store.

800
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,600
It gives me so much anxiety.
We're not a regular store.

801
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,440
We have our own thing going on here.
No, no, no. Give me the regular store.

802
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:11,210
Let me stand in line
and let me know where I am in line,

803
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,320
how much time I have kind of
go to that. Fuck you. Yeah.

804
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,850
And I'll tell you what else can
irritate the shit out of me.

805
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,280
So when I had that audio
trouble with this one,

806
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:23,540
I was also having audio
trouble by my other one. So I
go, I'm going to bring both.

807
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,160
When I pick up the one that's

808
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,200
fixed,
this one I go,

809
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:31,260
can you take a look at this other one?

810
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,500
[inaudible] you gotta you
gotta make another appointment.

811
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,410
You can go over to that table and sit
there. I'm like, well you're right here.

812
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:40,590
Can't you just can't I just leave
it with you. It's fucked up.

813
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:42,330
Just fix it the way you fix this one.

814
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,300
Cause that's outside of the wacky way
we do. We don't do things traditionally.

815
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,570
We don't do things the way that
would make sense to do them. No,

816
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:55,260
I like tradition guys. Let me know
where to go and where to stand in line.

817
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:59,620
And then the worst is when you activate
a device. I activated my mom, watch,

818
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,201
go,

819
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:06,201
go stand at that table and then it's one
employee and then five old people like

820
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,730
me, like I don't know how
to put in my password.

821
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:13,560
And then she has to divvy up her time
between the five poor girl, old people,

822
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,550
some poor millennial has to
help you figure it all out.
And then the guy's like,

823
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,060
dammit. She goes, I've been there
sitting next to guys since she goes in,

824
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:25,260
then you know your password. Now you
don't know your password. Uh, no.

825
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,400
Uh,
granddaughter's name is Brandy.

826
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,370
And then they're like,
okay, we can try that.

827
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:37,740
And then I saw this old lady who had the
tiniest iPhone there ever was like the

828
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,490
first one, you know, it's like,
uh, just a, an an inch of this.

829
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,060
And she's like,
but I wanted to work again.

830
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:49,450
Like she was some foreign lady and
the guy and the guy was like, oh yeah,

831
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:53,430
I know that your motherboard is fried.
You need to buy a whole new phone.

832
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,760
And she's like, but go god,
magnus, one word, please,

833
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:01,200
please make the one word that I have.
Like she couldn't come to Jesus on it.

834
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:05,040
Like, please don't make
me spend $800. Please,

835
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,120
please just let me have my old ass phone.
Make it work please.

836
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,030
And that's all you're thinking when you
go in there and just please make this,

837
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,830
make my life right again. Just
make my life okay. Oh, oh,

838
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:21,500
okay. Oh, by the way, I wanted
to mention this. So I was, um,

839
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:26,040
when I, a few weeks ago maybe
that this point a month or so ago,

840
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,060
I had these shows coming up that
were for Seattle and Portland.

841
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:35,340
So I reached out this great artist in
Philadelphia, Paul greenies. And I go,

842
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,250
I go, Hey, do you want to do a poster?

843
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,120
We've worked together before on other
posters. And he said, yeah, he goes,

844
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:43,530
any ideas? Cause he always
says like, you know,

845
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:47,720
is there anything you want incorporate?
And at the time I remember that, um,

846
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,860
everybody has been mentioning
that whenever I put up
photos to promote my shows,

847
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,380
they're all pre weight loss. So
they're all like, man, none of your,

848
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,130
your pictures look like you. Yeah. And
like, you know, so I just mentioned, I go,

849
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,960
well, you know, I haven't had
anything that reflects my weight loss.

850
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,240
I'm like,
just nothing.

851
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,660
So far everything has been like
photos that were taken before.

852
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,970
That's all I gave him.
And then he made this.

853
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:24,040
I love it. I love it.
And so it's me with some

854
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,440
glass and, and I look like
I'm 130 pounds. It's gaunt.

855
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,910
Anyways,
it's a beautiful poster.

856
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,730
I had some left over from yeah,

857
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:39,620
look like from that tour. Uh,
it's uh, it's screen printed. It,

858
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,260
it's super high quality paper and
I signed a whole batch of them,

859
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:45,790
so if you want them,

860
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:50,760
they're in our store right now.
Um,

861
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,540
it's a great poster related. Amazing. Uh,

862
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:58,860
and there's a bunch of, uh,
let me see if this is a,

863
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,750
there's some other things that
are in there, but check it out.

864
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,290
There's a bunch of things, but
that poster is, is brand new shirt.

865
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:09,220
Don't forget that one. Yeah. And Gene,
I tell you that sweatshirt, the jeans,

866
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,350
sweatshirt is my favorite thing ever.
It's beautiful.

867
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,030
It's always in the hamper I got, I wear
it so frequently. Yeah. It's my favorite.

868
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,950
It's a pretty fucking, a lot of
people have been getting the, the,

869
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,030
the established is that now.
That's how I say that.

870
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:30,130
It's 100. I've been in conversations
where it's about to come out naturally.

871
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:32,590
Like I'm not thinking about our
show and I'll be like, you know,

872
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:35,530
you kinda got a wonder if you have the,
you know,

873
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,460
the wherewithal to do it.

874
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,630
I'll stop and I'll be like, I'm
not sure I can't, I'm not sure yet.

875
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,550
Well now I have to go. I say the word
stand on my head and then I go, oh,

876
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:52,390
it's stamina. I have to
reverse it. And people are, uh,

877
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,500
have sent in like one guy sending a
video of him at the gym and he's like,

878
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:58,470
I'm going to kill this lift.
I have to stand in line.

879
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,490
And you know that people don't generally,

880
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:05,410
like that kind of shirt is all
fucking wrong. We'll look, uh,

881
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,010

sure near there. Nope.

925
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,670
But uh, yeah, I mean they're close enough.

926
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:14,220
If you're in any of those areas,
make the drive and uh,

927
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,610
it's going to be a fun, fun night. We're
going to do the podcast live in Florida,

928
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:22,540
so it's not often that we get to
travel that far and do the show,

929
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,670
but we're doing it.
That'd be fine.

930
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:28,430
In Indian River County. I forgot
it was called that dude. Yeah.

931
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,850
Florida is so fucking
weird, man. You know,

932
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,100
I mean from the minute you get off
the plane. I love Florida by the way.

933
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:38,960
It's not la. I mean, you know. No
worries. But I do like, I enjoy it.

934
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,740
Yeah. It's so weird. You seem
so happy just hearing about
it. Yeah. I like Florida,

935
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,930
man. I, I like the weather. I
like the people. It's like a,

936
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,740
it's kind of swampy and spooky are
so happy. Weird that I, Oh shit.

937
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,770
Goddamn Bruce Thompson

938
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:57,320
scientist video series continues
our look at chemicals on the cheap.

939
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:58,820
So if you're a cash,

940
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:02,570
it is essential in a home lab both
as a reagent and it's a precursor for

941
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:04,070
synthesizing other chemicals.

942
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:09,200
Until recently I recommended battery
acid is a good source. Battery acid,

943
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:12,590
it's about 35% concentration
and relatively pure.

944
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:15,140
And it was cheap a few years ago.

945
01:02:15,141 --> 01:02:20,040
Five gallon jugs sold for 15 or $20
in gallon jugs when only $6 or so

946
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,880
recently a lot of doors
and found the price.

947
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:27,630
It's sky rocketed to about 15 years.
It makes it extra boring

948
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,610
his face.
Yeah.

949
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:34,140
The fact that he hasn't moved a muscle
and he hasn't blank to the entire time.

950
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,780
How do you stay that still
dead eyes?

951
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:44,040
God looks like fucked up shit.

952
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:48,430
I think he molests children to Jesus.
I wasn't going there.

953
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,430
I think he molests retarded children.
That's creepy.

954
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,630
He looks creepy and we're
going to get emails like, Hey,

955
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:58,200
that's rob the chemical go. And so
it was gonna be like, that's my dad.

956
01:02:58,201 --> 01:02:59,034
You asshole.

957
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,330
Well, your dad's creepy as fuck scissors.

958
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:09,740
Another amazing adventure. Notice
I'm wearing very heavy rubber gloves,

959
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,793
acid

960
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,640
addition to burn.
Your voice is so monotone.

961
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,260
It's also an extremely hydrating agents,

962
01:03:24,261 --> 01:03:28,810
so it literally sucks the water out
of your skin and charge it. Whoa. Wow.

963
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,660
Don't mess around in fight club
with concentrated sulfuric acid.

964
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,910
There you go. I think that's
what happened in fight club.

965
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,860
The concentrated sulfuric acid poison on
the Tyler Durden is hand Tyler pours it

966
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:43,670
on Jim Norton's hand. Isn't that what
they did? Jim Norton? You mean Ed Norton

967
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,310
wrong with you?
I do that all the time.

968
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,120
And then we heard,
um,

969
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,690
Jimmy Dean Stanton on
the radio the other day.

970
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:05,600
Oh yeah, the sausage. Jimmy Dean
Morgan Sausage. Jeffrey Jeffrey, James,

971
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:09,410
Jimmy Morgan's, Jimmy Dean sausage.
That's who it is. Jimmy Dean sausage.

972
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:14,370
Jeffrey gains. Jeffrey Dean
Sausage. Morgan sausage. Yeah.

973
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,670
Um, I have some, would you
rathers come on, man. Really?

974
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,360
You want to do it? Would you rather what
is, you have something else you wanna do?

975
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,253
No, go ahead. Go ahead.

976
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,420
The top layer.

977
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:48,280
Your sister,

978
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,820
grandmother walks masturbating.

979
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,440
Never have another orgasm.

980
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:01,520
[inaudible]

981
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,440
are you ready? Yup.
Okay. Would you rather,

982
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,660
every time you see somebody, and this
can be like you're walking the dogs,

983
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:18,040
which never happens, but you're
out with a kid and just a neighbor

984
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,180
passes by you.

985
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,630
And every time you see another human
being and they get within your shot,

986
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:28,030
you rep all loud fart. Okay. One of your
morning farts, like you fucking blasted.

987
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:28,883
Okay,
okay.

988
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:34,290
Or every time you see Ellis
you get so you get so excited

989
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:35,843
that you vomit.

990
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:42,710
Okay.
Or every time you see Ellis,

991
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,040
you get so excited that you vomit all
over yourself. I don't even see that.

992
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:49,910
How you have the nerve to
pitch something like that.

993
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:55,330
Being that you have such a
ridiculous phobia for the eye,

994
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,500
you know, even that concept. I mean,

995
01:05:57,501 --> 01:06:01,450
you get so you get man. Yeah, I know,

996
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:05,720
but that's why it's called Woodridge.
Just Game Babes game. It's not reality.

997
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,360
Rather. No, I'm not listening to them.

998
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:24,070
You're so happy that you're able
to take them off lies and lies.

999
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,940
I promise you I'm not so either.
I'm, I've fart within earshot.

1000
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,190
Anytime I see anyone. Anyway, so you're,

1001
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,270
you're at the airport and it
just try every new person.

1002
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,660
Welcome to the planner. Whenever
I see my son, I vomit. Yeah,

1003
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,430
you get so excited that you
eventually vomit on yourself. No fart.

1004
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,940
I would eventually
learned to deal with that.

1005
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:54,690
Like the embarrassment would
become second nature. You know,

1006
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:58,380
it's like somebody has like a fucking
goiter on their neck and it's like,

1007
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:01,380
oh my God. But after they have that
for like a year, they're like, yeah,

1008
01:07:01,381 --> 01:07:05,280
I got this fucking thing on my neck.
You know, and like people look at it,

1009
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:06,660
it's embarrassing.
I don't care anymore.

1010
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,230
That's how those farts on
the positive side, you know,

1011
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:11,640
every time you come out on stage,

1012
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:16,540
you rip a huge into the mic and it's Tom
Cigarette fighting comedian, comedian.

1013
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:21,120
It becomes a hug plus chicks.
There's chicks would be like,

1014
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,500
this guy is pretty fucking cool.

1015
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:28,140
Women love burning guys like the
guys that, that Fart openers.

1016
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,970
Now I don't have to keep farting.
Right. So I can, you know,

1017
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,450
keep framing every time you
have a question about that,

1018
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,330
because you said like every new person,

1019
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,540
so I had a show do I farted
like a thousand times? If
there's a thought that yes.

1020
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:46,020
Now that I think about every
time you look at somebody,

1021
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,750
so you've got to pick like five
people to look at you like, Hey,

1022
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:51,480
make the show room pitch black.
I don't want to see anybody that's,

1023
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:55,530
that's your work around. Okay,
that's true. Of course I'm farting.

1024
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,700
What are you doing? Is it even worth
the time our nanny comes? It comes in.

1025
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,160
Yeah, you get used to it. She'd
be like, yeah, he's a nice guy.

1026
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,930
We go to the playground, Ellis and he
see another parent. You flirt. I mean,

1027
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,920
it's going to hurt. It's going
to ruin your life. That's great.

1028
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:16,190
Did you come up with that? No Way. Would
you have answer it though? What's yours?

1029
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,340
Well, obviously funding because
of my severe phobia of vomiting,

1030
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:23,360
God damn severe metaphor.
I'll balance this.

1031
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,920
Where yours listener ones. Okay. So people
have been submitting them as well. Okay.

1032
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,920
So, and then we'll go back and
forth. Uh, somebody's rights.

1033
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:35,950
Would you rather read the entire iTunes
update agreement from top to bottom?

1034
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,640
Every word no skimming.
So funny.

1035
01:08:41,641 --> 01:08:43,940
I'm like God or a shit.

1036
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:48,140
Listen to Frank Sinatra and Garth Brooks.
Oh Man.

1037
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:50,540
One after another.
For the amount of time it would rate.

1038
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:54,020
Take you to read the iTunes of
Green Nolan from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

1039
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:57,830
You know,

1040
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:02,180
I'm one of those people who might find
it interesting to try and understand the

1041
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:06,800
iTunes agreement.
What I get very angry at.

1042
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,860
Um,
auditory assaults like that.

1043
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:12,880
Like it would enrage me
to listen to Garth and uh,

1044
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,350
and then you throw on you be 40
and I would just be like, oh,

1045
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,590
I think it takes to read the iTunes
agreement. I mean, it's possible.

1046
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:22,320
It's easy to get to scroll on. It's
on your phone, but that phone snap,

1047
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:24,770
do I have to understand it? Oh,
you don't have to understand it.

1048
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:28,580
You've got to read every word. I'm
a quick reader. I'm not like you.

1049
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:32,630
I don't have to sound everything out and
can move my lips. When I read to myself.

1050
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,710
It might take 10 minutes. It's fine.
I went to law school for two weeks.

1051
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:37,220
Don't forget,

1052
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,310
that's like reading an iTunes agreement
every fucking day to the iTunes

1053
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:44,810
agreement. It just upsets me. The whole
thing. The idea of reading it upsets me.

1054
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:48,710
Yeah. Yeah. It's all like legal jargon
and yeah, and I was a paralegal,

1055
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:53,690
so it doesn't bother me. Holly's like you
have any qualifications for that stuff?

1056
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:58,220
No, I don't, but I, I was an
immigration parents. So what?
It's still intrigues you.

1057
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:02,920
It doesn't intrigue me, but I mean,
I've read boring stuff like, yeah, no.

1058
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,840
So 100% I would listen to Garth
and frank for that amount of time.

1059
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,760
Yeah. I'm not much of a reader, Huh? Yeah.

1060
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:13,250
Well not breeding fucking
iTunes agreements.

1061
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,310
I can't believe you're signing up
for that. I do it for fun right now.

1062
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,130
You'd read the iTunes agreement,
pull it up. I'll take a look.

1063
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:24,110
I'll let you know when it says God.
K. Yeah. Okay. What'd you rather,

1064
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,810
every time you leave the grocery store,

1065
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:28,520
are you listening to me or are
you paying attention? Yeah.

1066
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,910
Every time you leave the grocery store.
Okay,

1067
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,760
and someone's pitching some nonsense,

1068
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:39,850
you have to stop and fully give
them your presence and listen to,

1069
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:44,210
they'll hold children,
save the bees,

1070
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,800
save the tsunami, whatever. The other
thing, and then you have to donate the,

1071
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,130
Oh my God, what's wrong
with you? This is so good.

1072
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,630
You have to do this for the rest of
your life. Every time. Every time.

1073
01:10:56,631 --> 01:11:00,050
They're out here, everywhere. Everywhere.
I know trader Joe's, trader, sorry,

1074
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:00,884
Trader Joe.

1075
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:03,740
You got to go to whole foods and you got
to listen to the whole spiel and then

1076
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:07,400
you have to do whatever it is they want
you to do every so there's no hurrying

1077
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,160
out of the grocery store is when
I saw you that lately, by the way,

1078
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:14,250
I've noticed that.
I must be giving off a do not

1079
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,170
even think about photography because
I have noticed them skipping me a lot.

1080
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,540
Like I walk out and there'll be
two of them and they'll be like,

1081
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,430
go talk to another person.
Well,

1082
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:30,510
your beard makes you look angry in
medicine and you probably just look angry.

1083
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,860
Yeah. Yeah. You're not like, I've
told you this before. You're not fun.

1084
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:39,060
You're not engaging. You're not
friendly. You're not social.

1085
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,320
That's what a personality.

1086
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,050
Other people see me full of shit and they
approached me. They want to talk to me.

1087
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:50,790
They want a hug. No, very huggable.
Kissable enjoyable's of human. Okay.

1088
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,340
You know that. That's not true
about you. That's so true.

1089
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:56,870
I'm so many know that that's not true
about you. I'm so between the two of us,

1090
01:11:56,871 --> 01:12:01,140
likable. Everybody would rather spend
time with me. Not True Bait. That's not,

1091
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:05,700
oh my God. I'm talking about like in the
comedy club world, they're always like,

1092
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:10,390
how's that fucking? All I hear is Tom hate
me. No, you know Tom doesn't hate you.

1093
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:14,010
He hates everybody. Okay. So it's
either this for the rest of your life.

1094
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:16,590
Every time you go to the grocery store
you have to do that. It's a really good,

1095
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:17,070
by the way,

1096
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:22,070
really good one kill or once a week you
have to go to the apple store to either

1097
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:26,370
have something repaired
or to buy something,

1098
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:30,840
but without an appointment.
Oh my God.

1099
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:34,840
Once a week or every time you go there
as both robbing you of time. Yeah.

1100
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,760
That's the whole point.
Aggravating and they're going to,

1101
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,420
they're going to wear on your
last nerve and it's a hassle.

1102
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,060
I'm trying to think which one
would I rather do. It's horrible.

1103
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,980
It's an excellent with your other,
because they're both equally undesirable.

1104
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:55,020
Horrible. I think might end up
murdering of parking lot petitioner.

1105
01:12:56,070 --> 01:13:00,540
I mean at least in the apple store,
I'm acquiring a toy.

1106
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:04,020
You know, like in the grocery
store I'm acquiring a necessity.

1107
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,460
It's probably you have to food and
things for the house like that,

1108
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:10,080
but it's a toy.

1109
01:13:10,081 --> 01:13:14,610
So maybe I can look at the toy reward
as like that's the payoff here.

1110
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:18,000
I mean,
you get some cool gadget here pretty soon,

1111
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:22,520
and every once in a while I'll
land in there when there isn't a,

1112
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,080
I'm a crazy three hour
line to do something.

1113
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:29,160
And here's your workaround to you could,
you can game the system,

1114
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:31,630
find out when the low
traffic times are right.

1115
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:35,150
Maybe it's right when the store opens
at 9:00 AM at the mall. So yeah.

1116
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,000
My problem with the parking lot,
uh,

1117
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:41,070
petitioners is that I feel
like they work from this.

1118
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:46,430
They like to the worst shape come
from a guilt place begins with those.

1119
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:51,430
Sometimes they'll say like, I'll be
walking to my car and they'll say, uh,

1120
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,590
do you know that there's
300,000 kids in Los Angeles?

1121
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,750
They don't have a place to sleep tonight.
And I'm like, no. Yeah, wouldn't you?

1122
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:05,220
Like, wouldn't you like to be able
to do something about that? No. No.

1123
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:11,010
Well, now you can. So they're just like,
they're just guilting you. They're not,

1124
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,010
they're not like sharing

1125
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,490
information with you at the farm. Make you
feel bad. Of course, of course. It's all,

1126
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:19,180
it's all manipulation. Do you want to
donate a dollar to the save the teachers?

1127
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:22,810
Now I give money to teachers. I do, but
I feel like save the children. Like do,

1128
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:25,690
I'm saving my kid right now. Like
I'm, I'm wrapped up in a toddler.

1129
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,550
It's a full time job. I'm taking care
of my children so don't worry about it.

1130
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:35,440
Okay. Someone else submitted.
Wait, why did you choose apple?

1131
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:39,820
100% man. Apple. I have to
say that I don't enjoy the,

1132
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,160
here's what I hate so much
about the apple store.

1133
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:46,420
I don't like the mall driving to the mall,
parking at the mall

1134
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:53,030
and dealing with it. I would rather do
the parking lot. So listen work. Yeah.

1135
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,170
Cause I'd make friends and because
I'm friendly with everybody,

1136
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:00,730
cause I'm such a good personality
and I'd, you know, I'd make it fun.

1137
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,030
You should met both of us

1138
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,920
and fold them assigned to interviews.
Well we just see like who really,

1139
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:12,380
really who they think has a
better personality. Right?

1140
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,590
I mean it's obvious it's me because I,

1141
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,790
I actually don't believe that
you believe that now people are,

1142
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:23,860
you have a much more cold.
Yes. You have a much more cold,

1143
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:28,000
much more cutoff,
much less engaging in warm personality.

1144
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,860
And you know it, you're always like
Tommy, you go talk to them. Oh,

1145
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:33,400
it's not because you're
a better personality,

1146
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:36,010
but because sometimes I don't
want to deal with that person. No,

1147
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:39,760
because you're just, you're more of a
curmudgeon. You're more like a wreck,

1148
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:44,470
loose that you know, you can't you, oh,
I'm a loner for sure. Yeah. Well, I mean,

1149
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:48,020
on and on. I enjoy a lot of people's
coats. Ted Bundy. I mean there's, there's,

1150
01:15:48,021 --> 01:15:52,630
there's your, you have that same kind
of am the alone champ. I definitely,

1151
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,440
but I'm very selective of
who I spend my free time.

1152
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:58,240
I had a handful of friends
that I've had since I was 14.

1153
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,850
People don't like you in general though.
I would say that's not true, I think.

1154
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:03,430
But I think I make a great impression.
Um,

1155
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,360
like a cursory sort of surface friend.
Absolutely.

1156
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:10,210
Ask anybody at the comedy store if there,
who do you like better?

1157
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:13,120
Tom And Christina? Not Comedy
wise, like who's Funnier,

1158
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:17,380
but who do you like as a person who's
a better personality? Hands Down,

1159
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,243
I'm going to win that.

1160
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,000
Keep going and okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1161
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:29,740
Would you add there?
Be Skinny and eat whatever you want.

1162
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,640
You can eat whatever you want and
stay then and not have to exercise,

1163
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,840
but your poor kinda stay poor
for the rest of your life.

1164
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:42,220
Or you're rich.
You can eat whatever the fuck you want.

1165
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:46,900
You can exercise, but you'll
always stay fat. Say you're fat,

1166
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:51,460
but you've got like stacks. Like you're
a multimillionaire and you don't have to,

1167
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:53,590
you don't have to work.
You can work when you want,

1168
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:58,570
so it's skinny and poor or rich and
fat and you can eat what you want.

1169
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,330
In both scenarios.
I feel like for many people,

1170
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,790
this is so easy.

1171
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:09,500
And I think the only reason that it's,
I find it intriguing to me is, uh,

1172
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,010
even though I'm

1173
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,580
not skinny, I've recently lost
some weight, you know? Yeah.

1174
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,500
Well this one I designed, especially
for you, right? You're, you just,

1175
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,390
you just started to, you know, lose
some weight. You're looking better,

1176
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,020
you're feeling better. And you know
how good that feels. Oh, it's the best.

1177
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:31,220
But what would you like
to be the best version?

1178
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,800
Like the best version of that,
but you're poor,

1179
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:39,070
poor, and you can't, there's no hope like
you're and how poor qualify. Yeah. Okay.

1180
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:40,383
Uh,

1181
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,060
I mean,
you're not talking about like,

1182
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:46,840
I can't pay bills and I can't do anything
right. I mean, it's gotta be like,

1183
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:52,430
okay, you're not Bangladeshi poor.
You're not living in a cardboard box and,

1184
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,560
and, uh, defecating and shouted in Los
Angeles terms. Yeah. Korea town in 2008.

1185
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:01,130
Okay, so you were living in like
getting by Barrio, getting by,

1186
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,860
getting by in the Barrio. But
that's it. I mean, you're,

1187
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:06,920
you're locked in the rampart division.
You're living in that apartment.

1188
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,040
Jose's your landlord.
That's as high as it's ever going to get,

1189
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:14,330
but you look amazing and you
can eat anything you want.

1190
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,090
You don't have to exercise.
And you stay skinny and healthy.

1191
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,110
And that's the thing you have.

1192
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:21,890
You have all your health and you can eat
whatever you want it, but you're rich,

1193
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:26,840
rich, rich. Yes. Stacking it, but
fat, fat as fuck. And how fat.

1194
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,270
That's the other thing. Okay.
Uh, what's the heaviest?

1195
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:34,250
You don't have to say the
number, but whatever your
heaviest is. Yeah, that's what,

1196
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:38,690
that's what it's got to stay. Yeah.
That's where it stays now. Oh, sorry.

1197
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,610
Cause I have my answer. Oh,
you do? Yeah. Yeah. 100% rich.

1198
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,940
Hundred percent. Why? I mean, I, I,
you know, I remember being that fat.

1199
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:50,893
It's not that bad.

1200
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:58,700
I mean, people actually, honestly,
until we invited fat shaming,

1201
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,500
no one really gave me
a hard time about it.

1202
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:03,830
I have like one person every once in a
while I would say something on social

1203
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:07,070
media. They'd be like, you look fat
in this big. I'm like, all right. Uh,

1204
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,840
it's not that bad.

1205
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:13,880
So because I made the number
something you've already been, okay,

1206
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:17,710
let's then let know. I'm saying even
if you look, I could have gotten

1207
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:20,310
fatter and let's say in this
scenario I'm even fatter.

1208
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:24,270
I would rather have the comforts and the,

1209
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,110
the hurts of that lifestyle.
Right? Uh, and no,

1210
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:30,210
I guess that I'm going to die at any time,

1211
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:36,360
but you have enough money to kind of
do something. I can take medicine.

1212
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:37,190
That's right. Right. And I can,

1213
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,350
you ain't got the best access to
medical care and now you're fat.

1214
01:19:40,351 --> 01:19:44,580
You're not manwell your rebate. Oh, come
on. No, no. Listen, you're, maybe you're,

1215
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:48,930
you're, you're bad. You're five
bills. No, you did not. That I know.

1216
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:51,580
This is a different scenario.
So if we were driving down scenario,

1217
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,720
this is an additional question. So
we've, we've had, that question's gone.

1218
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:59,750
New Scenario. Okay. Same, same
stakes, but you're 500 no,

1219
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:03,600
definitely not. I'm not doing that. That's
too much. Yeah, that's too much. Oh wait,

1220
01:20:03,601 --> 01:20:08,190
who's 500 people on Tlc on those people

1221
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,190
that they're like, hey, maybe
in a week or two you'll die.

1222
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,560
You don't do something that's too fat.
You want to know.

1223
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:18,360
That's like for my height and frame.
What would be like,

1224
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,790
what'd be punishing for you? Yeah. I mean,

1225
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:25,791
well definitely the upper 200300300
would be like really heavy.

1226
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:31,040
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What? For
my frame? Yeah, you would be,

1227
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:33,750
you'd be like, Jesus, man, you
really need to drop some weight.

1228
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,930
How fat was like Mama June.

1229
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,970
Oh, okay. You don't know how
that is a dom delouis fat.

1230
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:46,470
Oh yeah, he's three over 300. What'd
you be damned Eloise fat? I mean,

1231
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:49,880
I wouldn't want to. Okay. What about God,

1232
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,470
you're still doing this because I'm
trying to, I don't want, I don't know,

1233
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:55,500
men's weights. Like I don't, I don't
know what 300 pounds is on a man.

1234
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:59,070
I can kind of guess on a woman. I just
don't know your weight. 300 pounds.

1235
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,880
Ooh. Like my, okay. Picture my heaviest.

1236
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,200
Another 30 something.
35 pounds basically.

1237
01:21:06,201 --> 01:21:10,730
It doesn't seem like a lot to me.
Fucking a really 35 more pounds on that.

1238
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,000
How fat was la? The Front?
Shucks. Cylance and wells. I mean,

1239
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:21,440
at that point he was probably,
he looked like he was over 300 pounds.

1240
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,740
You're Orson Welles fat. That's the
level of fat at the end of his life.

1241
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:29,150
Let's look at it.

1242
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:32,420
Okay. Um, let's see what we have here. Fat

1243
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,513
Worsen

1244
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,600
cause you would take, so
what's, what's the lure?

1245
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:42,840
It's the money that you'd rather have
money is what you're saying. Well,

1246
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:43,674
I'd rather have,

1247
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,670
um,
the,

1248
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:51,440
the comfort and the security. The
money provide. Yeah. I mean, your mind,

1249
01:21:51,441 --> 01:21:55,800
I've been very broke and,
uh,

1250
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:59,780
and I, I have no shame about
having been that broke.

1251
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:03,570
And I feel like that period
taught me a lot, a lot, uh,

1252
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,970
about myself and about life. But I never
want to go back to being broke again.

1253
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,890
Sucks. I mean, yeah,
that was terrible. So,

1254
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,340
but you heal what have you could
look the best and you'll never

1255
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,290
age shitty. Like you'll,
you'll just be hot fat.

1256
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,760
Orson Welles kind of looks like me.

1257
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:23,523
Not at all.

1258
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,160
Ah, holy. That's his leg
right there. That's kind of,

1259
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:32,750
it kind of looks like a gut because that
picture is, I see that I'm going to try.

1260
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,420
I mean, he doesn't look
good. That's him thinner.

1261
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,620
Hmm. No, that's fat. Yeah.
Let's definitely fat.
Yeah. He's, he's definitely

1262
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,580
fat there. Um hmm. I Dunno.
Let's, how about this though?

1263
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,480
How fad is he?
Um,

1264
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,090
you'd be fat and rich. So
here's the thing. I mean, yeah,
you could die anytime, but

1265
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:03,380
you've seen these commercials,
I thought, is he here?

1266
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:05,980
Faith?
It

1267
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,000
doesn't do anything.

1268
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:12,580
I remember he's got his Chyna
action that drunk underbite

1269
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:19,070
just doing anything. Sorry.
Cut. Okay. Rolling. Two,

1270
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,503
take two.

1271
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:25,470
I mean, yeah, this guy is, but he's got,
he's got to be like three bills. Yeah.

1272
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,710
So that's how fat you are. Just so,
just so you know. I would do that. Rich.

1273
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,783
It'd be awesome

1274
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,560
because the level of Richard describing
it sounds like it's so much fun. Yeah.

1275
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:38,760
You're just like Richard Brown
balling out of control. All right.

1276
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:41,370
Some big fat rich guy.
So what? Okay. It's fun.

1277
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,503
Yeah.

1278
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,940
Well you start driving it up like
you're saying. I mean that's the thing.

1279
01:23:46,941 --> 01:23:51,890
Everyone has their, their limits for
things. If you go up to 500 I'll be like,

1280
01:23:51,891 --> 01:23:54,290
no. Okay. But here's the
thing. You're skinny. Yeah.

1281
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:59,180
And you can eat as much as you want.
So I get the satisfaction of all the food.

1282
01:23:59,181 --> 01:24:04,100
I want to gain weight, but I'm
poor. So what? But I've done it.

1283
01:24:04,101 --> 01:24:06,080
I've told you I've done it.
It was a thing.

1284
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:09,590
It was a phase and I don't want to do
it again, but I know you love to eat.

1285
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:13,610
Imagine you could just eat, eat, eat, eat,
eat, eat. You don't have to gain weight.

1286
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,880
Okay. Just the free all. I
think we chose our sides then.

1287
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,030
Sounds like you chose that,
right? You'd rather be poor. Ah,

1288
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:24,920
I hate fucking being poor. Yeah. Actually
I would rather be hot and skinny.

1289
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:27,110
Then I'll just find a guy,
some fucking rich guy,

1290
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:29,660
some fridge fat guy and I'll be like,

1291
01:24:29,661 --> 01:24:32,270
let's hook up and then we'll
find each other. There you go.

1292
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:37,190
We did it and I'll marry
you. Harrison. Yo, Mary.

1293
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,760
Ah,
French champagne.

1294
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,130
There's always celebrated.

1295
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:49,520
The guy pick up the California champagne.
My Song,

1296
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:55,000
he's really good cars by Ed and I.
That same French excellence.

1297
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:59,250
The bottle don't like the
best French champagne.

1298
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:04,810
It's vintage tainted show Pharma
shots one or two take three.

1299
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,160
Action please.

1300
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,060
The French champagne has
always been celebrating.

1301
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,710
Excellence is a kind of fun.
Your champagne by far.

1302
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:18,570
Mass Song.

1303
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:24,850
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. I have one more.

1304
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,150
Okay, cool. So what's the lesser, I mean
I shouldn't say that. Okay, here we go.

1305
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:33,430
This one's just more base. Okay. Okay.
Would you rather, every time you fart,

1306
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:37,330
it's a short or every time you burp.
It's a birth.

1307
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:42,910
Every time you fart, it's a shark. Yeah.
Or every time you burp, it's a birth.

1308
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,050
Yeah.
Whew.

1309
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:48,980
Um, God. Yeah.

1310
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,280
That's a really gross, I haven't burned
in a long time since I was pregnant.

1311
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:00,970
Barfing is the word that's really gross.
I feel like you've,

1312
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:04,070
I birthed a lot when I was a
kid. Here's, I think you'd have

1313
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,180
to choose barfing though.
Okay. Because, okay.

1314
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:10,520
They're both growth.
They're both uncomfortable.

1315
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:15,440
Sharding ruins that part of
your day completely. Like,

1316
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:19,760
you're going to have things you need
to be doing that you're like, I have,

1317
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:23,600
I have shit in my ass cheeks right now.
We're as,

1318
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:26,420
while the burping is disgusting.

1319
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:29,930
You can at least be like
however gross this is,

1320
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:33,020
I could still walk into this
place right now. You know,

1321
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,310
I can spit on the sidewalk. Right.
But you got to change underwear

1322
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,290
when you start it fucked up.
Time they ruin. Takes up.

1323
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:47,180
Yeah. Well, I like it.
That's your concern is,

1324
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:54,040
oh, wait a lot of damn
moments. Well, listen,

1325
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,570
but listen,
here's why.

1326
01:26:55,571 --> 01:27:00,571
I choose sharp because you choose
sharp because you can prepare,

1327
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,750
you bring wipes and you bring
panties with you on the road.

1328
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,510
You pack yourself a diaper
bag like we do for the kid.

1329
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,810
Basically our kids shirts and you
just wipe it up and y'all is nasty.

1330
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:16,510
It's nasty. Or I would wear
adult diapers and that way, dude,

1331
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:19,540
that's how you do this.
So you just wear adult diapers,

1332
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,260
you shorten the diaper and you wipe your
ass with fucking moist towelette and

1333
01:27:23,261 --> 01:27:25,210
then you're done. Right.
It's just so nasty.

1334
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,560
You can hold in a fart and that way you
wouldn't have to shirt, but a birth,

1335
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:33,920
you can't borrow everywhere.
All right,

1336
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:38,300
you just wipe and then
you're done. I hate kissing.

1337
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,560
Fine. Hey, somebody sent
in this clip. This is

1338
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:48,360
audio only of a, your
favorite thing of barfing? No,

1339
01:27:48,361 --> 01:27:53,190
it's a pornographic film. But this
one has a very funny line. Okay.

1340
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,720
Uh,
tell me what you think of this.

1341
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,460
You ready to be a single mother? Oh my
God. Are you ready to be a single mother?

1342
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,760
Me.
Here's some multis in that pussy round.

1343
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:08,380
Ready to be a single mother of six.

1344
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,140
Say Mother say,

1345
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:18,310
wow. Yes. You're not going to
call my phone after this, right.

1346
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:23,940
I'm a block your number. You're not gonna
come to my crib. Right, right. Hi. Hi.

1347
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:27,690
Here we go. Oh Shit. Oh,

1348
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,090
oh,
oh.

1349
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,660
That's pretty clever,
Huh? As far as writing,

1350
01:28:33,661 --> 01:28:35,720
I'm sure the writers spend
some time on that. Nope.

1351
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:40,710
I'm amazed he could get out that dialogue
as well as he did. And the jacket. Yeah.

1352
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,690
That was really a lot of work on his part.

1353
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,460
A strong performer. Oh Shit. Oh.

1354
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:48,810
But I mean, you're ready to be
a single mother. That's a funny,

1355
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:52,570
very hard ready to be a
single mother. Yeah. I mean,

1356
01:28:52,571 --> 01:28:56,980
anybody that's known as single
mother been a single mother. Yeah.

1357
01:28:57,130 --> 01:29:01,730
Not Easy. I wouldn't, I wouldn't take
that ejaculations oof. I know. No thanks.

1358
01:29:01,731 --> 01:29:02,250
Because he's basically

1359
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,450
telling you never, ever. I get
it. Yeah. Don't contact me.

1360
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:08,580
I heard it's pretty funny.
Um,

1361
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:14,310
you got an email email here.
Uh,

1362
01:29:14,311 --> 01:29:19,311
I feel compelled to weigh in on your
wiping style conversation from episode

1363
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,230
three 92.
Yeah.

1364
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:26,100
I believe that both bunching and
folding have benefits and drawbacks.

1365
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,940
The bunch picks up more,
but as you said,

1366
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:33,000
leaves you open to poopy knuckles.
If you aren't careful,

1367
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,990
the fold is more civilized
and protects your knuckles,

1368
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:42,240
but it has been known to require more
wipes and is prone to punch through with a

1369
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:46,500
finger. If you are thorough and a
committed wipers such as myself,

1370
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:51,090
this is why I employ a hybrid strategy.
I will take a length of paper,

1371
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,270
perhaps eight squares are so fold at once.

1372
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,600
Then bunch half allowing the flap to
form a tail like the train of a wedding

1373
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:01,170
dress.

1374
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:06,060
That way I enjoy the superior wiping
power of the bunch while protecting my

1375
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:09,360
knuckles from collateral
damage with the fold.

1376
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:14,250
I hope this helps and if you choose
to read my email on the show that can,

1377
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,720
that I can change a life. Keep it
classy. Jeans, Zach from Texas.

1378
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,220
There's some, I hear some
flaws in your logic. A,

1379
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:28,350
how do we know that the folded wipe
leads to more wipes than a bunched wipe?

1380
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,900
I don't. I mean we need to
see some scientific evidence,

1381
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:36,390
empirical data to back up this claim.
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.

1382
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:42,630
I don't know that that's
founded in anything. Check
out this lunatic. I used to,

1383
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:44,790
uh,
have a joke about this in my act.

1384
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:46,740
I never made it onto like
a special or anything,

1385
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,480
but I used to make fun
of people that did this.

1386
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,780
What's up guys? So people have
been asking me, Oh, how come?

1387
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:56,500
And the recent training videos, even
posting, I see you wearing jeans. I mean,

1388
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:59,110
I just, I've never seen a fucking
guy where it is in the gym before.

1389
01:30:59,111 --> 01:31:02,080
So why are you the exception?
Is there a benefit to wearing jeans?

1390
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,740
So I want to answer that question today.
Why this house smells destiny?

1391
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:08,380
Where jeans, well, I'll tell you why.

1392
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:12,070
It's because a long time ago your
man used to be professional climber.

1393
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:15,370
And I'm not talking about one of those
climbers that you're going to a facility

1394
01:31:15,371 --> 01:31:17,970
and you climb goes fucking rocks
though I was a ghetto climber.

1395
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,400
I used to climb fuck a buildings, legit
buildings with my fucking fingertips,

1396
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:22,090
you know?

1397
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:25,810
And what happens is that if you're wearing
shorts or track pads to going to Rick.

1398
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:27,010
Hmm.

1399
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:31,030
So for many, many, many years,
all I did is I trained with jeans.

1400
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,250
I used to do a wall runs with jeans.
I used to,

1401
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,310
everything with James flips would genes,
the whole fucking nine yards.

1402
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,020
And I know that sounds a bit unusual,

1403
01:31:38,021 --> 01:31:42,580
but I don't think this is that uncommon
in the park who slash climate world.

1404
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:43,840
Yeah.

1405
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,510
But if you gave me the choice whether
or not I could train with jeans or with

1406
01:31:46,511 --> 01:31:49,750
track class, I would choose. I would
choose. Jeans are 100% of the time.

1407
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:54,270
It's fucking great. I love it. I can
go ATG on a squat with jeans. Oh,

1408
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,740
I can get much tighter on a
deadlift for jeans. It's like,

1409
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,280
it's almost similar to multiply. You
know, you're having that extra thickness

1410
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:00,980
here.

1411
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:05,980
I think you look so crazy with gyms or
at the gym with jeans like I used to

1412
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:10,360
make, I used to have a joke about how,
you know, like what are you a fuck?

1413
01:32:10,361 --> 01:32:11,470
I forget the joke,
but I was like,

1414
01:32:11,471 --> 01:32:15,880
are you a communist or is
it like a Romanian fucking
infiltrator wearing because

1415
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:20,230
you look like a lunatic. You look like it
looks like an episode of the Americans.

1416
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:24,050
Like the, the person just arrived
and they're doing the fitness.

1417
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,760
My trends. It's a Hungarian dude. Um,

1418
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:30,460
I this think you're kind of low and loose
when you say things like that. Yeah.

1419
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,220
Given that were in your mom's house,

1420
01:32:32,221 --> 01:32:34,650
do you think you could have some
fucking respect? Yeah. Just so you know,

1421
01:32:34,651 --> 01:32:38,820
I'm having [inaudible] pants made out
of denim right now as we speak. Yes.

1422
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:44,310
I used to everything with jeans. I don't
like spandex. I want them to be denim.

1423
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:48,790
We both been doing pilots. I know we
both did. We made fitness today. No,

1424
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,630
I wish I never had to workout by.

1425
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:56,660
This is the second time I've never had
this happen as I'm making fitness my

1426
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:02,220
right tricep, it goes into a
full cramp. It was so bizarre.

1427
01:33:02,221 --> 01:33:02,461
It's just,

1428
01:33:02,461 --> 01:33:06,810
it's one of the things I've never had
it happen twice cause you're not wearing

1429
01:33:06,811 --> 01:33:11,350
denim denim shirts and then then we're
just looking at it. It's going to, yeah,

1430
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,290
like clamping up and releasing.

1431
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:16,280
You're not used to making
fitness as hard as I do. Yeah,

1432
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:20,520
I think that's part of it. I'm also the
fitness champ. That's right. That's right.

1433
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,110
Um, all right. Well anything
else you want to fill her up?

1434
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:29,430
Holy Shit. That is big time. That is.

1435
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,770
Hey fever

1436
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,180
shot shot.

1437
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:04,973
Okay,

1438
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:11,110
look at bids
by the way.

1439
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,080
I want it to announce that

1440
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,573
this Friday

1441
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:26,440
we are releasing the a
Yoshi live podcast episode.

1442
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:32,430
So the late show and Irvine will come
out this Friday for all you genes out

1443
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:35,320
there and sperm vine,

1444
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:39,940
the sperm vine show
with Yoshi will be out.

1445
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:43,370
Oh boy. Is she all right. Fill
her up. Jane, what do you got?

1446
01:34:43,371 --> 01:34:46,700
We know it's been so long since we've
done this show and I thought, you know,

1447
01:34:46,701 --> 01:34:51,140
we've never really done a
super mega celebrity edition.

1448
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:56,510
I thought why not do the
most famous people in the
world? Okay. The Kardashians.

1449
01:34:56,690 --> 01:35:00,890
Wow. Why not? We know and
there's a whole new school now,

1450
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:05,600
so let's get into it. Fill her up.
Seal her shot. Let's start with the,

1451
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:09,770
with the ladies. Okay.
Is it Kimar Kylie. Wow.

1452
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:12,110
Cause those are kind of like the two.
They're all famous.

1453
01:35:12,111 --> 01:35:15,480
But those are the two probably
most famous. Those are
the two, the two hotties,

1454
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:18,490
right?
Well Courtney and uh,

1455
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:23,890
they're less or lesser card and
they're not as hot as Kim and Kylie.

1456
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,490
Those are the secondary third dairy.
Technically she's a gender.

1457
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:33,320
Well Kylie Jenner. That's what I'm saying.
It's all the same clan. You're right.

1458
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:36,320
But,
so Kim is like the two point,

1459
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:40,460
the 2.0 model and then
Kylie's the 2.4 whatever.

1460
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,110
You know what I'm saying? Is it
2009 or 2017 I mean, I'll tell you,

1461
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:48,650
I got a problem right away with like,

1462
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:52,120
she looks like I liked snakes,
but she looks like a,

1463
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,500
like a little doll or something,
you know?

1464
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:58,280
What do you mean she looks too
juvenile? Oh, she's too young.

1465
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,230
She's too young. It's
not that like, you know,

1466
01:36:03,231 --> 01:36:05,780
I mean this looks like a little kid.
Yeah,

1467
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,340
she's still pubescent is
what you're saying? Is She,
I don't know how old she is,

1468
01:36:10,341 --> 01:36:14,920
so I, I'm assuming she's over 18
for the purposes of this report.

1469
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:19,340
I hope so. She's 18 so
she's a teenager. Yeah.

1470
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,460
All right. I don't know. Never
mind. I'll go back on that then.

1471
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:26,660
So I feel better now.
Yeah. So it's basically,

1472
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:31,640
do you feel like teaching someone
a few lessons or do you want,

1473
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:33,081
I guess,
you know,

1474
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:38,081
the most famous post posted in the world
that has just been beaten up left and

1475
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:42,710
right by monstrous black dogs.
But she'll be like,

1476
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:46,040
so are we going to, are you going to
come in me? And I'm like, I'm in there.

1477
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:48,170
And she's like, no, seriously.
I'm like, Oh really?

1478
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:52,040
And we've seen what she's capable of.
If you've seen the rage a video,

1479
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:57,740
yeah. She's used to like
some massive black dogs mind.

1480
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:02,360
And let's throw this into the ring
before even, so is this one, by the way,

1481
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:03,620
she's going to the black guys,

1482
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,660
but let's keep in mind that
Kim's very insecure, right?

1483
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,180
She's the type that
you could really abuse.

1484
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:15,470
She's kind of a Karen in this situation
and I don't know what Kylie's emotional

1485
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:19,550
status, but I know, I'm know for a fact.
Not as confident as we think she is. Yeah.

1486
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:24,140
She's been a victim of a violent crime
pretty recently, a year ago or so,

1487
01:37:24,141 --> 01:37:27,290
or however. She's
traumatized, she's fragile.

1488
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:29,750
There's a lot of things you can
get away with in a girl like that.

1489
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,300
That's really good coaching.
Yeah.

1490
01:37:32,301 --> 01:37:37,220
And I think ultimately she knows like,
oh don't neglect the balls.

1491
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,450
You know? Like do you think
Kim knows that because she's,

1492
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:46,310
she's not gonna be like, Ooh, balls,
there's a gross. I'm like, no, no,

1493
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,800
you got to pay attention here.
On the other hand,

1494
01:37:48,801 --> 01:37:52,880
Kylie's young and dating rappers
and those guys are like, bitch,

1495
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,820
put it all in your mouth.
Right, right, right. Those
guys are just kind of savages.

1496
01:37:56,821 --> 01:38:01,360
I'm assuming she doesn't even know that
not swallowing is an option, you know,

1497
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,020
cause she's,
is she dating Tyga was that was,

1498
01:38:04,021 --> 01:38:08,010
I think there's a big scandal right now.
Oh, I think he got photographed without,

1499
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:11,880
with another girl. Oh, we'll see. I, I
don't know Taiga, but I've seen him. Yeah.

1500
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:15,360
And I think he's, he looks
like a savage sexually. Really?

1501
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:18,690
I had assumed it was covered in tattoos.
That's what does it for you.

1502
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:22,080
And you think that means
savage? He's a rapper. Yeah.

1503
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:26,600
Tattooed rappers, you know? Yeah. I know.

1504
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:30,210
I don't think he's rapping about
rainbows and fucking lollipops,

1505
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:34,110
but I don't think Kanye is like put my
balls in your mouth all the time. Yeah.

1506
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:38,530
He seemed, he seemed a little more
oddly enough, more normal when it comes,

1507
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:40,710
you know what I mean? Like I
would believe that. I mean,

1508
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:44,370
I don't think he's a stable normal guy,
but I don't see him being like,

1509
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:48,060
look bitch underneath I'm a
foreigner in your mouth. Right. Well,

1510
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:51,780
cause he's done that before camp.
Right. That's your baby Mama.

1511
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:55,650
You got to give her some respect. Right,
right. Put some respect on my name,

1512
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:56,730
put some respect on it.

1513
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:01,330
So there's a lot of variables
here dealing with, yeah.

1514
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:05,580
I still think you've got to go with Kim.
I do old school. Yeah. I mean, you know,

1515
01:39:05,581 --> 01:39:08,570
it's a better story. Um, you know, I like,

1516
01:39:08,571 --> 01:39:11,640
I like a good story and uh,

1517
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,780
I feel like it's legendary in there.
Who knows what could happen.

1518
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:19,470
Maybe I could find one of those rings
she lost in Paris or something, you know?

1519
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:22,470
So I would go for that.
I think that would be more fun.

1520
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,440
She's got two babies that came
out of there. That's cool.

1521
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:30,440
I like bitches with babies. Talent
that, yeah, I'm going to go Kylie. Yeah,

1522
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:34,080
I think that's better for you. For me
personally, I think it's better for you.

1523
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,050
She's kind of a dope.
She's 19.

1524
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:40,200
I could really traumatize
her and you know,

1525
01:39:40,201 --> 01:39:43,830
she always wants to talk about it as
like selfies and her new cosmetics line.

1526
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,890
What I feel like we screwed up
though. Why? I feel like the other,

1527
01:39:46,891 --> 01:39:51,180
the next most famous female genders
actually Kaitlin, well let's go there.

1528
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:55,590
That's the next one. Well that's a lady.
Yeah, but they're not the way I frame it.

1529
01:39:55,770 --> 01:40:00,720
Okay, let's go for the guys.
Yeah. Old School. Bruce Jenner.

1530
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:04,070
I'm talking in his prime cause I
didn't think you'd want to woman.

1531
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,830
Like did you really want
to fuck her downstairs?

1532
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:12,160
Thing is she still has a doll. I
think she still has a dog. So yeah,

1533
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:17,010
that kind of rules it out for you.
I know it's old school,

1534
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:18,860
Bruce Jenner and his prime.

1535
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:23,310
I'm talking like eighties
athletic or Kanye.

1536
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:28,560
Oof, man. It was really tough. A
lot of variables to deal with here.

1537
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,580
Uh, versus some guy who's like, I
think I'm a woman inside, you know?

1538
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:38,190
Yeah. That's the thing. It's just
weird shit happening with him. I mean,

1539
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,160
look at this guy. That's it.
Those muscles. Look at that.

1540
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:47,190
Use The fucking man. Dm. Brucey yeah.

1541
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:52,690
Well that's a really tough
one. He's got a good,

1542
01:40:52,691 --> 01:40:54,060
here's the,
because

1543
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,320
physically I don't really care.

1544
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:01,920
I feel like it's the mental instability
and I think they're both have a good bit

1545
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:08,320
of that instability. But maybe
it's just that, like with Bruce,

1546
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:10,180
the only thing is like,
you know,

1547
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:12,820
he wants to do this thing and he's kind
of trying to come to terms with it.

1548
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,950
But you would know that
at the time, right? Yeah.

1549
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:17,200
You wouldn't know that.
He might not know it,

1550
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:20,440
but it's going to manifest in other
ways. You might be like, can I just,

1551
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:25,140
do you mind if I wear a wig
and a panty hose and you're
like, okay, yeah, whatever.

1552
01:41:25,141 --> 01:41:25,340
Yeah,

1553
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:29,630
but like with, with Kanye, you're
just dealing with this in bill,

1554
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:32,120
unbelievably out of control.
Ego,

1555
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:36,100
the porn out. He likes porno law and he's
acting out a lot though. And he's like,

1556
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:41,070
he's so annoying. You know he's having
like near mental breakdowns and stuff.

1557
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:45,210
See, because Katelyn's annoying as
fuck now. Right? She's annoying. Right.

1558
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:48,750
But as Bruce, she probably stayed
in line, you know what I mean?

1559
01:41:48,751 --> 01:41:51,230
Like her ego is under, I don't
know what his ego was like when he,

1560
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,880
this is a good question for you.
You should answer this first. Yeah.

1561
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:59,040
So sexually,
you know that like he can do it.

1562
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:01,650
I mean he fathered a bunch
of kids and you know,

1563
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:04,020
and I'm looking for that fertility game,

1564
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:06,990
but then Connie is not going to treat you,
treat you like baby Mama.

1565
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:11,250
He's going to treat you like, like a
little piece of trash on the ground. Yeah.

1566
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:15,090
I don't like that. I don't like Connie's,
I'm, I'm just putting this on him.

1567
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:19,860
He might be brutal. He might
be disrespectful. Yeah,
that'd be fun for you, Bruce.

1568
01:42:19,861 --> 01:42:22,020
I feel like he'd have the unconscious,

1569
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:27,090
the lady as he is coming right now.
Uh, and he's smiling like that.

1570
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,160
Hmm.
You know,

1571
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,770
come face. Oh, there we are in
Amy. Yeah. Look how cute he was.

1572
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:40,060
See, there he goes. Uh, yeah.
That's more of a calm face.

1573
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:44,770
Look at them. Short shorts. No,
I like him. You know, athletes,

1574
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:49,600
you can't go wrong physically. He probably
looks great. Naked. A, he's got this,

1575
01:42:49,601 --> 01:42:52,570
the anima. Yeah. Stand
them up now. Lazy Lover.

1576
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,780
He's going to have a lot of weird stuff
going on and it's more interesting.

1577
01:42:55,870 --> 01:43:00,370
I think ultimately Kanye would
be very toxic to be around.

1578
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:04,220
It's so annoying. Such a fan
of him as a producer. Right.

1579
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:06,190
But I think that would be the thing.
I'd be like,

1580
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:09,850
I'll just deal with it and then
it would give me, you know,

1581
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,540
first listens to these things would not,
you're just a Pete,

1582
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,930
you're just a slam piece baby.
You're talking relationship.

1583
01:43:16,931 --> 01:43:21,220
I'm talking about filling up
grilled cheese. He's like,
yeah, come check this out.

1584
01:43:21,221 --> 01:43:24,130
And then I'd play a song from maybe that
I'll ask such a good song is a baby.

1585
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,160
He's filling you up and sealing Yusha.

1586
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,870
He's not letting you listen
to his music's like his raps

1587
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,930
coming over. Oh, uh, uh, Ross is here
and 21 stab at what's the other fellows?

1588
01:43:34,931 --> 01:43:38,590
And he'd be like, go make them a sandwich
to donate a little bitch. I'll be like,

1589
01:43:38,591 --> 01:43:40,810
all right,
I'll make you sandwiches.

1590
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:44,940
Well I guess we agree to
disagree. Yeah, I think we chose,

1591
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:49,650
we chose who was right for each of us
on that one. Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

1592
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:53,870
Um, look, we got to wrap this up, gene.
Okay, hold on. Can I do another one?

1593
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:58,130
Another one.
Kaitlin or the mom.

1594
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:02,660
What's her name? Chris.
Right. Chris Jenner.

1595
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:08,450
Christ Christian or Caitlin or about
the same age. Let's walk through it.

1596
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:13,370
Wow. CAITLIN's in new lady. She's probably
going to want to definitely Chris.

1597
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:17,870
Chris, man. Well, okay, let's
say Katelyn has a vision and new,

1598
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:20,090
freshly made vision.

1599
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:27,230
Yeah, I dunno. I don't have any
problem with it, but I just feel like,

1600
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:32,090
yeah, you do. You'd have to
have a problem. You wouldn't
have a problem with it.

1601
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:37,430
No sound don't a problem with doctor
made machine probably feels funny,

1602
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:40,540
you know? It feels weird,
right? I guess. I don't know.

1603
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:43,860
I mean I've only had real Virgenes
but what if, I don't know.

1604
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:48,140
I don't know if this is Dick turned
inside out though. That's what I'm saying.

1605
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,860
And so as a straight guy, wouldn't
you still, you'd be like, oh,

1606
01:44:51,861 --> 01:44:55,380
this is like a dick. Like it's still a
deck, right? It's still a dick. Yeah.

1607
01:44:55,381 --> 01:44:58,700
I'd be like, you have your dead
Dick, but where are your dad's balls?

1608
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,200
You'd still have that in your head that
you were still having sex with another

1609
01:45:03,201 --> 01:45:06,270
dude's Dell. Yeah, of course he would.
It'd be tough to get through it out.

1610
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:10,970
It's still a dick. Yeah, I think
Chris would be, um, I don't know.

1611
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:15,140
Something about her that would be fun.
She seems like a fun,

1612
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:20,090
Fun Lady. She's a fun time.
Savvy, smart business oriented.

1613
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:24,560
I mean, look, she built this family,
she did career. It's pretty miraculous.

1614
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,500
High maintenance as shit,
but I mean, I don't know.

1615
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:33,110
Now let's go through this because she's
just been dumped by a husband of how

1616
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:38,030
many years converting to being a woman.
She's damaged goods too.

1617
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:42,740
Yeah, she's had her spirit broken. You're
like just putting your mouth. Yeah. Yeah.

1618
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:47,060
I think I would definitely rather
fill that up though. Yeah, the, yeah,

1619
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:51,290
the mom Kaitlin's going to be
annoying. Oh my God. Hi. Maintenance.

1620
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:54,260
She's more high main is to me,
I think then the other lady,

1621
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:58,550
and we don't even know actually
that Caitlin likes men.

1622
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:03,140
I don't know is a big thing about that.
Oh, is that right? Yeah. It was like, no,

1623
01:46:03,141 --> 01:46:03,950
I like,

1624
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:08,910
I mean at the time it was like that
he that she likes women that just

1625
01:46:08,911 --> 01:46:13,550
transitioning. Oh, feels like a
whim. A woman but likes women. Oh,

1626
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:16,880
I didn't know that. So she's, well,
I mean this was what I first heard

1627
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:22,490
long ago,
so lots of process call me Caitlyn.

1628
01:46:22,491 --> 01:46:26,990
It's so complicated. I can only imagine
how horrible it must be to go through.

1629
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:32,270
It's a lot. God, poor woman. All
right. All right. Well, there you go.

1630
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:34,240
There you go.
Uh,

1631
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:39,220
please go to a lot of hard hitting quite,
I mean, this one really broke me down.

1632
01:46:39,221 --> 01:46:42,740
It's picking your nose. Make your
nostrils big on retarded people drive.

1633
01:46:42,741 --> 01:46:44,840
Would you rather fuck
Caitlyn or Kris Jenner?

1634
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:50,160
These are the questions
that we answer on your

1635
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,890
mom's house.
On the podcast.

1636
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:58,990
They'll try 99 a please shop through
the Amazon banner. He'll Trump 90.

1637
01:46:58,991 --> 01:47:03,120
Sorry. No, Trump gave him a bad
shout out. Yeah, you did. And uh,

1638
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:06,930
Trump stupid. Oh, this is huge.

1639
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:10,770
I can't believe I forgot this all the way
until the end. Oh, today. Uh, this week,

1640
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:15,270
the 28th, the 28th of this
month, mostly stories.

1641
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:20,340
My album based on the last
Netflix special comes out,

1642
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,010
the audio release comes out.
Here's the thing,

1643
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:27,630
it has two bonus tracks,
two pieces of audio,

1644
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:31,530
two tracks that I just recorded,
um,

1645
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,060
last month that I told them.
Uh,

1646
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:37,830
instead of keeping these for
myself for the next special,

1647
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:41,970
put them on this album.
So if you get the new album,

1648
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:46,350
it'll be on iTunes. Of course, Amazon,
wherever you can buy and stream music,

1649
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:50,910
it'll be there. Two bonus tracks.
I would love for you to get it.

1650
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:55,370
If you're interested in hard copies.
I ordered a limited edition, um,

1651
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,460
about a hard copies.

1653
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:03,000

1654
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:07,020
So there will also be a limited
amount of limited run of vinyl,

1655
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:11,730

1656
01:48:11,731 --> 01:48:14,100
but that's in June.

Denim jeans is a term of affection.

1669

Jeans is like bay genes,
