6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,280
I just think it's um, a silly
thing to have to say, you know.

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,210
Well I think for the super wealthy,
the super rich,

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,250
he don't have time to be
with their children and then
they pushed them off onto

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,670
nannies. Yeah. It's like,
I mean I get why, but ah,

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,810
cause then that motherfucker
raises your kids. Yeah, sure.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,990
We know who's raising your kids.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,820
Who was raising your kid and they're not
kissing him all day and loving on him

13
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,000

Where's your water? Yeah, I'm
actually really thirsty. Really? Yeah.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,130
I'm thirsty right now,
Kevin.

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,850
Probably because you haven't been
hydrating. Yeah. At all today.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,490
I haven't seen you drink any water.
I drank a bunch.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,210
I bought a couple of waters actually,
I was out. I get thirsty. Sorry.

20

This is your name on here? No,

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,480
Okay, cool. Could you
drag it out more? Thanks.

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,670
Yeah, I can't because if the
audience is paying attention,

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,920
they can see that I'm the water champion.
Oh,

25
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,450
and you had to beg me for my water
because I hydrate constantly.

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,210
Mm hmm.
Oh,

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,740
why are you so sweaty right now? Cause
I was running around. I ran outside,

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,820
I switched the boards,
having board problems.

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,860
I finally installed the new sound craft
board and it was recommended to me.

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,130
I couldn't get it to, uh, to
function. I couldn't get it to work.

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,680
I did it really quick. That's why I
did it really quick. I know, I know.

35
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,134

74
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,540
Thompson Jr com [inaudible] dot com guys,

75
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,490
also checkout. That's deep, Bro. Pied
Cass. I just had Kevin Christie on,

76
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:14,140
we, uh, talk about grief. It's real fun
actually. It ended up being a really fun,

77
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,990
fine cast and we laughed a lot
and we were really happy. It was,

78
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,580
it really was grief.
Yeah.

79
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,970
Cause his dad died in a horribly bizarre
11 accident that was really like a

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,340
horrible hiking accident.

81
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:28,900
And then my mom died last year and we
talked about it and ended up paying like

82
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,410
super, not a bummer. I know it
sounds like bummer, but it was in,

83
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,690
this was if I recall, um,
uncircumcised men. Yeah.

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,113
Uncircumcised.

85
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,790
You sound like that guy has in recall
in circumstances guys and Co no,

86
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,080
what I was going to say is that,
uh,

87
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,330
I remember that his dad was like
an experienced guy. Yeah. Right.

88
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,380
You knew the terrain
very, very well. Yeah.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,760
And then the storm came and then no good.

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,270
They never found them horrendous.
Yeah.

91
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,610
So how does he deal with
something like that?

92
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,180
And I think it's a valuable lesson and
people dealing with all kinds of crap.

93
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,800
Like grief is not just a death that people
lose stuff you lose every day. Right?

94
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,990
You win some,
you lose some guys.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,100
That's how it's always been ups and
downs and we get super deep on it.

Uh, yeah. Um, so do you remember
dating this guy or no? Well,

146
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:12,370
we didn't date, but we,
we just asked. Oh really?

147
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:15,910
This is my last white boyfriend before
I started dating a lot of Puerto Rican

148
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:19,930
dudes. Um, and then I married you. Wow.

149
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,800
That was like five Puerto Rican dudes.
That's really something.

150
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,870
But he was special because this guy was
a math major and he would occasionally

151
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:33,430
smoke crack. Like he would pick it
up one month stop. Yeah. You know,

152
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:37,900
he was real smart.
Do you miss him all the time?

153
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,910
Is that Derek? I Miss Derek. Derek. Yeah.
That looks like a Derek doesn't it does,

154
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:46,770
it does matter or uh, uh, Rick? Uh,

155
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,700
I could see a Rick Scott. Yeah.
Scott. I've known really trashy.

156
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:55,990
Scott's too. Yeah, I've done quite a few.
Yeah. Why is Scott such a trash name?

157
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,710
Have a no, we're going to get some Skype
messages for sure. Many Scott. Matt. Hey,

158
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,700
what's up Scott? Fucking
pieces of shit. I'm closing

159
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,420
everyone. I did that at
that, at the Burbank show.

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,610
Were you there for that?
You were there.

161
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,890
I remember we were doing the meet
and greet and this girl was like, oh,

162
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,140
well you say hi to like my friend Derek
and I go, yeah. And I always like,

163
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,410
I don't know how to
make it. Yeah, not lame.

164
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,430
So I just go to dumb and I go,
what's up Derek?

165
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,330
You fucking

166
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,470
piece of shit. Oh, right. Yeah. She
was like, her face dropped. Yeah.

167
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,950
Um, okay. I got like
really offended by it.

168
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,120
I go, how could you get, I don't
know. You read a comedy show.

169
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,260
What would you get offended by that?

170
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,840
But what was the, I thought he was like
five years old or something. No. Oh,

171
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,090
what if he was like a five
year old kid and you're like,

172
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,800
Derek's a fucking piece of shit. Be Like
you fucking Jew. And she was like, he is.

173
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,910
I remember I go, I just
guessed that I, no,

174
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,340
I block out stupid moments like
that in my life. Yeah. Yeah.

175
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:04,780
I just block them right out.
I can't think about it. Okay.

176
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,670
No, I'm serious. Like stupidity that
she was being stupid. Yeah. I like,

177
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:14,380
I don't even as as as a register anymore.
Yeah. I'm upset about this board.

178
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,310
What's wrong? What do you mean? What's
wrong about this particular board?

179
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,040
We're both getting the other
board in here. Well, I mean, look,

180
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:25,180
you knew that that was going to be a
time investment to I didn't think so. Oh,

181
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:29,980
I think it takes, I just throw these
things out in the same, same compartments,

182
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:33,400
you know, same inputs, but
it's a different board. I know,

183
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,190
but I didn't think it would be that
complicated. Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay,

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,240
this sounds good.
I mean it's still good.

185
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,023
All right.

186
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,490
Um, well, uh, what do you, you don't
want me to be upset about it? No, I mean,

187
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,610
I don't know.
It's,

188
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,080
I think you've done a great job is what
I'm trying to validate you and you say

189
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:55,410
that we carried on and it's
good man. Yeah, I guess so.

190
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,060
All right, fine. Yeah.

191
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,850
Well what is my boyfriend talking
about? I have no idea. I have no idea.

192
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,950
It says deckhands. Yeah, I think it's
a show. This is a reality show. Okay.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,480
And these guys are a Mensa members.
Yeah.

194
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,450
Why hasn't this mentioned in
here that what it is though?

195
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Like why isn't it mentioned in the
description and I don't know. Do you have,

196
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,040
do you know what it's from deck
hands. What's that? I Dunno.

197
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,090
Okay. Just deck hands. Who are
you mad? Are you mad at blue band?

198
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,410
She didn't put on there. Of
course. Oh, okay. Why? What,
what is this supposed to be?

199
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,903
From what?

200
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,670
I don't know. Bam. Okay.

201
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,180
The only person I ever have to lie to
is the God damn judge fucking line.

202
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,610
She fucking rich pieces.

203
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:52,290
That shit fucking getting richer off the
fucking was there breaking her hands.

204
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,600
Fuck you mother fuckers. That's what
I got to say about the whole life.

205
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,410
Do you think fuck down?

206
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,300
I F whew. Yeah, no idea.

207
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,380
Okay.
Um,

208
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,180
Ifq so you don't remember this guy?
You don't remember making love to him?

209
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,560
No, I'm telling you, he was my last
white boyfriend freshman year, Derek.

210
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,240
Yeah. And he came from,
um, Medford, Oregon,

211
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,920
which is like a logger town. He's
real, you know, rough around the edges,

212
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:26,990
but that's why I liked him.
His hands were kind of rough,

213
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,030
but he was soft inside and you know.
Yeah.

214
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,400
I love guys like that. Do
you, Chris is a little bit,

215
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,590
but I just didn't introduce him to my
parents. Do you remember lovemaking?

216
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,150
He's very gentle.
Yeah.

217
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:48,080
You'd be surprised how sweet
Derek's lovemaking is. What,

218
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,690
um, what about it is a real treat? Well,

219
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:55,660
a lot of his breath smelled bad
like whiskey or marijuana, mo,

220
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,200
one cigarette.

221
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,760
But when he wasn't high or drunk,
uh,

222
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,040
he was real sweet. Those are the best,
um, like votes of confidence on people,

223
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,240
you know, when they're not fucked up,
they're awesome. Yeah. That's the best.

224
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,520
He enjoying the, he does no one, you know,

225
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,920
and when he gets on those things,
he's a different guy

226
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,550
on a whiskey.
He gets cozy.

227
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,300
Yeah,
I know.

228
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,150
Yeah. It's kind of a bummer to only
have like half a person in your life,

229
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:36,720
you know? Like I always am amazed when
women hang in there for those types of

230
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:41,550
relationships. Like, well, you know,
I mean, 70% of the time he's a pls,

231
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:45,450
but then that 30, this really is an
example. I mean, she's a little slow.

232
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:49,620
I don't know if you can really buy the,
wait a minute. Yeah. What are you saying?

233
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,730
She's a little, not on the level.
Like why, like how are you can,

234
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,780
you can hear it and you're gonna hear it.
She's not, she's not doing so so well.

235
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,860
She is a retard.

236
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,590
Yeah.
Do you ever seen old Mcdonald had a farm?

237
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,580
When you start making the fuck
it insect sounds back there.

238
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,730
No net farm. He had a break.
Great. Great. Very what?

239
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,890
What'd you start thinking of that
crazy shit. That's what good.

240
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,970
I'd rather listen to
some fucking Metallica or
something while you're killing

241
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,710
shit. Right. You know

242
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,290
he always liked Metallica.
What is he saying?

243
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,530
That he'd rather listen to Metallica
than old Mcdonald had a farm.

244
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,430
Yeah, but it wears on me down all the
head of farm playing. Why you don't know,

245
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,690
but I also don't know how you find
a sun visor with a rebel flag. Oh,

246
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,524
I know where you can get one.

247
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,890
You ever seen old Mcdonald had a farm?

248
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:43,880
Ever see when you start making the
fucking insect sounds back there

249
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,890
knowing that farm, he had a
great, great, great, great, great.

250
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,940
What do you start thinking that crazy
shit man. I'd rather listen to buffer.

251
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,470
Yeah, these are winter shoes. He'll do
that down the fucking 60 this morning.

252
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,510
Oh my God.
About race.

253
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,350
Nice. He Drinking Busch
lite. Maybe that's also,

254
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,780
you see that like in Florida you
see it's a real winner circle.

255
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,420
Yup. Yup. Busch light.

256
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,800
Cause that's like a 12 or for like six
bucks or something. And that's real cheap.

257
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,690
Real cheap. Yeah. It's like 50
cents a beer man. That's like man,

258
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,920
when you're in high school and you're in
Florida and you're drinking out in the

259
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,440
groves and a,

260
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,660
and also when you're a deck deckhand
or you wear a confederate flag visor,

261
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,890
you drink Busch lite.

262
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,340
So is a show that follows this piece
of shit around here. He said, why not?

263
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:48,960
If you're gonna Invest in alcohol,
how much could that 12 or be like,

264
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,880
am I just getting night or thunder bird?
Yeah, it's stronger. And number two,

265
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,260
if you're going to wear socks,

266
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,320
why mash the flip flop into the
sock in between the two doing,

267
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,630
he's thinking these things
through. You think he's like, hmm,

268
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,340
I don't know if this really adds up to me.
He probably doesn't do that.

269
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,060
Why not just commit to a
full close toed situation?

270
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,170
We found a boat, but it was
60 in the morning. He said,

271
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,630
oh this is the winter time he's got colon.

272
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,820
Do you think he has cute Tutsis are now.
Oh, they're super nice. Yeah. All right.

273
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,900
Yeah

274
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,640
he does. I've seen her.
Oh my God. Dot Com.

275
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

276
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,400
My Dad's toenails are fully yellow
and like corroded and falling off.

277
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:45,140
It's been not only for years.
You know why that happens though?

278
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,950
You know why they're at this level.
Cause he's never at the early level.

279
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:50,030
Didn't care.
That's what,

280
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,010
that's how all shit gets like that
winning when it started he was like,

281
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,690
I'll give a fuck.
Well let's,

282
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,860
maybe it will just go away on its
own and you ignore it. I tell you,

283
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:04,700
the older I get, the less I ignore
body stuff now. Cause you're like,

284
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,930
this could be cancer.
Like everything could be potentially bad.

285
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:12,680
Like really bad at my
age. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

286
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:15,380
It can be an indicator
of like severe problems.

287
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,300
Do you think he's eating
like a Kale? I, by the way,

288
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:23,360
I think about that all the time.
Everything could be a problem.

289
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,960
I started thinking about it much
more people our age die now. I know,

290
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:30,770
and I just had a physical, we've got,
we'll get into that. That's a whole,

291
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,850
that's a whole episode. Yeah. But I
mean, I mean, do you want to go there?

292
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,090
You want to hear what Heidegger,
Nietzsche has to say here?

293
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,470
Aristotle, Aristotle of
Florida. What's this guy up to?

294
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,443
What's he eating?

295
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,170
Hi,
my name is Shane.

296
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:55,171
Mother fucking league.com
www.com fuck yet.

297
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,330
Dot Com.
Fuck yeah.

298
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,950
This is a show where they're just
following a bum, like a drunk,

299
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,130
a drunk drifter in Florida
around is what it feels like.

300
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,430
How go Florida attracts like this specific
type of trash because you can survive

301
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:16,210
there. I think you're never going
to freeze to death, you know? Um,

302
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,080
you could get work doing bullshit,
right?

303
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,500
Being a decade working in the
orange groves or you don't,

304
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,020
you don't have to like
have a high Falutin job.

305
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,600
You can sneak and sleep outside and by
Busch light and you can just drink it and

306
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,130
just go to work. He was working.
He was being, he was on the boat.

307
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,790
Do you think it's like,
it's the swamp thing? Like,

308
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:43,650
you know how there's either
swamp people. Yeah. I Dunno man.

309
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,800
There are a swamp people. I mean, I think
there's a combination of everything.

310
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,770
I it's that,

311
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,630
that um, you know, it's an easy yes.

312
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,340
Easy state to carry a weapon in. There
you go. There's no state income tax.

313
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,130
Yup. That draws in people that are really
rich. And then people who were like,

314
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:08,050
I don't pay no motherfucking taxes.
So, uh, you know, I don't know.

315
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,880
I think the combination of those and that,

316
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:14,350
and you can wear a confederate flag sun
visor and nobody gives you a static.

317
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,130
Yeah. That's also what is another way
I wear them. Yeah. Yeah. In Florida,

318
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,560
um, nobody's going to look twice
at you, right? I'm Marna. Yeah.

319
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,190
Got It. That's a scary part. In
some parts of Florida, nobody will,

320
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:30,190
some places they won't give a double
take. Yeah, that's true. I mean,

321
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,570
you can't do that Shit in Miami.

322
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,510
Yeah, I know, but be like Boca, but,

323
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,510
well, good. I got the tools to
show you a fog of wings of plugin.

324
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,500
Very fucking bag of fucking fighter.
I'm not bagging,

325
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,180
but
look at him.

326
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,320
He's just a drunk though.
Yeah. I actually just,

327
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,490
I want to punch the production people
for showcasing what are you doing? Yeah.

328
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,680
This guy's a fucking idiot.
Because the key to an interesting,

329
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:05,340
crazy is that they're interesting.
Yeah. I need to have something else.

330
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:08,610
Just some fucking loser being
a loser. Yeah. Like, Hey,

331
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,250
you want to follow a loser
around with a camera?

332
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,260
Like a guy that just never leaves the
front of seven 11 and let's give them a

333
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:16,630
show.

334
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,460
That show should just be called losers
and they go to seven 11 and silver lake.

335
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,280
Remember we used to live. Yeah,
that one. Next warehouse. Right.

336
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,270
Follow people buying hot dogs.
Not Evil. We're not evil people.

337
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,900
Right?
Yeah.

338
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,240
Who Was it? Was it Jeff Tate
that was buying all the hot
dogs, dogs and Gatorade.

339
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,200
Right. But there's someone else that we
would have. Did he message you by the way?

340
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,480
Uh, no he didn't. I don't think
so. Messaged me on the twitters.

341
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,490
No text message you, I don't know. All
right, cool. No, it's good. Busy Day.

342
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,080
That was really in there. I wish the
Persian lady would start texting me. Yeah.

343
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,050
That will be the best.
You know,

344
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,160
I got a message for Shenaz today in
other nursing opportunity in Florida.

345
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,780
Oh really? Uh Huh. She's missed out on
a ton of them. I have to tell you this.

346
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:10,340
I cannot believe I, you know, when you
don't write shit down, you fuck yourself.

347
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,490
Right.
Uh,

348
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,980
this happened when I was back in
Charlotte, in Charlotte, North Carolina.

349
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,850
I went to, I was doing the show.
You're not going to believe this.

350
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,130
I have to actually show you,
set this up so you,

351
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:28,860
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Okay.

352
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,250
This is a perfect timing.

353
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,400
This is the infamous bikes
clip that ended up being a bit,

354
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,070
right.
So this is the kid.

355
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,910
Did I talk about in this that I didn't
even notice that before I talk about his

356
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,123
and the special

357
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,310
talking about this whole
exchange. Yeah. So this guy,

358
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,783
sorry.

359
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,410
Right, right. It's horrible
audio. But that's the kid. Okay.

360
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,670
That's him. I'm sitting
there, I'm not sitting there.

361
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,410
I'm standing on stage and performing
in Charlotte on Friday, I think.

362
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:15,350
Friday, early show. Really? Really?
I still remember it. You know, you,

363
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,510
you forget about shows.
It was such a good show.

364
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:23,400
It's such a good crowd during the show.
He's laying in the front row.

365
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,130
I say something, I go,
what? And she goes, I dated

366
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,880
this kid. No Shit. That's incredible.

367
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,830
It's very random. And so she dated
him at this age. You're kidding.

368
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,510
And I go, you have got to be
shitting me. She goes, no, I go.

369
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:48,580
So when you were dating like did this air,

370
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,803
she was like yeah.

371
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,580
And he ended up changing his name has,

372
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,130
his name is Tom Cigarette and I
ended up changing his name. Um,

373
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,800
uh, and anyways, now I,

374
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,370
well he did change his name cause then
you made this into a major bit. I know.

375
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,650
And then this guy's like,
what the fuck?

376
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,140
Um, but this is, this is
what I wanted to show you.

377
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,100
Well first of all,
I wanted to tell you that he is now,

378
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,000
now just went to prison.

379
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,510
No, it didn't really work. They
didn't scare him out of it.

380
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,010
I didn't scare them straight for
sure. I get it. Um, that never works.

381
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,351
Yeah.
You know,

382
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,930
like in Springer when they bring out the
teenagers that were rebelling and then

383
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:42,420
they'd yell at them.
Yeah, it doesn't work.

384
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,240
Do you want to see what it looks
like now or not? Love to see what it,

385
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,670
so look at him here. Well how would you
describe those? Adorable. He's like,

386
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,000
this kid can be our son. Yeah.
He looks really cute. Just
perfect little area. Boy.

387
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,600
It was like a sweet kid, right? Yeah.
But the haircuts menacing but you know,

388
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,340
menacing well to Hitler
youth. Come on, he's got,

389
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,830
he's got a bowl cut.
Parted in the middle.

390
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,460
It looks like he looks
like hey hiller okay. Um,

391
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,470
that him well if that's what
the says he's a Daikin. Oh no,

392
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,070
that's him now. Okay. That's crazy. Yeah.

393
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,840
And how did you find this picture?

394
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,800
Cause I found out his name from the lady.
Um,

395
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,923
Justin.

396
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,140
That I think that's a hand.
Yeah.

397
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,030
Come job stoppers there.
Yup. But look at that. Uh,

398
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:36,100
he's doing the grimace,
but you know what though?

399
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:37,660
The kid that got yelled at and secure.

400
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,870
This is what you'd expect for the
ghost of Christmas future for this kid,

401
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:45,510
you know, or you expect that fucking
accountant scared me straight.

402
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,650
I don't know. Wow. That's so crazy. Genes.

403
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,210
Do you think he knows the backend?

404
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:56,910
Can't believe you don't think this is a
bigger deal? Um, I don't only because,

405
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,710
only because in this era of the
Internet now, yeah, it's everything.

406
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:04,460
Everything comes together so much faster.
Yeah.

407
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,010
I'm serious that a woman probably
was like, oh my gosh. She's like,

408
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:11,910
she's probably a fan of yours. And
then she put it. Yeah. You know,

409
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:14,350
it's not that crazy. Now
you have lots of fans. Okay.

410
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,370
Well I thought it was pretty crazy.
And um,

411
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,470
she also let me know his
mailing address in prison. Um,

412
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,670
now that's crazy. You're
going to write to, that part's
crazy. If you write to him.

413
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,031
Well,

414
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:31,060
I was thinking of giving out his address
so that everyone could write to him. Um,

415
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,160
I sure will.

416
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:37,161
And to encourage him to be not a
criminal or just get through your time.

417
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,170
You know how many fucking dumb shit he's
going to get or people are like, bikes.

418
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,120
It's all, it's going to be his bikes.
I know. Pull your jeans up, Justin,

419
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:52,890
stay in, stay out of
prison. I was like, wait,

420
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:56,580
why are these people calling me mommy
bikes and the drawing pictures of bikes?

421
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:59,760
That's what I wanted is that
he just opened the letter
and it just has a drawing

422
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,100
of a bite. Do you want
to help? I don't know.

423
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:07,101
I mean I asked and then I consulted with
somebody legally about doing that and

424
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,650
they said it was fine because you know,

425
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,820
we're asking people to
write something nice.

426
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,540
I'm just apprehensive about it.
I'm apprehensive to intuitively,

427
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,940
it doesn't sound like a
good idea. Yeah. I mean,

428
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:28,530
look what happens when people just, we
set the mommy's on like a Twitter person.

429
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,560
We got Gloria,
Stefan on Gloria.

430
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:35,790
Stefan because of the
mommies. Yeah. I don't know.

431
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,120
We might ruin that guy. I don't want to
do that. I really don't want to do that.

432
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,780
It wasn't, I mean, I really
thought it'd be cool in my mind.

433
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:47,180
The cool thing would be he goes,
uh, he's in prison would suck,

434
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,750
which sucks. Then they go like, hey mail.

435
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,710
And like one guy gets a letter,

436
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,400
one guy gets two letters and they
hid the guy's first name is Justin.

437
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,080
I can say that you Justin. And they have
to just like a bundle and what the fuck.

438
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,520
And then people are writing
cool things to him. Like, yeah,

439
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:09,690
like you'll get through this or you know,
encouraging stuff. Um, you know the guy,

440
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,570
I think he's, I don't know if he's
married, he's got a couple of kids.

441
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,330
I don't know. They could, people
could be cool. But then again,

442
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,090
if people would just go
off and do some crazy,

443
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,760
I don't want to be the
one who encouraged you,

444
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,070
who they blame for inciting that,
you know?

445
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,320
Yeah. I don't know. So
anyways, let's think about it.

446
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,750
Let's talk to our lawyer.
Okay, let's ask our attorney.

447
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,740
I'll say this, it's not
that hard to find. Okay.

448
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,520
So I'll just say that it's not that
hard to find him. No. Oh, I mean,

449
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:45,870
if you know me and you can find me.
Okay.

450
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,520
And your finance availed. Okay.
Like where could they find you?

451
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,220
On Twitter or, I dunno, there's
other places. I don't know.

452
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,030
I can't come on. You can't solve
the whole mystery? No. Okay.

453
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,950
So they see you on social media.

454
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:07,951
Maybe they can find this place to
send Justin some nice mail I guess.

455
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,140
I think they could, I'm not
telling you you can. Okay.

456
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,180
But I would encourage you, if you do
decide to ride Justin a letter. I mean,

457
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,620
seriously say something nice.
Wouldn't that be,

458
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,550
wouldn't if it sucked for like
wouldn't it suck? First of all,

459
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,910
they told me that his vibe,
like his crime was that he,

460
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,250
I think he was on probation and he was in,
um,

461
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,240
in possession of stolen property.

462
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,360
So it's very possible that why
he's in prison is because of like,

463
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,270
he could have received a stolen
and ends up in prison. So anyways,

464
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:49,150
what I'm saying is that
sucks just to go to prison.

465
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,450
Wouldn't it be cool if at least you get
like a hundred letters or more work?

466
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,200
Definitely.
That'd be the bright spot in your day.

467
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:59,740
And that's the part of me that
wants to do it, but I like, again,

468
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:03,590
a mystery that he would never,
maybe so like,

469
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,350
yeah. What's Netflix like? I don't know
how long he's been away. What's Netflix?

470
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,630
He just went away now. Oh, okay. Yeah,
no, he just, he just got locked up.

471
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,580
That is so bananas.

472
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,590
And she told me about it at the show
and I wrote to her later like, you know,

473
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,880
just asking questions and
stuff and you know, Nice Kid,

474
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,710
12 year old kid. She was there with her
husband. Probably came from a bad family.

475
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:33,190
I'm guessing Justin didn't
have great parents maybe.

476
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm guessing you didn't have a lot
of guidance, do you think so? Yeah.

477
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,880
And that's why you're
in the shit at 12 year.

478
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:42,370
You're on the scared straight show because
the parents don't give a fuck about

479
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:45,400
you. You're running the
streets. Yeah. Seriously.

480
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,370
You're not even capable of shit unless
your parents are bad. It's true.

481
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,990
Yeah. You tired hun jeans. You
had a long day. It was a long day.

482
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,170
Do you want to talk about the
physical? I think we should. Okay.

483
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:05,090
I have some of that. Which one is that?
One of my three. It's so it's also not,

484
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,020
it's not even open yet. Sweet.
Oh, it's nice and cold. Yeah. Um,

485
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,280
yeah. So here's what happened man.
It's been two years. Why not? Yeah,

486
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,520
it's been two years since my last
physical. I like to stay on top of it.

487
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,200
And Yours is, how long has your, I forgot,

488
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:23,830
cause you told me years
has been how many years? 40

489
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,590
I can't believe you've never had one.
I've never had a physical. You know why?

490
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,670
Because I'm Hungarian. I got
cockroach. DNA. It's true. It is true.

491
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:37,700
I have no problems.
I don't believe in this fucking bullshit.

492
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,190
You by 25 to 45
Jesus.

493
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,590
I hope so. I don't want
you to die. Thanks.

494
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,340
Your genetics are far weaker than
mine. Yeah, you're less resilient.

495
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,020
You get sicker more.
Yup.

496
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,280
He is sick more that your bowels
are constantly bothering you.

497
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,270
All right, so here's what happened. Yeah.

498
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,520
I go in first of all,

499
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,300
from 2014 I weigh,

500
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,460
I weigh 10 pounds less than I did in
2014. Good. That's good. Check. Oh wait,

501
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:14,210
22 pounds less than I did
about six weeks ago. Okay.

502
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,100
That's when I started eating like
Kido Kedo yeah, he does hardware,

503
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,900
Quito, Quito, c. K. E. T.
O. Yeah. Okay. That's cute.

504
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,390
Even after Quito, Kaylyn, it's the
mantra. Quito. Kaitlin. And uh,

505
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,840
so that's the good stuff. That's best.
Best about what good stuff ends. So,

506
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,990
so then he goes by doctors real thorough.
He is doctor Dick by the way.

507
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,120
Yes.
If you follow my standup at all.

508
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,100
Completely normal or you
stream it on Pandora, I get a,

509
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,850
a breakdown.

510
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,550
The charts top tracks that are streaming
and doctor Dick has been number one for

511
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,610
me for about, I dunno, 15 months.

512
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,210
He Israel,
he's our doctor.

513
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:03,100
I go see this guy too and he says
horrendously funny shit to us. So

514
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,990
that's the guy. Anyways, he keeps a
really thorough notes, really thorough,

515
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,850
you know, back ground stuff.
So he's like, you know, yeah.

516
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:13,870
Your waist down.

517
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,880
Let me see what I wrote down
2014 you guys lose weight.

518
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,870
Yes. You fucking finally listened
to me. I go, all right, man.

519
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,390
Keeps talking. Asking
me. You know how things,

520
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,150
anything bothering you. He goes, Oh yeah,

521
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:35,500
I wrote that you had food poisoning this
one time, you had this. I said, yeah,

522
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,840
you know, I, um, oh, I had to,

523
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:42,010
I had a food allergy test and they sent
it to him cause they send any specialist

524
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:45,970
sends something to him. He goes, that
came back all negative. I said, yeah,

525
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:47,770
I'm going to see this
gastroenterologist though.

526
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,830
I had a consultation just because of
like explosive diarrhea and crazy shirts

527
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,610
and shit.
And he said,

528
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,360
and I broke down for him how
there's kind of no rhyme or reason.

529
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,420
Like some days it's horrible.
Yeah.

530
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,690
It's also like quick and then
some days it's fine, it's IBS.

531
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,680
Anyways, he goes, hmm, hmm.

532
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:17,140
Uh, and then has, has, have you had
that test or that test? And I go, uh,

533
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:20,810
no, I'm having, I'm having it coming up.
And he goes, yeah, I think you should.

534
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:24,670
And he goes, shit, I test.
Should I check your prostate?

535
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,960
And I go, uh, he goes, it looks
at me and I go, I don't know,

536
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,190
like you're the doctor because
we were a little young for it.

537
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,220
I don't think so. All right. Let
me keep talking about gastro stuff.

538
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,520
He goes, but maybe there's
something there. Hm.

539
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,880
All right. Uh, all right,
we'll do it. And I'm like,

540
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,020
oh man. And were you bond cause it
sounded like you got out of it. Yeah.

541
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,530
Well I wasn't bummed cause I told
him I go, he kept looking at me like,

542
00:35:55,531 --> 00:36:00,000
what do you want to do? And I
go, dude, I, I trust your right.

543
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,920
If you think it do it,
do it.

544
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,660
But have you ever had a finger
in your butt hole? Yes. Okay.

545
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,960
But not that deep. So lemme tell
you about this saying is that it's,

546
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,210
it's his, if someone told me
we're not going to do this
today, I'd be like, great,

547
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:19,880
let's move on. Yeah. I wouldn't
debate it. Quit debating it in,

548
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,970
they don't put it in there cause
I don't like a finger in my butt.

549
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,250
So anyways, we do the physical. Oh.

550
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,180
Then he goes, oh, let's
run a quick EKG on you.

551
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,390
And I'm like, all right. He runs it.

552
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,430
And as is has been the case,
I have a super low,

553
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,470
uh, sitting heart rate. No. Like, uh,
like an athlete. Yeah. Which is again,

554
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,230
it's in that, it's in that bit,
it's all like jokes about that.

555
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,510
So he goes and your heart rate is so long
ago. I know. It hasn't changed though.

556
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:59,400
It's always been like that. He
goes, I want you to wear a monitor,

557
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,590
a heart monitor at home tonight
while you sleep. I'm like,

558
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:09,450
why? He goes, because I want to see how
low it gets when you're sleeping. He goes,

559
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:11,870
if it gets this slow when you're awake.
Yeah.

560
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,000
I want to see how low it gets when
you're sleeping. And I'm like, God damn.

561
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:19,650
We probably have near death experiences
every night you think are dreams or on

562
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,710
the other side.
And if you don't know,

563
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,580
you know the jokes that
I make about at our,

564
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:27,000
because marathon runners really,

565
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,290
really strong cardiovascular people,
their hearts are strong,

566
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,770
so therefore they,
they don't beat as many times per minute.

567
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,210
So I have a, my heart, my
sitting heart rate's around 44.

568
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,140
There's gotta be like a hole in it or
something that's making it extra slow.

569
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,430
Well it's definitely not,
I'm laid back.

570
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,800
Maybe he goes like, are you ever
tired? And I'm like all the time. Yeah.

571
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,680
That's your heart.
So anyways,

572
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,090
I wore that.
I slept last night like a 90 year old man.

573
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,170
15 patches. Oh, it's embarrassing. And
I mean it was fine. I don't bad for you.

574
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,250
I saw people look at it. When I
went from him, I went to the, uh,

575
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:17,450
rite aid. I had a button down. Yeah.
Like this one. People were like,

576
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,710
this guy's about to die. I'm surprised
I didn't shave your chest though.

577
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:27,350
Cause it didn't it. Yes. Did it, did heres
rip out multiple hundreds possibly. Yeah.

578
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,260
They usually shave you for that.
They didn't know.

579
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,310
How did you sleep with that stupid thing
in your pocket? It was, I had shorts

580
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,900
on and I was honestly what, you know
what helped yesterday I was so tired.

581
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,700
Does it was easy to fall asleep,

582
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,250
been a rough couple of week in a cigarette
house. We're recording this at night.

583
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,160
When I a while the baby sleeps.
We normally do this in a day,

584
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:55,050
but it's been naughty. Yeah.
Yeah. Lots going on. So,

585
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:59,920
okay. He fingers your but wait, no, no,
no. We're not there yet. Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,580
They take a bunch of blood.
Yeah,

587
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,760
I do a urine test. He goes, I'm here.

588
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,940
You're going to take this heart
thing at home. I go, okay.

589
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,090
Then he checks the balls,
you know.

590
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,130
And what does that feel like? Is it kind
of Nice or it's a medical, it's medical.

591
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:18,990
It's real medical.
He touch it.

592
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:22,650
Hard to feel for lumps
are not hard pressure.

593
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,550
It's,
it's soft to medium,

594
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,910
but he checks it. Does he wear gloves or
free ball and free. Free hands. Gloves.

595
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,270
A soft, nice hands. Nice hands.
Yeah. And you can tell him

596
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,630
knows what to do with a pair and nuts.
Like he knows how to hold them medically.

597
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,580
Sure. Um, yeah. So do you
have to cough? Is that real?

598
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,610
Sometimes I didn't have to coffee
yesterday, but I have had to cough before.

599
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,350
Why do they do that?
Um,

600
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,970
I guess because they know like it's a
reflex thing to seem to live close to go.

601
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,710
So if they don't, maybe something's
wrong. I Dunno. Hmm. Um, anyways,

602
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,910
checked me all out, then comes in and he
goes, all right, lay on your left side.

603
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,630
Hmm.
Yeah.

604
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,530
And he goes in there
now with your left hand.

605
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,640
So imagine you're laying
on your left side. Yeah.

606
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,910
Extend your hand as far as you can
and hold up your cell phone. I'm like,

607
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,650
okay. He's like an open the camera.
And I'm like, all right. He's like,

608
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:22,950
not put the reverse camp,
you know,

609
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,360
reverse camera on so you can, it's
up for a selfie. And I'm like, what?

610
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,520
And he's like, do it if I
put it on. And he's like, all
right, great. Take a picture.

611
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,800
I go, okay. So it's me holding it out.

612
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,610
And then he holds his finger up to his
nose and he's like, Ooh, like that.

613
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,150
That's what my doctor did. And I go,
can I please post this? He was like,

614
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,220
absolutely not.
I sent it to you though.

615
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,920
I was amazed. I really appreciate, I
can't post it. You know what I mean?

616
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,090
Now he's a professional. Yeah, he's
really good doctor. He's so thorough.

617
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,220
He's so good. He's a genius. That guy.

618
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,640
I go in there for like minor
stuff and he's so thorough.

619
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,450
Hey this so then comes the moment
truth. He's like lay, lay there.

620
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,410
Pull your knees up.

621
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,370
Yeah, we had been there and
he lubes up the finger. Right.

622
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,250
How much of the finger does he lubricate?
I can't really tell, but it feels,

623
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,720
and is it embedded in the middle?

624
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,470
He does,
um,

625
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,700
for the index and it's pretty low.

626
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,160
I asked him right before I go,
you want me to clean up back there?

627
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,220
And he kind of smiled and then

628
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,090
he's nice.
He's saying is that,

629
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,230
I thought of that with you because
that's my fear about putting my finger or

630
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:35,330
mouth on your rectum is
dirty. It must be. It was.

631
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,410
And the thing is is that it wasn't,
was it sweaty?

632
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:43,940
It was hot today in La. No, it was
yesterday. Oh is he? Yes. Yesterday.

633
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,090
Yeah, she was overcast. So you did,

634
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:50,510
but you did feel self conscious
about the smell. At first,

635
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,550
I didn't know even know
what it looked like.

636
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,420
So I real quick did a
cursory check back there.

637
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,220
I took some paper and I checked
you got nothing. So I was clean.

638
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,660
Yeah. Cause when I go to the
gynecologist I make sure I'm very clean.

639
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,070
I take a nice full, I didn't know anyone
was going to get in there. I knew,

640
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,800
I remember I asked you, yeah, I go, he's
going to stick his finger in your butt.

641
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,980
And you got no,
he's not because he wasn't going to,

642
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:21,310
he decided in the moment I asked
for it to not ask for it. So, uh,

643
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,393
he stick,

644
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,190
he sticks his finger in and I'm
surprised at the ease and also the,

645
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,570
uh, lack of discomfort I'm
feeling really at first.

646
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,760
Right. So it's like, okay. And
I'm like, oh, oh baby monitor.

647
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,250
I'm like, all right, that's not bad. Yeah.

648
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,080
And as that thought is processing,
like that's not bad.

649
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,450
He does a swipe. He goes, he
goes, no polyps like that.

650
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:58,040
And then he goes, oh, I can feel it. He
goes check into profit. And I'm like,

651
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,550
I do like the like just startled,
you know, like absolutely. Ah,

652
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,700
ah. And he goes, you want
a second opinion? I can put
another finger in there.

653
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:12,170
And I'm like, Dude. And then he pulls
it out. It goes, there you go. I'm like,

654
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,270
oh my God, man. Like it, it was
traumatic. It was traumatic.

655
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,310
It's terrible. Whenever someone puts
their hand inside of you, everyone,

656
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,100
I was getting checked when I was going
to birth Ellis and someone put their hand

657
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:29,510
at my coach every hour. Like it
hurts at that point. Terrible.

658
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,460
So he said,

659
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:36,470
now I put my finger like this and you
before it feels like I have to shit

660
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,080
immediately. You've
liked it. You liked it.

661
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,900
It feels like I have to shit now.

662
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,530
You didn't feel like you had to shit
immediately. You didn't like it.

663
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,450
Please answer my questions.
I have so many

664
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,800
because one time I had a medical finger in
my butt. Honestly, I felt damaged. Sure.

665
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,080
I was like, wow. He really was
rough with you. Well, he wasn't,

666
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,190
I mean it wasn't it rough for
damage or sore because he was too,

667
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,360
it was too rough. I mean, I,

668
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,880
I had a lot of thoughts
about anal after that.

669
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:12,860
Like not, not fun. Tender
felt tender. I was like, Ooh,

670
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,270
let me know if you never
had that, did you? Okay,

671
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,770
so you said that the finger
went in easily. Lot of Lube.

672
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,640
So he really, when I cleaned up back
there it was gunks so that's good. Yeah,

673
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,060
that was considerate of him.
Yeah.

674
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,280
So it went in easy and then you felt
when it got deeper as you're saying,

675
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:36,110
you felt the hook and he kind of
looked at in there. Oh yeah. Yeah.

676
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,060
Sort of thinking about that pegging class
we went to for Nikki. Who is your show?

677
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,290
Because we did a show. We did
Nikki Glaser show, not so safe.

678
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,880
And we went to a peg in class on the show.
Yeah. I was thinking about that. Like,

679
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,120
man, I remember how you guys were
like fucking these clay models. Yeah.

680
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,270
Oh my God. Even those like chapstick
sized ones, I go, man, I don't know.

681
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,150
I didn't,
I didn't think of anything feeling,

682
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,480
and I know I had a medical procedure.
I'm not trying to equate it with that,

683
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,490
but I'm just saying it was
so tender. I was like, Ooh,
you know the Butthole, it's,

684
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:13,200
it is real tender. Roney yeah. It's
just not for me personally, you know?

685
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:16,460
I don't condemn anybody that's into
it, but no, not at all. It's real,

686
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,870
real tender. Yeah. Okay, so now you
took a shit since then. Wait, wait,

687
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:26,370
wait. But did it hurt to shit? It
wasn't like that. No, no, no, no.

688
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,070
It was just like sensitive,
like, you know, like a muscle.

689
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah. Yeah. No one though. Like
those guys used to bang that.

690
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:37,620
Like they were just like,
oh,

691
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,380
rapid triage it out and they would wrap
or fire bang. We've got to be like, Whoa,

692
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:45,750
Whoa, whoa. Take it easy. You just
tell me about those guys. Like, like,

693
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,770
you know what I mean? It's called the
prison pound. Yeah. You love those, right?

694
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:53,810
Love prison pounding. Especially
when you start to dry out. Yeah.

695
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,470
It's like it takes too long and then yeah,

696
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,330
it just dry like a dry rub in there.
Kind of feels like that.

697
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,810
Here's the other part.
He goes,

698
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:08,580
well because of your digestive stuff and
we're not sure yet because you haven't

699
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:10,890
had the colonoscopy yet
and all this and that.

700
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,100
I want you to take this kit home,

701
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,670
shit into this plastic cup and then scoop
of pieces of the shit into these four

702
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:24,780
vials. Dude, I nearly
vomited this morning.

703
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,760
I also had, um, what's it called?

704
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,950
Performance anxiety.
I know you did.

705
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,500
Now don't you wish you
had just done the colon

706
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,190
brown, Brown John Coming up? Yeah,

707
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,370
I sent you wouldn't be punished and
have to do what you going about to talk

708
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,500
about doing. Well, I
still have it scheduled,

709
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,720
but I'm saying that had you done it prior,
you wouldn't have got,

710
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,680
you wouldn't go through what you
did today to have gone through that.

711
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:03,930
That was so disgusting. Let's talk
about it. So here's the thing too.

712
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:04,710
I,

713
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,710
I felt the nature calling and I went
up there and I sat down with a cup

714
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,970
underneath me and a plastic surgeon's
gloves to tell them the accouchement.

715
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:19,860
So you, you have a set of plastic
gloves, you've got a rubber gloves,

716
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,390
rubber gloves, you've got a,
basically a Dixie cap shit into shape.

717
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,140
And then you have several vials.
Yes.

718
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,380
Of each file has a lid. And
the, when you remove the lid,

719
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:37,120
there's a little shovel scooper and
it's for you to break up poop and put in

720
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:37,954
there.
And then there's,

721
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,170
and there's fluid in three
of them and nothing in one.

722
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,810
So I had two false alarms because
they're so worked up about it. Yeah.

723
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,350
I was like, I gotta do it because I also
have a busy day. It's not just like, Hey,

724
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:57,700
do this and then you're
done. It was do this, um,

725
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,620
then go to our house, we're moving
to, had to do something there,

726
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,830
come back here, bed,
go back there. Yeah. So

727
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,270
it was a lot of stuff.
What I'm saying is I, um,

728
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:18,790
man, when I finally got it
to come out, it was like,

729
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:23,140
it came out in, you know, in
one like blend chunk. Yeah.

730
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,960
It was kind of Mushy,
kind of stringy

731
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,660
and it was like in that, there
was something, I dunno man,

732
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,160
here's the thing.
I was fucking gagging at like,

733
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:45,460
what's into like, I've always wanted
to kind of pick it apart. I see. Like,

734
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:49,150
did you see pieces of stuff? Can I
tell you something? I realized too,

735
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,320
and I've said this before,

736
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:55,470
I can talk about the act
of shitting without it,

737
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,260
without a blink actual shit.

738
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,630
I'm not, I don't have, I can't
do it. I'm like, oh right,

739
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:08,290
you've said this before. You're
really not into it. Oh my God,

740
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,173
dude,

741
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,470
you're sitting there right there
with a cup of your own feces.

742
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,910
I have never done that. Chopping it
up. Oh, and here's the other part,

743
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,710
because I had to do those things.

744
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,740
I didn't had to put those containers
in a sealed bag in a third bag and keep

745
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:29,630
them in the frigerator. Cool. Right next
to our babies. No, I kept it in the,

746
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:33,520
in the drawer there's like a special
drawer we have under the fridge.

747
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,930
I put it in there. Good.
That is so gnarly, dude.

748
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,810
So you cut it out, but what was in your
poom asking? Did you find I saw stuff.

749
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,700
I don't want to bring it up to
him. Gagging. I was dry heaving.

750
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,110
I had tears running down my face. It
was really fucking disgusting. I really,

751
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,480
really hated it.
I can't even tell you.

752
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,130
Maybe one day when you've processed
it more, you can tell me what you saw.

753
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,400
It was bad. Just know that
it was bad. It was gross.

754
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,923
Yeah,

755
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,020
it was really bad and
that sounds terrible.

756
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,180
I dropped off.

757
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,830
I dropped off the heart monitor with,

758
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:15,820
so they're going to tell me what,

759
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,450
what happened overnight and then
I dropped off a bag of shit.

760
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,520
He's thorough.

761
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:26,770
Dr. I don't think I've ever heard of
anybody having to go through this much

762
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,580
stuff.
Even on the Dropbox,

763
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,380
I'll do another urine test because he
wanted to make sure my urine test was up

764
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:37,190
to par and was like, yeah, it's fine. They
ran the test. Right then bananas. Yeah.

765
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,990
Good though. That's what she want.
That's exactly what you want. So then,

766
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,920
okay, so that's drama.
Yeah. With the house.

767
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,980
And then I took LJ to the doctor today
for his checkup and he lost his shit.

768
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,240
I had to take blood from
his little heel today. No,

769
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,730
I had to sing twinkle,
twinkle little star for him to calm down.

770
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,880
I calmed them down. Yeah.
My voice is terrible,

771
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:05,630
but it's the only thing that stopped
him. It was so cute. Why didn't you sing

772
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,970
such a weird song? Yeah, I like it.

773
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,230
And then I found a love match for
our nanny or Guatemalan nanny. Um,

774
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,590
his name is Israel and he works in the
parking garage. Yeah. Where pediatrician.

775
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,220
He's real nice. Yeah. I really liked
his energy. I want to set them up.

776
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:51,080
Do you think he, uh, they're
both Guatemalan. Yeah. I
feel like it's a, it's a,

777
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,360
and they're both like super
sweet, you know? Yeah. Like I say,

778
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:59,530
sarcastic shit to both the nanny and to
people like Israel and they're just like

779
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:02,580
blank. Yeah. You know, like little
bit. How's it going? I'm like, well,

780
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,830
kids still alive today at all,
Dude, just remind you of it.

781
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,890
COMP, drought baller shit. No,

782
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,900
fuck them bombing the shit.
Fucking carbs are a fucking ball.

783
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,830
Yeah. Little bit had a little
similar. Same time. No,

784
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,690
no, no. This guy was much sweeter.
Okay. Like a nice Christian dude.

785
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,010
Fucking cops. Fucking Bob is a genius
about this. This sound like the guy

786
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,290
I always do. I hit on
me. It's fucking morning.

787
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,750
Fuck it was the enemy right there,
homie.

788
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,070
Lomi from the gs up.
Tracy Gang homies on value gang homie.

789
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,950
Fuck Lionel from waste sour me and
power gang homie still Bordeaux.

790
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,850
So Daniel's putting it.

791
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,360
That could have been the guy.

792
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,770
That's one of my favorite things of all
time is that those guys findings are

793
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:58,940
released. They're gangbangers. I
mean if the setup is true there,

794
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,330
there's a video. These two dudes
are like, you can hear him,

795
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:06,650
their total la Trobe say
like bought those and,

796
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,920
and they're like, I love gang
violence so much that they like,

797
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,650
it's like, uh, a hack premise
for a joke that they used to say.

798
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,850
Remember when they couldn't find
been loud and all these guys, man,

799
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,120
they should just get sent some crips
and bloods over there. You'll find him.

800
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,160
Shoot them. These guys were like, that's
how much we love it and killing. Yeah.

801
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:26,371
And they,

802
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:30,270
and then in the video they go crazy with
the machine gun and saying it's legit.

803
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,320
Yeah. I think that's a real thing. I've
always said it was hilarious, man. Me Too.

804
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,910
I like anything with gang bangers. Yeah.
Like Mexican ones. Butoh who radios,

805
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:43,680
you know, saying Homie la man. It's
solely homes. Did you see that?

806
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,120
It's sketch, people were passing
around the Cholo fitness. Yeah.

807
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,500
It was pretty funny. I got sent
that like 5,000 times. Yeah. Oh,

808
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:57,400
genes I guess sent that a lot too.
Anyways, so we have this bed that we, um,

809
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,460
the frame we should say the bed is Saatva,
which we've had are, you guys know, uh,

810
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,870
the bed is fun in the mattress is perfect,

811
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,050
but we ordered this bed and we got it.

812
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,790
It took months to get here. And
when it finally did. Oh my God,

813
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,430
it was,
it started squeaking and we got this bed.

814
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:16,140
It arrived in like June or something.

815
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,020
Oh my God. Is that it?
Is that our bed? No,

816
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,283
but it sounds

817
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,650
picture a picture too,
by the way.

818
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:30,990
You guys know we waited
a long, long, long time

819
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,370
to get a nice mattress,
which yes.

820
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:39,340
You know we can slap a
mattress and we waited a long,

821
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:43,880
long time to get this. This is a
really nice bed frame in. Yeah.

822
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,960
Like we spent, you know,
decent money on this for sure.

823
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,790
We didn't have a bed frame.
Yeah. For years. No bed frame.

824
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,530
Just a bad,
just the mattress.

825
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,820
I used to sleep with a bachelors on the
floor and then at one point we got just

826
00:54:57,821 --> 00:55:01,670
one step up, which was just, what
is it? Just a box for rail? Yeah.

827
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,740
Block Saatva set it up there. Like
do you have a, a frame? I go, no.

828
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,660
And they set up, they love,
it's what solve it right.

829
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,600
Gave us so then when we move we're like,
why don't we get a proper look? Adults.

830
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,940
Yeah. Like and with a nice
headboard, you know? Yeah.

831
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:20,290
And we went to a really nice
store and we did it. We're like,

832
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,890
we're buying this really nice bed frame.
It's like an investment by the way.

833
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,740
We bought it, let's say in
February. And they were like,

834
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:33,210
it's going to be delivered March 1st
and then write it to her at the end of

835
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:37,200
February. They go, it's not ready. And we
go, okay, well you know it's been a month,

836
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:41,270
but how much longer? We think in
April. Yeah. Oh, another month. Yeah.

837
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,950
Then they just didn't call back.
Do you remember that? They look,

838
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,600
of course I played then anyways.
Then they were like, okay,

839
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,090
you know when we complain
where you're getting the bed,

840
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,670
the guys came out and set it up and
day one like you lay on the bed.

841
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,110
Okay.

842
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:05,090
But I think we, a couple things. We had a
newborn baby. Yes. And we also were like,

843
00:56:05,091 --> 00:56:08,580
it's new. Like maybe this is
maybe settling. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

844
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,340
And Man,
it's,

845
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,500
it felt like it got worse.
Yeah. I got white worker and
then I would any movement,

846
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,850
any movement.

847
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,480
And you and I get up to pee in the
night five times between the two of us.

848
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,590
So every time one of us gets up it's
like the loudest, it's a nice sound.

849
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:27,360
Okay.

850
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,030
The frame. That's what you do here
at two o'clock in the morning. Yeah.

851
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,990
And then the person leaves
and makes you think,

852
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,270
oh are you talking about
a hundred year old bed?

853
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,690
I know three or four month
old bit and they made it,

854
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:43,020
it was one of those like
custom. Yeah, bed frames.

855
00:56:43,021 --> 00:56:47,040
Like it wasn't just some pos. No. Anyways,

856
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,990
I started to get desperate.
You know when you,

857
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:54,140
when you have the thought of you
picture them saying fuck you,

858
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,960
you bought it. Yeah. Yeah. I used to
have, I would have those in my mind.

859
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:01,740
I know you were really fired up like
to a point where I was kind of worried

860
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,460
because you are ready. We're convinced
that they weren't going to fix it. Yeah.

861
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,500
And you were like, you call, okay,

862
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,100
you call a UGL it cause I'm going
to get too angry. And I was like,

863
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:15,180
all right babe. Like I know when you're
fired up about something. Yeah. I'm like,

864
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:19,770
all right, I'll fucking call them. And
they were totally sweet about yeah.

865
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:24,330
Oh my can of course send us a
recording of the squeak and then from,

866
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:26,550
it's like protocol for them and
then we can send somebody out.

867
00:57:26,551 --> 00:57:31,470
They sent somebody out within 48
hours. Yeah, but you were on your last,

868
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:34,470
like he was one of those things where
you would love town and you're like,

869
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:38,130
could you fix the bed please this
week? And I'm like, yeah, sure.

870
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:43,110
On top of everything else that's going on,
the kid being sick or you know,

871
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:46,920
whatever. I'm going to make
sure. So we finally fixed it.

872
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,510
Finally Heimaey came. Was
that today? Yeah. Hi. May
came. And so what did he say?

873
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:52,770
Why has it been so shitty?

874
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,240
He said the washers were the wrong ones.
Cool.

875
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:02,910
Certain things weren't done
tightly and you know, he took,

876
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,740
we took the mattress off together,

877
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,810
then the box spring and then he
just worked with like the core,

878
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,720
like the rails and he said,
you know,

879
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:17,400
Ron washers here and uh,
tightened everything up. Boom.

880
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,150
Yeah. Cause I sat on, it was great.
Oh my God. I know it's bright.

881
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,430
It's really been disruptive. I think it's
been psychological torture. Yeah, it is.

882
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,070
It is. Because we wake up every time
one of us mood any movement. Eh,

883
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,940
eh. I mean you should be able
to move without. Amen. Yeah.

884
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,330
It was so bad.
It's so weird that we did wait so long,

885
00:58:39,331 --> 00:58:40,164
so long.

886
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,000
We just adapted to it.
A couple of idiots.

887
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,080
It's horrible every day.

888
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:56,260
It is one of those things
where as as humans you just,
you're so adaptable. Yeah,

889
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,360
yeah, of course wrong. And then
you're like, well, just live.

890
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:02,740
We'll just live around this misery
and were really into that. Oh yeah.

891
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,240
That's the bad.
That makes noise.

892
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:05,703
Okay.

893
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,080
You realize how long we dealt with at
that level. No, I mean it's really,

894
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,160
it's pretty a long time.

895
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,940
It's like having one phone charger in the
house half a year. We've been sleeping

896
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,873
like that

897
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:22,200
wrong with us. When you're
like, we can buy phone chargers,

898
00:59:22,201 --> 00:59:27,050
like we can have them in every room.
Like, Oh yeah, that's why like 10 of them.

899
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,880
Why do I suffer? And it's like
such an easy fix. Did they,

900
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:36,380
they didn't even charge us to
fix the bed, right? Uh, no. Yeah,

901
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:41,000
I gave the guys from scratch that we're
doing such a good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:44,420
I suffer so much sometimes.
Yeah. Needlessly.

903
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:49,370
God. Do you want to hear a
crazy accent or see a crazy,

904
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:54,530
a porn clip that's not
hardcore? Sure. Which one?

905
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,320
Porn or ag accent. I mean, you know,

906
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,530
[inaudible] stone,
Bondo,

907
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,000
turn what's available and stuff
like me and a blind competition

908
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,140
and they made arrangements.
They were calling us.

909
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,980
One of my favorite thing from the top
of this is that he's making a challenge

910
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:22,720
video and not lowering the
audio in the background. Well,

911
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,640
you get to hear him,
right.

912
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:28,210
But in any break you get to hear
loud television in the background.

913
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:33,370
And I think the lighting is from the
television. Yes. It looks like. Yes.

914
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:38,371
So he just has a TV room and rambling,

915
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,540
senseless nonsense.
I heard him say any man wants to fight me,

916
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:46,780
which is, it's a pretty
bold, yeah. Challenge. Right?

917
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:50,890
I feel like he and the deck hand
guy, yeah. Would be a good man.

918
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,550
He might be the Irish version
of the deck hand. It might be,

919
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,860
although I feel like this guy
is less of a piece of shit.

920
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,610
Even watching somebody make a,
I'll fight anybody video.

921
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,490
I still feel like he's less of a
piece of shit. Sure. In the deck hand,

922
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,200
he's got his life together a bit more.
He has an apartment in doors, right?

923
01:01:08,201 --> 01:01:10,750
That we know about it. That's
true. He does live inside. Yeah.

924
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,610
I don't, boy any moms
there. Is that right?

925
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:21,230
[inaudible] look at me.

926
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,830
Look at me.
I'm strong demos.

927
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,800
Amy, what's up with his mouth?
He needs a, what is it called?

928
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:32,070
The million dollar smile.
Why?

929
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,110
Why his teeth like that? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. He looks really in bread too.

930
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,990
Oh boy. Yo, this kid like, oh boy.

931
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:45,430
He said he's nine and a half stone.
Nine and a half stone. Yeah. Yeah.

932
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,280
[inaudible]

933
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:56,100
the, he's missing a title. I know. I'm
trying to, I'm trying to absorb it.

934
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:59,070
I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to
do the math on nine and a half stone.

935
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:04,260
I know what it is that minus
the teeth. Wait. Uh, uh,

936
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,890
God dammit.
God dammit.

937
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,830
He weighs what?
Jesus.

938
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:18,090
What is it? Nine and a half. Nine and
a half stone. I forget what the fuck.

939
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:23,091
And you know in your kilometers
you for Rainer's nine stone.

940
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,630
What? How could that be right?
Nine stones. 126 pounds.

941
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:37,080
That's right. He would seem
to be that much half. I Dunno.

942
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,190
I Dunno. How much do boys that
age way? What does he like?

943
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:45,510
30 10 stone is 140 I guess that's what
made me, he's like 130 pounds. All right,

944
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,110
man. Was that few teeth?
That's fucking nuts.

945
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,720
That's really nuts. Chiclets that
are left are black. They're not good.

946
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:00,400
Smoking and drinking every
day. God, this could be,

947
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:04,710
this could makes me scared
to go to Dublin, man. Jesus.

948
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:08,170
Is that how your 13 year olds are?
I don't know where he's at. Oh yeah,

949
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,690
they're all they do is drink a, what
is it? Guinness? Is that Ireland?

950
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:17,130
Yeah, of course. Yeah. I
love Dennis. Of course,

951
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:21,030
when it's fresh, like in the UK,
not the bullshit we have here.

952
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:25,500
I like the bullshit here in the UK. It's
even better. It's not shit goes down man.

953
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:30,000
It goes down easy. Yeah. Yup, Yup.
I like that. I like harp logger.

954
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:34,330
That's my jam. Yeah. And
the CIDER Strongbow. Hmm.

955
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:52,580
Huh? And me brother. I heard that part.

956
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,200
You got a brother in the video.
What's duffer too?

957
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,790
It says that on his sweatshirt.

958
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,630
Don't talk.

959
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:15,390
It kinda looks like like
a hardcore lesbian woman,

960
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,360
right? Yes. Yeah.

961
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,530
Like if this person was like I'm a
woman, I'd be like, yeah. All right.

962
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:28,480
Now his pronouns all over the place.
Maybe that's what's going on.

963
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:33,470
Maybe the teeth are, as part of this
trend, there's binary shift. You know,

964
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:38,410
maybe his pronoun is a
dent.

965
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:42,670
Dental tenders.
There's a miracle smile.

966
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:44,500
Do you think we could
send him one in Ireland?

967
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,590
Why does his brother up so many teeth?
Oh, the shipping and handling on that.

968
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:50,860
It's got to be, you know,
cause we bought a pair of,

969
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:52,580
they haven't arrived yet of
the million dollar smile.

970
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,490
The thing itself was what? $12? No,

971
01:04:57,491 --> 01:05:02,350
49 nine shipping was 1399 right.

972
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:07,180
Which is his badge as the
product. Shipping and handling
was a dollar less. Yeah,

973
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:10,810
it was total. It's a total, totally
ripping poor people off on the shipping.

974
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:15,910
These people don't even have teeth.
I know. Hey for the fucking box.

975
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:16,923
No

976
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:18,563
bullying

977
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,170

978
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,353
bike.

979
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,340
Make a long story short prison. Yeah.

980
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,130
[inaudible] box.

981
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,600
No,
we got a close up of that

982
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:53,700
man. Oh No. Black and Brown.

983
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,780
He's too young for that.
It was he in prison.

984
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,990
It sounds like my ears are
working so good today. I mean,

985
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:04,680
normally this just flows out of me.
So I'm about being in prison.

986
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:05,973
Like

987
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,700
I feel like this is his version of,
you know what I'm saying? Listen to me.

988
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,220
Look at me. Listen to me. Look at me.

989
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,173
Yeah.

990
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,900
Is fucking, oh my fucking
God dude. He's annoying me.

991
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:30,120
Like the retard fucking redneck guy.
Yeah.

992
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,950
A blue band. Redeem
himself. Damn. Good job.

993
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:50,280
Live in God.
Jesus.

994
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:55,120
Oh bummer. Yeah, she's, yeah.

995
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,270
Was this a cheer you up?

996
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,070
That's fine.
You answered

997
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,673
it.

998
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,260
So this is a puppet foreign.
Oh, that's a puppet.

999
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:28,990
She actually had sex with the puppet
genre cause they're incredible.

1000
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:35,980
This puppet has, it looks
like Aaliyah. Oh my God. No,

1001
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:39,100
that's not aliyah.
So disrespectful

1002
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:47,060
that her, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1003
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,533
yeah.

1004
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,820
So she that he has a puppet painter.

1005
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:01,570
She just has sex with the puppy.

1006
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:05,650
She going to have sex with a puppet
though. I mean is they have a dildo.

1007
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,690
Oh God. Why don't you just
rides it like it's a real

1008
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:19,323
bit.

1009
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:24,590
She has to below the puppet boy.
Oh boy. Yeah. No, for real. Yeah.

1010
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,783
Yeah.

1011
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:31,983
Okay.

1012
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:36,960
Yeah. And this woman did this. Yeah, she's
cute though. She could have had a normal,

1013
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,070
I'm sure she does do regular stuff, I'm
sure. But yeah, this time they were like,

1014
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,420
here's an extra 60 bucks for a pub it.

1015
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,100
But as far as pouring goes,

1016
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:50,390
this is probably one of the more
desirable gigs or you're right.

1017
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,840
I mean there's no STDs. There's
no common. Your face. All right.

1018
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,640
It's not like blowing the Wu Tang clan.

1019
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:01,950
Oof All nine oh nine I think about that
since we talked about that on the last

1020
01:09:01,951 --> 01:09:05,460
episode. Yeah. I keep thinking
about it man. Like yeah,

1021
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:08,070
cause you chosen a worst band for that.

1022
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:13,300
That isn't the worst group. What are
they called? What is it? What does a rap,

1023
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:18,250
it's just funny to say like group band.
I'm like,

1024
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:23,120
what are their rap band, right? Yeah. I
mean there, there are 80 years old. Yeah.

1025
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,990
Another wrap group. Yeah, there's
gotta be better. What a crazy band

1026
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:36,330
somebody wrote in like Hanson's three
boys. I thought Hanson was two boys.

1027
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:40,410
I both, I also said one direction
that isn't that for or was for

1028
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:44,310
budget.

1029
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:49,310
People wrote in about the a PSA
already sending in new length.

1030
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:51,084
They're like,
dude,

1031
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:55,310
those aren't even the hardcore
homos are more hardcore.

1032
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:58,560
It's are we going to see them or, oh
yeah. I mean, all right here. Let's see.

1033
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:04,410
Um, I love when they go. Like this one
came in right now this is for Tommy bonds.

1034
01:10:04,411 --> 01:10:08,330
I know he'll get a kick out of
it. No. Yeah, it happens. Yeah.

1035
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,690
Forget. Excited. Click
send. Okay. What's this one?

1036
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:16,620
No real good job on your picture please.

1037
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,680
She spilled my coffee.
I'm sorry sir.

1038
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:27,880
You're fucking bitch.

1039
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,480
I got like that.

1040
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:41,050
You wouldn't get away with it here.
You shouldn't get away with it at home.

1041
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,573
Yeah.

1042
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:54,070
That is not a p as not a cool PSA.

1043
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:59,800
What country was that? That
wasn't America. Thanks Sean.

1044
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:04,480
Thanks dude. Was a real fucking
bummer. Whoa. That was terrible.

1045
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:09,430
The air that you fucking bitch. Oh yeah.
It's definitely on America then here.

1046
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:13,550
But he had an American accent.
Canadia what'd be like?

1047
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,490
Don't you wouldn't do this egg.
Yeah. Do it your waitress. Huh?

1048
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,230
That one's real crazy. I guess. You
know what? Maybe it is Canadian Canada.

1049
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:28,030
I think they actually give a shit about
people and things like this. Right?

1050
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,403
Okay.

1051
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,860
[inaudible] in a terrible accident.

1052
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,430
[inaudible]

1053
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:05,800
Whoa,
man.

1054
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,090
Uh,

1055
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,860
there's not fucking around. No, no, no. I
think you're definitely right about that.

1056
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,450
Wow. I was terrifying. Oof.
It could have prevented that.

1057
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:20,260
She was a nice young lady.
That was pretty terrible,

1058
01:12:20,261 --> 01:12:24,270
but you fucking bitch and he beat the
shit out of her for that will be cool. No,

1059
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,670
that's just like, uh,
I've never, I would never,

1060
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:33,040
we've never done that to a waitress.
Fuck man. I'm, you've wanted to do that

1061
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,030
to a waitress. No. Come on.

1062
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:41,830
They have a a little,
you mentioned retard porn.

1063
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,523
That's what it says.

1064
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,420
Being a groundskeeper for the frat
houses can be a pain in the ass,

1065
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:01,070
but there are a few things that keep me
here. One is that nobody fucks with me.

1066
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,890
The powers to be,
let me do my own thing.

1067
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,280
As long as the yards are kept
up and there are no problems,

1068
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,050
there should be obvious.

1069
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:14,280
There is more barely legal twat on
campus anywhere else in the city. Boy,

1070
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,690
Hey God, I enjoy looking
at fresh, young snatch.

1071
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:22,700
Just particular to house was put on my
list last month and this was the first

1072
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:25,990
time that had a chance to work
here or the narratives middle.

1073
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:31,370
I can't believe they're still thinks
I'm a fucking retard. What an insult.

1074
01:13:31,371 --> 01:13:32,204
There you go.
Because

1075
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,440
yeah,
so he's pretending to be

1076
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:37,653
sure,

1077
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:40,563
sure.

1078
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,390
I can carry anything.

1079
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:51,040
I couldn't help but wonder if why this
beanie cut was talking to me like a moron.

1080
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,330
I understand.
My name's Chris.

1081
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:57,850
I can't believe this.
Duncan

1082
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:02,360
thinks I'm a fucking retard.
What an insult because I started a little,

1083
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:04,010
there's no reason to
think that I'm an idiot.

1084
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,130
I'm going straight in this dunk cut out.

1085
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,310
And I remembered that I was wearing a
shirt that had writing on front special

1086
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:15,670
Olympiads before. I could
say a word. She hugs me.

1087
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,330
My Dick instantly got hard.
I thought you'd feel it.

1088
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,910
I thought of playing a retard.
It was going to get me laid.

1089
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:27,210
I'm all for it.
This is really good research.

1090
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:32,680
Seriously. What's your name? Billy.

1091
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,310
Billy. Yes. Pretty good.
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

1092
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:45,810
It's quite the setup too. Yeah, I
do too. So many like quick to the,

1093
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:48,800
you know, right to the action,
but this is, yeah. You know,

1094
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:53,270
build some humor and excitement around it.
It's a story. Yeah. Really get into it.

1095
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:57,380
Yeah. Elaborate story. Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,890
It's pretty good. And sweet.
Keep going or no, I mean,

1097
01:15:00,891 --> 01:15:03,290
I feel like I know where it's going.
What do you think's going to happen next?

1098
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,073
Okay.

1099
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,180
What are you,
where are you guys?

1100
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,540
I don't understand how you know where
it's going because I haven't even watched

1101
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,410
it yet.
Where's it going?

1102
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:14,980
Yeah.

1103
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:19,300
Um, I think the more, do you think
he'll stay retarded for the sec?

1104
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,270
Well,
what's the,

1105
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,480
what's the tagline to the points
now and here? We're all in one.

1106
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:29,990
So he finishes and he goes,
Bam. I don't know how. Okay.

1107
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,970
Like, what's his fetish?
And he's like, ah, no,

1108
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,290
I'm not retarded. Who's retarded? No,

1109
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,060
he said if I was going to
make so aggressive and fast

1110
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,850
and this like,
she via founded upon it.

1111
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:48,200
Well, he's like done like write books,
so I don't know. Revenge to make it work.

1112
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,820
Yeah.

1113
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,600
Um, she's really not
pretty. You're Sloan now

1114
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:59,080
attractive. Um, well, what are
they doing? Can you describe it?

1115
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,770
Because I'm watching it.
He's alone. Jerking off.

1116
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:06,420
Well, I figured the trick was
not dead, too embarrassed at all.

1117
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,060
So then I looked at who cries like
stupid. Like he kept on Jack. Yeah.

1118
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:14,620
Can BP her? Let's see. He's

1119
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:23,080
quiet. Yeah. So she's, she's

1120
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:24,960
being nice to him.

1121
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:28,950
I figure I better make my plan now
because she was looking at my cock like it

1122
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:32,490
was her last meal,
so I took her hand and grand hat.

1123
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:37,240
This is so fucking long. Right. All right.

1124
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,030
Get to it. Yeah. Now it's, you can
hear the music. They're doing it.

1125
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,250
The retired style. Well, not retarded.

1126
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,170
He's really a munching on her stuff,

1127
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,460
but I kind of want to see what year.
Just wanted to see

1128
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,280
the grand finale.
What's the,

1129
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:00,090
and also I wanted to see if he
was going to be retarded, right?

1130
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:04,580
Or is he going to tell her the truth?
Like, yeah. Higher Iq than you bitch.

1131
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,263
Yeah.

1132
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,580
That's what I retards,
it's gotta be a finale.

1133
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,113
MMM.

1134
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:19,060
No. Oh, here we go. I
think we're getting close.

1135
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:24,170
Yeah. Big retarded finale.
The big fake retarded valley.

1136
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:28,830
It's a really underwhelming
performance, by the way. What?

1137
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:33,500
It looks like two people
fairly like missionary,

1138
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:38,400
but barely really moving.
You know, it's not soft core.

1139
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:43,130
No, no, no, no. It's not,
but it's like real bland.

1140
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,833
Okay,
here you go.

1141
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,430
Ah,
who's retarded?

1142
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,270
Okay.
Ah,

1143
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:10,550
no line. Nothing. I didn't
even think this through

1144
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,050
a lot of acne.
Oh,

1145
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:25,230
they really missed out a golden
opportunity here and the punchline.

1146
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,360
Nothing.

1147
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,930
I was starting to get a little worried
he was putting on her clothes so she was

1148
01:18:30,931 --> 01:18:32,190
getting real quiet.

1149
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,090
Has it beginning to think that maybe
the Jig was up and she was pissed.

1150
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:40,260
I figured what the Hell is that pussy
was definitely worth every trouble.

1151
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:45,990
He kind of promised me that.
You won't tell anyone,

1152
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:48,630
Huh?

1153
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:53,310
Christy can get in a lot of trouble for
taking advantage of this special person.

1154
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,800
Okay, Miss Christy, I promise.
Oh Damn. Yeah they could really,

1155
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,550
that was it.
Like that was such a

1156
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:09,970
blessing that we just got
one over on the slow girl

1157
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,070
man. He should have been like,
yeah, no retarded. You dumb
bitch. Stupid Bitch. Yeah,

1158
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,450
yeah, yeah. You fucked a
pretend retard. Oh my God.

1159
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:24,530
And somebody else will good. We got a lot
of emails about this. This is my fault,

1160
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:29,090
but I'm sorry if the,
uh,

1161
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:34,980
if us dumping the back catalog ruined
your data plan B in your storage, right.

1162
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:39,410
You guys, we explained in the last
episode, but then we got so much,

1163
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,750
we just did it to,

1164
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,560
to be nice and to give out the entire
back catalog to you guys because we get

1165
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:52,070
asked a lot for it. Yeah. And I, and we
did, we always are like, oh, one day,

1166
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,910
any other day we just said
let's just do it. And um,

1167
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:01,940
I insisted and then, I mean, people have
been writing a lot like, oh, thank you.

1168
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:05,150
Thank you. Thank you. Uh,
but wanting to to find these,

1169
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:09,270
but I definitely got a bunch of like,
what in the fuck?

1170
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,550
Like my phone shut off.
Um,

1171
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:18,300
anyways, really sorry if, uh, if it,

1172
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:23,130
you know, fucked up your storage
and everything but a hope.

1173
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:28,250
Hope you do like having access to
all the back catalogs in eight hours.

1174
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:34,440
We had over 1.5 million
down crazy. Um, yeah,

1175
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:38,150
because we'd done that like once before,
a million years ago.

1176
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,370
It was way before the show took off.
Yeah. And it didn't have the impact,

1177
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,590
so we did not know. I
didn't know. Sorry guys.

1178
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:50,890
Um, anyways, people
wrote more farts please.

1179
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,450
This eight email just came in from mason.
Okay.

1180
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,650
I am a longtime mommy recently
looking through your amendment Mama.

1181
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:59,950
So decided to listen to episode
one 93 with cousin Janette.

1182
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,910
I'm glad you mentioned that. Undoubtedly
one of your finest mama sows. Uh,

1183
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,810
I had an epiphany as I was listening.

1184
01:21:07,811 --> 01:21:10,000
I had an epiphany where
have all the parts gone.

1185
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:13,060
I listen every week and
did not notice until now.

1186
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:15,970
There has been a real fart
drought at your mom's house.

1187
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:18,370
I do not know what the
reasoning behind this is,

1188
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,670
but I think I speak for a lot of
mommies. When I say, come on, you guys,

1189
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:25,390
show me how those big tits fart.
With that being said,

1190
01:21:25,391 --> 01:21:27,820
I still love the show immensely.
A door, the main mommy's,

1191
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:30,690
but seriously more fart please.

1192
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:35,640
A Mason from Charlotte. I saw Tom, uh,

1193
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:36,820
on the 15th.

1194
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:43,060
Now does he mean that we aren't farting
or that we don't play enough farts?

1195
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,700
I think it's a combination of the two.

1196
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,760
It's really been a fart decline.

1197
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:53,880
And I will say the reason that our farts
tapered off is because our microphones,

1198
01:21:55,151 --> 01:21:59,510
we used to hold them in our hands and then
we upgraded the studio. We've got the,

1199
01:21:59,511 --> 01:22:00,370
and now we do these.

1200
01:22:00,371 --> 01:22:03,790
And it's really hard to fart into these
microphones cause there's an arm, right?

1201
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,980
Oh, what is that? And
you'd have to uh, Jeez.

1202
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:13,670
I think you're, whoa.
Uh, um, all right. Yeah,

1203
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,500
we're good. Uh, you're answering
the question for them though.

1204
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,960
What do you mean get far mix?

1205
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:22,843
Just put mics on.

1206
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:27,350
That's really good. And we can get them
professional grade like these [inaudible]

1207
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:32,060
yeah. And then what happens is
you mute them and I let you know,

1208
01:22:32,061 --> 01:22:35,720
like that's your fart. So whenever
you have one you just unmute it.

1209
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:41,060
It's a really good idea. I mean, it really
get, and guess what happened as we're,

1210
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,920
as we're talking about this,
sure.

1211
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:48,130
As we're having this convert sation the
king has returned from his long Brown

1212
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:55,700
cation. No. And surprisingly enough,
he's still ripping some damn farts.

1213
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:00,260
Wow. Well look, can we see, can we see it?

1214
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,620
I mean,
he's back.

1215
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,313
Our great leader

1216
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:18,160
an apartment.
Whoa.

1217
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:24,680
It's still doing his thing and
stuff like that. That's his. Wow.

1218
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,100
Wow.
Yeah.

1219
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,080
Sorry. You know, I feel like
it's been so long. It feels like

1220
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,990
the first time, you know?
Yeah. Nice. Whole there. Ooh,

1221
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,333
Jesus.

1222
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:41,140
Oof Man.

1223
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,400
I missed him so much.
Now this is a,

1224
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,660
an upgrade because when we more
king parts around apartment,

1225
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,580
that's the title of the video course.

1226
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:51,830
The first time we found him he was
in his parents' basement. Yeah.

1227
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,010
And now he's got his own place,
which is great.

1228
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,580
There's been other kitchens and other
rooms though. I feel like he's moved.

1229
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:01,840
Maybe he's the Kinda guy that can't hold
down a job long and therefore we lose a

1230
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:05,540
lot, you know? No, kind of
feels like that to me. Uh,

1231
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,950
surely none really farting a lot though.
I like the whole,

1232
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:12,640
yeah, it looks good. Ooh. That
felt like that could go wrong.

1233
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,130
That could go south real quick.

1234
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,480
His guts. Sure. A shrink.

1235
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,363
Yeah.

1236
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:32,103
Si.

1237
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,870
What do you think doctor would say to him?

1238
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:39,610
I was just thinking that he would have to
go through his shit with his own hands.

1239
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,870
Now, a lot of people over the years have
written to us and say that ass rappers a

1240
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:49,510
fraud and that he'll pump
his rectum full of air. Yeah.

1241
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,540
I don't see how that's Po.
How can you fart for five?

1242
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:56,530
Whole consecutive meant there are no
edits. There are edits. Oh, and this one,

1243
01:24:56,531 --> 01:25:01,000
there is a lot on watching right now and
it's like, like three fights in a row.

1244
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:03,720
Let's see. Okay, let's see.

1245
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,370
Rod, he's tiny. Assassinated. Okay.
Yeah, it's all the third or fourth.

1246
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:14,880
But do you think he's a fraud? No,
man. I mean he's, he's dedicated.

1247
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:23,330
That's a really impressive car.
That was one.

1248
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:28,740
Sounds like, I mean that is a
lot of air coming out, so yeah.

1249
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:30,703
Well,

1250
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:35,000
I mean you either have to be
consuming constantly to keep that out,

1251
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:38,510
which he likes to consume is a
gluttonous slob or whatever. Yeah.

1252
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:42,380
Harry and gross letting a
Slob. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

1253
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,330
he is the only,

1254
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:49,660
the only person who has not come
on your mom's house after us.

1255
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,530
We're sorry doing him. He did give a
shout out to us though. He did. No,

1256
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,520
he didn't say it. If you, when he
had his youtube channel, he said,

1257
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:03,050
it said in the video description,
shout out to your mom's house. Oh cool.

1258
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:08,420
So he gave us some props. It was a tip of
the cap. That's a good tip of the panty.

1259
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:13,070
That was the most he would do. He did not
want any exposure. So interesting. And,

1260
01:26:13,071 --> 01:26:16,110
and I, we either went on
over there. Yeah. And we,

1261
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:19,990
we talked about him and they were an yeah,

1262
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,830
we did a profile and show Joe.
And even with all that,

1263
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:27,050
after we got back from that, we
were like, now let's try to get,

1264
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:29,000
and he was unresponsive.
We asked people,

1265
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:33,170
we found out his contact info because
it was posted, I think on live league.

1266
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:37,250
We offered him money. Yeah. We
offered him money and hey dude,

1267
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:41,600
we'll pay you whatever art because I love
it. Yeah. The love of the game. Yeah.

1268
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:45,050
It really is. You can't be bought.
He doesn't want the, the glory.

1269
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:48,840
That's how he's a purist. You respect
him for that. He's a purist. Yeah.

1270
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:52,940
He doesn't show his face as much anymore.
If you'll notice,

1271
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,160
it's just the panties.
And the

1272
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,770
no, he still shows. It
turns back and yeah,

1273
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:01,510
but it's not really now.
Look,

1274
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,040
have a look what's coming up here though.

1275
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,800
Your favorite look out brown.

1276
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:17,120
Oh my God. But then I'm up is
my favorite. It's the best.

1277
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:21,430
Yeah.
How this makes me so sad.

1278
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,090
This is going well and he used
to do the double thumbs up.

1279
01:27:24,091 --> 01:27:25,130
It's been a really great,
yeah.

1280
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,550
Snappy. Oh, that's a good one.

1281
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,473
I got to tell you.

1282
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:36,500
That looks familiar to me. I think
this might be old footage. No,

1283
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:41,240
these might be old fart. Yeah. Yeah.
No, no. I don't recognize this room.

1284
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:46,600
What's on the walls? What do you think
that is? Sure. A band that's a weird,

1285
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:47,600
it doesn't fit him

1286
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:54,800
house.
Love

1287
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,080
that one. That the Coi on my
stomach one oopsies. Yeah,

1288
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:03,750
very clear and gross. Oh, he is
more farts around my apartment.

1289
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,760
Thumbs up if you want
more apartment farts.

1290
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,113
Let's see.

1291
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:14,410
Of course we want more apartment for it
was kind of dumb question is just do it.

1292
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:19,710
Just give us what the people want.
He's a construction worker.

1293
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:23,100
How do you know? Says it on the
site. What site, but on Youtube,

1294
01:28:23,101 --> 01:28:26,040
on his profile says,
my gluttony has become a hobby of mine.

1295
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:30,180
I work as a construction worker and I
keep my gluttony a secret from my family.

1296
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:30,931
Oh,

1297
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:35,430
I'm gaining for all my subscribers and
love scarfing down tons of fattening and

1298
01:28:35,431 --> 01:28:39,660
lard, gross food and garbage to
pack in my growing Harry Beer Gut,

1299
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:43,290
my goal is to reach 300 pounds
with the help of my fans. Okay.

1300
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:45,540
So that makes sense.
He wants to remain anonymous.

1301
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:50,380
Never written that much before though.
No, it doesn't sound like him. You know,

1302
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:55,520
the thing about him is he does have this
Banksy quality where it's cause there's

1303
01:28:56,161 --> 01:28:56,570
all these,

1304
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:59,460
cause he's been kicked off of Youtube
and lively because so many times.

1305
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:02,410
And I always wonder if somebody,
just the videos, you know,

1306
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:06,060
ripping them and then saying that
they're him. He's so mysterious.

1307
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,770
That writing that you just read,
that's not ass rapper voice.

1308
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,930
That's just not him.
I don't believe it.

1309
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:20,880
And then this is good.
Like this is more

1310
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,510
vast editing. Yeah.
There's an effect. Yes.

1311
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:27,123
Edit.

1312
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:33,280
And it's this like a flashback the way
that they're editing it. Yeah, this is,

1313
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:37,820
this is an old wise, this is not him.
This is in my mind. You're supporting

1314
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:45,350
her staff are really advanced editing.
This is six

1315
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:52,910
man.
And smashing it with some beer or

1316
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:55,950
the audio is right with it.

1317
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,610
Steve's babies was fucking
loads of Manet's, Huh?

1318
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:03,640
Yeah.

1319
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,970
Feel like it's too advanced. You know. Um,

1320
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:12,490
I remember what he did this thing that
was really gross where he used to sit on

1321
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:15,400
food. I know. I didn't like hard
on it and then eat it. Yeah.

1322
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:20,860
That was like really,
really into now this look,

1323
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:25,750
according to this one,
he would fart on like eggs and need them.

1324
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,960
So gross.
So gnarly.

1325
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:32,860
Quietly farting around my apartment
is the name of one quiet. Wow.

1326
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:38,070
That does look recent. Then quality video.

1327
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,790
New panties. Yeah. This one's
new. I am fascinated by him.

1328
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:47,640
Of course. Is the most intriguing
person from your mom's house.

1329
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:51,150
That's real low quality. Yeah. This
is new. This is a new apartment.

1330
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,950
I believe that he works construction.
Yeah.

1331
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:04,230
On the ladder. Set up.
Climbing the ladder.

1332
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:11,400
I like his set up, so that's my favorite.
The storylines. He's a lunatic man.

1333
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,180
Yup. Yup. Um,

1334
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,600
that's funny that that came back as we
read the other emails that it wasn't a

1335
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:20,610
setup man. Isn't that serendipitous? Yeah.

1336
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:24,330
Isn't that interesting how the
universe wants you to hear those farts?

1337
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:29,040
Really does. Where are the farts? Here?
They are asking. You shall receive.

1338
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,500
[inaudible] I got a pack.
I know.

1339
01:31:31,501 --> 01:31:35,820
I'm so tired of what we were up with
so early with Lj. Yeah. Who is it by?

1340
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:38,550
Cracking. Ah. All right, let's go.

1341
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:42,990
I'm going to eat some Turkey sausage.
All right. I'm going to go to bed.

1342
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,830
All right. Thanks for listening guys.

You know what I'm saying?

Nope. That same friend check soon. US.

1352
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,343
like this.

1353
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:42,713
Please forgive me.

1354
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:49,070
You don't say the same. Oh, la La proper.

1355
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:52,903
