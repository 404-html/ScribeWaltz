fuck's going on with this guy. Um,

78
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,030
real quick just to,
before I forget the, um,

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,570
twitch,

80
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,880

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,860

00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,950
so youtube the show drops 11:00
PM Pacific Tuesday evenings.

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120

84
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,640

9:00 PM and as an added bonus,

85
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,690
blue band is there. Jean,
you were there last week.

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,220
I'm going to try to jump on next week. I
did. I got to talk to mommy for a minute.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,960
What's your, uh, handle? I think
it's queen jeans. Queen genes one.

88
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,980
I'm Dj Dad Mouth One. So I'll be there
in a week. I'm surprised nobody took

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,560
that. It's twitch.tv/your mom's
house podcast. It's cool. I, I,

90
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,620
you know what, I'm very not cool. Yeah.
And I went on there and I'm like, oh,

91
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,810
what a great way for fans of the show
to kind of chat it up, chat and, and,

92
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,120
and go along with what's happening live.
It's kind of weird,

93
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,760
but I don't know what this kid, this
kid does have a really long neck. Danny,

94
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,160
long neck and Anita Lane in a lotion.

95
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:27,080
One neck like this.
Yeah.

96
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,650
Now do you see, I do think it's
really long or that it's an angle.

97
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,240
It's really long.
I was going to ask,

98
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,610
do you think that the length has anything
to do with his voice being Danny Lung,

99
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,510
neck in, in, in, in their vocal
cord stretched out? Yeah. He's got,

100
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,430
is he not? He's not American,
right? What is it? He's
definitely American. Oh really?

101
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,680
I thought he sounded like New Zealand,
New Zealand. Oh No, no, no, no.

102
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,310
Maybe in US mom's truck. Oh my God. The
baby just kicked right. You have a baby.

103
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,370
Oh my God. I was so painful. Shit, man.

104
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,620
There's a person there and forget.
So ladies,

105
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,500
if you're known to newness, they
knew this comment, comment and uh,

106
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,670
you know, I know when it is, am I
in marks around what is happening?

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,660
Long neck one lions, Dram
your lists. You know what,

108
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,470
I can't help but think when
this happens. I mean, obviously,

109
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,040
you know he's an odd bird.
Yeah, it's an ostrich.

110
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,100
But what's great about the Internet is
that he's putting out a call out there

111
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,150
for someone to rub lotion on
his long ass neck. Yeah. It's a,

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,130
it's an odd thing to do. He sounds
weird. He looks different. Um,

113
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,470
someone's going to do it.
Someone's going to be like,

114
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,030
I'd love to rub lotion on your neck.
Is it about us being all connected?

115
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,060
It's someone is watching this being like,
I want to rub lotion on their kids.

116
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,610
That's the one unifying
element to the internet.

117
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,450
The rest is divisive and hate
and you know, horrible comments.

118
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:03,230
And then there's times like this where
some freak can get somebody to rub lotion.

119
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,310
That's true. Yeah. Do you think the
vocal fry is a result of the length?

120
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,380
I don't know.
I don't know if he is,

121
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:14,381
I'm making it so that it sounds
like that or if it's really,

122
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,830
um, just something that's,
you know what I mean?

123
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,730
I don't know if it's a big forced
thing. It's forced. That's an aspect.

124
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:26,480
This vocal fry shit. I know,
but guys don't usually do this.

125
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:31,400
Is it usually a a girl, a teenage girl
thing or a younger girl? Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,880
Dad. No, I don't know.

127
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,080
Megan and I have been together
for nearly three years.

128
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,980
She's a beautiful go who I'm very much
in love with and I have a lot in common

129
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,110
with. I can't wait to get
home and jump in the pool.

130
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,820
It sounds like he's laying
down when he speaks, right? No,

131
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,990
it does nick down.

132
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,310
Notice the dual desk.
He have vocal fry

133
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,690
and also again an accent and affect the
dual dis as he's talking like gangster.

134
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,660
If y'all got a Laney no
new on the side of my neck,

135
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,370
you know, tell him to hit me up. Got Up,

136
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:18,380
got it on nick. Manage. But it,

137
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,740
now this does have the elements
of a great, your mom's house.

138
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll tell you what's,
what's striking me though,

139
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,750
I think I know what you're going to say,

140
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,760
but I do think what I'm really enjoying
about a damn long neck or Danny long

141
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:36,930
neck, whatever his name is,
Danny long there that um,

142
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,380
he's at least feigning some
sort of confidence. You know,

143
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:45,381
it's very easy to be down about
yourself if you have a 26 inch neck.

144
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,170
Yeah. But he's like, you
know what? I'm owning it.

145
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,970
I'm going to go with the nickname always.
You know,

146
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,530
you always have to accentuate your flaws.
Yeah.

147
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,460
Rather than try to hide them because
everyone sees it and that's really success

148
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,330
level when they call me big pop,
you know what I mean?

149
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:04,280
It's like saying mushy perps you know,
my tits aren't getting any smaller. Yup.

150
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,740
But we just got to address the fact that
they're getting more and more enormous

151
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,230
everyday. Big Daddy Stag Dick. Okay.

152
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,800
Put it out there.
It's one of your sad traits.

153
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,980
Really bummed about having
a big old stinky deck. Yeah.

154
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:23,820
Everyone used to point at
it and laugh like fun of me.

155
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,220
Yeah. I get caught on things and people
are like, oh, you got a big Dick.

156
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,010
And I was like, no, I talk about it.

157
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,950
Was that hard for you to
change after football practice?

158
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,880
Everybody hated changing after football.
I went to a,

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,260
a weird school with regard to that.
What do you mean? Well, I remember,

160
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,090
I mean it's weird because you should
be a little more comfortable with it,

161
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,170
but when I went to school, I'm an
underclass. I'm a freshman high school.

162
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,930
The upperclassmen were changing what
towels around their waist and and like

163
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,450
wearing boxers into the showers,
not Jesus.

164
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,210
So you don't want to break the mold of
what the upperclassmen are doing because

165
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,440
then you're like being extra
weird, you know, queer.

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,360
But it was weird that they
were doing that. It is weird,

167
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,700
especially because they're upperclassmen,
they're more developed.

168
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:17,310
I think a big part of it was
that it was a very small school.

169
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,530
I think if it were a normal size, high
school go, you know, or a big high school,

170
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,640
I don't think that ever
would have happened.

171
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,680
I've always felt that showering at school
was just so cruel and I know it's hard

172
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:30,300
on a teenager and adolescent.

173
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:34,440
Your body is just for Octa and then they
want you to get naked in the middle of

174
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,590
the day and then when I have practice
at the end of the day and then just go

175
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:40,710
home dirty, can't you do that like in
a jam or something? Yeah, I don't know.

176
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,660
Football you get really funky. It's
tight stuff. You know a helmet,

177
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,800
you're sweating and it's Florida.
What time of day were you practicing?

178
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,040
I was going to say rehearsing three
30 to five 30 and just fucking go home

179
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,220
and shower. Why do you have to
shower your disaster after football?

180
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,870
Just such a mess.
Amelie.

181
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,240
When one kid walked around flaunting
his deck and he had a big old,

182
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,110
yeah, he's black and he
had a big Dick and he also,

183
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,880
you know what he's looking for the dudes.
Oh, he was looking for the dude's. Yeah,

184
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,270
he was looking for Dee Dee found any
dudes in high school in high school,

185
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:20,020
but I think outside of high school he
definitely met some dudes. It's so crazy.

186
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,870
Yeah. Guys are such animal.
He liked showing it, you know.

187
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,970
But I feel like I would too if
I had a big old begging me too.

188
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,330
I didn't have a deck like that.
Oh who does vary?

189
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,840
My Dick would hide and especially
when I was active. Yeah.

190
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,350
Brought it would like invert, it
would like grow into me, but that's,

191
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,890
I think it's not like natural cause
you're, your body's protecting your,

192
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,050
you're tweaking berries natural.
If you have a little Dick.

193
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,530
I never showered after, well first of
all I didn't really do PE as a kid.

194
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,850
I would like fake run the I do,
I do like a 15 minute mile.

195
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,210
So I would never really break a sweat
because I was golf and then that meant

196
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:02,490
that my makeup will get all messed up.
So I was just kind of fake ticket sizes.

197
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,700
So traumatic for boys mean he's still
thinking about those decks, Huh? No,

198
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm thinking about like the what,
how traumatic. It's like titty size,

199
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,290
but tiddy size is traumatic for us
girls. Yeah, that's true. I can see that.

200
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,780
I almost feel like Dick size and periods
are traumatic, different, you know,

201
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,770
but then you get your period and like
you want to hide that kind of from the

202
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:25,090
other girls who maybe they
don't have. There's really,
yeah, I didn't like it. Yeah.

203
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,410
Cause then it's,
that's embarrassing.

204
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,050
You could bleed all over your
shorts or something at school,

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,160
like the first time you get it.

206
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:34,600
That was my big fear is that I get my
period at school and like I just bleed

207
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:38,890
everywhere. I mean it didn't, didn't go
down that way, thankfully. God. But um,

208
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,250
yeah, but you guys are always
into your big Dick Sizes.

209
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,480
I feel like it's a big deal with
guys deal. It's a big deal. Can they,

210
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:50,800
I mean they have the science yet to
make people's Dick's bigger. They do,

211
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:55,480
but it's not, um, it's not
like breast implants. Yeah,

212
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,940
you figure it.
See that's the thing is that usually do,

213
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,220
and here's the thing about a
breast implant that doesn't,

214
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:03,340
let's say isn't perfect. You're like,
ah, it's still a tit or whatever,

215
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,610
a dick implant, or like, you know,

216
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,910
a fake Dick that makes you make it bigger,

217
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,590
could affect bodily functions.
It could affect definitely performance.

218
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:18,430
It could affect sensation.
Like it's totally not worth it to do that.

219
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,320
I feel like they could just put like
a mold dick over your tiny deck.

220
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,680
Like you've got a small like can we
just put like an implant deck over your

221
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,870
regular Dick?
I don't think they do it like that.

222
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,130
Like I would never sign up for
any type of surgery on my Dick.

223
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,520
That wasn't the mandatory,
well of course. I mean, yeah,

224
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,540
I mean like I have a normal sized Dick,
but I'm saying if it were,

225
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,710
even if it were like micro penis,
I still would be like, no, no, no.

226
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,020
I agree.
That's so,

227
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,770
but here's the thing is that men have
invented like vaginal rejuvenation and

228
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:54,110
boob jobs and cellulite sucking out.

229
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,520
You'd think that the guys would start
inventing penile growth stuff. Like,

230
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,280
I don't know if they can do bro. I
know they do employee, they do peanut,

231
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,520
well they do male, female to
male surgeries. They do. Yeah,

232
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,410
they do an enlargement surgery. It
exists. Right, right. But not like a big,

233
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,030
it's not good. I don't think it's, I mean
I've seen some shows on it. It's like,

234
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,910
I dunno, it doesn't seem like it's, if
it were a really effective and well done,

235
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,250
you'd hear guys be doing it well.
Cause I've seen those penises that like a,

236
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,300
when a woman transition, they basically
grow the clit out through stop point.

237
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,820
So you just have an enlarged and enlarged
clitoris or whatever and it's not,

238
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:38,510
it doesn't look like a big all
painter. I don't know. Dude.

239
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,860
So crazy between your legs.

240
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,180
That's basically what I would, I would
totally get badge rejuvenation now.

241
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,990
Snatch tighter just cause
it gets blasted with kids.

242
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,920
Like I'm gonna have my second baby and
this kid's already big. They're like,

243
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,300
it's going to be at least eight pounds.

244
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,950
I think the doctor takes it fucking
blast my badge for a test drive.

245
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,330
That's how they know if it's done right,

246
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm going to have to have intercourse
with you right now. Check your oil

247
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,450
and you wake up. You're like, what
happened? He's like, feels good.

248
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,530
And it was a great time. Are you in the
room too? And he's like, this is great.

249
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,850
You're gonna love it as a
field. Oh really? Nice. Cool.

250
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,340
But I have to because it's all
blasted. It's all fucked up. Yeah.

251
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,440
No. What disaster down
there. And I don't think so.

252
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,180
Can be even bigger disaster after the
second boy. You think so, dude? Yes.

253
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,690
It's all, it's all trashed.
This vessel is trashed.

254
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:42,980
I need to get my eight tits done.
I could get my badge. Don, come on.

255
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,830
My tits are all fucked
up now they're below my

256
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,470
got big nat Geo titties. When I take
my bra off, they just hang to my belly.

257
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,750
I look like I'm ever seen
like those gorillas and the
zoo that I've given birth.

258
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,990
You're, you're kind of going
overboard now. Naked, pregnant.

259
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:04,890
I'm saying I take my bra and it
looks like Coco the gorilla. I mean,

260
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,620
she's just, it's been alive forever. I'm
surprised she lived this long, long time.

261
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,650
But anyway,
I have gorilla tits and then this belly,

262
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:17,810
it's fucking disastrous. Yeah.
Cocoa knew sign language.

263
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:20,930
How Rad was that?
Raised a bunch of kittens.

264
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,760
Coco is a little kid.
We saw a fucking hummingbird getting fit.

265
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,270
Maybe humming birds nest right
outside our kitchen window.

266
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:32,000
It's the most exciting fucking thing
in the world. Another 10 years.

267
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,560
I would weep at that site.
I think.

268
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,260
I know. I feel like it's really
special, isn't it? It is.

269
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,030
It's hard to be cynical
about baby hummingbirds being
fed by their mommy. I know.

270
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:51,960
It's so fucking cute. I got my little
feet are out there so little the baby.

271
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,070
I know.
Tiny little farm.

272
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,560
I get so excited when I have a customer
at my hummingbird feeder. I just love it.

273
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,720
I can't believe they're using it.
You know,

274
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,780
here you are here. Speaking of Moms, check
this out. So this girl set up her mom.

275
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,740
Okay. By just having an aggressive
conversation on the phone, like God,

276
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,450
like the mom is sitting there and she
set up a camera and then she's talking

277
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:18,660
like someone's talking shit to
her, you know, so that's the Mama.

278
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,253
Hello.

279
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,320
Do you could pull up,
I got you to address already.

280
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,100
Oh, I seen this. She's like,

281
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:38,101
what is the grandma says [inaudible]
has comedy that Sousa Trump

282
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,250
you can put up right now.
I'm here.

283
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,520
That's such a mom move. Right?
That's, that's your uh, yeah.

284
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,470
Your inner baby bird.
I know. Check this out.

285
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,883
Yeah,

286
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,770
she got her good.
I mean that mom went from zero to 60 fast.

287
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,560
Somebody calls our boy and says they want
to talk some shit. We talked some shit.

288
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,230
Yeah, call me. Call me
right now, mother fucker.

289
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,070
Gary and consulate yesterday.

290
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,190
I have some affairs in Hungary. Still a
little bit cause my mother's death, blah,

291
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:42,860
blah blah. And you have to call
to make an appointment, right?

292
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:47,720
They don't just take fucking walkups.
Of course, I called a week ago and,

293
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:52,250
uh, the Hungarian person
answers and goes, ah,

294
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,420
VR eating lunch, call back later,
click and doesn't even say goodbye.

295
00:19:56,421 --> 00:20:00,440
It's so crazy basic.
Not really.

296
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:04,790
Cause that's how shitty my tribe is.
And I have the phone and to Tommy,

297
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,360
I go this fucking bitch. I mean,
why did you answer the phone then?

298
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,080
If you're not going to take my
call, let it go to voicemail, Bro.

299
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,200
You're eating your lunch. I respect
that. But then to just be like,

300
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:18,260
we already think, launch a call
back later, he can hang up.

301
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,300
That's going to hear what you have
to say. No, not nothing, 100%.

302
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,440
Exactly how I imagined the
Hungarian consulate to behave.

303
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,210
You have the unfriendly,

304
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,560
it's my culture and I listen. Uh, we
have many wonderful things about Hungary.

305
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:39,090
We were once a great empire,
culturally, a lot of cool shit.

306
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,010
But you know, my shrink is trying to
convince me. She's like, you know, not,

307
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,590
not everybody. And not every
Hungarian is like this. I go, yeah,

308
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:50,620
but as a culture were pretty rough.
It's a rough,

309
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,120
I would say it's accurate and there's,
there are nice people. That's true there.

310
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,410
I mean I have wonderful people
that I then, by the way,

311
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:59,930
you thought that that tracksuit girl was
one of your native cause like we were.

312
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,940
We were. And so we find it. So anyway, the
point is two months they're booked out.

313
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:07,390
She has one appointment I can have
in two months, which was yesterday.

314
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,770
Tommy and I rolled down there and I'm
sitting there and as blonde chick roles in

315
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,640
wearing track pants and the track zip
up and I was like, that's what's up.

316
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,450
That's my girl right there.
She's totally one of my tribe.

317
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,980
I of course do, you know, rude
is shit like not very helpful.

318
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:28,960
Sit Down with Uva and it's kind of
not.

319
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,390
And we'll have a video that
plays the passport photos. Yeah.

320
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,630
That shows you how to go about entering
to get your passport information.

321
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,330
So fucking weird family enter.

322
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,000
And in the video the family sits show,
they show you the family entering,

323
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:48,740
sitting across from the
Hungarian consulate,

324
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,140
we employee and video and then uh,

325
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,320
getting their photos taken. And
then fingerprints, you know,

326
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,630
they show a guy in a cast,

327
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,470
like his arm's in a sling
and the cast hang walks in.

328
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,350
He never even semis smiles.

329
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:09,580
He walked with a measurable kind of face
children looks like look like they fear

330
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:14,110
him like they stand back from him and
then when they're like take a photo and it

331
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:17,860
shows him going just
a grimace on his face.

332
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,810
That's what it would be
like when you come to there.

333
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,360
It's an off video.
Yeah,

334
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,490
just misery thing.
Optimistic. How's that now?

335
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:34,280
Most people would like even with
just show a family walk in, hey whoa,

336
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,310
it's so weird that they would cast a
guy with an arm cast and then two of his

337
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:44,280
fingers and a miserable look on his face.
Miserable. Yet. It's so funny. Very weird.

338
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,530
But it makes me dread even like I was
fucking dreading having to go there and

339
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,920
deal with this shit. Cause you know
the Hungarian government is like not,

340
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,300
they're not. It's not actually what
government is easy. That's true.

341
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,030
Having to do us stuff sucks.
But man, you can't even smile.

342
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:04,550
Like they can't even feign being
human. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

343
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,820
So I'm glad that shit over with.

344
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,430
This is like the last thing I have
to deal with from my mother's death.

345
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,530
Nobody tells you when somebody dies.

346
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,410
It's just paperwork for fucking
two or three years, man.

347
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,080
It's just a legal nightmare.

348
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,100
So if you can get your affairs
in order and get a will in place,

349
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,220
a living trust before you died and make
it easier on your kids and your family

350
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,000
do do it because it is a such a
bomber if you don't have any of that.

351
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,920
Um, so anyways, you got a new show.

352
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,821
Well here's the thing,

353
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:39,930
I talked about it last week and I've done
a lot of messages. People are into it.

354
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:43,570
So this is a spoiler alert.
Spoiler alert,

355
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,430
the staircase,

356
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,070
spoiler alert,
it's 13 episodes,

357
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:51,290
so you might be behind and if
you don't want to hear this,

358
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,530
I'm giving you fair warning.
Scroll ahead a few minutes.

359
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,140
So that being said, here we go. I
have been obsessed with this thing.

360
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,730
Um, they recently added three new
episodes. So I guess this thing came out.

361
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,810
I missed it when it came out.
Originally it is an old ass show.

362
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,850
Well it's a documentary series.
How long ago did,

363
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:14,450
they probably originally aired it, I
don't know, at least a few years ago.

364
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,150
And then they updated it with
three new episodes, but it was,

365
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,890
the whole thing was new to me.
So I'm,

366
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,310
I've been tracking through 13 hours and
I even enjoy it when I wake up and I was

367
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:28,640
waiting for the twist, the
turn, you know, and uh, again,

368
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,660
if you haven't seen it yet or you want
to see it or you're halfway through it,

369
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,630
I'm going to give it to you right now.
Um, but if you're not, I'll tell you this.

370
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,730
The,
the fucking show gives you,

371
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:44,720
I would say eight episodes or more
where you're like, dude, this is,

372
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,440
where's this going to?
How is this going to turn in any way?

373
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,920
And then it's the biggest fucking turn
that you don't expect because there was

374
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,210
corrupt officials within the system,

375
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,843
um,

376
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,640
who withheld in perjured themselves
on the stand banana people in the SBI,

377
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,490
which is like the State
Bureau of Investigation.

378
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,100
I didn't even know there was an SBI.
I've never,

379
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,330
I don't know if every state has it,

380
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:17,180
but they have it in North
Carolina and you know,

381
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:22,010
it was a big, big murder case
there. So they send in the,

382
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:26,060
their officials and their experts to,
you know,

383
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,570
test everything and
uh, you know, uh, they,

384
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,210
they didn't do a DNA analysis.

385
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:36,980
They had a guy go on the stand and make
claims that they turned out that other

386
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:41,420
experts said you could never make.
And this dude just blatantly lied.

387
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:45,590
He just lied on the stand to
convict the guy who, you know,

388
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,500
the whole time you're watching
this thing and you're like,

389
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,740
there's no way this guy
has not done this crime,

390
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,340
but they end up placing if,

391
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,140
if he's getting a fair trial,

392
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,600
you could argue that there would be
reasonable doubt in some way and therefore

393
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:06,320
that's what you're, you're,
that's what you're going for
as a defense. You want to,

394
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,250
is there a reasonable doubt? Well,
they didn't give him a fair shot at it.

395
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,340
And what ends up happening is because
of the corrupt government people,

396
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:22,030
this guy actually a gets a new trial and
then has to decide whether to go for a

397
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:27,110
plea or take it to trial,
some terrible decision.

398
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,190
It's a horrible choice to have
to make. And actually, you know,

399
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,960
things became more favorable
to him, um, for the new trial,

400
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,360
like and looked like even more evidence
would be withheld because of some of

401
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:46,050
these circumstances and the time
had gone by and I'm like, baby,

402
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:48,430
this search warrant wasn't valid.
Maybe they shouldn't allow that.

403
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,650
So all these things would have actually
led to a more favorable case for him.

404
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,330
But then he's like, you know,
at this point he's like 71
and he's like, you know,

405
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:01,710
I've already been to prison for eight
years. It's been great. It takes on you.

406
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:04,980
And he has one kid who was like, go
to trial, fucking vindicate yourself.

407
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,090
The other kids like, are you out of your
fucking mind? Like this is too crazy.

408
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,170
Take the plea. You don't go back to
prison. Yeah, it's on your record.

409
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,060
But you know, you only have this much
time left and it's been horrible.

410
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:23,010
Let's just end it. So he ends up
taking a plea and he does take place.

411
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,750
So I woke up,

412
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,310
I wake up to eat snacks occasionally and
watch a minute of your show and he was

413
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:34,260
at home with his family, uh, drinking
champagne and celebrating and listen that.

414
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,460
And they're all just like, yeah, Daddy, we
know you're not guilty daddy. It's like,

415
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,540
how do you,

416
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,600
how do you believe your
parent who's clearly guilty?

417
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:48,450
I don't want to believe it. I mean,
look at, you can believe that he didn't,

418
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,080
I know there's people obviously that
believed that he didn't cause people would

419
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:53,680
think, oh, Jeren isn't, it's,
I know. It's so crazy. Yes.

420
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,960
So many similar behaviors to him,
especially in the early days.

421
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,860
See this, they actually,
what's incredible is the,

422
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,370
the actual just accomplishment
of filming this documentary,

423
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,630
they filmed it for 16 years.
That's amazing. Um, so it's,

424
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,110
it's an amazing thing to,
you know,

425
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,860
a product to even come up with like
what a project this is. But you know,

426
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,940
you see him in those early
days when she's, you know,

427
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,430
freshly dead and he's
smoking his pipe. Look. Yup.

428
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,120
But I loved her so much. I
miss her. And you're like,

429
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,360
there's just little things that
are quirks. What I learned also,

430
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:35,361
or what I came to think over time is
that it is a bit unfair in a way too,

431
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,240
man. He goes sympathizing with
the murderers. We'll know.

432
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,840
It's like you try to be objective.
You try to watch these things and go like,

433
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,790
it's a little unfair in a way to to judge
people's behavior under stress and be

434
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,670
like, that's the only indicator.
I mean I feel that way,

435
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,750
but I'm saying if you're somebody
you go, oh, he's acting like this.

436
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:57,900
You shouldn't act like that.
That's not a hundred percent accurate.

437
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,730
People process stress different. Yeah. No,

438
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,000
it's true. People have odd
reactions to death. They do. You,

439
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,830
you're in shock for a long time
when somebody dies and who knows.

440
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:15,831
But I will say that the words I've many
times I've watched her show when he's

441
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,880
talking and it's a lot of horse
shit he does. He does. Spin yarns.

442
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:24,840
He is full of Shit. And you know what he
never fucking says, right? I never did it.

443
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,770
I would never kill my life.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well,

444
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,770
every time I'm eating a sandwich and
watching watch like eight minutes of it,

445
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,180
13 hour documentary. But if, if, if
someone had accused me of killing you,

446
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,620
there's only one fucking thing to say. I
love my husband. He's my pride and joy.

447
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,260
I would fucking kill my husband.

448
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,040
It's still saying that you guys
were even saying, I'm gonna kill me.

449
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:49,840
I love my husband. What would you say?
You'd be like, I'm glad she's gone.

450
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,040
Time to get dead. Time to date.
Can we look at your Netflix queue

451
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,050
and I want to make it,
I just think that it's,

452
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,390
to me that nine one one call reads so
false. I think this is my interpreter.

453
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:05,090
That's a, that is a totally,
it's like bad acting.

454
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,020
You could tell when you try to
act with someone and you're like,

455
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,510
you're not good at pretending to do this.

456
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,570
And it reads,
it reads like her.

457
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,470
I didn't hear it when I was laying
trying to sleep the other night.

458
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:20,400
And you played that and then I won.
I had panic in my heart for him.

459
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,190
You didn't can't tell, but I don't
listen to enough. Nine one one.

460
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,750
Oh, I thought it was horrifically
bad acting. I'm not an expert.

461
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:28,910
The other thing or the crime
scene photos and you're like,

462
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,070
I'm really supposed to think that
this is a fall. Like from the stairs.

463
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:34,460
I Dunno.

464
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Is it possible they have experts testify
that it's possible that they see it as

465
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,180
how much blood is that? There's an
incredible amount of slough fall,

466
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,600
fall down the stairs.
I fall down the stairs.

467
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,240
I mean it's like lacerations to the head,

468
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,450
blood everywhere and she fell.

469
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:53,581
Oh,

470
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:57,750
can we please just pull up your Netflix
queue so the audience can see what I see

471
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:02,810
when I open Netflix and I have to click
on to my profile and thank God we have

472
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:08,370
separate profiles. I used to annoy me
about Netflix, but I'm like, look at this.

Very funny. Uh, seven. Okay.

476
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:25,390
You're just rewatching that for fun.
I'm assuming. I haven't seen that.

477

00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,120
They're American crime.

482
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,170
El Chapo outlaw bikers, queen of
the south. It was either drugs,

483
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,740
war or murder.
These are yours.

484
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,630
This is survivor's
guide to prison. I mean,

485
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,730
okay. The conspiracy, the
seven five, that's also

486

and a lot of murder there. Okay.

487
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:11,070
Now let's pull up Christina's profiles.
It's not gay.

488
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:16,071
It's just called what normal people
like this is a healthier spread.

489
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,470
The Ventress I would say,
cause you're strictly in one cat,

490
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,970
like three categories.
Murder, war and drug lord,

491
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:29,850
Shit and Mafia.
That's all you fucking

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,220
psycho shit. Yeah, it's
definitely, yeah, that's different.

493
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,530
Okay. Here we go. Here's yours.
Cooking shows. Let's see. Here we go.

494
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,400
Good place.

495
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,450
Interior design. Yeah, like that.
Set it up. Queer eye cooking.

496
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,160
Here's wasn't staircase telling you to
watch it. I was at telling me here's your,

497
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:53,180
continue watching, watching popular.
I know Rita. I love that show.

498
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:56,210
It's think of life. Love it. Great.

499
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:59,900
But it's baking show 40 year
old virgin friends. Yeah,

500
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,310
so light trending. This is trending
though. Within your algorithm.

501
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,110
That's how trending works based on
the shit you like. Just trending.

502
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,430
It's trending within your preferences.
That's so funny. I did not know.

503
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,420
So you have parts of known
the ranch lust stories. Okay.

504
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,330
New Girl. Ibiza parks and rec.
Okay, so let's see what it was.

505
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:30,020
All dark and then it's suggesting
British TV shows where you critically

506
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:34,850
acclaimed irreverent TV shows
the office we'd the stuff,

507
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:38,990
normal people, notional TVC mines is
crime TV shows. You're says emotional TV.

508
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,910
Sensate Riverdale, Grey's anatomy.
Mad Men. I like international.

509
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:46,100
I'm into the Korean soap operas.

510
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,010
Yours has a bunch of Korean stuff and
I watched a few Spanish things and it

511
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,630
gives me all Spanish
suggestions all the time.

512
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,250
You make the mistake of clicking on
one foreign thing and then it's like,

513
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:58,610
do you like all foreign shit? It's like
want to see a bunch of Mexican stand up?

514
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:01,070
And I'm like, no. That's the thing.

515
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:03,860
If you make the mistake of
clicking on like one dumb show,

516
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,450
the Netflix forever is like,

517
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:07,700
do you like this other dumb
shit I saw that you liked?

518
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,050
It gives you this category.

519
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:12,650
Quirky TV shows featuring a
strong female lead look at that.

520
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,920
But I don't like any, I wouldn't watch
any of these. I'm not interested in,

521
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:19,040
you know, it's just interesting that
they have it broken down to that door.

522
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,850
They do working with a strong female lead.
Oh they do.

523
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,530
And I watched the 40 year old virgin
again. That's, I like that great movie.

524
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,600
We're into this Billy Bob Thornton
show Goliath. That's great. Amazon,

525
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,580
is it Amazon prime? Who's this here?
John David Letterman's new show.

526
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:42,230

watched that. I, Jerry Seinfeld did it.

527
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:46,010
Obama.
Tina Fey docu series.

528
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,150
I'm just trying to let you know that
like I have kind of a wider array of

529
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:53,360
interests. No, your shit's gay. I
get it and know what you're saying.

530
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,590
That's what you're saying.
Shit's all gay fucked up and shit.

531
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,950
My Shit's gay. I'm saying that I have
other than three primary interest.

532
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,840
Here's more my speed. Okay.
Speed. Yeah. We know what your
speed is. Psycho speed. No,

533
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:13,400
it's not psycho speed.
A little more respect for me.

534
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,590

535

Yup. Good name. There you go.

537
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,870
Not a lot of d bags named
Julian in the world.

538
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,710
Okay.

539

Halloumi out hold me out version of

sketched by Chris. Gosh.

547
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,160

552
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,890
Thank you Christopher. Uh,
love the sketch. Love the
shirt. It's on. Presale now.

553
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,090
Flipped it to black because people just
like Blackmore. I like black shirts. Yeah,

554
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,360
but it's absolutely hilarious concept. I
came aware of white shirt. I feel like,

555
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,880
excuse me, I get the armpits yellowed, but
within like a week, all me, I know. Yeah,

556
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,430
I know. I don't. And then like
the kids spill some shit on me,

557
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:18,660
so things look better on white too.

558
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:22,320
But people just don't like white shirts
as much. Fucking nerds, ma'am. Okay.

559
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,940
White shirts are for fucking nerds
and Europeans. Eastern Europeans.

560
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,760
Um, Yup. And Oh, tomorrow
the don't forget it's,

561
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:37,380
I'm on hot ones. Um, that
should be fun. Sean Evans.

562
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,210
Fantastic. Thank you sir. Um, how
hot was it? Be Honest. I know.

563
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:45,450
Everyone wants to ask you that. How
hot we're the wings. They got hot,

564
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,950
they got hot. So how does it start?
It starts like super, like, oh yeah.

565
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:54,240
Like where you're like,
that's not spicy flavor. Yeah,
yeah. You go, that's nothing.

566
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,000
And then it goes a little bit more
and you're like, oh, maybe this is,

567
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,240
it's your fear of it that's going to be,
and then I think,

568
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,850
I think actually they get the
hottest one is like number eight.

569
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,020
They say it's 10 but it's really
like you get to 10 I did all of them.

570
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,340
Oh yeah. I cried at one
point. Did you drink milk?

571
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,730
Yeah, we got, we got chocolate,
soy milk or chocolate.

572
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,840
I don't like regular milk is disgusting
and terrible that drink milk are

573
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,180
disgusting. People discuss.
If you're not a baby,

574
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:26,040
there's no point drinking if you're
an adult and drinking whole milk. Yes,

575
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,640
you're a total fucking pedophile
without question. You're disgusting.

576
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,320
You're a bad person.
Absolutely.

577
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,950
Don't you have a friend that's
drinking cups of whole milk? Oh my God.

578
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,490
Ordering it in restaurants.

579
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,940
Does it come warm to having this?
And he's like, he's like, oh,

580
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,300
and do me a solid Darlin go ahead and
bring me a glass of milk. And she's like,

581
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,660
I'm sorry, what gross does your
parole officer know you're here? Yeah,

582
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,900
I'll give him a heads up when she's like,
okay.

583
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,190
And so she brings it nice and warm.
Temp to room temperature. Right.

584
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,740
So it's all fucking warm. Like it just
came out of the cows tits. I Dunno.

585
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,510
It just seems drank a glass of
milk. It's like, ah, it's just flat.

586
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,690
Did you do that in private?
Do it in private or don't do it at all.

587
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,190
It just looks like it's a glass of mucus.
It's just fucking disgusting.

588
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,970
It's gross. I mean there's no reason
for you to be drinking that as an adult.

589
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,450
You're a grown adult. You're not a baby.
You don't need milk anymore. I agree.

590
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,290
Can I use to hate it as a kid?
Even like give it to you as your lunch.

591
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,140
It was like part of the lunch
program or whatever and he'd be like,

592
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,800
it smells because it would come in like,
you know,

593
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,110
a plastic container with all the little
milk cartons and it would just smell

594
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:36,530
because it had been sitting around
and the, and the spare milky deal.

595
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,580
Rose fucking nasty.
Let's put on something nice.

596
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,903
Okay.

597
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,623
Hi.

598
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,123
Oh Shit.

599
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,680
Yeah.
Do that also reminds me of somewhere?

600
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,913
Yes.

601
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,703
Yeah.

602
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,523
Oh yeah.

603
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,390
They had the same dentist. I didn't
really have this same kind of, well,

604
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,960
she's got equipment. You see she's
got the Janet Jackson headphones.

605
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:40,790
Do you see that shit? Well, she, yeah,

606
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:44,170
I mean she's obviously a little more
advanced. How did she get that art?

607
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,610
She's like, I have it lubricated
my instrument. I don't know.

608
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:52,530
I wish the guy would have
had a huge coffee at the end.

609
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,070
You'll see like black tar come
up. Yeah. You don't have no cough.

610
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,490
He knows what he's doing. Practicing
that long shift for days. Ah,

611
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,810
man is the rectum I've done night.
Not How do you get that crazy?

612
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,840
Like what happens where you just
don't give a fuck anymore, Tom,

613
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,440
how do I get there? That's
what I'm saying. I don't know.

614
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,670
Alcohol and then you'd just booze.
Yeah.

615
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,230
You really got to go hard daily. You
never fuck around. You never skip days.

616
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,230
Always drinking. Never. Not
Drinking. Now we got this message.

617
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,860
I haven't even read it yet, but it
says, um, dear mommy is an epidemic,

618
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,960
has been brought to my attention. Started
a few months ago when I was showing up.

619
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:34,100
Buddy. Tom's special
disgraceful. This buddy

620
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,530
of mine had the subtitles
on early into the special.

621
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,540
I suggested to turn them off. He said, no.

622
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,550
He watches everything with subtitles
on which is true and that was that 10

623
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,390
minutes or so go by.

624
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:47,870
I began to notice that he was laughing
at punch lines before they were being

625
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:51,020
said no. I paused a special on
laid down the law. He didn't.

626
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,340
He didn't and still doesn't agree with
me that subtitles spoiled, joke's ruined.

627
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:59,200
The element of surprise and timing and
overall just distract from the actor

628
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,043
performance.

629
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,620
We don't watch specials together anymore
and it's my mission to find out what

630
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:07,910
kind of person people are and
quizzed them on this. Get this.

631
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:11,000
A lot of people watch specials with
subtitles on. It drives me nuts.

632
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,640
I like these clowns are
just being pretentious.

633
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,660
They are ruining the experience
for themselves and also
watering down your guys'

634
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:22,010
comedy. My best denial analogy is it would
be like reading the last sentence of a

635
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:25,280
chapter before the last page
of the chapter as Comedians,

636
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:28,330
I would like your input on this matter.
Am I overreacting or these people?

637
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,300
Monsters,
grass casino on your machines within.

638
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,780
Thanks for booking Boise. Tom.
Look forward to seeing you perform.

639
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,410
Notice you two haven't had any
play on words for Boise yet.

640
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,940
Thanks for all the laughs Trevor.

641
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,710
Good point. Trevor Boise,
why is he Poissy noisy,

642
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:46,890
noisy,
noisy.

643
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:55,020
I Dunno. Boys, boys,
boys, boys and holes. Ease

644
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,600
boys inside me. Yes. I'm like that
kind of work on this, right? Well sir,

645
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,200
I think here's, here's the problem titles.
If you don't have a hearing problem.

646
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,430
Well here's the problem with the subtitles
is that they're not always accurate.

647
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,040
They're not always accurate.
But he's also right that with,

648
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,950
with regard to especially jokes,
right?

649
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,470
Words will appear before their
set of course. And so that,

650
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,060
and also you're missing out on comedic
timing, facial expressions. Uh,

651
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,650
maybe cause we work on these
punchlines, right? For instance, uh,

652
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,650
you just do a gesture to go with a
word and now the laugh is even bigger.

653
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,870
So you are fucking with what we do.

654
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,950
Maybe the people that are doing this
that don't need to have the subtitles.

655
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,190
Maybe it's a little bit of anxiety.
Interesting.

656
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:43,130
They don't like the element of surprise.
They they want, like he said, you know,

657
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,020
I want to read the,

658
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,860
the end of the thing first because I know
some types of anxiety about it. Well,

659
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:50,750
because people have tons of
anxiety. Well yeah, the yellow,

660
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,160
the key to good comedies, the element
of surprise. So either you're right,

661
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,670
maybe it's a control freak thing and this
guy doesn't want to have a good time.

662
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:01,150
In which case I would say give your
friend a drink, have a fucking beer.

663
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,650
Like chill the fuck out.
I don't know why.

664
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:06,190
I want to know why he wants to come
on if he's not having trouble hearing.

665
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,910
That's true. I don't understand
it personally. He wants that.

666
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,010
But it takes the fun out of the sand up.

667
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,680
Maybe he feels like it's a little
more insight or something, you know,

668
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:17,710
he's like a little more ahead. He's a
little ahead of it. But I'm telling you,

669
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,730
because I've seen how they
subtitle things. It's not
always accurate. The words,

670
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:26,350
uh, and the wording is so crucial to a
joke. Why don't you say Tom? Yeah. We,

671
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,550
we think about words. And how many words
and word placement. It's very crucial.

672
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:35,400
So I don't, I don't see why anybody
would want to spoil the fun.

673
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,040
I agree. I, you know, I'm watching
that show Rita, and it's in Denmark.

674
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,290
Well, language they speak. Is it Danish?
I think so. It's not American. So anyway,

675
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,300
uh, and I know they're fucking
subtitling it incorrectly. It bothers me.

676
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,510
I wish I knew about subtitling from
another language they fucking fuck up.

677
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,740
But even in this, in our own
language, they fuck it up. I'm sure

678
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,250
one thing that's so true,
it's like so inappropriate now,

679
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,350
but in the Narcos,

680
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,350
which is filmed or it takes place at
the previous seasons where Columbia,

681
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,250
I think they're going to
Mexico for the new season.

682
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,190
Those guys are constantly,
constantly saying, Maricka always.

683
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,080
Yeah. Mighty guys like a short,
shortened version of it. Um,

684
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,940
so it might've Gone Liz,
the full word,

685
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:28,941
mighty guys like fag and they say it all
the time and it's in this uptight all

686
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,600
the time. This show, it feels
like if it was an English,

687
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,470
that's just not acceptable to say.
Now Tom has honor percent.

688
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,760
It's 100% how everybody that I've ever
grown up with in South America speaks.

689
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,570
They're constantly calling you.
I mean,

690
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:50,190
more so than I ever experienced
growing up in English. They're much,

691
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,990
much,
much worse at that.

692
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,580
Well, this whole Social Justice
Warrior Horse Shit, you know,

693
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,180
it's a very wonderful American thing
that we're doing culturally now.

694
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:03,710
Policing everybody for every little
fucking thing they say that's remotely

695
00:46:03,711 --> 00:46:06,950
offensive to them.
Listen, same in Hungarian.

696
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:11,390
Do you think they've stopped saying faggot
or whatever because a five people are

697
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:14,990
upset by it or whatever. I mean,
come on, you're going to stop.

698
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,140
You know what I mean?
It's just, it's silly.

699
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:21,880
You're not going to police the world
into making the perfect world exist to

700
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,540
everyone gets their needs
and their feelings or was
going to be nice knowledge.

701
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,850
Yeah, guys, this is a safe space.
That's my favorite. It's a safe space.

702
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,340
There's no fucking such
thing as a safe space. Okay?

703
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:35,180
You're always under threat of
being your feelings misunderstood.

704
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:38,960
Are you not communicating clearly?
This fucking generation is,

705
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:43,961
fuck you guys are all fucked and you're
creating this puritanical dog shit place

706
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,270
is. You never going to
sterilize the world guys.

707
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,300
It's never going to fucking
work out for you so well.

708
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:55,220
The world is a fucked up
place. I know that. Everyone's
nice. No one did. I don't.

709
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,580
You want to prepare your kids for that
inevitability that there are fucking

710
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:03,460
dickheads out there. Either fucks
racist people. Avoid that guy.

711
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,050
Don't talk to someone like that.
You walk away from them.

712
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:10,430
The best thing the preschool teacher
ever said to us was that he, she says,

713
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:15,140
your son is a great kid. Nice kid,
doesn't play with everybody. And I said,

714
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,910
that's right. That's how I fucking
raised him. He's an elitist when you did,

715
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,970
but I did say to play, but he plays with
some people he doesn't play with good.

716
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,650
Why should he play with everybody?
Kids he doesn't play with or just Tan.

717
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:30,310
They're not what you think.
Have a little bit of fun,

718
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,800
more Melanin in their skin.
No, she did not say that.

719
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,710
He's just blondes lump ones in their
eyes. Make sure the light, I don't know.

720
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,700
It's just, do you teach them
that? That's not what we do,

721
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,350
but,
but I am proud of him.

722
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,160
He's discerning because why shouldn't
she be discerning with your friends?

723
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,620
It is great.
You wanna hear another prank call.

724
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,030
I loved hearing other prey called another
one from, I think from Fort Simpson.

725
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,710
So he calls a tattoo shop.

726
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,980
This guy's got talent with the uh,
God. It's so funny what he does.

727
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,770
The,
the Sissy.

728
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,790
A Fremont Street. Remember that? How can
I forget? He's like, Hey, I'm a sissy.

729
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:22,170
Gemini. How can I
forget? Oh, he's a sissy.

730
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:25,290
Gemini.
He's such a fucking freak.

731
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,500
I'm a Gemini too.
Did you know that I'm a sissy?

732
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,520
Geminis this guy, just in case
you're a, Oh, we can't forget

733
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,950
cause I like white. We'll
see like our son. Right.

734
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,753
You know?

735
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,683
Thank you.

736
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,980
Yeah. Okay, so that's that
fucking guy. All right. No,

737
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,740
the great.
Tony made a,

738
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,900
a prank call using him to get a
tattoo. He wants to get a tattoo. Okay,

739
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,170
so he sets it up.

740
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,600
My Dad was looking to get a tattoo.

741
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,070
Can't really figure out what exactly
he needed. If it's all right,

742
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:19,420
if you have a sec, do you mind if I put
them on real quick and you can rx. Okay.

743
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:44,290
Like a sailor. Jerry was kind of
style traditional. That's awesome.

744
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,530
Come on down here and check it out.
And so like that. Make an appointment,

745
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,090
bitch.

746
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,640
All right. That

747
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,203
too.

748
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,500
On what?
Gemini?

749
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,243
Yeah.

750
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:28,000
Special white slept.
Um,

751
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,973
which is,

752
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,800
I love of the Tattoo Guy. Laps and laps.
I also think it was great that, um,

753
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,150
that's so funny. Tony did a, he
goes, he's like, come on, dad.

754
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,220
Plays against, so like the Tattoo
guy. What's going on? It's brilliant.

755
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:53,420
It's this guy got a real talent.
Yeah. This guy is a real talent.

756
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,850
The fact that he's trying to temper dad
is just fantastic. Another great call.

757
00:50:58,851 --> 00:50:59,690
Thank you so much.

758
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,230
Let's stop here for a
moment and we'll regroup.

759
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:06,750
We'll be back with guests very soon.
Okay.

760
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:11,340
We're back here with Comedians,
writers,

761
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,130
actors, producers, Jews,

762
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:18,210
wrappers, wrappers, shoes. Yes. Yes.

763
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,280
It's both Jews. No, come on. No. Are
you kidding me? Here's the thing.

764
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,220
You fucking converted. Oh wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa. I don't love the vibe of that.

765
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:31,790
I was, I was saying like, you haven't
converted. That would be nice. Oh yeah.

766
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,530
There's a, how do I say it? It was more
like a, Oh, I didn't mean that like that.

767
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,740
Let me rephrase it.
Did

768
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,053
you convert it?

769
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,150
People needed those facial expressions? I
think so. I think they do a lot. Ah, yeah.

770
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:50,570
Why not? I was Catholic. That
was humiliating. What are
you were Catholics? Oh yeah.

771
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,040
Yeah. You guys, do you guys come on over?

772
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,090
Hard to mass on Sunday every week?
No.

773
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,110
But see in Judaism you can still
have a Shabbat, which is today,

774
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,170
and we'll light some candles and sing a
song. And you're still part of, you know,

775
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,340
deep tradition. What's that? Oh, first
of all, was it it? Was it a demand? Oh,

776
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:11,920
it wasn't a demand. It was a, it was
an ultimatum. Was it really? It was a,

777
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:12,490
how do you bring it?

778
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:16,490
Was it like an expected ultimatum or was
it wasn't an ultimatum. I would never.

779
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:20,380
Right, but you were like, I
would prefer this. Well, you
know, the problem would be,

780
00:52:20,381 --> 00:52:24,280
hmm, no, I mean obviously there's
a subtext of every Jew that's like,

781
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,940
I would prefer this.
Yeah.

782
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,930
It's like the obnoxiousness and chauvinism
to say like, and now you can join.

783
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:36,310
My culture is, I would never
have explicitly said that
she, Natasha volunteered.

784
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,130
Really? Wow. And you knew, but you know
it would be meaningful to him though.

785
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,830
I mean is that I went, well, yeah.

786
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:46,030
But also I went to Catholic school and
I was not connected with Catholicism at

787
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:48,100
all and she has,
she had an entertainment lawyer,

788
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:49,570
so she was familiar with the culture.

789
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,210
He been in Showbiz for another year and
I really did like fall in love with the

790
00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:57,200
traditions.
I could see how that gets done.

791
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,060
Think it's all about like there's a
holiday where you just eat outside for a

792
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,060
week under a tent under palm fronds
and told me that this is a blue band.

793
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,930
Yeah, he's our producer. He told
me about it wrestling. Right.

794
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,200
There's the red band expanded universe.
I know about this. When we left,

795
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,400
when we left red ban,
we hired Bluebay. Well,

796
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,430
we also have a producer for our podcast,
but it's a Jewish podcast,

797
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,330
so it's gold band.
That's great.

798
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:29,190
Great name for our are real name is
and the Dov. Oh, he's okay. He's cold.

799
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:33,840
Ben Himself. He's from the old country.
Yeah. So, um, yeah, no, we're big fans.

800
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,410
I just think the Jews are great.
So great.

801
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,030
I feel very welcome now. Yeah,
kind of did that yourself.

802
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,160
You don't even have a producer
here. Yeah, that's right.

803
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,820
I just pushed the button all by myself.

804
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,710
That would be bad if that was
one of your saved like drops.

805
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:54,703
I approved.

806
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,900
The sound effects are actually totally
negating the double lightening bolt flag

807
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:05,240
that you have in front of your house.
But now I'm kind of going, okay, I'm,

808
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,090
I'm more comfortable.

809
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:11,120
There's a bunch of save
stuff for every Jew.

810
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,300
Well, that one says I
approve Jews. Jews are great.

811
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,030
Jews are funny.
Whose voice?

812
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,830
That's it from an interview
that Yoshi, you know, Yoshi,

813
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,210
Yoshi did an interview once where he
talked about a lot of crazy things.

814
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,500
Those were some of the things.
That's Yoshi.

815
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,680
He also says this in the same interview.

816
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,890
Fuck the girl with no arms and one leg

817
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,200
necessarily.
Have you say something good like,

818
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,140
yeah, so I mean I, you know,

819
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,000
if I have somebody coming to the show
and I go like this might be funny to drop

820
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:03,420
with them, I'll prep it, I'll get
it ready. So Natasha converted.

821
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:08,490
It's so fascinating. I really
do. I mean I was raised pretty,

822
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:12,150
I wouldn't say like intensely,
but like pretty Catholic grade school

823
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,030
and a
Catholic,

824
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:27,240
all girls Catholic school for high school,
I was the first challenge.

825
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,780
The Jews were more rational because
I grew up in the San Fernando Valley.

826
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,170
It just made a little more sense,
a little more intuitive.

827
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,500
I mean the two main tenants are

828
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,500
24 hour period ideally where you turn off
your phone to Saturday sundown and you

829
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:53,360
like candles and have a dinner party
and then the next day, Saturday,

830
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,060
what does it mean

831
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,610
is converting you right,

832
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,340
don't fucking call me no cell phones,

833
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,050
but you know about that.
It used to be Saturday.

834
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,170
They literally, I'm not
kidding. They literally, they
shifted the day by one day.

835
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,040
I mean, the whole thing
about Christianity was that

836
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,770
it was self conscious about its
connection to Judaism for a long time.

837
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,400
So they did a lot of weird
like adjustments to say
we still have a sabbath,

838
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,530
but it's no longer on Saturday even
though it's pretty obvious that it's,

839
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,020
that it's all good test to mentors. I
mean I'm not even a, well there are three,

840
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,020
Natasha didn't say it right. So there
are three main tenants of Judaism.

841
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,640
Procreate,
keep Shabbat.

842
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,310
And then you remember the beginning
of ducktails where scrooge McDuck is

843
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,030
swimming in the pool.
Right?

844
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,940
Cool. Why don't you, yeah,
that's the third major.

845
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,900
Third Nights of tenant points.
I love swim and background,

846
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,910
but we invented that. You invented,
that was a gift that we gave to you.

847
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,480
And the reason why I know the tenants
is because I had to take 19 four hour

848
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:03,280
classes in order to,
you're good at it.

849
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:08,140
The other thing I love before a trio of
rabbis told me that if I went to Paris

850
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:12,550
with my baby, they, you know, if it
was Jewish it might get like, you know,

851
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:16,420
hurt. And was I okay with that? Oh
Wow. And did you, when you menstruate,

852
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:19,070
do you have to go sit in, in
the every time? Yeah. Yeah.

853
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,640
I don't touch her for the full week.
Do you know about that though?

854
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,780
That's not a joke. No,
that's Orthodox Jew.

855
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,240
Jews don't touch you. Not only for
the week that you're menstruating,

856
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:29,860
which obviously every normal person
doesn't touch their white while they're

857
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:30,880
meant straight up.
Of course,

858
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:35,970
the week after also it's two full weeks
until ambulation and then we fuck when

859
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,220
you're fertile. Right. I
mean the, the argument,

860
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,970
it's pretty barbaric and cave manage,
but the argument is kind of like, well,

861
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:43,080
if you don't touch wife for two weeks,

862
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:45,840
then you're like so horny
for your wife all the time.

863
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,440
There's something about that,
which I haven't felt horny
for my wife and I would,

864
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,100
I would say seven years and we've been
together for six. No, you're right.

865
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,690
I love to hit that cooked. You also
totally love the fact that, I mean,

866
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,120
other cultures do this,
but like in Jewish culture,

867
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:05,030
it really like Jewish people will
support each other, you know, like, yeah,

868
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,980
that's definitely true. Knowing like in
businesses I'm serious. Like, you know,

869
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:09,630
I don't like where you're going with this.
I'm serious.

870
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:12,990
But they w people will support each other.
It lifts up a community.

871
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,870
Like you don't see that in every culture.
Well,

872
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:20,871
I think that any culture that has been a
subjugated to weird forms of oppression

873
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:25,500
become black, tight, tighter, and more
and more connected and more supportive.

874
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:28,030
I was thinking about this, about
gay people recently, like, uh,

875
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,600
how it's like homophobia so awful.

876
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:34,380
But it also creates this like
interesting culture of like, you know,

877
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:37,560
this fiber community. And if homophobia
literally went away then, I mean,

878
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:39,470
imagine what gate the gay
community wouldn't exist.

879
00:58:39,471 --> 00:58:41,660
It wouldn't be a gay
community parades or nothing.

880
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,320
That would just be like people in the
suburbs fucking each other, right?

881
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,210
Yes, it would be good. I'm not saying
it'd be bad, but there'd be something,

882
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,370
there's something vital that's created
from oppression, which is why I'm

883
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,510
Oh, ardent homophobe not
cause I don't like gay people.

884
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:57,010
I like to push the culture forward.

885
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,660
Mother fucker.
You appreciate that.

886
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,960
That makes me feel like a member
of a community. There you go.

887
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:08,140
Is that also what that guy
said? That's Joe Pesci touch it.

888
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,490
Did you get any kind of emblem or necklace
or what do you get when she got her

889
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,990
clitoral? When they removed it and put
it on kind of the value. You get a name?

890
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,200
Yeah. Oh yeah. You're allowed to
say it or you got a special like it.

891
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,970
It's not like a transcendental mantra
or you're not allowed to tell him.

892
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,710
Can you share your TM mantra?
It's Natasha, Coco Diaz.

893
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,210
Tell him your name. What's your
Jewish name? Oh, that's good. Dot.

894
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:40,320
Oof. The guttural are, isn't really
flowing off the back of your throat, but,

895
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:44,750
but which means tree and I don't remember
what that light of light because of

896
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:48,410
Ligero. No, but yeah, that's why you went
with Ora. Yeah. Okay. I gotta tell you,

897
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:52,340
I know I'm really into the fact
that you're not like, yeah,

898
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:56,540
I did this thing to fucking, I don't
know, pray with him and sacrifice kids,

899
00:59:56,541 --> 01:00:01,160
whatever. Jews, dude, you're like,
I'm really on board with it. Yeah.

900
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:06,080
Well, I mean I can't say that I'm
fully, oh, actually we got to run. Okay,

901
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:10,010
thanks. But most of his brothers
a rabbi, so, and he's moving here,

902
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:14,390
so he'll also help us, you know, continue
to celebrate the big holidays. You know,

903
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,530
it's nice.
They're all at night,

904
01:00:15,531 --> 01:00:19,130
the holidays and you're already
drinking and eating. You know,

905
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,820
you're on a good team.

906
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,670
You know the, you know the old,
there's an old Jewish joke,

907
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:26,690
which is that every holiday has the
same theme is a, they tried to kill us.

908
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:31,460
We won. Let's eat well because
that's a classic to Joe.

909
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,010
Nice. I like a celebration.
Then like Easter Sunday,

910
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,380
it's a bomber I fucking hallway.
Bummer.

911
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,820
But Easter is also based on a
Jewish holiday. What are the,

912
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:45,470
is it the crucifixion of JC? And then
he rises from the dead to the station.

913
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,880
Fucking cross. Chuck bomb
was a Bummer, but Easter is
Passover, right? So the last,

914
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:53,710
the last supper was passed. So it
was a Passover Seder. Straight up.

915
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,940
Yeah. Where are you like
have to get blasted drunk?

916
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,110
Yeah. Well, no, you, oh, that's
four cups of wine. That's true.

917
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:02,720
But there is actually one holiday in
Judaism where you're literally supposed to

918
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:06,580
get drunk. Oh, right. That's
a different one. It's called
Purim. Oh, Pam. About that.

919
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:11,630
It's like, it's Ju Ju Halloween and you
are literally commanded to get so drunk.

920
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,570
There's a character in the, in the story
called Haman who was like the bad guy.

921
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,440
He tried to kill us. We won.
Let's eat. And uh, but this
is, they tried to kill us.

922
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,520
We want low. Let's get
back. Let's get fucked up.

923
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,980
You guys are really
putting on an appealing,

924
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,010
do you tell your choice? They're
Catholic. Not yet. I mean,

925
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:32,190
he's only two and a half, but we're also
not, yeah, we're not really, I mean,

926
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,950
maybe you could argue where culturally
Catholic, but it's also at a man.

927
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,580
I mean it's like there's lights.
Did you, how'd you baptize them?

928
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,950
Remember we did at the
urging though at the,

929
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:48,120
almost almost ultimatum of, of
my parents. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh No.

930
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,910
I didn't want our child to
go to hell either, but I
wasn't going to, I mean like,

931
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,540
I don't remember you saying it. I
remember getting multiple calls. Okay.

932
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:59,190
Do you want to hear what was it
in July? And I was like, ah, yeah,

933
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,310
setting it up right now. All right. Are
you having a girl? No. As a boy. Oh,

934
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:03,870
nevermind that. Wait, what was it? Well,

935
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:06,750
it was just one of the other great
things is instead of a baptism,

936
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:09,180
the girls comes out of your coach,
a naming ceremony,

937
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,640
give birth out of their vaginas. But
no, isn't it? Um, if your mother,

938
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,530
you don't have to get their
debt cut. Oh yeah. That too.

939
01:02:16,531 --> 01:02:18,270
Automatically you're in the club,

940
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:21,510
you were in the club or you get jumped
in or fucked in. That's the other,

941
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:26,040
it's like, it's like [inaudible] basically
you'd have to do 19 four hour classes.

942
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,780
Uh, welcome everybody to the
orientation for ms 13. Um, but,

943
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,570
but that would be a good clip.
That would be great.

944
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,900
I would love for you to use it.
Yeah.

945
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:39,660
Unless people think it's racist
and it goes viral on that level,

946
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:42,750
then I would like you to not use it.
So there you go.

947
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,970
What's called Coulis. That's my
favorite line in that. Um, okay.

948
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:52,060
Judaism where we got it. Yeah,
we got it in 1994 our costs.

949
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,050
I'll tell you what's funny about
the conversion classes. It was like,

950
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,130
it was a couple of couples like
Natasha in me. First of all, it's all,

951
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,100
it's all I didn't have to,
but I did because it was nice.

952
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:04,893
It's a nice husband

953
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:11,970
and there are no, no men. By the way.
There were some like people like me,

954
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,870
but there were no men converting because
the men have to get circumcised to like

955
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:19,910
God be adults. They have to get
their, did they do for real though?

956
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:25,350
Yeah, they got a little ritual Dick.
For Real. That's why historically

957
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:31,830
Mr Teen Orientation, I'll take
out our dicks for the ritual.

958
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,300
Yeah,
they cut it right here.

959
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:40,830
The head I, I don't know. I think it's a
great question. I actually think it's, Oh,

960
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:44,370
definitely. It would be on the
head of the Dick. This is like

961
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:51,030
a blood spiritual, you know, making
your day is like gang shit man.

962
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:52,480
Yeah. For Real. Yeah. But that's,

963
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:56,250
that's why historically men have been
much less likely to convert to Judaism

964
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:59,760
than women because even if you're 40,
you still have to get the circumcision.

965
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,650
You got to do it well. You raised a
orthodox or, yeah, I was raised, well,

966
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,980
I was raised in Oakland with my mom
who's like an atheist Hippie, but my dad,

967
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:13,140
when my mom and dad split became,
uh, he got a, became very religious.

968
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,230
He joined up with a group of Hasidic
Jews known as the sophomore who are

969
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:19,830
literally the most religious of all the
Hasidic Jewish groups are like the most

970
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:23,130
extreme of all the acidic juice.
It was pretty, pretty crazy.

971
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,720
They don't like my dad and mom,

972
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,620
my stepmom and my dad didn't sleep in
the same bed together because of the,

973
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,580
because of the monthly, it's
really intense. Yeah. Yeah.

974
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,930
You wouldn't want to accidentally
wake up with like, you know,

975
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,080
menstrual blood on your,
on your pajamas,

976
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,790
like the Godfather when the horse head
is in there. You know what I mean?

977
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,760
They didn't share a bedroom. They
shared a bed room, but not a bet.

978
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:49,410
They had two single beds.
Exactly. Like Lucy and Ricky.

979
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:53,400
I think that would, my dad would
say, you know, Lucy, I'm home.

980
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,950
And he would walk over to the other bed.
He would smash,

981
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,590
he would probably pump for a while
until it got like really close.

982
01:04:58,591 --> 01:05:01,260
And then he probably, he slowed
down a bit. He caressed her bed,

983
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:03,600
then he started pounding again and
then it'd be like, Daddy's coming.

984
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,920
And that's what I remember.
Yeah.

985
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:14,400
Fuck through a hole in the sheet or no,
that's a truce. The Handmaid's tale.

986
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,130
That's a true rumor.
Uh,

987
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:21,230
a false rumor that that is so pervasive
in Judaism that Jews believe it about

988
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,180
themselves because the,
the, the, the air, uh,

989
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,910
refined air of Jew Jewish
observance that my dad was at.

990
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:32,320
90% of American Jews that you've met
have no exposure to that in real life.

991
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:35,260
But I do, I mean, I have,
I have cousins who spoke,

992
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:39,220
speak Yiddish as a first language and
speak English with an Eastern European

993
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:43,000
accent raised here, raised in America,
third generation Americans. But they have,

994
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:45,700
they like if you met them, they'd
be like, Hello Tom, how are you?

995
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:50,070
Love or whatever it needs to do.
They sound like Cardi B talks.

996
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,193
Yeah,

997
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,051
dude,

998
01:05:56,051 --> 01:06:00,790
I have family honestly that I wouldn't
be sure that they knew who are raised in

999
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:03,730
New York. I'm not sure. They
wouldn't know who the Yankees were.

1000
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:07,660
Not Positive that I'm not, I'm
not, I'm not joking for sure.

1001
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,250
They wouldn't know who Cardi
B is. There's no, there's no,

1002
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:13,150
there's absolutely no question. They
would know who Cardi B is. Awesome.

1003
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,750
I know some Dominicans that,
uh, okay, I'm listening.

1004
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,470
Were born and raised in Washington who
don't know who the, the square Rebbie is.

1005
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:26,110
Definitely know the Yankees are, but they,
uh, have, uh, accents and you're like,

1006
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:30,820
you're born here. Well, yeah,
yeah, definitely. And heavy
accent. You're like, oh,

1007
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:34,360
you came when you were 12? And like, no,
no, I was born here, but this is it. Yeah,

1008
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,150
totally. You know, they have
a heavy, and they sound yet

1009
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:44,030
they have like a Danish. I had, I
had a cousin one time when I was,

1010
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,400
we were in the hospital when my dad was
sick and uh, and my dad died eventually.

1011
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,910
Anyway, I just wanted to tell
that story. But no, he goes, he,

1012
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:56,690
there's a wheel at the
story of him fucking right.

1013
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,780
Well he fucked my step mom and a death.
And that was,

1014
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,620
I mean he told his dad he would put the
jacket. Well, he actually ejaculate.

1015
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:05,080
It's so hard. He turned inside
out and that's how he died. Yeah.

1016
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,270
He just kept coming and coming
until he wasn't there anymore.

1017
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,260
But I still have that jar of common.
So every, when I need advice,

1018
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,770
I got it in the talk to it, like
raises into a figurine, you know,

1019
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,370
turning brown. He pops up out of the,
out of the thing and just like, what,

1020
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:25,840
how can I help you? Nobody.
But my cousins come jar.

1021
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,390
My cousin goes, I, uh,

1022
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,340
cause he knew I wasn't religious and he
didn't have much exposure to people that

1023
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:31,240
weren't religious.
You know,

1024
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,530
and there's this thing that
happens when someone's sick.

1025
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,500
Do you have to kind of guard
their deathbed kind of,

1026
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:38,050
sort of has to be like a religious
person there to make sure that all the

1027
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:39,340
rituals are done correctly,
whatever.

1028
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:44,190
So it was very odd because it'll be like
me who's next to his dad and then like

1029
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,950
a kind of tertiary family member who's
not really that close to the family,

1030
01:07:47,951 --> 01:07:49,750
but it's just there to
like be a ritual guy.

1031
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,130
So he turns to me like in the
middle of the night and he goes, hi,

1032
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,990
I have a secret I have to tell you.
And I was like, what? He's like,

1033
01:07:55,991 --> 01:07:58,440
cause you're not religious. I feel
like I can tell you. And I go, okay.

1034
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,540
And he's like, I've always wanted
to. And I go out to be gay, be gay.

1035
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,090
You willing be gay, you're gay, it's
okay for gay. I'm thinking to myself.

1036
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,570
And he goes, he looked,
he goes to be a lawyer.

1037
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:12,120
Oh that was really big, deep,
dark secret is dig deep.

1038
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,710
That's how religious they are to be a
lawyer. It would be like so secular.

1039
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:18,720
They only,
they only to be rabies is that it there?

1040
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,220
What are they supposed to do there
to work in some, uh, you know,

1041
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,970
business that the family owns
and to study their whole lives.

1042
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:29,780
It's like to be a lawyer as to like have
aspirations to connect to the outside

1043
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:32,630
world. And there's just that.
There's nothing there. Okay.

1044
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:35,180
Fucking through a sheet though.
Fucking through. So you know,

1045
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:39,020
the Jews have the prayer, uh, like
the, the, the thing that they wear.

1046
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:42,020
Have you ever seen it? They Dang, they
have the dangling like little fringes.

1047
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,650
So that's a garment Poncho.
Yeah, it's exactly like a Poncho.

1048
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,920
That's a garment that's a square with a
hole in the middle that they put on in

1049
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:50,300
the morning.
Every Jew,

1050
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,090
every or the docs who wears though
sometimes if they're less religious,

1051
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:54,770
they tuck them in. So you don't
know that they're wearing them.

1052
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,050
And if they're more religious,
they put them out so that the world knows.

1053
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:02,200
So historically those garments would
be hanging on a laundry line in the old

1054
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:04,430
village or whatever,
in the Shtetl.

1055
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,690
And Non Jews would walk by
unaware of what the thing was.

1056
01:09:07,691 --> 01:09:10,310
They would look and I go, why is there
a big sheet with a hole in the middle?

1057
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,420
Somebody said, oh, they must,
you know, the most logical, yeah,

1058
01:09:13,421 --> 01:09:15,580
those logical things that they
must have walked through that hole

1059
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,920
and then everybody starts to believe it.
So much so that like,

1060
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,780
I would say honestly most Jews, you know
that think that think that about them.

1061
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:24,783
Their own

1062
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:28,000
doesn't party. You though, when
you hear like in any religion,

1063
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:31,450
like let's talk about, you
know, Christianity or Islam,

1064
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:35,230
when you think about someone's level of
devotion being that high, you're like,

1065
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,220
man, that is just too much. Oh,

1066
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:43,610
give your life to this. I
mean, I just go like, but I,

1067
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,600
I mean I respect someone's
dedication to it. I'm like,

1068
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:47,910
you're making your whole life about right.

1069
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,040
I really under beliefs, I really
understand it though. Yeah.

1070
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:55,010
I really get it because my, I think
what it's about is that like the world,

1071
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,590
if you're not religious,
if you're paying attention to the world,

1072
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,060
it's so obvious that the world is,
that life is chaos. It's terror.

1073
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,900
It's fear, it's people killing each
other. It's like meaninglessness.

1074
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,140
It's careening towards death.
It's like it's empty and alone.

1075
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:13,610
And religion is this thing that goes, no,
no, no, no, no. It's totally meaningful.

1076
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,880
It's completely,
it's completely enclosed.

1077
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:20,510
There are answers to all of the questions
you think are unanswerable and you

1078
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:21,321
don't have to worry.

1079
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:26,321
Just join this totality of a religious
system and like there isn't any becomes

1080
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,870
comfort. It's total comfort
completely. Of course.

1081
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,630
I, cause I know it's my mom's
pretty pretty religious, you know,

1082
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:35,080
not like dedicated in the type
of way that your father was,

1083
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:37,990
that your child would have a
bad life if it wasn't baptized.

1084
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:42,300
Love it guys.
Yeah,

1085
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:47,080
I thought Catholics had a waiting
room for that type of situation.

1086
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,420
But like we're saying like, you know,
like my mom prays the Rosary if the,

1087
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:56,950
if a car rides longer than 10
minutes. Oh, you a religious,

1088
01:10:56,951 --> 01:11:00,220
she carries a Bible with her. She doesn't
carry a Bible with her. But I mean,

1089
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:04,360
you know, she wears a necklace with a
bit of a Virgin Mary or something on it.

1090
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,760
So your mom's house is a church.

1091
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:08,530
It's the house of the Lord
is the House of the Lord.

1092
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,250
One thing about her is that like
when she does get stressed out,

1093
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:14,100
she's a very overwhelmed,
it's very

1094
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,933
anxious.

1095
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:19,970
But the only thing that kind of like
brings that anxiety down a lot of time is

1096
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:24,030
prayer or the thought that like
it'll be taken care of. Oh, it works.

1097
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:29,040
It's not up for debate whether or not
prayer and being religious meditation or

1098
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:30,643
whatever the fuck.

1099
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,730
So these two Jews have a uh,
hey, hassle out. It's fantastic.

1100
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,960
It's the honeymoon standup special.
You have to look great.

1101
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,250
I did a gorgeous, I was eight months
pregnant here though. That's fine.

1102
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:48,060
Well yeah. Great. Yeah,
but you're not that great.

1103
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:53,070
I just did it thing eight months
and I look a lot bigger. No, no, no.

1104
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,290
Um,
I love how you guys,

1105
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:59,140
you both your sets and then you had the
Q and a thing that's kind of fun and

1106
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:00,143
couples grows.

1107
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,700
Did talks, does a half hour of
stand up than I do have are set up.

1108
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:07,170
Daniel Tosh it. Yeah, I dunno.

1109
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,950
It was weird because he, you know, he's
got his own thing. I guess to be honest,

1110
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:13,730
I wasn't familiar with
his work right then.

1111
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:18,370
We just knew it'd be a funny play on
words. And we, I'm a Texas by the way.

1112
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:22,720
You did it in Austin. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,
and yeah, so Natasha did a half hour,

1113
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:24,100
I do a half hour and then we do the,

1114
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,490
this is what we're doing on
the road to the last hour,

1115
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:30,070
half hour is us bringing couples up
and kind of like troubleshooting their

1116
01:12:30,071 --> 01:12:34,340
relationship and just basically roasting
them. Yeah. It's really fun. Thank you.

1117
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:39,120
So you toured with that, with this show
though for a while, right? Yeah, we uh,

1118
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,600
we went on a tour and a, it was really
fun, as you guys know, do to her together.

1119
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:46,080
No, no, he won't. He won't even
get a couple's massage with me.

1120
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:50,110
That's true.
Why will you get a couple of,

1121
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:54,010
but have you seen his Netflix queue
by the way? That'll explain it. Well,

1122
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,150
it's the Netflix Queue.

1123
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,040
It was just mostly things about murder
and drugs and shooting and you won't get

1124
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,800
a massage to a couple's massage.
Couple's massage. What? What?

1125
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,640
Why does it remind you of his murderous
now? Because he's a psychopath.

1126
01:13:05,641 --> 01:13:08,640
This is just part of the ones
that have to do with Netflix.

1127
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:10,340
Queue is like that but
he likes couples miss.

1128
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,240
Not a psychopath want a couple's massage.

1129
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,930
He'll pretend like he does but this one
is so in tune with that side of himself

1130
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:18,570
that he is going to close up the wound.
What's the issue though? I'm the,

1131
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:21,330
I don't like, I don't like that. Okay.

1132
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:25,530
When you go into like a treatment room
and you're there, it's like it's all you,

1133
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,680
you, you, you pull apart,
you want to fart and stuff.

1134
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,580
I mean I do want to force
someone to breathe loud.

1135
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,670
I want to grown and I don't like any
other distractions. I don't like,

1136
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,533
you don't want to hear like,

1137
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:40,250
so Christina was [inaudible] that shit
irritates me and I don't want to hurt her.

1138
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,390
I hear you want to be able
to like with impunity,

1139
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:46,920
slowly move your legs apart and push
her to wars and just to do an a silent

1140
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:49,860
negotiation to you do it. You
have to put your, I don't know,

1141
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,560
what are you talking about?
I figured your legs

1142
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:59,060
cause he knows that even
talking about massage,

1143
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,520
how do you ask that?
It must be or you want to talk about that?

1144
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,340
I mean it is it your legs up
and scoot your butt down. Okay.

1145
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,270
I've heard from other people. Yeah, I
did not know you did that. I didn't,

1146
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:13,440
I but I've heard from other people. Sure.
That part of it is like they're doing,

1147
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,610
they're giving you the massage
and then there's like a very,

1148
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:19,390
there's this period of silent negotiation
where the person will be like rubbing

1149
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:22,390
and then they're like sorta errantly
like sort of flinger your balls,

1150
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:24,470
you know like sorta
flick finger like this.

1151
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:29,870
Just a light grace and if you close
your legs then the person massage,

1152
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:34,200
oh this dude likes bodywork. Okay, he's
here. He's a legitimate human beings.

1153
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,033
A little swipe.

1154
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,290
Then you slightly just a little
bit open and then open a little,

1155
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:44,200
just a little less because if
you turn around and flop out,

1156
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:48,700
they're probably going to be like, this
is uh, like a cop or I don't know what.

1157
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,620
Right. So yeah, it's a, there's
like a, there's a dance.

1158
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,190
You don't want to have
your legs straight forward.

1159
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,580
What will the Cummins in the balls or
actually it's in a jar filled with my

1160
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:05,320
father's ashes.
A good drop.

1161
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:07,750
What'd you say? How many times have
you done this? I've never done it,

1162
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,050
but I watch a lot of documentaries
on Netflix about this. There is,

1163
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:15,840
there are a lot of Daca. Yeah,
there are. You learn about, anyway,

1164
01:15:15,841 --> 01:15:19,680
the point is I like traveling
with Mosha cause I'll be about,

1165
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,090
I'll go get a massage,

1166
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,640
I'll come back a lot more like sort of
reasonable and in my, in my, in my mind,

1167
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:26,680
I honestly don't know how
we'd do it with the child

1168
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,280
on his birthday.
When is it?

1169
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:36,750
July six to Seattle and gets available
cash or.com we sold out the first show.

1170
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:41,380
So there's only shows available for
the late show, but it'll be fun.

1171
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,170
Columbia city theater in Seattle.

1172
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:50,050
We're going on a big RV trip with
the baby and we're terrified.

1173
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:55,510
We're terrified that you bought one.
I have one. Yes. Yes. This is awesome.

1174
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,500
My plan is to just try to
not cry, not cry. Hello.

1175
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,030
This alarm is going to be hard.

1176
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,180
We're driving from here to Seattle
because I have a wedding in a,

1177
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:06,790
I'm actually marrying another
woman, uh, after my birthday.

1178
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:11,590
It's a birthday present
for me. Judaism. No for,

1179
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,160
we're going to drive all the way up the
coast like all the way to sat up on the

1180
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:19,120
coast. That's a long ass dress. A long.
How long? How long is this going to take?

1181
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,080
We have like 11 days.

1182
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:22,880
We'll be good to only drive
three hours a day with the baby.

1183
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:26,530
Going to be that going
to bring a helping hand

1184
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:33,840
and he's coming in the RV.
I sense you have contempt for this trip.

1185
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:37,570
Well,
if you can believe it.

1186
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,140
I'm really into camping and for s and if
you can believe this and Natasha's not

1187
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,250
as into camping.
That's hard to believe.

1188
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:46,390
It's hard to believe she's a rugged Kinda,
you know wild.

1189
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,660
I've always noticed that about her.
She loves hiking, Birkenstocks,

1190
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:55,750
her
Hilton Garden Inn.

1191
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,510
We had a severe anxiety
flying with our son.

1192
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,180
I don't want to you bring
the car seat. Uh, yeah.

1193
01:17:06,181 --> 01:17:09,360
You bring everything. You fucking
bring everything. You do it alone.

1194
01:17:09,361 --> 01:17:13,300
Because I was planning on doing that
personally. I, there's some women who for,

1195
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:16,100
it's like not a big deal. Yeah, the
baby's fine. He sleeps on the floor.

1196
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:20,780
Not with my kid. He's a boy. He's active.
It would give me so much diarrhea,

1197
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:22,010
anxiety to do it alone.

1198
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,240
I can't even imagine if you were the
one that shit your pants. I promise.

1199
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:32,950
I actually do have so much anxiety
when we phone a couple times with them.

1200
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:33,650
We've,

1201
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,620
we've sworn it off now until he's like
10 what's the weirdest thing that's ever

1202
01:17:36,621 --> 01:17:41,180
happened to you guys on an airplane?
So weirdest thing. A memory.

1203
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,050
It was always something horrible.

1204
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:46,910
There's so many weird things
that have happened on airplanes.

1205
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,860
Don't have a great story,
but I do have a story.

1206
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:55,250
There was a time when I got on a plane,

1207
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:56,840
I start flirting with
this girl pretty hard,

1208
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,760
like I didn't know where she
was just sitting next to me,

1209
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,160
and this is actually
a very pathetic story,

1210
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:05,900
but what ended up happening was we ended
up holding hands up to New York and

1211
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:10,270
that was
the end of the stuff.

1212
01:18:10,271 --> 01:18:12,230
That should give you a massage after a no.

1213
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:16,940
I adjusted my legs open slightly and
she didn't respond to that at all on the

1214
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:18,260
way to Africa.
That's true.

1215
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:23,060
That was a long flight and I ate
tacos in the Atlanta airport.

1216
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:26,480
Bad idea before like a 19 hour flight.
Oh,

1217
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:29,710
they don't have bathrooms
on the African polite

1218
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,900
pair of panties with me and my
carry on. When were you there? Yeah,

1219
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:38,240
we flew to Africa together.

1220
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,780
It seemed like the kind of couple who
goes to the bathroom in front of other

1221
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,333
in front of me.

1222
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,790
Did you give

1223
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,010
each other but no brown,
Brown, brown a lot.

1224
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,630
I
was a woman.

1225
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:25,460
I can't even begin to entertain this,
but like as a guy, when you have to Fart,

1226
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,530
you always had to deal with this problem.

1227
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,700
I leave the room,
you know?

1228
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,580
I don't think so.
This is a central issue.

1229
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,720
Our listeners care about the topic
they want to know about, so hold on.

1230
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:51,830
So you're watching a movie,

1231
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:00,110
Natasha? I don't know if
I, if that's true for me,

1232
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:02,970
I'll either hold it.
Wow.

1233
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,990
I mean it's like why do I want to
breach that? At this point you're,

1234
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:11,790
how many years in six years have you
been holding it that long then fart in

1235
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,890
front of each other? Like
friends? Yeah, definitely.

1236
01:20:13,891 --> 01:20:16,170
Do you fart in front of your guy
friends when you're out of the house?

1237
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:19,680
I put the girls, don't I do, I
don't know. We got to hang out more.

1238
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:24,040
I'll get you to start farting.
Tell him after an afternoon

1239
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:29,670
that closer to the friend. Definitely
the more, I mean if it's a really,

1240
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:31,950
really close friend, I'll sit on them
and fart in his lap or something.

1241
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:35,660
If it's a really close friend,
I'll slide my dig into him and I was,

1242
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,650
it's really about farting,

1243
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:41,760
but it is that I'm gay and I had
a secret that I have that I'm,

1244
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,770
I'm trying to reveal on this podcast
and my wife Natasha. So you never want,

1245
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:46,531
even when you're pregnant,

1246
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:49,530
you never had to Fart or what do you
do when you have to farm it? I didn't,

1247
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:54,450
I didn't. Uh, I mean I just, I don't ever
have to, you don't ever have to Fart.

1248
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,030
No. I mean, this is a lot
about number two is, well,

1249
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:58,070
what do you do when you
have to remember too?

1250
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:02,290
Mine are white and I don't do that
either. Hers or Velvet Velvet, Hawaii,

1251
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,840
reality. Believe this. Tasha is on brand.
It's exactly what you imagined the topic.

1252
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,350
I know they're white. I never heard that
before. But that is because I'm anal sex.

1253
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:16,890
That is why they're so white. Yeah, that's
a lot. Do you guys think this is funny?

1254
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:21,900
Just be honest. I had to do with shit. No,
not yet. No, not definitely do it. Shit.

1255
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:27,270
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Those guy climbing a tree,

1256
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,790
he's going to look like
you just got to treat food.

1257
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:35,910
What's he trying to do? He's trimming
a tree. A tree trimmer. Okay.

1258
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,480
It looks unprofessional. It was like
a little buddy has some boring shirt.

1259
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,480
No shirt. He's got the straps in
the robe. I don't know. Whatever.

1260
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,170
You should have like a machine to do that
I think. I think you're probably right.

1261
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:47,783
I mean that just,

1262
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,700
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1263
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,720
Moshe thinks that's funny. I don't,
I don't think it's funny either.

1264
01:21:55,721 --> 01:22:00,280
We're kind of the same now and Natasha,
why don't you create a real funny,

1265
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:03,820
let's talk and I'm over 14 right?
Also,

1266
01:22:03,821 --> 01:22:06,790
I love trees and I know how they should
be trimmed, so right away I'm like,

1267
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:11,570
so I know there's a man at the bottom
of that three screaming and agonist.

1268
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,540
He's like just saying it was a giveaway,

1269
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:17,160
like I knew what was going to happen
and you'll surprise I got you. It was,

1270
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:21,700
I was surprised. That's a very surprised
if that wasn't going to end well.

1271
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,540
That was a long drop. And the Adelaide,
the agony at the, I didn't like the fall,

1272
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:30,250
but the screaming at the bottom, that
was pretty funny. One more thing.

1273
01:22:30,251 --> 01:22:32,020
That tree doesn't need to be trimmed.
That's

1274
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:38,410
what bothers Natasha doesn't need
it. See, I'm a big proponent of like,

1275
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:42,190
the screams can be funny.
Oh yeah. The shout. Oh, you
know, can I hear that again?

1276
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:46,210
Sure. It did seem kind of good. Yeah,
just the end. Good. Alright. That scream.

1277
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:49,570
Let's see where is, he sounded
painful if I remember. I mean,

1278
01:22:49,571 --> 01:22:53,330
that guy might not be alive. Yeah. And
that makes it even funnier, right? Yeah.

1279
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:59,980
Oh my God. Hold on.
Hold on. What happened?

1280
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,183
What happened?

1281
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,610
Go ahead.
I don't want to get,

1282
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,280
he broke a bone that he's
hurting. He's in pain. Yeah.

1283
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:15,820
He might've popped the liver. I mean,
and it's hilarious to my husband.

1284
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:23,050
That's what I'm going to have
a very refined sense of humor.

1285
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:28,730
This is obviously funny. I
mean, it is cut this part,

1286
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:33,190
maybe my husband, ear to ear. This
is the happiest he's looked Tommy.

1287
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:37,510
We're having a baby. No smile.
Definitely out of a tree. Yeah.

1288
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,770
So you're going to have two boys. That
sounds really hard. You got him to,

1289
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,890
it's all digital. This
is why, but this is why.

1290
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:49,540
This is why she's not farting and you're
not fighting cause you have girls.

1291
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,920
Two female dogs,
little Pablo are the only male forces.

1292
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,940
That's why I'm out numbered by dicks and
balls and Fart. You got more clips, Tom?

1293
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,030
I've got all kinds, all kinds of
shit. Trying to see some clips.

1294
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,520
Watch his videos like this all the time.

1295
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:11,320
I've got my home pages or are
CNN Kook Slam meal on Instagram

1296
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:19,270
likes
Dr Phil like molestation videos.

1297
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:25,830
Why that? Why that is what used to
referring to what she's referring to.

1298
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:31,890
That's way better

1299
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,070
not the mothers are like,
I don't,

1300
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,860
I just want your my son because exactly
what my reaction was funny was that he

1301
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:41,850
was so close to the ground
and hurt himself so badly,

1302
01:24:41,851 --> 01:24:46,690
so badly and the parachutes open like
it didn't know what went wrong. I Dunno.

1303
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,390
It's like he didn't have it fully open.
I don't know what's going on with it.

1304
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:55,710
Okay. Would you guys marry your mom?
Wait, what? You're asking me if I would

1305
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,710
Mary, my mother? No. No.

1306
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:01,150
Why? Because she's my mom. That's,
I find that kind of off putting,

1307
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:06,830
get around to calling my mom.
I mean,

1308
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,760
let's say, why would you marry your mom?
I don't know. I just putting it out there.

1309
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,400
Are you queuing up a clip right now?

1310
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,820
Tell her mom and you're my son and
I fall in love with him. He said,

1311
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:24,380
yes I am. He said, you know what, I was
scared to let you know too. I am too.

1312
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,050
We're both consenting adults.
If, if it comes down to it,

1313
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,390
it's just like the gays there,
you know,

1314
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,290
as long as they're over 18
everything's fine. Yeah.

1315
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:37,580
You know what I'm really glad for is
that this is subtitled cause they're so

1316
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:39,070
stupid that I'm saying,

1317
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,290
it's like why are they talking to cameras?
Like marry your mom.

1318
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:47,850
But that's,

1319
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:51,950
we thought on this is like just don't
tell people that you married your mom.

1320
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,090
That's why I watch those racism
videos on Worldstar with,

1321
01:25:56,091 --> 01:25:58,310
it's like the old white lady got like,
go back to your fucker.

1322
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:01,460
It's like the minute be racist,
by all means.

1323
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:05,810
The moment the person you're being to
poles, the camera, it's like walk away,

1324
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:08,330
you're going to lose your job,
you're not going to work at quickie mart.

1325
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,070
More enraged.

1326
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:12,830
And they are also so used to phones
that they don't realize they're being

1327
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:16,100
recorded. But he definitely know
he's a, he's at an interview.

1328
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,910
Let me say this about this couple.
You know how Wise Cup,

1329
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,990
teardrop,
apple,

1330
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:28,970
it's kind of full circle to your ms
13 no, you know, here's the thing.

1331
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,080
You know how like when you have,

1332
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:31,820
when you were single and you
would have sex with somebody,

1333
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:34,690
you shouldn't be having sex was,
it was like a little hotter, right?

1334
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:39,620
This is probably so hot. Like when
you get to tell mom fucking, I mean,

1335
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:44,260
it's probably so hot, right? You know,
if you're down because you know it's,

1336
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:47,120
it's literally the ultra, the,
the, Oh gee taboo. That's true.

1337
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:48,390
And it's gotta be kind of awesome.

1338
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:51,830
Also led to my favorite
listener made songs

1339
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:55,840
of all time here. My son, I'm your mom.

1340
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,290
You're my son.
I'm,

1341
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:04,090
your mom told me you're asking when
you ask them when you see your mom.

1342
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,830
Oh yes, I would hear my son. I'm your mom.

1343
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:16,840
It's just like the gates.
Just like the gates

1344
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:20,260
fell in love too before they had
sex, it sounds like. That's right.

1345
01:27:20,261 --> 01:27:21,061
What was cool about it?

1346
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:23,980
Because they had a relationship from their
previous relationship of just being a

1347
01:27:23,981 --> 01:27:24,420
mother and son.

1348
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:28,970
They're able to really communicate openly
their desire before they consummated

1349
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:31,610
friends for.
That's actually,

1350
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:36,490
we were so fascinated by this. We found
out that there is a common thing amongst,

1351
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,450
uh, parents, even siblings that
are separated for a long time.

1352
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,870
A lot of times when they're reunited,
the feelings are so overwhelming.

1353
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:48,730
It can be confusing that they'll
shift sometimes into sexual feelings.

1354
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:51,220
Oh man, that's so intense.
It's very intense.

1355
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:54,170
So would you,
would you like hook up with your mom?

1356
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,920
I would rather just to kill
myself at this moment right now.

1357
01:27:57,921 --> 01:28:01,430
Even that have entertained
this conversation. Yeah. Even
as a bit, yes. Great. Okay.

1358
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:06,140
I accept that, but yeah. Oh man,

1359
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:10,780
that would be, see you afraid, you
know, base it damn these afraid.

1360
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:15,200
Do you play this video for every podcast?
Not Very podcast a while. Here's one.

1361
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:19,460
Hi Melanie. I'm Scotty with
ecstatic hearts, Tantra,

1362
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:23,730
which just want to share that
there are many ways to orgasm.

1363
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,020
She's acting like he's going
to John Waters movie sucks.

1364
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,890
You can't put that style
acting. Yeah, like a over,

1365
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,910
I just played it cause you're a
couple ice. Any sex right now?

1366
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:41,420
They're this ever going to Oregon.
He just came on on came hug.

1367
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:43,490
That's so funny too because not rubbing.
Well,

1368
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,740
I mean it's like in the touch and I had
been having sex for years and you've

1369
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:49,730
never ever had an orgasm. It's
like they're, they're just hugging.

1370
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:53,060
That's funny.
Oh Man.

1371
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,830
He like yelling. This just came
in. I haven't seen this one.

1372
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:04,810
It's this therapy to yelling.

1373
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:09,070
It was the primal scream in the burning
man I've seen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,550
This doesn't appeal to me because it
seems like it would hurt my voice,

1375
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:13,170
but I think most of us should do this.
Why?

1376
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:14,820
Because I think you have
more rage than I do.

1377
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:18,490
Rage. I don't have any rage.
Do you have more than me?

1378
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,300
Like when you get mad where people
park. Oh, that's true. Really? Well,

1379
01:29:22,301 --> 01:29:25,330
we live across the street
for an elementary school
and people are always coming

1380
01:29:25,331 --> 01:29:28,100
to pick their kids up and
parking in my driveway. Oh

1381
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:30,130
No, no, no. They don't
park in his driveway.

1382
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:33,990
They parked like two inches out and
I kind of plot out a little bit.

1383
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,130
Blobby he could still get
out and I was a school,

1384
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,520
are y'all done? I go, that's a driveway,
and then she's like, this lady was like,

1385
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:43,190
well, it's too big. I'm like, I
didn't pour the fucking concrete.

1386
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:48,060
I didn't establish this property. I
bought it and he's yelling this, throw a,

1387
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:50,630
and then she goes, she goes, well,
I'm just going to go and I go, well,

1388
01:29:50,631 --> 01:29:52,610
I'm going to call the police. And
she was like, go ahead and go.

1389
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:56,560
I'm going to key your car. She got
back in her car and drove away. No, no.

1390
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:01,020
She's picking up her kid from school.
What am I going to say? Really respected.

1391
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,280
[inaudible] name's Maggie or car.

1392
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,980
One of the great things of greatest
minds ever had was I was in in Berkeley.

1393
01:30:06,981 --> 01:30:09,920
I was going to park and
someone cut me off and,

1394
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:14,480
and pulled into the spot and the lady
was just like walking away and I just go,

1395
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,630
I said it exactly like this.
I go, I'm a key. That car,

1396
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:21,170
have a nice time in the bank. I'm a
key that car. And I just drove away.

1397
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:24,960
Of course I didn't key the car. I went
to bed about my day, but I do yell.

1398
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:28,490
I'm a key that car,
really the street. I just,

1399
01:30:28,491 --> 01:30:31,610
I loved the idea that there's no
possibility she would be in the bank,

1400
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:35,510
not freaking out, not enjoying
her time. Yeah. And I and I,

1401
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:37,790
and that was the price of entry for that.
Yeah.

1402
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:41,610
That is also the opposite of,
you know, spreading love and joy.

1403
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,700
That's right. It's like
spreading that key, that car.

1404
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,370
That is what I miss about Christianity.

1405
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:51,260
I liked that you did it. Yeah. That car,

1406
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:55,960
it's good because it's you
that car threat, it's menacing,

1407
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:59,080
but it's like you just as an empty
threat and then you're not going to be,

1408
01:30:59,081 --> 01:31:01,060
you are fucking her day
up, which I like. I loved

1409
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,400
that. I was just like, okay,
now I'm going to go on my day.

1410
01:31:03,401 --> 01:31:05,560
And at least she got punished
for taking that spot.

1411
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:10,000
You'd almost be a bitch more pleased with
having done that and not even getting

1412
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:13,290
the park like I could. Oh No. Yeah
I think so. Just feel good about,

1413
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,180
I would never do that dude. We
had a, we had a funny situation.

1414
01:31:16,181 --> 01:31:20,080
Speaking of conflict cause I
sometimes am prone to conflict and uh,

1415
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:22,750
we were driving back
from the air from lax.

1416
01:31:22,751 --> 01:31:25,510
We got picked up by an Uber
and we just watched, um,

1417
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,260
we just watched drugstore cowboy wait
at midnight, midnight cowboy cowboy.

1418
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:34,930
So we were kind of thinking about that.
And um, the car, the guy and the Uber,

1419
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:38,890
he looked like kind of a professor and
he rolled his eyes a moment. He saw.

1420
01:31:38,891 --> 01:31:42,310
So I should have like known
something was up, but I didn't quite,

1421
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:43,600
why wouldn't you roll your eyes?

1422
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,360
I mean just cause what we look like
snobs or whatever. I don't know what,

1423
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,000
what his process was.
Whatever we get in the car,

1424
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,670
I might've been wearing two
hats. That's true. Possible.

1425
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:55,300
So we're in the back of the car, we're
talking about the plot to midnight cowboy.

1426
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:57,340
We're like, you know, what
was that? Were they gay?

1427
01:31:57,341 --> 01:31:59,170
Was that a gay love that situation?

1428
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,090
What kind of analyzing the film and he's
Kinda like heroin thing a little bit.

1429
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:07,480
Just the littlest bit. And then,
uh, it's like an hour ride.

1430
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,840
We get back to my house and we're kind
of, we're kind of going like, okay,

1431
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,950
Natasha goes, you turn left here
because our entrance is not where the,

1432
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,270
where the address has a, he kind of snaps
at her after he goes, like, he goes,

1433
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,930
I'm a turn left because the thing says
to turn left. And I go, all right,

1434
01:32:22,931 --> 01:32:26,530
stop the car. We're getting out right now.
And uh, he's like, I can't stop the car.

1435
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:30,930
And I like open. I had already opened the
door and uh, and he's like, I, I do that.

1436
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,630
I pulling over. So he pulls over into
our driveway and I, and I'm like,

1437
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:38,410
at this point, like, I think
I did, he starts screaming,
so I pull out your phone.

1438
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,620
So I pulled out my phone. It was just
like click, you know, and I was like,

1439
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:43,780
say goodbye to your job at
Uber, you know, whatever.

1440
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:48,520
And we get out and he's like, cause he,
oh, that's right. He called me a jackass.

1441
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:52,630
He's, he swore he took it to
the swearer zone and I'm like,

1442
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:55,000
that's when I started recording. I
was like, what'd you just say, be it?

1443
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,820
I didn't say bitch. Uh, and
he's like, he's like nothing.

1444
01:32:57,821 --> 01:33:02,170
I didn't say anything and he wouldn't
give me my luggage. Right. He's like,

1445
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,640
she's eight months pregnant.
At that point,

1446
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,800
I think it was actually on the way
back from the special actually,

1447
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:08,080
and he wouldn't give me
my luggage and I'm like,

1448
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:11,410
give me my fucking luggage to get the
fuck outta here. And he's like, nope, no,

1449
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:15,700
I'm calling the police don't know
why he's calling the police. He goes,

1450
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,830
you go in the house, I'll give your
luggage to your wife. I'm like,

1451
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:21,040
I'm not leaving my pregnant wife out of
the way. It's because I was being cool.

1452
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,410
Yeah. Yeah. Super Cool. You know,

1453
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,780
often people would say being cool
would be supporting your husband,

1454
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:27,470
not an Uber driver,
but uh,

1455
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,410
just knew what to do to get him to leave,

1456
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,250
I guess as opposed to like starting to
film him and activating him and making

1457
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:34,240
him really mad in our drive.

1458
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:37,700
Well, he walks out and he's pacing
back and forth, calling nine one one.

1459
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,900
And I'm like, give me my fucking luggage.
So I go distract them to Natasha.

1460
01:33:41,901 --> 01:33:45,080
She's like, what? I leap into
the car and pull the trunk open.

1461
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:49,670
Now I go to grab my bags. He freaks
out, runs over slams the car shot. Yeah.

1462
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:53,590
First you told me eight months pregnant
to go pop has a trunk. Okay. To be honest,

1463
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:55,400
we're all in the front seat.

1464
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,390
All right. Well we do.
And where to be honest,

1465
01:33:57,391 --> 01:34:02,100
I'm not really in a good mental zone at
this point. Yeah. And I popped the trunk.

1466
01:34:02,101 --> 01:34:03,810
I go to grab the thing,
he slams it shut.

1467
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,430
Finally we negotiate a settlement where
he does take the bags out and I'm like,

1468
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:12,390
all right, now get the fuck out of my,
off my property. And, and he's like,

1469
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,690
I know way I'm waiting for the cops.
I'm like the carbs for what dude?

1470
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:18,630
Like what are you going to tell
the fucking cops? And he's like,

1471
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:23,310
I'm going to tell him that you were, you
know you were obnoxious. I go, okay. And,

1472
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,890
and he's like, know? And I
started walking away and goes,

1473
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:28,830
and I'm going to tell him that you didn't
understand the plot to midnight cowboy.

1474
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:33,720
That's really funny.
Absolutely. He Won. I will.

1475
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:37,770
No question is a consumer knows
where we live. That's true.

1476
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:39,900
There's no question at that
point in the interaction.

1477
01:34:39,901 --> 01:34:42,560
I was kind of like as a comedian,
like you're like, this one's not,

1478
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,200
this one's yours.
You take the w one whites

1479
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,350
on that.
That's fucking I,

1480
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,440
it's almost unbelievable that he
could come up with that. I know. Yeah.

1481
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,460
He looked like a retired history teacher.
He's clearly a set,

1482
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,220
like he was like 65 70 they so funny.

1483
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,720
It's almost like if I saw that in a movie,
I'd be like,

1484
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,080
that guy would not be able to put that
together. Was funny. It was very much,

1485
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:07,310
obviously it was driving the car.

1486
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:10,980
As we analyze this film that he
clearly thinks he understands more,

1487
01:35:10,981 --> 01:35:15,800
that he's just going like,
oh my God, these insufferable
hipster scar in the back.

1488
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:19,840
Think they understand this. Just like
driving angrily. Maybe he was like a, um,

1489
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,040
like a film critic or like

1490
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:26,960
I bet he taught at La Community College.
I did threaten to shoot him.

1491
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:31,520
You did? Yeah. As I was walking in, I
was like, you better get out of here.

1492
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,930
I was like, I don't have a gun. I
think like, you know, or you know,

1493
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:38,150
I'm gonna go get my gun or something.
I don't have a gun.

1494
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,520
There is no group said that to him.
I think so.

1495
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:46,340
Would you put up with this type of
behavior in your yard and my yard,

1496
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:51,320
like right in your driver for it not to
be on your property so that guy fucking

1497
01:35:51,321 --> 01:35:53,930
knows where you live. I'd be afraid he's
going to come back and Jack me later.

1498
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:54,790
I did feel that

1499
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:01,370
we got into a fight because I just felt
like he was escalating it in a way that

1500
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,880
my issue is that she
should be like on my side.

1501
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:11,780
Stranger swears at you and tells you
and it's like not giving your luggage.

1502
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:12,680
Wouldn't you be fired up

1503
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,460
when he said when the guy was like,
I know when to turn left

1504
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,940
and then I would have just
been quiet about it. Exactly.

1505
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:31,250
I wouldn't have been like,
let me out of the car and open up the door

1506
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,670
or what pissed you off about
that is what I'm saying.

1507
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:38,740
Was it like being disrespected but
he disrespected her wife cares.

1508
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:42,230
It didn't affect me attitude.
Anyway, let's roll the clip

1509
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,990
me shape pig

1510
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:57,150
mediation, dehumanization. Who?

1511
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,960
Those bottom teeth are just taken away.

1512
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:03,240
Um, this is kind of bothering me.
Well, first of all, I like a lot about,

1513
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,510
this is a Bobby Lee character

1514
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:11,400
TV and I'm very proud of it.
He did say,

1515
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:17,690
ah, that's a shit turnover
over here. Well, wait,

1516
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:20,530
what's bothering you? Uh,
first of all I liked, I don't
want to, it's very close up,

1517
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,970
close up. About my, like
my, my submission fantasies.

1518
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:27,130
I'm not going to shave fully.

1519
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,450
I'm going to have an
extremely shiny face and not,

1520
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:36,660
not trim my nose hair framing and the
bottom teeth are just so proud cause he's

1521
01:37:37,211 --> 01:37:37,900
in this like wait,

1522
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:41,290
he's looks like he's on the toilet
because he can see his shampoo bottles.

1523
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,010
He is definitely in the bathroom.

1524
01:37:45,011 --> 01:37:47,680
The cool thing is is that if
you need to go to the bathroom,

1525
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:52,300
he's okay with that walking
on the street shout hey shit.

1526
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:56,010
Big stuff. I love that.
He goes into a bit of a

1527
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,740
piece, he goes into a pit of
a bit of a character. It goes,

1528
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:03,120
if you see me walking on this
street, stop me. Go Hey shit. Big.

1529
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:04,920
Like it sounded very New York.

1530
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:09,330
It did like who watches a lot of movies?
Uh,

1531
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:11,960
and then I'll come to you.
I have latrines.

1532
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:15,260
Your pace is just shit and your,

1533
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:20,130
your verbal mediation PSL from me.
You can shit off of me.

1534
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,313
It didn't show up.

1535
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:23,990
Well it's very expensive to have
people come to your house and do that.

1536
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:29,630
So he's probably trying to get is
extended for free. Cost effective.

1537
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,980
I like how you,
I do wonder if how true this is.

1538
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:36,310
Like if I did see dude on the
street and I was like, hey shit pig.

1539
01:38:36,311 --> 01:38:40,000
And then I just shit in his mouth. If he
would hit this guy, he's down. He's down.

1540
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:41,410
Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I think so.

1541
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:46,090
Definitely like $300 to have a woman come
over and do that. Yeah. At least. Yeah.

1542
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,450
Well I don't think there's a lot of
women doing the shit pig videos. Yeah.

1543
01:38:49,451 --> 01:38:51,460
Dominic. No. To come over and shit on you.

1544
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:56,210
Oh saying he's doing it to try to get
free people to shit on him. Right.

1545
01:38:56,290 --> 01:39:00,160
But I think he's gay and I think our men,
I think it's free in that convenient,

1546
01:39:00,161 --> 01:39:03,570
but he tells you if you want to meet
him, you meet him at the bus station. No,

1547
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:07,470
he has a a desert area. Let's
not listen to it again. Yeah,

1548
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:11,500
he did say that you can meet him at the
bus station. What site is this from? A,

1549
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,840
I don't know. The site that it was
pulled from. Please don't tell him. No,

1550
01:39:13,841 --> 01:39:17,770
I'm just curious what he's in Norway. Oh,
so he's not sort of directly available.

1551
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,753
No, he's not. Okay.

1552
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:23,200
We were looking at the by

1553
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:29,250
there, it's even not dirty. Boy.
He's a bit of an outlier there.

1554
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,780
Dude. I was in Norway once,
uh, and I went to the,

1555
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:37,340
they have a comedy show in Bergen and the
local comedians found out I was Jewish

1556
01:39:37,341 --> 01:39:39,500
and we're like really kind of titillated
by that. And they're like, oh,

1557
01:39:39,501 --> 01:39:41,900
come with us, you'll
love this. Look, look.

1558
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:45,380
And they brought us downstairs behind
the comedy club into this basement.

1559
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:48,740
And they go, this was the room
where they tortured the Jews.

1560
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,830
I swear.
And I'm like,

1561
01:39:51,831 --> 01:39:54,890
why would you think this is a tourist
destination that I'd be like, Yay.

1562
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,010
And then they pointed up and there
were swastikas on the ladder. Ooh.

1563
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:00,200
In the balcony across the
street. And they're like, yeah,

1564
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:02,210
the Nazis were here and they,
this room,

1565
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:06,860
they would interrogate the
Jews and torture them. Like,
Ooh, thank you. You like it?

1566
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:10,190
Yeah. You are shipping big,
right? Yeah, that's a, yeah.

1567
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:13,070
It's really intuitive over those guys
to show you that? Well, you know,

1568
01:40:13,071 --> 01:40:16,280
comedians really get human instinct
and human and the humanity.

1569
01:40:16,281 --> 01:40:19,460
So they really knew that that
was a thing I would like. Weird.

1570
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,910
So weird. We were looking at this kid.
Oh by the way, have you noticed that?

1571
01:40:22,911 --> 01:40:27,911
Do you know that some people watch
comedy specials with subtitles on?

1572
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:33,650
They do sometimes, yes. Okay.
Wait, because his mom is deaf,

1573
01:40:33,651 --> 01:40:36,590
so sometimes we have settings. So that's
different. That's totally different.

1574
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:39,170
Sometimes our subtitles or
just on. Oh, okay. Right.

1575
01:40:39,171 --> 01:40:42,440
But you're saying something different.
I'm saying that we got emails about,

1576
01:40:42,441 --> 01:40:45,440
this guy was like, I was
watching a special with my
friend is subtitles were on.

1577
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,350
He's sitting there laughing at things
before they're said, cause he's reading.

1578
01:40:48,351 --> 01:40:50,720
Right. And, and then he's like, you know,

1579
01:40:50,721 --> 01:40:54,160
I've noticed that a lot of
people are doing it and people

1580
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,220
who are not hearing impaired.
Why was like an odd thing to do?

1581
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:59,680
You mean specifically comedy
specials or just stuff?

1582
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:02,950
Specifically comedy especially. Why?
I don't know why they're doing it,

1583
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:07,300
but I am of the thought that it's
gotta be kind of ruining it a bit.

1584
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:10,990
It's like stair step ahead. I'm very
used to that because I grew up with it.

1585
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,960
Something my parents being
deaf, but uh, I wonder,

1586
01:41:13,961 --> 01:41:15,430
I would like to watch my own special with,

1587
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:17,620
I mean I can't ever watch one of
my own specialist. Definitely.

1588
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:22,150
But I talk so quickly that I wonder
if the subs had a person, actually

1589
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:28,520
I'm telling you there's no way
they can get it right. No, no,

1590
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:33,230
that dear ms, ms, whatever.
They're missing a beat. I
mean, they're misquoting,

1591
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,730
they throw it up. Wait before you
say it or, or, or, or it's late.

1592
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:41,140
It's not matching up. Kind of fucks it
up. Especially if you are, if you are,

1593
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:46,210
if you can hear the reason why, why would
you do that to yourself? I don't know.

1594
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,910
I that's bizarre. What's the
reasoning? Maybe it's a comedians.

1595
01:41:48,911 --> 01:41:52,230
You sometimes miss punchlines and
so they want to watch it. I guess I,

1596
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:55,090
my theory on it was at this guy's
doing it because like maybe he goes,

1597
01:41:55,091 --> 01:41:59,200
he's just like a little
anxious and doesn't want the
mystery of where does this

1598
01:41:59,201 --> 01:42:03,340
going to stay like a second ahead. So
it's like true. Almost comforts him.

1599
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:05,380
It's bizarre. It's bizarre. Hey,

1600
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:09,950
maybe we could have them weigh
in on our Yani debate. Yani,

1601
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,730
there's nothing to talk about. We know.
What's the other word? The Yani. Yeah,

1602
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:18,270
the Piss on me beat me guy.
Uh,

1603
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:22,960
he's saying I got you. Just a good
point. Okay. We'll just wrap up on that.

1604
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:27,070
All right, that makes sense.
Okay. Um, so this guy,

1605
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,670
no, we would do it. That's okay.
Do you think this is terrible? Um,

1606
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:37,050
so this guy is the biggest celebrity
that this show is ever created.

1607
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:39,250
Okay.
He's legendary.

1608
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:43,120
He's amazing and he's contributed so much,

1609
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:47,260
but there's a mystery as to what he's
saying in one part of this video. Okay.

1610
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,550
Okay. You can give me your
version of what you think he say.

1611
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:50,500
So I'll just start it off.

1612
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:52,890
Black. God's love the fuck. Fuck good.

1613
01:42:52,891 --> 01:42:57,891
Look if you're a hot black guy and you
want to fuck me at 2195 if you want to

1614
01:42:58,731 --> 01:43:00,020
move in,
you can move in.

1615
01:43:00,021 --> 01:43:03,350
But you got to fuck the how many
I need to be fucked a lot, man.

1616
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:07,250
You can't rent free food, free rent and
everything else, man. He has a GL man.

1617
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:11,500
Men from jail, homeless
or um, you're thug.

1618
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:15,610
Want to come move in if
Franklin you too man. Free Rent.

1619
01:43:15,611 --> 01:43:19,190
You could at least in a k fuck me
piss. Somebody beat me a home, Ya know?

1620
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,990
And there it is. Wait a minute. Oh yeah,
it's clear what he said. What does he say?

1621
01:43:22,991 --> 01:43:25,120
A whole minnow. Oh No, no,

1622
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,220
but that's what I understand that there's
a controversy about what he's saying.

1623
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:33,640
Right. The last part, the last thing I
hear it again. Of course you can hear it.

1624
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:34,474
Many times

1625
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:39,080
he rented Elisa in the k fuck me piss.
Somebody beat me at home, Ya know?

1626
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:43,390
See what saying? What do you think he's
saying? I'll tell you my version of,

1627
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:44,190
and it's,
it's,

1628
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:47,560
I don't want to taint their opinions and
tell me what you hear first because I

1629
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:49,680
feel like, well here's
the audio, just the audio,

1630
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,670
all them, Ya know, piss on
me. Beat me home. Ya know,

1631
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,450
I,
I ain't got nothing really whole meadow,

1632
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:03,150
the right lane.

1633
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:08,180
See what I think he's saying is that's
been submitted I think cause he,

1634
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:13,200
he tells you about what he wants,
literally gives his address out.

1635
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:16,110
He says, Piss on me.
Beat me home here now.

1636
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:20,800
And he's in such a frantic excitement
that it comes out of here now. Yeah,

1637
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:23,870
I'm home here now. I'm home
here now. Okay, let me so

1638
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:26,220
piss somebody beat me at home,
Ya know?

1639
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:30,870
No. Oh No, no homie. Now some
people are saying, he's saying,

1640
01:44:30,871 --> 01:44:35,830
whoa man out hollow man out. Oh Man, hold
on, hold on. Hold on guys guys. I mean,

1641
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,580
I know he does. He has an
affinity for black guys, but like,

1642
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:42,030
he's not really street. It'd be crazy to
pivot at the barrier and be like, Hey,

1643
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,860
hold this man now. Right now. Right.

1644
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:49,360
People have said,
that's my argument to it doesn't,

1645
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:51,420
it's not consistent with
the rest of the speech.

1646
01:44:51,690 --> 01:44:54,380
Now that's so cool if can
be this restaurant. Yeah.

1647
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,330
By the way,
Trejos Tacos.

1648
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:00,830
There's so many different
versions that people are, I mean,

1649
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:05,060
people have said he's saying
a homie on out, hold me down.

1650
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:07,520
Hollow me out. Um, uh,

1651
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:11,000
in and out, like you said. Okay,
so this is a clip you found.

1652
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:13,310
This isn't actually a
person. Oh yeah. People,

1653
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:15,700
we found this and it's been talked to him.

1654
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:20,210
We don't know that you have his address.
Write him a letter and no,

1655
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:24,100
but it's really, I write him
a certified letter. He's not,

1656
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:26,960
there's no way he remembers
what he fucking said. That
Watson, I'm telling you.

1657
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:29,360
Crazy true dude.
I tell you what,

1658
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:34,580
I challenge your mom's house to
write a certified letter with half.

1659
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,560
You rip a hundred days in.
I Dunno.

1660
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,920
He says it's a drug rip a
hundred dollar bill in half.

1661
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:43,160
And tell him if he could tell
you the accurate answer to this,

1662
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,870
you will send him the
other half of the hundred.

1663
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:47,930
There's no way that dude doesn't want the
other half of the hundred or actually,

1664
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:52,160
if you want to save your money, say
that you are a black guy, a black top,

1665
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:55,140
but loves the fuck, but one thing he
does when he's going to respond to it,

1666
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,470
I don't think cash is the
incentive here for this.

1667
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:02,900
Find a big black guy home
drive to his house and be
like, Oh, I'm here to top you.

1668
01:46:02,901 --> 01:46:03,734
But first,

1669
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:08,280
you know what I love most about him
is there's an unwrapped gifts, right?

1670
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:13,150
There's the red bow.
Oh,

1671
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,280
there's another light present he has left.

1672
01:46:15,281 --> 01:46:17,180
Oh and looks like there's another
president. It's like his birth.

1673
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:20,370
You know what's inside of that present,
right? Oh, this was one present.

1674
01:46:20,371 --> 01:46:22,830
That's the boat of the presence.
So he's not that popular,

1675
01:46:22,831 --> 01:46:26,310
but you know what's inside of it, right?
A whole me now. Oh man, that whole minnow.

1676
01:46:26,430 --> 01:46:29,400
There's so many people that are trying
to figure it out. We do it one more time.

1677
01:46:29,470 --> 01:46:33,600
Just a quick reminder that the,
what's he saying? Oh, I'm here now,

1678
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:37,410
homie on out hold here down all the
different groups of been a tee shirt.

1679
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:39,630
Does he know this is the third tee shirt?

1680
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:45,540
Yeah. Wait, I'm saying how
could you possibly probably

1681
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,130
not send this guy a letter you have?
Well I like pull me out.

1682
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:51,660
We have,
there's,

1683
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:54,180
there's other people that we've featured
on this show that we've actually

1684
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:59,010
contacted and offered goes, well
we'll offer it some substantial money.

1685
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:03,560
Much more than a hundred dollars. No they
won't. They won't even answer us. Yeah.

1686
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:08,490
Sometimes they want to answer sometimes.
Uh, what getting like, what's going on?

1687
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:13,080
Wait, how many know we've had, we've
respond how much and and he was like,

1688
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:17,370
go fuck yourself. No, he was
like, uh, he basically goes,
I dedicated a video to you.

1689
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:20,910
Like he dedicated a video to us and
that was his response and he got

1690
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:25,020
overwhelming like contact
from our listeners. Wait,

1691
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:28,380
how much did you offer her, this person
and for what? What's subsist to interview?

1692
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:33,220
Just in it. Just to make fun
of him on your podcast. I know.

1693
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,780
We just wanted to interview him.

1694
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:41,600
This guy on it will be a probably a
very respectful, like absolute dateline,

1695
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:45,930
you know? Wait, so, uh, what did,

1696
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,800
what did you offer that person? What's
substantial money like? Well, yeah,

1697
01:47:48,801 --> 01:47:51,840
like for over we're over $500 to 500.
I mean,

1698
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:54,930
I'm just going to offer him
$500,000. Half a million. No,

1699
01:47:54,931 --> 01:47:56,790
but I mean I also was like,

1700
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,410
or just get back to me with what you
want or can I hear it one more time?

1701
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:05,490
I'm going to weigh in and finally my
final way. The final, your final version.

1702
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,480
Okay,
here we go.

1703
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:15,150
Fuck me. Piss. Somebody beat me at
home, Ya know, come see me when I come.

1704
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,140
Come home here now.

1705
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:21,300
Don't hold me on out homie on now it
sounds like it's today and try it out and

1706
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:24,630
try out and wanna fuck a pitch.
Let me try it out.

1707
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,550
She has to apply it only as fuck,
man.

1708
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:30,300
I'm looking at the hardcore guys and
meaning wanting to do it and I want to

1709
01:48:30,301 --> 01:48:33,900
deliver it. I'm a hot swap.
My trash come down. Let's fuck

1710
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:38,220
screens over here.
I don't think it's,

1711
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:41,040
I'm home here now because it doesn't
fit with the theme of what he's saying.

1712
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:45,560
Fuck me. Piss on me. Shit. It's like
he's like, you want to come over?

1713
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:49,840
Do you want to come over? You want to
come over drugs and forgot what I forgot.

1714
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,610
Like he's just talking gibberish. That's
a very good, that's a very good point.

1715
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:57,660
I think you're right and I think you are
reluctantly being the lead detective.

1716
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,890
Well she's got the right jacket
for it. Wait, so it's like, oh.

1717
01:49:01,891 --> 01:49:06,870
So he's going like fuck me, piss on
me. Like he almost is doing that.

1718
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:11,670
I almost see saying hold me down. But he's
saying hold me now or whatever. Right.

1719
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:16,170
It's too fucked up mess.
Right, right. Yeah.

1720
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:20,010
Just got like a bottle of Tequila.
He doesn't drink

1721
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:28,390
liquor bottle behind it and pull me
on y'all. Come on with me on the,

1722
01:49:28,450 --> 01:49:31,720
y'all holding me on the
call. Palm, Ya Know Harlem.

1723
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:33,900
It's Stephen Hawking

1724
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:40,470
the horn.
It's a good point.

1725
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,650
I feel like it's hollow man out.
But you're right.

1726
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:48,020
It's inconsistent with their own neonics
before calling me on that street. He's

1727
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,320
not a street. No. I want to
tell him Natasha, before I
forget. Oh, I'm so bummed for,

1728
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:56,350
I was going to do the thing for her,
but that you play drunk so well.

1729
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:59,470
You're such a great actress and
every time I see you do drunk,

1730
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:04,030
you think I'm really drunk. No. Yes,
yes. Like you. You see you do this in,

1731
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:04,930
it's brilliant.
Where are you?

1732
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:09,250
Don't overdo it like you do it the way
drug people really do it or they're

1733
01:50:09,251 --> 01:50:13,810
trying to hold their shit together,
which is so funny and so good.

1734
01:50:13,811 --> 01:50:18,380
I just wanted to tell you that I've
been to a lot of practice. Her Pr,

1735
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:21,560
her drunk is amazing. So funny, Huh?

1736
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:25,690
Pants less drunk on burning love is
truly one of the funniest things up.

1737
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:27,940
We laugh out loud. Funniest
things I've ever seen. Right.

1738
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:31,160
She's kind of like street a little
bit too. Yeah. Well she's trash.

1739
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:33,220
She what she is.
She's calling me on now.

1740
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:38,180
Yeah. That's so funny. And your
trash boys. Well thank you.

1741
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:43,430
Tasha would make funnier ear relatives.
I love that too. I like Tata.

1742
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:46,670
Thank you. My family. I'm part of,

1743
01:50:46,671 --> 01:50:49,640
I think what a family is here for
is to make fun of them. Yeah. Yeah.

1744
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:52,490
Moshe said I could make fun. It does.
Does he care if you make fun of him? Tom,

1745
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,490
to make fun of Tommy? I do all the
time on stage. He doesn't care.

1746
01:50:55,610 --> 01:50:59,610
Is there anything that's off limits?
Uh,

1747
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:03,870
not yet. You got to make fun of
her. Yeah, he does all the time.

1748
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,620
Talks about my loose
Vatche my big floppy tits.

1749
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:11,170
Oh yeah. You're loose badge
and big floppy disk. It is.

1750
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:14,570
Tom Tells me first. It's not like,
it's like we have a quarterly.

1751
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:17,620
What's so what's your, what's your
off limits? We got no lines. No, they,

1752
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:21,800
when it comes to the stage,
there's no lines for sure.
Right? Yeah, exactly. Well,

1753
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:23,450
I'd like to have,
I,

1754
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:26,740
I'd like him to not say negative things
about me and I'd like to say negative

1755
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:28,300
things about him.
I'm sure vice versa.

1756
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:32,680
But I mean what in interpersonal
communication at home
I'm brittle and I have a

1757
01:51:32,681 --> 01:51:36,040
hair trigger. But if she gets on
stage and makes fun of my deaf mom,

1758
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:39,340
it's all good to trades or
no, no. I will say though,

1759
01:51:39,341 --> 01:51:42,760
the way Moshe acts with people,
with their cars and with Uber people,

1760
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:46,720
he doesn't do that to me. No, that's
good. Yeah you will say that. Huh?

1761
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:49,870
You will say that. Cause that's what I
coached you to say on the drive over here.

1762
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:50,890
But it's what,

1763
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:53,710
I don't want people to think that he
carries that into our relationship.

1764
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:55,990
I know how unstable it seems.
I am.

1765
01:51:56,950 --> 01:52:00,820
I just have a thing about
being disrespected and it's
not good and I don't like

1766
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:03,030
it that I disrespect you sometimes,
but you don't act like that. Yeah,

1767
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:05,850
but it's not people that I know
disrespecting me. It's like strangers.

1768
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:08,080
It's different. It's way
different. I'm getting better.

1769
01:52:08,081 --> 01:52:10,420
I'm a lot better than I used to be.
I believe it's called righteous anger.

1770
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,100
That could be

1771
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:13,350
right. But this is a dude
thing. Let me tell you though,

1772
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:17,160
cause I know that you had fucking choke
a man out for snapping at me like that

1773
01:52:17,161 --> 01:52:21,550
too. I think, uh, it's just, it's like,
dude, it's testosterone. I did Tasha.

1774
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:22,261
I know you're right.

1775
01:52:22,261 --> 01:52:25,080
And I also didn't look at it like he was
protecting me because it seemed like he

1776
01:52:25,081 --> 01:52:27,730
was endangering our family
because of your volume.

1777
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:32,430
She was letting people know where we live.
The guy might have a gun,

1778
01:52:32,431 --> 01:52:33,450
like why go there?

1779
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:36,870
I did analyze and uh,
I decided he did not have a gun.

1780
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:39,350
I mean they were probably correct.
We're no,

1781
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:43,710
remember he had like a weird pace maker,
a wire coming from his neck. I was like,

1782
01:52:43,711 --> 01:52:45,970
I could just grab that and
Yank, you know. And he's just,

1783
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:50,150
you just unplug them.
Yeah, like commander data.

1784
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:54,680
But it's also the testosterone that sent
Moshe into a rage where he thought it

1785
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:57,740
was a good idea for me to climb pregnant.
Eight months pregnant into his,

1786
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:01,490
the guy's front seat without
his permission. And when
Moses did it, the guy goes,

1787
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,660
are you fucking car? But like, he was
so pissed. So it's like I almost did.

1788
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:09,350
Right, but if you had done it, I
would've been back at the trunk.

1789
01:53:09,351 --> 01:53:11,450
I would have grabbed the whole main
out and gotten the fuck out of there.

1790
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,070
He said, are you my fucking car
when you went to pop the trunk?

1791
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:17,390
Joe, she'll get into, his
friend was all he wanted me to.

1792
01:53:17,391 --> 01:53:20,660
He told me eight months pregnant to,
to,

1793
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:22,550
to slither my way into the guy's car.

1794
01:53:22,551 --> 01:53:26,570
Cause the guy was saying was holding
our luggage hostage in his trunk.

1795
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:28,050
Yeah.
I love this story.

1796
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,960
I liked the design. Are you
on? Well, here's the thing.

1797
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:36,160
I definitely understand
both sides of it from him.

1798
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:38,320
I definitely get as a father though,

1799
01:53:38,321 --> 01:53:41,200
what would you have done without a
father at this point? Yeah, that's true.

1800
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:45,100
I understand you feeling like,
I feel like it's almost like a very,

1801
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:49,780
very defined male female storyline
because you're, you're being,

1802
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:53,500
you're being composed, you're
being rational. You're,
you're thinking ahead. Yeah.

1803
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:57,050
Trying to make it go
faster. Well, annually.

1804
01:53:57,850 --> 01:54:02,430
Do you use our intelligence to get out
of potentially physical on the island?

1805
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:06,400
Just use my brute strength,
right. Sort of gorilla,

1806
01:54:06,401 --> 01:54:07,750
I'm out of my driveway.

1807
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:10,520
But it should be because men size each
other up right when you get into it.

1808
01:54:10,521 --> 01:54:10,890
Right.

1809
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:15,410
Did size up this handicap 70 year old
with like an old suit on with a, you know,

1810
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:20,330
elbow what he did, he really did. He did.
It was like, I could probably win this. I,

1811
01:54:20,331 --> 01:54:22,430
you probably wouldn't have done
that with like a guy who was like,

1812
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:23,690
look like he could kick your ass.

1813
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:25,760
That's the great hypocrisy of like,

1814
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:28,970
I just can't stand to be disrespected
because if the motherfucker was like a

1815
01:54:28,971 --> 01:54:32,220
thugged out like six foot eight body
filler, I would have been like, all right,

1816
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:36,200
listen man, um, uh, I'm
sorry. And anything I can do,

1817
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:38,290
I don't understand the plot to
midnight cowboy. I'll tell you,

1818
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:43,650
just say that the woman he yelled
at who had his car, their car,

1819
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:46,830
it was like a,
I'd say 65 year old white woman would,

1820
01:54:46,831 --> 01:54:50,380
he told the woman you were
like, Oh, my key, your car.
Oh, you weren't there. I will.

1821
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:54,420
She was. And so I felt like I could take
her, but see, that's, yeah, but that's,

1822
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:59,550
we almost the only people who don't think
about who they're saying things like

1823
01:54:59,551 --> 01:55:02,870
that too are literally crazy people.
Right. That's why they're crazy, right?

1824
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:06,360
Because they're like, yeah, I'll say
that to the fucking six, five, you know,

1825
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:11,170
300 pounds. Like, yeah, dog barks like
dogs that are way bigger than you.

1826
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:14,190
They don't know what they're doing. Yeah.
Yeah. So I mean, it's how you stay alive.

1827
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:17,910
That's ape shit. Like literally that's
ape shit. That's what monkeys do.

1828
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:21,900
So ultimately we'll get out of my little
jungle area. He helped out because,

1829
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:25,970
you know, he felt threatened, uh,
disrespected and I totally agree.

1830
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,180
I understand that you understand that.
But ultimately in this court

1831
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:33,070
side, are you on, well, Hey, I,

1832
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:38,070
I'm on her side as a survivor of
the feminine instinct is to be like,

1833
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:41,220
let's not start some crazy shit.
Let's just go get inside. I mean,

1834
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:44,190
when I'm vulnerable. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1835
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,390
I,
but the thing is like,

1836
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:49,270
I identify with what he thinks
because done it depends on it.

1837
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:53,730
He might've done it. It
depends. It depends. I mean
I think the older I get now,

1838
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:58,050
like you said, being a parent, I do think
about things like that. Like my behavior.

1839
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:02,970
Um, you know, my incidents or have
gone way down, way down. I mean, right.

1840
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,740
You got admit that you
buy people suing me.

1841
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:12,210
Taking my money. Yeah, totally.
Therapy. This is therapy for us.

1842
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:16,530
I love it. Oh yeah, I've been a oh
yeah. I mean I'm not like an angry dude.

1843
01:56:16,531 --> 01:56:21,030
I have a weird thing about strangers
disrespected. It was like a child thug

1844
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,240
reverts back to like, I've got
a little on the streets, right?

1845
01:56:27,241 --> 01:56:31,710
I've got a little part of, of my
from Oakland. Where are you from?

1846
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:36,150
I'm just kidding.
It's a fun area for me.

1847
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:41,190
I don't mean to say you were from
the town. I'm from the town and I,

1848
01:56:41,191 --> 01:56:44,430
and every kid in Oakland thinks
that they're like a thug. Obviously.

1849
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:46,200
I'm not an idiot.
I know what I look like.

1850
01:56:46,201 --> 01:56:49,260
It's not like I think I actually
strike fear, look like [inaudible].

1851
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:56,040
I don't even know who he is.
A rapper too short. Anyway,

1852
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:59,600
but there is a little part of me,
Natasha calls it old motion.

1853
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:03,120
That's what that's her name for that
get that character. It's still there.

1854
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:07,230
It's still just a little, and it doesn't
comport to who I am. I'm obviously,

1855
01:57:07,231 --> 01:57:11,310
I mean I get that I'm a little hipster
fob but uh, but it just comes out anyway.

1856
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:15,360
And I said to Natasha and me and my
friend Jacob joke around about this,

1857
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:17,760
anytime I mentioned the fact
that I grew up in Oakland,

1858
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:20,930
I'm in a very bad psychic
zone and I need to like,

1859
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:24,090
if I'm in conflict with a stranger
and I say, oh, I grew up in Oak,

1860
01:57:24,091 --> 01:57:27,030
I'm from Oakland, I got to go
like, yeah, I'm in trouble.

1861
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:29,430
That's the trigger where that's how,
you know what,

1862
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:32,970
I've reverted deeply into
my old persona recently.

1863
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,530
I won't go into the whole thing.
It was too long.

1864
01:57:34,531 --> 01:57:39,531
But recently I was disrespected by
somebody and I had homicidal fantasies.

1865
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:42,260
I was sitting there and I,

1866
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:47,070
I imagined myself beating him so badly
with his head exploding against the

1867
01:57:47,071 --> 01:57:51,090
cement. It was very satisfying to go
there after the feeling all the rage.

1868
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:55,650
But I just left. I left the situation.
I fantasize about people dying.

1869
01:57:55,651 --> 01:58:00,320
I don't care how they die. I just
want them out of my life. By the way,

1870
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:06,640
I, the last time I got no fear, let
me go into a physical fight. Like A,

1871
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:10,590
I don't know. I can't remember last
time I got in a physical fight, uh,

1872
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:15,600
probably 10 years ago. That's kind of
a recent two recent two recent. Um,

1873
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:18,060
but, uh, I was really ashamed of myself.

1874
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:24,030
Yeah, probably. I have a whole
bit about it in my first special.

1875
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:27,150
Were you working like, or like,
you know, on the road I was at,

1876
01:58:27,151 --> 01:58:29,670
I was at a comedy show.
It's a whole thing.

1877
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:31,630
I don't want to do bits because
there's so many bits in it,

1878
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:32,790
but it's a whole thing.

1879
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:35,400
How it literally couldn't have been
funny or was that a Hanukkah show?

1880
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,590
I had a drill in my hand,
like I disrespected me.

1881
01:58:37,591 --> 01:58:40,860
I literally threw the Dreidel at his head.
That's how the conflict began.

1882
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:44,770
The traditional Jewish way to start a
fight. And we like went outside and I,

1883
01:58:44,771 --> 01:58:49,300
I won the fight. Uh, but, uh, you
are being hired by a comedy club.

1884
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:53,280
I don't love the incredulity and
your voice. No, I always had a,

1885
01:58:53,330 --> 01:58:56,060
it was at a show at the Edinburgh
Castle in San Francisco. Uh,

1886
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:59,140
it was like a bar show before
you were like a touring comedian.

1887
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:01,200
It might've been just before I,
yeah.

1888
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:03,010
It might've been just before
I was a touring comedian.

1889
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:04,960
That would've gotten
back to your agent then.

1890
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:09,010
Maybe it was more than 10 years ago. Maybe
it was too. Yeah, it was probably 11,

1891
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:13,990
11 years ago. Yeah. Something like that.
But, uh, you guys swung on each other.

1892
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:18,430
Yeah. So fun. It was a
whole thing. Where you,

1893
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:23,140
so you never watched my special? No. Ouch.
Uh, there was a whole thing where like,

1894
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:27,040
he was in a show who's disrespecting the
performers that used to really make me

1895
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:29,950
mad when there'd be somebody disrespecting
another performer while they were on

1896
01:59:29,951 --> 01:59:30,730
stage.

1897
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:35,650
And so he laughed and I started to
applaud when he finally left the room.

1898
01:59:35,651 --> 01:59:36,970
He's like being loud and obnoxious.

1899
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:41,380
And then he said some shit to me through
the dre Latam classic and then he's

1900
01:59:41,381 --> 01:59:45,090
like, come outside. So I ran outside. I
didn't know what I was doing, but he uh,

1901
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:49,090
everything, it was kind of weird actually
because he had a third friend and um,

1902
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:53,470
and he, he is, it was me, the guy
and the third friend and then,

1903
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:56,400
and then Brent wine, Bach top kid. Yeah,

1904
01:59:56,470 --> 02:00:01,330
the last person you need to lock
up your back. Let's talk some shit.

1905
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:03,820
Yeah. Talks to see. Exactly. Uh,

1906
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:07,150
so it was kind of weird actually because
we were going back and forth, you know,

1907
02:00:07,151 --> 02:00:09,430
yelling at each other and then
things are calming down a bit.

1908
02:00:09,431 --> 02:00:11,740
Like I got control of my
senses. I was like, look,

1909
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:13,090
I'm not trying to start a conflict.

1910
02:00:13,091 --> 02:00:14,830
You were just being super
disrespectful in there.

1911
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:16,360
Everything was kind of calming down.

1912
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:19,630
And the third guy who was like playing
the mediator was like, it's all good.

1913
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,870
Let's just calm down. All of a
sudden at the end of the whole thing,

1914
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:27,190
as things were about to like be over
snatches my hat off of my head and he's

1915
02:00:27,191 --> 02:00:30,010
like, that's a cool hat. I mean, as
I used to say in the, in the bay,

1916
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:32,470
this was a line I dropped.
I go, look, I'm not black,

1917
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:36,250
but I'm black enough that if you grab my
hat off my head, we're going to fight.

1918
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:37,840
And uh,
so we did,

1919
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:41,920
we like ran outside and the
dude I had been training,

1920
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:44,380
like doing boxing training
for like a year at that point.

1921
02:00:44,381 --> 02:00:48,150
And it kind of interesting. I never threw
a punch at the guy like, which has come,

1922
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:51,610
I think of that as like,
maybe that's good. Like maybe
if I punched the guy, like,

1923
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:54,220
I don't know, something could,
a bad could have happened.

1924
02:00:54,370 --> 02:00:56,300
But what ends up happening,
we started wrestling around and I like,

1925
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,790
like kind of when a headline,

1926
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:59,960
I've got him in a headlock and I like
choked him out. I literally like,

1927
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:04,490
he literally tapped like, oh, and uh, and,

1928
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:08,350
and at the end of it, you know, and he
goes, I go, are you done? Are you done?

1929
02:01:08,351 --> 02:01:11,500
And this is from the bay. I go, are
you done? Are you done? And he goes,

1930
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:15,820
I'll never be done.
It's like I'm fighting a night.

1931
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:19,900
I'm fighting at night from the roundtable
end. He finally, everything calmed down,

1932
02:01:19,901 --> 02:01:21,760
everything conflict over end of thing.

1933
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,140
There's a whole thing where he had cut
me and also bled on me. So it was like,

1934
02:01:26,141 --> 02:01:31,030
I was like, and he looked in that moment
as I looked at his body, I'm like, Oh wow,

1935
02:01:31,031 --> 02:01:34,780
you're like,
you are a gay heroin user.

1936
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:38,380
Like everything about the moment there
was blood. I was thinking to myself like,

1937
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:43,160
oh my, this dude is like, was he around
the same age as you? He probably was,

1938
02:01:43,161 --> 02:01:47,750
but smaller. Like I hate that fucking
disrespect to the other performance man.

1939
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:51,470
Almost got in a fight at the
three clubs. Yeah, totally. Yeah.

1940
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,840
This lady was sitting in
the front and it was the,

1941
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:58,310
there was two shows back back to back
shows and she was like, yeah, and like

1942
02:01:58,670 --> 02:02:02,480
talking over people. And I was like,
and so I was, I wasn't on that show.

1943
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:04,220
So when that show ends,
people leave.

1944
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:08,720
She stayed and then I went to host the
second show and she started to do it.

1945
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:13,130
But because I was so worked up from
watching her, I immediately was like,

1946
02:02:13,131 --> 02:02:16,480
shut the fuck up. And somebody was
like, don't talk to her. Like, ah,

1947
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:18,830
you're the asshole. Like,
Hey asshole, I've been here.

1948
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,610
And she said something anyways, I call
her a cunt. [inaudible] people were like,

1949
02:02:22,611 --> 02:02:23,670
whoa.
And I'm definitely like,

1950
02:02:23,740 --> 02:02:28,360
just super, what is the
occasion? Is it, it's a showcase.
Is it a Montreal showcase?

1951
02:02:28,361 --> 02:02:30,040
A showcase that I'm,
I'm not showcasing,

1952
02:02:30,041 --> 02:02:33,670
I'm posting for them for the other
comments and I'm so mad that she's ruining

1953
02:02:33,671 --> 02:02:36,410
this for them. It's funny though, is
that the guy who was going on first,

1954
02:02:36,411 --> 02:02:38,290
I was mad at you. Like
why is he ruined it? Yeah,

1955
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:42,820
I know they weren't, but then
somebody was like, some woman goes,

1956
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:45,850
don't say that to her. That's my
friend. I go, that's your friend.

1957
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,900
Then you're a cunt too.
And then people got up and left.

1958
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:54,310
Then the show kind of actually
started to kind of go together.

1959
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:58,540
Well the friends, the friend
who was like, that's my friend.

1960
02:02:58,630 --> 02:03:02,770
Her son walks in with a backpack.
Anybody who goes out with it

1961
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:04,600
backpack,
that's bad news right there.

1962
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,380
And he was like, just staring. He was
like, cut, talk to you for a second.

1963
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:11,110
I was like, all right. And
I go outside. He's like,

1964
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:15,310
you called my mom crying and I go,
who's your mom?

1965
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:16,853
Yeah,

1966
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:21,180
any points to like the friend. I go,
I didn't really, I didn't call her.

1967
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:24,220
And he's like, yes you did. You
said Blah Blah Blah. He's like,

1968
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,750
I want you to apologize to my mom.

1969
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:30,520
And her mom's mom was like looking all
like up at me. Like, you know me can,

1970
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:33,040
she was like, what happened?
Why were you so angry? I go,

1971
02:03:33,041 --> 02:03:35,560
cause your fucking friend is tea.
They're like,

1972
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:38,950
well she's been drinking and this and
I go, exactly like get her outta here.

1973
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:42,820
And it was, we have this whole thing
and I go, all right, I'm calling now.

1974
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:46,630
I'll say this. Sorry, I said that
to your mother. I'm not sorry.

1975
02:03:46,631 --> 02:03:49,810
I said it to her though. [inaudible]
and they were like, okay,

1976
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:54,220
fair enough. They shook on it. Yeah. And
the kid you could see like he was like,

1977
02:03:55,090 --> 02:03:58,210
he was so fired up that I had said that.
And then he just kind of like,

1978
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:01,390
it's so funny too, cause it's
like conflict. It's so ridiculous.

1979
02:04:01,391 --> 02:04:06,130
It's like the guys like mad, like you said
the word to my mom. Like what? In what?

1980
02:04:06,131 --> 02:04:09,910
Who Cares? Really get your car
and drive away and you're right.

1981
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:13,900
I have no defense other than this.
At the end of that fight,

1982
02:04:13,930 --> 02:04:17,380
I was like so ashamed of myself.
Like I was as I like,

1983
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:20,290
the whole point of that bid is that you
can't really win a fight as an adult

1984
02:04:20,291 --> 02:04:23,650
because even if you win, you still feel
like a loser. You know, you're not,

1985
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:26,300
you don't get that triumphant
like playground feeling anymore.

1986
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:30,190
That's not available after 30.
Uh, but my friend Jessie, who,

1987
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:31,360
who I grew up with,

1988
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:36,280
a kid I probably got into a lot of fights
with when we were in middle school. Um,

1989
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:38,160
it's like the,
at the end of the day,

1990
02:04:38,161 --> 02:04:43,161
like we're all a society and humanity
is real but it's also an illusion and a

1991
02:04:44,291 --> 02:04:47,250
mythological,
like a fake thing that we're living in.

1992
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:50,300
In reality we're all like monkeys were,
were,

1993
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:53,490
were Simeon with testosterone
and we're just like,

1994
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:57,030
it's amazing that we don't come at like
sometimes there's just so many people

1995
02:04:57,031 --> 02:05:00,660
around each other that it's inevitable
and in Vr that conflict will occur

1996
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:04,890
between two males and you just have
to hope that your developed enough and

1997
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:08,700
enlightened enough to avoid that,
that you don't like die. Yeah. Yeah.

1998
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,950
Just hates your mommy and Daddy.

1999
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:17,130
That's probably where the rage comes
from. Do you think so? I that I don't,

2000
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:20,550
I think at a certain, at a
certain point, at a certain point,

2001
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:24,000
like avoiding conflict as a skill and
an unnecessary one and one that I'm

2002
02:05:24,001 --> 02:05:26,130
working on in a much better
at than I used to be.

2003
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:30,810
But at a certain point like there is just
a, there is a, there is a testosterone,

2004
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:35,310
a chemical reality that when two
males are in the same zone and they're

2005
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:39,590
challenging each other, like
it's difficult for there
not to be conflict there.

2006
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:43,830
It's possible to not be physical
conflict. And that's not about like, no,

2007
02:05:43,831 --> 02:05:46,440
that's not about your mommy and Daddy,
but your wiring,

2008
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:48,660
that shit when you were
growing up and you're like,

2009
02:05:48,661 --> 02:05:53,100
people used to fucking get on me, dude.
Like that's like your primal, that's your,

2010
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:56,100
your blueprint for the rest of your life.
That's always going to be a trigger.

2011
02:05:56,101 --> 02:05:59,640
You know what's really fucked up about
being good at avoiding conflict is you

2012
02:05:59,641 --> 02:06:00,930
don't feel like a winner.

2013
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:05,490
It's not like when you walk away all peace
and love like brother, it's all good.

2014
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:10,050
Like you owe your lifestyle. I'm a bitch.
I just, Oh, and if you, so if you fight,

2015
02:06:10,051 --> 02:06:13,050
you're an animal. If you
lose your, if you acquiesce,

2016
02:06:13,051 --> 02:06:15,960
you're a bit as hard to be happy.
I get that.

2017
02:06:15,961 --> 02:06:20,050
But I also think you can feel like the
enlightened smarter one who avoids things.

2018
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:24,570
You can and you still feel embarrassed
or I still feel it. Even when I'm in La.

2019
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:28,320
I recently had a conflict with it,
with a person very recently. Uh,

2020
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:29,850
this isn't like a stranger person.

2021
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:33,690
This is a person who was like trying
to get my goat and talking shit and I,

2022
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:38,310
and he was at such a low kind of area in
his life that I could have like really

2023
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,500
kicked a man while he
was down. Yeah. I mean,

2024
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:42,000
it's very easy for Comedians to do that.

2025
02:06:42,001 --> 02:06:45,420
And instead via Natasha and some
other people searching, I was like,

2026
02:06:45,421 --> 02:06:45,661
you know what,

2027
02:06:45,661 --> 02:06:48,900
I'm just going to like walk away from
this and just like check out of this

2028
02:06:48,901 --> 02:06:52,400
interaction. And in the end I
felt like, damn man, you know,

2029
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:56,940
I had all these good comebacks. So it's
like, it's hard to even feel like you win.

2030
02:06:56,941 --> 02:07:00,520
It's gotta be hard cause you're
close with Brent [inaudible].

2031
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:05,640
They're low frequency and they're drunks
at your show. Like it's fucking drunk.

2032
02:07:05,641 --> 02:07:10,500
Pops off dude. I get, I see red. Like I
want to fucking kill you. Relish children.

2033
02:07:10,501 --> 02:07:12,900
I want to fucking kill you. Let's
say you have to remind yourself like,

2034
02:07:12,901 --> 02:07:16,830
this person's life is so shitty that they
started drinking at whatever time they

2035
02:07:16,831 --> 02:07:18,770
came to the show. They're,
you know, they're sabotaging.

2036
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:21,270
That's something to remember about the
Internet too is like the people that are

2037
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:25,910
in common with me on the Internet, just
everybody's upset. What does the jeans,

2038
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:30,210
I know what it is. So what's
wrong mommy? No nothing.

2039
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:35,660
Let's remind people that,
uh, the specialist on
Netflix, if you haven't seen,

2040
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,500
it's fantastic.

2041
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:38,390
Honeyman's standup special.

2042
02:07:38,391 --> 02:07:41,420
most doesn't half hour and then
together we do a live couples roast.

2043
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:44,300
Thank you for saying it
was good. Uh, absolutely.

2044
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:48,470
And you can see them live
after an 11 day RV trip. Yeah.

2045
