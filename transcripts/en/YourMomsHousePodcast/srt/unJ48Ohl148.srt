May 31st and the belly room comedy
stores sold out. Sold out. That's it.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,410
That's how I'm running my Netflix
set right before I go tape it.

9
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:46,910
June 4th and what's Las Vegas for us?

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,800
Oh yeah. What's Las Vegas Moms? Moms,

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,670
penis.
Mom's bedroom.

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,150
Heard it referred to like that
Mom's Vegas. A taping for that.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,190
For the Netflix special.

Use the Promo Code your mom and
you'll get preferential seating.

16
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,470
Just give him a few days to get back to
you. It takes a while. It's free seats,

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,250
but uh, the only way you'll get great
seating is if you put in the code.

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,910
Your mom and Joey Diaz was on that lineup.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,920
They just added Brad Williams and Jay
Oakerson and I can't know the other two

20
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,650
checks the girls are on there. I don't
know them cause we're east coasters,

21
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:31,470
but it's going to be amaze,
amaze.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,500
November 24th in man, Diego, California
at House of Blues and then December 8th,

23
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,720
Jude Dork titties at
the Grammercy theater.

24
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:43,430
Only a handful of tickets left on that
one. Tickets at Christina p online.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,530
Go for it Tom.
It's your turn.

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,470
Oh, so I was just verifying
this and it is true if you, uh,

27
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,660
if you are living in the Braya area,
uh,

28
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:57,880
those shows have been sold out for
a while. But what happened is, uh,

29
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,150
the club is moving down the street still.
Embrya it's still on the same block,

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,000
but they're moving to a much bigger space.

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,430
So they have opened up tickets to
every show because of the new capacity.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,710
So they'll probably go pretty quick. Uh,
the ones that were on sale went fast.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,580
But, uh, if you missed out
on the original tickets,

34
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:24,470
you can go to Thomson [inaudible]
dot com slash tour and get the,

35
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:26,720
um,
tickets to those shows.

36
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:31,170

It's going to be a fun one. Gene.
It's been a long time in the making.

60
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,320
You prepped for this for a long
time. We got a lot going on. Yeah.

61
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,240
You ready to do it?
Yeah, let's get started.

62
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,830
Oh, he's birds. Birds.

63
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,330
Hey people

64
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,800
up a storm out here.

65
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,590
Really look at that shit. Shit. NATO

66
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,780
don't bring anyone loving.
Well Go.

67
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,620
Go to your mom's house.

68
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:42,770
You

69
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,290
know what I'm saying? Yeah. Uh,

70
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,830
that was just a little thing to
get the show started, you know?

71
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,250
Right in our wheel house. A lot of shit.
You know what I'm saying? Excited voice.

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,690
But um, yeah, today's going to be fun.
We had a lot to get into. First of all,

73
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,710
can we get into the your jacket?
Yeah. What's up? First of all,

74
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:05,360
are you Ukrainian? Are you Sullivanian?
Are You Hungarian? Like what?

75
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,260
What's the look you're going for is all
that Slavic? I'm a dope producer. Yo.

76
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:12,770
You know what I'm saying? This is so my
tribe right now, I'm really feeling it.

77
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,290
Maybe, I don't know. I feel
like it's just, you know,

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,920
up folk came through through
me up motherfucking dope
jacket and I've put it on

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,120
what's the flag of what a former
rush Soviet countries that,

80
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,850
I don't know what that is.
Which satellite country.

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,850
I think I saw a Dominican guy wearing
it. I was like, where'd you get that?

82
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,360
It's pretty dove though. Yeah, I like it.

83
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:36,170
I mean it's definitely loud and makes a
lot of statements. No word on a plane.

84
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,630
People we're definitely
noticing. Yeah. Jesus guy.

85
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,200
If you wore that to Hungary and Matt,
like my relatives and friends,

86
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,920
they'd be like that. That's a good jacket.
This is nice. This is good stuff here.

87
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:50,330
No good. Jagat you leave that behind.
Maybe you're like house music.

88
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,930
Absolutely. Like house music to, uh,

89
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,040
I remember when I worked with
a German and she was like,

90
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,240
how come nobody likes house music?
And I was like, I don't know.

91
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,330
It's not 1994 talking about we're
Americans. And then she was like,

92
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,910
once it was dancing, this
playground, house music, good luck.

93
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,570
Take that foreign shit out man.
When I was in Madrid for a semester,

94
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,040
every,
every club like the UK,

95
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,823
uh,

96
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,900
Hungary to booming everywhere.
The UK, they love that Shit.

97
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,883
It,

98
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,940
it was good. I know that never
really took off here though.

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,930
Something about that sensibility
is not, I dunno, it's not,

100
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,040
it's not as like they're,
it feels ma that's mainstream.

101
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,310
That's what people are into.
If you're young, if you're
cool, that's what you like.

102
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,690
And here it wasn't like that. Now it's
too, I don't know. But then again,

103
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:58,150
we liked that club music.
People like, you know,

104
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,500
people would do drugs and they
raves and stuff like that was cool,

105
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:07,330
but I don't know how I'm at attach. What
do I know? I know. I don't know anything.

106
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,830
We're, um, we're, we're basically
lost on our television shows.

107
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,800
You know what's so funny is that as
we're sitting here recording now,

108
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,970
all I can think about,

109
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:19,480
it's like when can we go back upstairs
and put the TV on and finish where we

110
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:24,100
left off? I know there's so many good
shows we're into right now. Well,

111
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,840
here's what happens is we dry up,

112
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,110
the well dries up and
then I find the TLC APP.

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,200
What happens is the well dries up on
really amazing award winning television.

114
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,140
Other words,
scripted mega shows that are phenomenal,

115
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,190
like coming to an end on the Americans
set that were kind of talking on the

116
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,580
marriage. He never got into the
Americans. You want to deep dive,

117
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:49,480
you'll have six seasons. So good. Uh,

118
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:53,830
we're watching Handmaid's tale tale
is really picking up a thank God.

119
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:58,060
There's finally hope. I was about to
commit suicide a couple episodes back.

120
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,930
So now we're, we're having some help and
I'm stoked. We're really, really fired up.

121
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,820
It's, it's good. It's, I mean,
this, this last ending was
just like Bam. I love that.

122
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,170
I kind of reminds me of when one of
those shows where you go, well, all,

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,311
I don't want to give it away,

124
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:15,010
but it's like when you're
watching one of the amazing,

125
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:19,900
like a breaking bad and something
central that you're used to changes,

126
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:23,440
all of a sudden you're like, I going
to go from here. I Know Sopranos,

127
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:26,730
like a character's just out of
the picture. You're like, what?

128
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:30,100
What's going to happen now? They
just really fucked shit up. Um,

129
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,250
I'm super excited for hand
jobs help. But anyways, we get,

130
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,510
we run through these shows and so then
you're great at finding the filler shows,

131
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,850
the um, the outliers,
the marginalized shows.

132
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,850
We'll tip our hat and
just tell the network Tlc,

133
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
you have really outdone yourself.
If you have an apple TV,

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,620
I recommend just going and getting the
TLC APP and just scrolling their reality

135
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,600
reality lineup. There's like,
it's a joke. It's a fucking joke,

136
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,720
but it's so good that dwarves,

137
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,160
it's called big and little big and little.
That's about fat dwarves dwarves,

138
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,420
which I heard I fell asleep. But you
said it wasn't as funny as we know.

139
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,990
It was way, way more depressing
than I thought it would be. See,

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,270
that's the problem with Tlc is they
get you, they get the empathy. Yeah.

141
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,310
Like I don't want to be empathetic.
I want to laugh.

142
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,400
I want to enjoy my fat dwarves,
you know,

143
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:28,250
and then you got me feeling for them like
Oh my God dammit. And then there was a,

144
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,650
yeah there's, they have a whole
bunch of fat stuff like that.

145
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,310
I lost all the fat and
now my skin hangs off me.

146
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,850
It's called like skin tight on that one.
And that was depressing too.

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,380
It's also hard to watch.

148
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,950
And then there's a

149
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,320
satin alive fat and Catlin
that family and yeah,

150
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,860
just all kinds of fat shit. Yeah. And
then they have a lot of gender stuff,

151
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,130
you know, I don't watch that cause
I feel bad it's a little kid.

152
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,710
But then there's one now that we are
really deep into called lost in transition

153
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,840
and I know it is so
captivating. The premises,

154
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,190
there are married couples that
had been married for a while.

155
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,020
I mean we're talking anywhere from
like eight to sometimes 30 years.

156
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,000
Multiple children, established
relationships, children for most.

157
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,870
And in each of these marriages the
man has told the woman did he wants to

158
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,990
transition to a woman.
And I mean you are really,

159
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,410
it is like jumping into a household
and seeing the biggest bomb drop in a

160
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,170
relationship.
You're,

161
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,970
you're literally getting to peek in to
a private life and seeing somebody go,

162
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,660
I am going to blow up what we have been
used to for three decades and thing is

163
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,710
the interesting part is that the trans
part isn't that interesting to me anymore

164
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,900
because I feel like we've seen
so many shows and we're kind of,

165
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,290
we have a better understanding of that.
The reactions,

166
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,760
the way people handle it.
It's the emotional drama.

167
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,910
That's calculus and
there's this one couple,

168
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,860
they've been married 24 years.
They have three children or four,

169
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,080
which, which won the Ohio
woman who's like just the most,

170
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,190
they have to come off
her whole dream in life.

171
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,170
The one that's married to my dad
basically. Yeah. The husband is like,

172
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,430
he's got a belly, he's got the
traditional bald, like horseshoe.

173
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,010
He just looks like one of
my dad's golfing friends.

174
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,030
Never going to be a good looking
woman. It's that guy, probably not.

175
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,460
And he's just like,
ah.

176
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,290
And he's so happy that it's that
he's told her back it up. No,

177
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,220
the bagging of the best

178
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,830
part is that she is like,
I mean,

179
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:01,831
all I ever wanted in life was to get
married and have children and have a house

180
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,440
and go to the hobby lobby on Saturday.
Like her, she's very simple. Yeah.

181
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:09,040
All she wanted out of life was the house,
the husband,

182
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,720
like the lionfish paddling and
she did the life that she wanted.

183
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,890
She's living the life that she wanted,
but he drops it on her one night.

184
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:21,850
She's like, and then, and then you see,

185
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,500
you see real, I mean, devastation
that, not that he's doing it.

186
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,030
It's that life is now not,
it's changing.

187
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,820
And so then they're like, what
are they going to do? Like what?

188
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,440
We're going to get divorced
and get separate places.

189
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,300
He is like flipping pancakes.
And he's like, we sure are.

190
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,620
And he's like cleaning up, cleaning
up shit in the garage. And he's like,

191
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,290
I cannot fucking wait for you.

192
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,270
And they're sitting there in this
interview and, uh, he's like,

193
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,500
he's like, you know, it was so hard
to tell her. He's like, but you know,

194
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,480
here I was my whole life,
you know,

195
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,770
my wedding day and the birth of our
children and I was just so devastated and

196
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:07,771
miserable guess cause he knew that he
was trans from day from why they got

197
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:10,980
married and he just couldn't come out
and he couldn't say anything and he was

198
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,940
like, I was so devastated.
And I'm like, Oh God, I'm so
miserable. And she was like,

199
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,330
that's so hurtful to hear
dates.

200
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,120
What? Like she's clearly
like, wait a minute. Those
are the best days of my life.

201
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:28,390
The birth of our children are, oh
no, no, not mine. It's not mine.

202
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,150
The best part is that,
like you said, he's one,

203
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:35,530
he's flipping the pancakes and she's like,
I've never been on my own before.

204
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,350
And he's like, Yep, it's going to
be tight. Not a lot of money. Yeah.

205
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't even know how to balance my
checkbook a separate place. So he's like,

206
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,710
the budget really going to be tight
so you're not the not splurge anyway.

207
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,220
I'm going to go out
so great.

208
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,840
He doesn't give a fuck.
I think he's so relieved to come out.

209
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,510
I mean you could tell the
way it is off of off of them.

210
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:03,460
And then there's this other woman who's
this really educated like engineer and

211
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:07,840
she's in her fifties and um,
and she doesn't understand.

212
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,770
She doesn't get it at all. He's
just gay and it's a choice. No,

213
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,530
she thinks he's like, I want
to go to Cabo. You can't,

214
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:20,740
we can't do it. She's like, do
you understand if you do this,

215
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,770
it'll fuck shit up between us. And he's
like, yeah, do you understand that?

216
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,330
She's like, you're so selfish. No,
really doesn't comprehend that.

217
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:31,840
It's like a brain thing and he really
does need to do this to feel whole.

218
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,390
He doesn't, she doesn't get it. No,

219
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,170
but actually that's kind
of fascinating to watch,

220
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:39,450
to be back to it because you know that
everybody, not everybody, but that,

221
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:44,451
that generation probably empathizes like
shares her set point of view that it's

222
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,180
kind of voluntary maybe.
Well it's generational.

223
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,740
Probably be like, yeah, these guys
choosing to be a warmer, come on by the,

224
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,090
or now you're choosing it.

225
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,860
They just don't have like the
same empathy and understanding.

226
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:01,720
So to watch her spiral has
just been fantastic too. Um,

227
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,740
and then her friend comes over who is
like the know it all and who's intervening

228
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,950
in their marriage and you're like, bitch,
why are you, are you meeting or anything?

229
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,630
And she's like, I am not
a lesbian. I don't like,

230
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,620
I'm not gay.
Cause then she's really out of it.

231
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,780
I'll be living with a woman then
and I don't like women like that.

232
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,260
She keeps saying that over. She likes
penises and this isn't the house.

233
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,560
It's so great. What a
great show. Great show.

234
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,330
Kind of wonder what,
what, what would you do?

235
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,730
Fucking I would, I would have to
be committed like I love, but I,

236
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,860
you know, cause I really do
think about this seriously.

237
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:43,280
Not We watching like I love you so much
that I would stand by you clearly and

238
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,031
I'd be like,
okay,

239
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:49,031
well we'll transition you and you
can live with us and braise our kids.

240
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:53,060
But like I may have to have a boyfriend,
I may have to step out.

241
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,280
Well we can't do it anymore.
You're not a man, you'll,

242
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,420
you're gonna transition and
you're probably not going
to be very attractive as a

243
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,770
woman. Let's face it.
It's also very hurtful.

244
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,120
You're going to be the ugliest woman that
dial it back a little. No, I'm serious.

245
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:11,390
You're not meant to be a woman.
Like your shoulders are too broad.

246
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,540
You have so much hair.
Could you imagine,

247
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,150
although the hormones will make
the hair fall out, I think,

248
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,340
I think that that'd be a pretty cute,
you'd be horrendous as a woman.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,570
What would you do if I was like,
I'm a man. Oh, I'd be so into it.

250
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,400
That would be, it would be, I think I,

251
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,890
I love you like that to where I'd be like,

252
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,210
we have that spare room and that
can be yours. And uh, you know,

253
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,730
if you start lifting,
we can start sharing clothes

254
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,840
and then you can get your second
Dalmatian wife like you want. Oh my God.

255
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,760
Can you imagine her and you and me
living together how the fuck would be,

256
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,460
can I say something?
I kind of would just to,

257
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:53,130
for the sake of the family and be like,
I'll just raise our kids.

258
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:56,040
And what would have the kids call
Dalmatian though? Just by her first name.

259
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,370
Just what are they going to call me?
They'll be like, Daddy, daddy and Daddy.

260
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,200
Yeah. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
daddy and Jenny now that,

261
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,500
so he's a boy is so you, me,
misty. She wouldn't be named Jenny.

262
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,060
Boring.
Yeah.

263
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,040
Misty Crystal Shandy.

264
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,090
Be Mommy to him for a while and he'd be,
it'd be hard to break it for him.

265
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,550
He's so young. Or maybe he
would start calling. We did.

266
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,060
We just have him call you your new name.
What would be your dude name?

267
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,420
Um, that's tough. It's so hard to
choose. I choose like a regular name when

268
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,780
that, when the one woman, the,
the lady who's not ready for it,

269
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:33,210
who's older and goes,
so do you have a name?

270
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:38,100
Like a woman's name that
you've always wanted so much
contempt. He was like, yeah.

271
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,960
She was like, what is it? He was
like, Lucy from, I love Lucy.

272
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,230
I love that show. And she goes, I fucking
hate that name. It's a stupid name.

273
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,250
Suzanne.
Cool about

274
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,730
it. And then there's other, they've
been together for 14 years now.

275
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,200
They're the ones that for kids.
Yeah.

276
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,430
And they live in a cul de sac where
everybody knows everyone's business and

277
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:03,330
she's really trying to hold it together
with him, even though he's transitioning.

278
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,470
And you can tell she's just eating those
feelings. Like she's getting fatter,

279
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,760
fatter every year.

280
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,770
I have a special treat for you that I
want to get all before I guess arrives.

281
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,870
Sure. So for people who
may have missed last week,

282
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:20,871
so a Christina is taping another
Netflix special called the degenerates.

283
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,470
Yes. Uh, Joey Diaz is doing
it, at least a Trager trigger.

284
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,070
And that's her name. Yes. Jay
Oakerson, Brad Williams. Williams.

285
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,300
I'm forgetting somebody else,
but one other woman who I
don't know. Um, but anyway,

286
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,230
it's a great lineup. It's in Las
Vegas. You had been, you know,

287
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,530
running your material, getting ready
for it. I thought as a gift, um,

288
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
because you're my wife that,
uh,

289
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,960
I could just go ahead and throw out
there some joke ideas. She's four years.

290
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,110
So what I wanted to do was create
this moment where we have you run this

291
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,680
material right now, cold.
You don't know what it is.

292
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,750
I just wrote it for you and uh, you just
read it and like fucking serious, right?

293
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,550
Yeah. Yeah. You wrote something
for me? Yeah. Isn't that nice?

294
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,110
I already know what it is.
Just don't know.

295
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,860
I don't even say I was saying like,
I think it's not going to guess it's,

296
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,200
I think it's helpful. Okay.
Um, and the, you know,

297
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,580
it's a spouse trying to help a spouse.

298
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:27,581
So I'll go ahead and play the MC and
then you go ahead and do the bit.

299
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,180
Okay. And fully commit. Please clarify.
All right. And coming to the stage.

300
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,190
Now Ladies and gentlemen,

301
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,720
put your hands together
for Christina. P. Yeah.

302
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,800
Okay, go ahead. Hair.
Um, you like big tits?

303
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,740
Well, I got um, check out these milkers.

304
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,920
These are tits so far,
so good town.

305
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,790
I call this one Milwaukee and this one,
green bay.

306
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,320
These are ripe for all your dairy meat.

307
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,103
Yeah.

308
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,960
Milk. You got it. Cheese, yogurt.

309
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,880
Could you give me till tomorrow?

310
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,530
Why
me?

311
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,420
Okay.
Look at me.

312
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,000
Look at this bitch over here.
She got some tiny little Hungary.

313
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:31,110
Ted's damn bitch.
You got a gluten allergy or something?

314
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,153
Thanks.

315
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,960
Eat a sandwich.
Skinny little bit.

316
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,893
Sure.

317
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,350
Okay. But you think this is my
voice, like this is how I tell jokes.

318
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,950
Yes. This is your impression of my
aunt. Just keep going. You're killing.

319
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,490
Oh my gosh. Okay. Um,

320
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,040
you're looking up here at these
big old tits and you're wondering,

321
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,470
is that the only big thing on
her? Nope. I got a big puss too.

322
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,530
You can park and an F-150,

323
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,140
a Silverado and a ram in there
and let motor trend decide,

324
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,550
which is the truck of the year.

325
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,190
You know what sad is that like these
are actually decent jokes, like,

326
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,570
like your yearly, you can't
just stop. Okay. Okay. Oh yeah.

327
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,880
My second kid is about to wreck the shop.

328
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:30,500
My Pussy is in the twin towers and these
babies are hijackers number one and two.

329
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,570
Al Qaeda.
You done fucked up downtown again.

330
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,190
Oh,

331
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,400
I love America.
Good night.

332
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,250
[inaudible].

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,720
I'm glad you saved it with that last
line because they were upset about you're

334
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:59,820
insensitive job, but good job. I mean,

335
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:04,620
I have to say like the jokes were
actually pretty well constructed. I'm,

336
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:05,660
I'm upset.
Yeah.

337
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,940
I put a lot of time with my second kid is
about to wreck the shot. My postseason,

338
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,990
my pussy is the twin towers and these
babies are hijackers number one and two.

339
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,770
Can I use that? That's pretty good. I
actually liked that. Okay. Oh good. Wow.

340
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,640
Al Qaeda, you done fucked up
downtown again. Yeah. Wow.

341
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,960
How long did this take to
ride this material from you?
About a 35 to 45 seconds.

342
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,900
Look at this bitch over here.

343
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,420
She got some tiny little hungry.
Ted's damn bitch.

344
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,880
You got a gluten allergy or something?
Eat a sandwich. Skinny little bitch.

345
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,840
I have a, I could just hear you in my
head as I was writing this. Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,610
So I just, from what I'm hearing,
you want me to focus more on my tits?

347
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,260
I mean, I think, I think
that's natural. Yeah.

348
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,700
And talk about what you know, that's what
you're saying. Right? What did, you know?

349
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,990
Wow, these are really
great. So what I'm gonna do,

350
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:04,770
I'm just going to practice tonight and
see if it goes well and then I'll let you

351
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,470
know. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, you've
been doing a lot of sets around town.

352
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,250
I think it'd be great if you even said,
uh, my husband wrote some stuff for me.

353
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,300
Jesus Christ. Here's some new stuff I'm
working on. You just pull it out. Yeah.

354
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,200
The sad thing is even your bad jokes are
pretty funny. Oh, thanks. Yeah. I mean,

355
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:23,730
not the eat a sandwich. You Skinny
Bitch or the yogurt lines. Great.

356
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,680
And how about Milwaukee and green bay? See
the, those are, uh, all those are right.

357
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:33,540
Dairy towns. Those are cities in Wisconsin
dairy state. Right. Gotcha. Gotcha.

358
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
Okay. Yeah. Feel free to swap them out.

359
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:40,730
You want to call them Madison and Osh
Kosh or whatever? Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,460
That's a really good, thanks. You're
welcome. Anyways, people can see you.

361
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:46,010
They probably, I'm, it's already all sold

362
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,420
out, but uh, it was just Ellie's
gone. No, no, I'm talking about

363
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
in Vegas. Uh, I don't know because they
give out those tickets last minute. Oh,

364
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,950
do that. No. Should the sign up is already
pretty full on. It's pre, pre done.

365
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,660
And everybody did. Yeah, he did
really great. When did you do this?

366
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:07,640
There's so funny yesterday. Very
talented. Thanks. Oh, that's not bad.

367
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,920
These aren't terrible. I think it's so
funny that you're complementing it. Well,

368
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,210
I can see good joke writing. I mean
the structure is really good. Yeah.

369
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,040
My Pussy is the twin towers and these
babies are hijackers number one and two.

370
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,800
That's really funny actually.
I do like it.

371
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,310
I know you done fucked up downtown
again. I like that too. It's a little,

372
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:30,910
it's a little black sounding
for me really. Well,

373
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:35,290
I don't say you done fucked up again.
You can change the phrasing you done.

374
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,210
You fucked up downtown and get traffic's
fucked up again. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah,

375
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,800
it was really special.
Thanks Tom.

376
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,460
I'm really proud of it and I think you're
going to have a great set as long as

377
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:47,500
you stick to exactly what I wrote.

378
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,240
Okay. Yeah. Um,

379
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,900
okay. Why don't we just take
a moment here because, uh,

380
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:59,140
our guests should be arriving shortly
and I want to eat something real quick

381
00:24:59,141 --> 00:25:00,790
after. Usually after.
I know after a big set,

382
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:05,320
I like to kind of chill for days
after killing Linus. I'm exhausted.

383
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,240
Yeah. All right, well here we go.

384
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,450
We are back in.
People's big dream has come true.

385
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,620
The last time was such a massive success.
Uh,

386
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,760
we never expected it to go.
I mean we always expect to go well,

387
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,160
but it definitely
exceeded our expectations.

388
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,490
We have in marking our to drew list as
it is called since the full list of video

389
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,000
just for you.
He is back doctor

390
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,150
the body pens.
I'm so happy to be here.

391
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:42,010
I'm so excited now showing the guns
off with a guest who you may introduce.

392
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:44,890
Yes. My wife, Susan's sitting
behind this. She may yet come in.

393
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:47,640
I've just mostly excited that she
gets to see the videos with me. Yeah.

394
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,530
So experience these things
with me. Uh, she didn't,

395
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,280
she didn't seem to understand
the importance of the,

396
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,120
the farts to you guys and the
blue are kids at breakfast.

397
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,470
Our kids are visiting us this weekend.

398
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,990
They all came around because
my daughter's in town and uh,

399
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:04,170
they mentioned at breakfast I was
told them I was coming over there.

400
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,660
All that talks. I'm so excited.
They talk about poo a lot, you know,

401
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,790
uh,
about one of the,

402
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,490
we have a lot of things we want to show
you clips that we've been playing since

403
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,550
you've been on and get your take on that.
But some people you don't understand. I,

404
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,621
I used to get my,

405
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,530
I have to get prostate biopsies regularly
for my prostate cancer and I would

406
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:26,740
sort of breaking a sweat just walking
around and you're all just off this fuel.

407
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,530
Just like that was exactly like that.

408
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,190
Except we're going to
shoot him a fucking needle.

409
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,580
I bring load of beer.
Plosive yeah.

410
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:39,520
What is your anxiety? I don't know. On
a scale of one to 10 about an eight,

411
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,590
what are the first things,
I guess we'll get this out of the way.

412
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:46,190
Somebody emailed and
they wanted us to wait.

413
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,040
Let me just first say how happy I
am to be here. Good to see you guys.

414
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,940
And I and I,

415
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,270
last time I was a little disoriented and
it took me a while to figure out what

416
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:58,520
the hell was going on. But
now I feel like I, you know,

417
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,230
I know you guys better and
I've been out of your house.

418
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:05,940
I've used your tushy toilet seat.
Did you use it,

419
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:10,380
use it or are you just, I just, it'd
be held. Behold the tushy toilets.

420
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,660
I mean the name just south of La.
I got a new one.

421
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,150
We're actually swapping it out.

422
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,550
The new one gets said we've got
to get curls dinner together.

423
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,120
I know we did since we last ride day,

424
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,580
we've got to get crawl over here to test
these things because he says, you know,

425
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:31,070
cleaning his mass is like trying to take
peanut butter out of shag carpet. Yeah.

426
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,070
And so, so this would be, this
could be really important for him.

427
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,420
It's very much like that. Go with
it. And have you tried it before?

428
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,230
I've used those before. Yes. I've,

429
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:46,260
I use the what's now the London
and New York used to be the,

430
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,551
I forget what it's called,

431
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:52,551
but it was it sort of a Japanese own
thing and the right and you know we got

432
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:57,270
into these because we rented a
house for a year from Japanese.

433
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,800
They figured this stuff out.
She had the toto washlet

434
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,900
but she had it hooked up in her house.
It sounds like it's up to a generator.

435
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,050
It's so effected us that when we bought
this house we immediately were like,

436
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,110
day one.
We need to

437
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,250
go back and tell him. I'm
just imagining, here you go.

438
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:22,560
You got a lot of stuff going on up here.
Yeah,

439
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,570
it's a lot going on again
to quote Corolla, it's like
trying to find Santa Claus.

440
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:28,404
His mouth down there.

441
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,670
He's been asking me to eat his scrum,

442
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,483
her

443
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,790
to make out with my butthole,
you know,

444
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,340
and like Bay Bay that with her tongue.

445
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,250
Well you know it's going to be clean
because you've had the tushy thing.

446
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,640
Can we wait till she's not
practicing something very weird.

447
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,160
I mean I worry about what the holdup is.
I could make a case.

448
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,820
You're ready against it, please.
Is the case is that, you know,

449
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:07,030
we got a homeless problem here in Los
Angeles and there's a lot of them saying

450
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:12,031
to ask a homeless person to do a lot
of fecal contamination of our water and

451
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:15,400
that oral fecal transmission of disease,

452
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,950
it can be really problematic
for a pregnant lady.

453
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,370
And so if you just happen to go buy one
of those encampments and volatilized

454
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:24,970
Norovirus, get into your nasal
passage, that stuff's going to be,

455
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,800
I stay away from those places. I
understand that. I just thought it,

456
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,990
but that's one of the
arguments against it. Well,

457
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,450
that's the only accurate I can think of.

458
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,850
Otherwise I just worry
about pregnant women.

459
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:38,260
I just don't want them to go once
she wants to. She delivered game on.

460
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,130
Thank you doctor [inaudible]
especially with your devices. I mean,

461
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:42,990
what do you got to worry about?

462
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,690
I'll just do it like the squat and
sit and get it over kind of quick.

463
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:51,320
You don't know where she lies on her back
over her squat down on her face. Weird.

464
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,920
What about antiseptic,
sir?

465
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,140
You're only watering your be whole still
fills the Clorox wipes or something.

466
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:01,870
You know rocks. Why? But he's
willing to do it for you.

467
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,720
My Dad wipes with those Clorox
wipes, double kill everything. Well,

468
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,280
he said,
I don't have any bottle age now,

469
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,530
so no cost to me now and nobody,

470
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,480
somebody calls out your theory.
Which one?

471
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,010
I'm going to show it to you. Okay,
let's do it. Gosh. Uh, hey dog hunts.

472
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,690
The episode of Dr Drew May have been one
of the best I ever heard on your mom's

473
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:35,610
house. However, I do feel that doctor
drew did make one egregious claim weight.

474
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,490
I couldn't sit back and
accept. Yeah, absolutely.

475
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:44,491
Pushes out the farts inspired by his
hot take and the claim by my beloved

476
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:46,900
girlfriend Jean,
that I may fart too much.

477
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:51,280
I set out on a personal case study
to inspect my own farming habits.

478
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:52,031
Even pregnant.

479
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:56,740
You're still good with this gesture on
supposed to make you want to vomit. Good.

480
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,320
The best part is that we're asking
a man who so overqualified. I know.

481
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,470
Well,
listen to what this guy said.

482
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:08,890
He goes after farts never gets
old when you're a boy, a man.

483
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,210
After keeping a detailed daily
journal for over three weeks,

484
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,620
a fart counts and patterns.

485
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,180
I found an introspective study into
your fire and Brown habits can be quite

486
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,910
light. Oh, that's interesting. First I
found that I fart about 17 times a day,

487
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,560
which by many standards is
above a little bit. Yeah,

488
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,530
it feels good to be above
average at something.

489
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,090
Even if this means I may be
more statistically likely
to clear you to actually

490
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:34,470
deliver. Right now you're going 17

491
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,450
healthy movement. Second, I
found after a fudge baby birth,

492
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:45,220
my farts were relatively dormant and
less agitated by food or another brown.

493
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,690
In my findings,

494
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:51,220
a looming brown was always good for
several warning blast until the log was

495
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:54,370
dropped and subsequently cut
by my urine and conclusion.

496
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,970
I can say with confidence,
poop does push the farts out.

497
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:02,040
When you're pushing poops out, farts
get pushed out to, come on now.

498
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,590
Talk me up. I mean, this is
Billie Jean who wrote in for that.

499
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,950
It's got to be true.
But

500
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,830
I mean this is a great advancement
in the world of scientific clinical

501
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:16,840
observation.
And I'm so grateful

502
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,800
I, you know, I, maybe I didn't
get into it deep enough last time.

503
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,180
Where'd it go further?

504
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,010
Which is that everybody's
a little different when it
comes to their farts. Okay.

505
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,933
Okay.

506
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,440
I mean we're having a serious
conversation is the best thing.

507
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,690
Just bodily form have somebody so cool.
So here's the deal.

508
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,130
Some of it is from swallowed air, right?
Some people are very prone to that.

509
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,930
They swallow that area.
It really gets through.

510
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,290
But there's other people that it's the
bacterial gas production than I tragedies

511
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,240
splitting of nitrogen by
the bacteria in the colon.

512
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,680
And that's what gives the smell and but
also at some people produce the gas too.

513
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,850
So some people, it's what they
eat. And with the bacterial Sorta,

514
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,070
the colonic sort of bacterial
flora is doing right and what that,

515
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,160
what that floor is doing.
I can it be effected by bulk and stuff.

516
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:14,300
He had a lot of good bulk in your diet.

517
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:17,670
You might be sort of quieting things down
a little bit. But if you're balanced,

518
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:22,400
stirred, and even at the right
locations, fiber, farmers, citrucel,

519
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,180
metamucil,

520
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,410
stuff like that issue and that you gotta
keep well now with all that in your

521
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:31,400
body and your abdomen, don't you have
to keep things kind of vegetables

522
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,940
for a praying lady?
I take amazing.

523
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,850
Is it time for me then you have to get
harassed. Burt before you eat yours.

524
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,820
I've done it. I've done
it. Okay, that's good.

525
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,790
It's a lot cleaner and as a man
we really don't. We sorta like,

526
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:53,190
okay, let's go. Let's go. What do you like
us to do? All right, where do we do it?

527
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:56,160
You want it to really shower?
He just did it.

528
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,240
And also like more than once. Let's
not say like I did it. Yeah. So shoves.

529
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:07,220
He liked it. So why do you think
she'd return the face once in a while?

530
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,870
I mean the state, the state, sort of
my inner dialogue coming out, I get it,

531
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,980
but know sort of standing over her sounds
like you're going to produce something

532
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:19,300
more than
just super freak her out.

533
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,150
Why don't we start like
never shower something easy.

534
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:26,860
I'm thinking maybe in the change my diet
position laying on my back. Yeah, yeah,

535
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,010
yeah,
yeah.

536
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,560
I can get in the dog for you dog.
Hideous.

537
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,490
I look hideous in all day and just not
a good guy with what women put aside to

538
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:46,580
love their mad, just let me
know. I know it's not fair.

539
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,480
It's really both of us got these wonderful
looking women and which like what are

540
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:54,320
they doing? Well, it's a matter with
them. I also think like I'm, you know,

541
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,660
I'm not the greatest at this,

542
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:01,661
but I know people who are so some guys
who are so far down the line on there

543
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,260
physically so unappealing and they
have these standards where you're like,

544
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,160
are you insane? Why do they
like it's offensive. Yeah.
They're like, no fat chicks,

545
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,740
Bro.
I'm like your three 50 this is biological.

546
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,410
Yes. Do you really want to hear it? Well,

547
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,740
it's that the way we've evolved is males,

548
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,550
if you evolutionary biological,

549
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,120
sort of an evolutionary psychology sort
of descriptions are sort of just so

550
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,401
right,

551
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:33,200
because you can't really study them
because there's no way to turn back the

552
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:37,610
clock. Right. Where the people haven't
found great ways to study it. So,

553
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,320
and please don't tell me all the
different ways that people do steady.

554
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:42,360
I know there's things out there to help.
I understand this.

555
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:44,340
So males have generally,

556
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:48,810
because we don't have to invest
so much biologically in a child,

557
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:51,270
we could just drop and go drop it go.

558
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,250
Which is what your new anal play.
There's going to be called

559
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,170
scrum master,
Christina.

560
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,553
Uh,

561
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,660
we tend to be more interested in
fertility for Kennedy and health and so

562
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:12,510
genetic, genetic, uh, you know, good
genes we're looking for good. Yeah.

563
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,930
And the females also are looking for
that and sort of have a different

564
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:20,470
relationship with guys that give them
the good genes but are mostly looking for

565
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,010
guys that can provide resources and
stability in an environment where yeah,

566
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,080
we're a child could be brought
on. Yeah. Yeah. Thus the house,

567
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:29,790
the Fart pill.

568
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,700
Yeah. Safety's last name means
a Segura is what? Safety safe.

569
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,600
Sure. Yeah. That was his dad though.
Not, yeah, that's true. Yeah.

570
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,560
But he's much like his father,
which is wow.

571
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,050
Yeah. You've mentioned, yeah, you did.
Like you do? Like is that better than him?

572
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Well, I've said that. He just
texted me. He let me see. He did.

573
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,640
Oh, he just facetime yesterday facetimed
me from a handicap stall. Uh, he was like,

574
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,630
look how much room I have this
shit in here. Where'd you get that?

575
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,270
Where'd you get the way you are?
I don't understand it. Yeah.

576
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,070
It's hard to figure out. Um, I want
to jump right in. Jump right in. This,

577
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:04,904
we have so much.

578
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,740
You do. I've tried it. I've
tried to like smoke screen.

579
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,960
We're going to ease into it. Okay.
Yeah. That's what you said last time.

580
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,960
First one of those words,
the first one that was in the news.

581
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:20,790
You may have caught wind of this one,
but I just wanted to get your take on it.

582
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,900
This lady who you may or may not
have heard about recently in the news

583
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,510
guys, this woman says she came
from Florida to find love.

584
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,040
Now she claims a man she's accused of
stalking is her soul mate because of her

585
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:38,041
superstitious beliefs and a particular
number following the number 33 I used to

586
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:42,610
wake up every day and every night at
three 33 was always three 33 three

587
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,840
Jacqueline Claire added

588
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,680
tied to the number 33?
No,

589
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,670
this woman went from Florida.
How did you, you know this story?

590
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,690
She texted this man who she had gone on
one date with 65,000 times I heard about

591
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,870
the or something like that.
Um, and then they, you know,

592
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:04,130
they arrested her and then she actually,

593
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:07,670
they gave her like a mini press
conference, which I thought was unusual,

594
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:12,280
but why Tom? She seems fine. Welcome to
the world of world news now. Yeah. Yeah.

595
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,530
Your, your show is going to become
a major news outlets. Don't worry.

596
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,090
That's what led her right

597
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,910
to a paradise valley businessman.
She met on the dating app. Look,

598
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,450
then I find out he does stuff with the
Dead Sea. The Dead Sea has 33% salt in it.

599
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,200
The common ground between the two.
Same birthday,

600
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,260
convincing her even more
that he's her match.

601
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,430
Oh boy. Do you think that something's
going on with her? It's no perfectly

602
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,230
normal. Perfectly natural. But are
you talking about Tom, we just,

603
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,530
you just told me you want to stand over
your wife with your pants on with this

604
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:48,820
lady. Cause I feel like the
eyes are very revealing.

605
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:53,440
Very right. You see that right?

606
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:56,200
So there's a psychotic process,
right?

607
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,710
She's not connected to reality and there's
a sort of an OCD thing going on here.

608
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,750
I feel a little guilty talking about this
one cause I'm going to give a talk on

609
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,910
stigma and Oct.
I'll write him a couple of months,

610
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:10,750
maybe around the same week
you air this thing. Uh,

611
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,900
and so I hate to make fun of this
woman as you guys make fun. We will.

612
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,940
I know it makes me feel bad, but the, the,

613
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,950
the inability to stop the preoccupations
you see it just rolls and rolls and

614
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:27,340
expands and expands and this kind of a
psychotic process to it, right? She's,

615
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,440
she doesn't even like sort of acknowledge
that this is a problem here. Right. Uh,

616
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,690
and then the obsessive compulsive quality
to it and then the compulsive behavior

617
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:39,720
of texting a billion times, that kind
of thing. She's medication. Yeah.

618
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,120
Very bad thing.

619
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,640
Maybe maybe the separate call
exposure between the two birthday,

620
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:52,000
convincing her court documents reveal.
She texted him 65

621
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,400
many of those messages show disturbing
delusions of murder also to,

622
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,770
to process. Like if
somebody said, you know,

623
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:05,800
you did the 65,000 times and she
responded with it. That's it.

624
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,970
I thought it was more like, so she's
not connected. Yeah. Not In this world.

625
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,650
Yeah. And then then they, they
called it delusional, you know,

626
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,330
the newspaper just said
that and she's right.

627
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,100
This is a delusion delusional person.
Yeah.

628
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,480
So mid the sometimes schizophrenia can
have certain amount of OCD type quality

629
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,600
to it. That was voting.
Yeah. What it meant,

630
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:29,230
the idea that these are the
newscasters are treating her like news.

631
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,470
Like, oh no. Like she's rational.
Like asking her these questions,

632
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,100
she's going to act rashly when they
know she's not. Yeah. I always,

633
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:40,090
I am very disturbed by the
lack of sophistication when
it comes to mental health.

634
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,310
That, you know, I mean, it's
like, honey, have you been, Ooh,

635
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,450
behave even.

636
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,660
Here's the questions you would
ask somebody that you go,

637
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,900
have you been hospitalized before?
Have you been able to manage work?

638
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:55,330
Have you had, do you have
[inaudible] Jeff obtrusive thoughts?

639
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,850
Have you ever thought that these things
might be problematic as opposed to

640
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,270
really, you love him? Tell us about
that. Like, can you fucking kidding me?

641
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:02,170
He's like,
give me a break.

642
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:06,040
That's what we were kind of amused by
as the press conference for women that

643
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,410
clearly just needs medical care.

644
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I feel like I've seen the same look in
an interview with like a psychopathic

645
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:16,720
killer who's delusional and detached.
It may be,

646
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:21,700
I don't think you can see he can't read
a lot, but just somebody kind of, Oh,

647
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,720
I've discovered something
called the uncanny valley.
You've heard of this? No. Oh,

648
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:29,650
you guys love this. Oh yeah, so, and she
makes me think of that when I look at her,

649
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,160
which is that, when is this comes
out of the world of robotics.

650
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,990
So cause I was thinking about stigma,
why it occurs.

651
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:38,680
I'm doing some research on it and
I came upon the uncanny valley,

652
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,540
enrolled the world of
robotics and virtual reality.

653
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,490
As you make humanoid, let's call them
robots more and more and more lifelike.

654
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:51,020
We like them like them, like them, like
them till they get really nearly human.

655
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,010
And then we're repulsed.

656
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,850
We get these called the uncanny
valley where this uncanny repulsion.

657
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,240
And look at her, she's like, she's
like, she looks like a human being,

658
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:03,740
but there's something uncannily
like disturbing. I was like,

659
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:06,800
Oh man, but we should feel bad
for her. Not just be disturbed.

660
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:08,680
We should like honey, come,
come with us. Come on now. Yeah,

661
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,880
but we get this uncanny discussed
and discussed. Is it fear? Is it,

662
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,530
it's all of the above.
Why not jump to empathy?

663
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,830
Much like on my hands what I'm saying,
like when he was,

664
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,360
when he watches a video, your theory,
you're going to take getting injured.

665
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,540
Why instead of empathy
does my husband laugh.

666
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,720
I am still to this day traumatized and
confused by the guy in the garage car

667
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,390
where I know he had his legs amputated.
If he survived and he survived,

668
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,680
we find out he's from you have legs.
Yeah, he has legs. What? Yeah, he does.

669
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,220
Do they work?

670
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,280
I mean that was the one that was just
maybe we should show Susan that fit and

671
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,650
confused cause I was traumatized watching.

672
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:55,460
I knew what was coming and watching
it and then confused when the laughter

673
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:58,970
ensued between you too.
It wasn't just Oh yes,

674
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,770
Oh yes you did.

675
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,480
Because that's because your reaction was
when there was laughter and nonetheless

676
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:08,150
there was mirth.
There was birth and I was confused by it.

677
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,620
I was confused by the heads up.

678
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,860
Disturb made a traumatize me more now
I was listening to an interview with

679
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:15,590
Johnny Knoxville and he was saying,
you know,

680
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,500
they film his reaction
after he's been hurt.

681
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,240
Now I think the audience feels safe
to laugh because we know he's okay.

682
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,350
You know he's going to get medical
treatment even if he cracks a rib. Yeah,

683
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:28,041
I mean that's what we,

684
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,950
that's what we like the three
stooges and that's male humor.

685
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:33,550
We like to see people get hurt that
don't really get hurt. You know,

686
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,030
we've got people banging
somebody on the head.

687
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,170
If I took a mal and banged on the head
and it wouldn't be just, Oh, it would be,

688
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,200
oh, we gotta go to the hospital now
and you might never be the same.

689
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,550
It's like that's how there has been a
really starts rolling. Oh No. Oh No.

690
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,290
What's happening? What's happening?
Okay. It's a parachute or

691
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,240
these paratroopers. Are these the
weekend ones? Yeah. Military. Yeah,

692
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,530
but see empathy. Joy. What do
you land on the alligators?

693
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,490
The scream is funny. That
sounds funny. Scream the sound.

694
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,500
Not the connection to what's happening
is another layer to my experience here

695
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:28,980
today,
which is sort of like,

696
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:32,310
I'm watching myself a little
more clearly and I'm seeing that.

697
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm laughing at things.
I should not be laughing.

698
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,680
The brown side of the forest,
I the one with the,

699
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,960
Oh, my husband loves these murder
shows. Like the first word report.

700
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,810
Interesting. Murder Porn.
Is it a women's thing?

701
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,450
This one is 24. Seven. What's
your favorite? Favorite?

702
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:02,420
What? Murder Porn? No, I love
crime shows. I like thrillers.

703
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,270
I know what I'm saying. Like so any
I can watch. Do you like the mystery?

704
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,770
The mystery unraveling? I like
solving the crime. Like a evil genius.

705
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,910
I don't know if you saw that. My kids are
watching it. It's fantastic. Yeah. Right.

706
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:19,670
And it's you putting together the layers
of what's connected and that, you know,

707
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,320
I like,
I like the detective aspect.

708
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,170
Why not figure out how
photosynthesis works or something

709
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,420
with a dead person.

710
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:34,780
I'm also fascinated by
human behavior and uh,

711
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,060
I've always been interested in
psychology and talk. To be fair,

712
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,380
as I know you somewhat now you are
not interested in human behavior.

713
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,920
You're interested in abnormal human.
That's true. That's true. That's true.

714
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,890
Very abnormal or abnormal.
The more I'm fascinated,

715
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,590
but I don't know why
I'm interested in that.

716
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,550
Here's my theory because I
watch him watching these shows.

717
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,290
Tom's actually be feeling ashamed now.

718
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,473
That's a whole dynamic

719
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,380
is the gossip.

720
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,560
And then what did she say?

721
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,810
And then he did that in his house.
He's got two sisters,

722
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:22,210
so he got rewarded by that stuff.
So that element came in. Yeah.

723
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,270
You're like gossiping.
I do. I find that very,

724
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,400
very common. Almost unheard of. No, no.
I'm going up to not happen among comics.

725
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,190
Car, super gossipy about
especially about other comics,

726
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,950
about things happening in
our business. Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,820
I almost don't call that gossipy. It's
Sorta like you love tear each other down.

728
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:49,230
It's envy bore the gossip.
I honestly,

729
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:52,860
my favorite role in that is the listening.
It's not,

730
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:55,680
I'm not a big like call everyone
up and talk about everyone,

731
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,480
but I like being the listening device
to others. Somehow that seems better.

732
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,040
Yeah.
He enjoys hearing the story unfold.

733
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,880
Like I'm not very good with details and
stories and I know that you don't like

734
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:10,880
that tone.
That's true.

735
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,980
I do like storytelling is a good
skill to be comedic skill too.

736
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,500
So it's very, I have very different
parents when it comes to storytelling.

737
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,930
My mother is very good at
detailed storytelling and
her father is horrific at it.

738
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,840
Well, you just told a great story
he did during his face chat.

739
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:30,130
At least he sets it up, right man. Most

740
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,250
of his stories when he could be like his,

741
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,440
the difference would be like the guy
robbed the place and then that's it.

742
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,850
He'll be like, I was in the store and
then my mom will be like, I was in there,

743
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,390
I was in line. I felt this guy
come in and he was weird. You know,

744
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:50,130
a woman in front of me. It was breaking
a 20. Yeah, she was wearing a face shield

745
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,860
and you'll be like, did that
happen to yeah. And you're like,

746
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,490
why are you fucking leaving all this out?
Like that's how he tells the story.

747
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,750
Okay. Anyway. All right, let's jump
into the, uh, there's so much. Oh yeah.

748
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,630
This guy is really cool.
Oh, I get your take on him.

749
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,300
I want an adult. How do you in my lap
right now, under 26 right now, no frills,

750
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:12,600
no big titties and intelligence.
I don't care. She's a hood rat,

751
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,610
punk rock or any kind of anything.

752
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,060
As long as she's hot in here right
now in my 37 year old Dick Right now.

753
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,610
Right now. Right now. Right now, right
now. Right now. Right. No worries.

754
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,140
Oh Geez. He's out of
drugs still. Well or no,

755
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,870
this guy's got it going on.
I'm sure if I should talk to her.

756
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:32,400
She's like that all the time.
It's very helpful. I mean,

757
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,530
we suspected that something's going on.

758
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,540
He could have the grinding
of the teeth a little bit.

759
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,790
The per separation right now,
right now, right now. Right now,

760
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,000
I didn't know if it was drugs or
mental illness. It can be both.

761
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,100
It's impossible at different spend time
many times and had some people get hyper

762
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,810
become hypersexual on stimulants
and some people have shut off.

763
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,590
If you have the mental illness
combined with a stimulant, then it's,

764
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:58,720
then it can go into overdrive and
for sure it could, but it's again,

765
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:01,050
it's hard to predict which way
you're going to go. We, we've,

766
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:04,230
we discussed this last time I seen him
like we saw a lot of stimulant type stuff.

767
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,340
He's real, he's got it going
on. He's somebody who admire
and emulate. Definitely.

768
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,950
If you're going to set up your
Tinder account, that's what you want.

769
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,180
Hang behind it.
You want to do.

770
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,580
I haven't visited that this clip in
a while so I forget what he could.

771
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,550
I think he gets into more

772
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,380
never having anything is everybody
else gets way he'd agree here. Beers,

773
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,390
use the research on Calamari and I put
it out eight months ago and then you just

774
00:49:29,391 --> 00:49:33,230
go with that. Oh, why won't you go with
me? I don't need that question answered.

775
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:34,880
I need right now. Right
now. Right now. Right

776
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,400
CD treatment. You think you still are.
You guys always, she'll be dead people.

777
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,433
Dead people.

778
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,250
So the repetition is severing
these nonsensical even
that some of the times that

779
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:58,050
rhyming stuff, that weird run weird.
Did you see that? A lot of me,

780
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,580
but sometimes it makes me think you know,
but he's in real trouble. Keep going.

781
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:06,850
I want to say he's okay. He's
in real trouble. Keep going,

782
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,290
having to order, give him food away
to the homeless. I think I deserve it.

783
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,350
I think I'm entitled Bloke and
I think that I deserve it. Now.

784
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,280
I'm not going to believe in
your guide or any nonsense.

785
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,120
I'm not going to believe in fate.
And either I just want to hear right now,

786
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:19,950
right now, right now,
right now. Right now.

787
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,330
So he also, uh, he also tied in his, um,

788
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,040
his own behavior to deserving it.
He said, yeah, he's been a give

789
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,580
to homeless people, but I, I'm trying
to, I'm really trying to figure this out.

790
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:36,180
Why he might have norovirus.
No, he'd be vomiting then. Uh,

791
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,820
I'm sure you'll have
the footage like that.

792
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:43,220
Ma My wouldn't know why the no shirt and,
and why he said No.

793
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,800
The common things is
discovered on this show.

794
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,300
We find a lot of guys with no shoe PCP
will make you store your clothes off if

795
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,220
that's Oh yeah.
It's still around.

796
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,630
And Mtma XTO someone said good to
see people do that. People. Yeah,

797
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:01,910
but when you go whack on people to do
it first year, just around the street,

798
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:05,210
three close, cause it's kind of a manic
manias main historic the clothes off.

799
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,290
Remember that guy was the pony guy that
out of San Diego masturbating out on the

800
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,690
corner. Oh, you haven't
seen that footage? Love

801
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,320
they pony the guy, the guy that did that
video about the yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

802
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,153
I know who you're talking about.

803
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,880
The South Park picked up a little
cartoon about change the world,

804
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,310
but he was severely manic,

805
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:29,480
psychotic severely and he was on the
street corner screaming at everybody was

806
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:33,350
closed off masturbating. That's
as is the custom. It was pristine.

807
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:38,060
It was swept away.
Can we that now she is laughing at,

808
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,150
I know she claimed she didn't laugh
at that. You're taking it seriously.

809
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,360
I can't tell you why this makes me
laugh. My mother, who was mentally ill,

810
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:48,950
ironically worked for a psychiatrist
growing up and we would get these calls in

811
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:50,650
the middle of the night,
um,

812
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:55,610
that is running down the street called
the pet team. And so I knew her.

813
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,930
I knew from very early age,
like how that works. It just,

814
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,170
it tickles me in an area from childhood.
I need to hear a lot more about that.

815
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,090
But first this guy,
there's,

816
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,660
there's a way he's sitting there that
makes me think he might be lying on his

817
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:13,640
stomach and he said he hadn't had
any sex in five years or something.

818
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,700
Did you say that up here?
I can pay. He looks for me.

819
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,600
I used to guys look at that when
they like paraplegic, you know,

820
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,020
sort of up on their elbows.
Maybe water.

821
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,100
I think I deserve it. I think I'm
entitled Bloke and I think that has the,

822
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,440
right now, I'm not going to
believe in your guide or any, no.

823
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,610
My slide down.
Putting up on his elbows.

824
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:37,070
Yeah, under the age of 26
because it tell him my research,

825
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,970
the father is 35 to 55 it could have
been longer. Have longer telomeres,

826
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,370
intelligence, more inner.
We need to get rid of it.

827
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:45,470
And like we need to get rid
of incest and pedophilia.

828
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:46,880
We need to get rid of it right now.

829
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,630
Right now. Right now. Right now. That's
right. And there's one last thing.

830
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,880
Oh, you're only having sex.
You're telling Murray's abundant.

831
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,760
You're just going to get
stressed and anger and,

832
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:58,750
and make everybody depressed and stressed
and angry as you were with the guy and

833
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,900
just go by and later in
life you have cancer.

834
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,390
I want a hottie in my lap right
now. Right now. Right now.

835
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:07,960
Right now he can old big hits.
Doesn't matter what subculture right here,

836
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:10,660
right now in Spokane, right now to
go out with me on a date right now.

837
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,810
Yeah. Oh, well he's give their address.

838
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,630
He also put out a video that I'm,
I don't have it queued up,

839
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:22,631
but where he offered to take a woman to
dinner and give her a thousand dollars

840
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,110
just to go to dinner to go to dinner.

841
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:27,840
But he also wanted it to be somebody
who was perhaps willing to have a family

842
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,020
with him after it pays $1,000.
Yes. There, you know, uh,

843
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,530
who was I talking to?

844
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,170
One of the radio show or something I'm
doing where we interacted with somebody

845
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:40,470
that was like, it's such a
prostitute and she said a, he's guys,

846
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:44,640
we'll just pay just to hang out.
Yeah. That's kind of, yeah, eh.

847
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,530
She's got a ladder. Gee, I don't think so.

848
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:48,480
It'd be hard to get that engine to adapt.

849
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,780
So what kind of mental illness your mouth
have? Oh, eh, she was borderline. Ooh.

850
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,030
And then later psychotic.

851
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:59,020
But we didn't know early in the eighth
has shoes, which I'm pills later.

852
00:53:59,021 --> 00:54:03,900
Is that the psychosis? Probably Kim is
Shuttin. She um, oh, she got depressed.

853
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,220
She got sick with cancer and then she
slowly became more and more of a shut in

854
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:11,520
and by the hills that, huh? I
must have been pink. I don't know.

855
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:16,260
Doctors do that Turner. Yeah,
some something's doing. Uh,
but anyways, entertaining.

856
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,420
That's one way of putting it.

857
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,950
Talked to my therapist is
that only recently came to
know that that's borderline

858
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:24,960
disorder or did you always
know? No, I, I only,

859
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,780
I knew 10 years ago when I got into
therapy and my shrank was like,

860
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,410
I have a theory. Yeah. Your mother
might've been. And I'm like, no, that's,

861
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:32,670
that sounds about right.
Yeah.

862
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,970
So it's so surprising to me how few
people really understand what that is.

863
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:37,380
I was talking to somebody the
other day, I'm like, no, no.

864
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,480
That's borderline disorder.
Oh No. It's very clear to me.

865
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,040
People seem to understand narcissism,

866
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:44,530
but they don't understand borderline
portal adds a little harder to,

867
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:48,630
to undertake. Yes. From the beginning.
Yeah. I guess it's a more covert racism.

868
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:51,900
I think you see it, it's
kind of more apparent. Yeah.

869
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,790
And somebody can say
something and be like, see,

870
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,440
that's super nice and borders
are good at sort of drag.

871
00:54:56,441 --> 00:54:59,020
He's getting you in the queue,

872
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:02,460
sucking you in and all of a sudden
the thing starts spinning around.

873
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:07,230
And the appearance of being
charming and normal try. Yeah.
Shit. Yeah. Was real fun.

874
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,750
Funny. I feel it was funny. Yeah.
You can say, I feel bad for brothers.

875
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:14,040
They're their own worst enemy. They really
are. Their biggest fear is abandonment.

876
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:16,130
And ironically they push everybody,
right?

877
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,270
So they suck you in and
they get you super close,

878
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,350
they build you up and then
they cut you down. So you,

879
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:24,750
so you either you're either all good or
all bad at all times and if you're all

880
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:27,300
good, you're going to bandage. They make
you all bad and then they abandoned you.

881
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,620
That sounds about right. So, yeah,
that's why I was down the comedian. Yeah,

882
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,090
it's good. It's gotta come from
somewhere. Oh Gosh. Yes. Oh boy.

883
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,620
Processed a Yay. Um, so PCP,

884
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,530
that's what we're thinking on this guy.
I'm thinking still thinking stimulants.

885
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,910
Stimulants. Yeah. Maybe I'm
doing maybe MDM, ecstasy.

886
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,390
Interesting. Come on topic.
We were the tough, yeah.
What? You give me a rough one.

887
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,620
Hit me a rough one. Okay. Yeah.
Oh, what'd you think? Oh Jesus.

888
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,330
Just the way he's,
Oh gosh.

889
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:02,210
Hi.
I'm looking for a white lady.

890
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,780
It's tattoo and dominant and be willing
to put me in a dress and beat the shit

891
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:12,650
out of me. Call me. I'm going to
see she had three months street.

892
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:13,870
Okay.
Can

893
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:18,560
Fremont CC Jim Again?
You skipped and white bitch.

894
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,520
It's what I'm looking for is a stupid
care to like bitch that put me in a dress

895
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,653
and shit.

896
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:29,060
Call me 22 and wait, wait,

897
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,810
slut.
No,

898
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,370
I've never kind of really
bunched up on that way.

899
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,420
That is that he or she,
he, but what are you,

900
00:56:41,421 --> 00:56:45,220
things are so bad for them really. Then
again, when he starts calling of the,

901
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,750
it was interesting because he started
submissive. Yeah. Flip to like,

902
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,240
is he not [inaudible] whatever it is.

903
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,940
I was having empathy until he
started that stuff that I was just,

904
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,500
yes, I can. Horrible feeling in my chest,

905
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:04,110
Mike Disgust and then
pain and misery and uh,

906
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,180
and then watching her glee and delight.
Yeah.

907
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:10,640
Feeling that way is really disturbing.
Really like look at her actually.

908
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,710
She's like, yeah. What? What
else? What else? What else?

909
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,370
Horrible you feeling in your stomach
so hard. It's so horrible. So horrible.

910
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:23,350
You're laughing at me. Sexual
fetish that we're seeing. Well, no,

911
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:28,110
that's, I don't think they, I wouldn't
say quite that lightly. That's a,

912
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,680
that's not a great, happy
person. That looks good. I mean,

913
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,090
that's an unhappy, horrible, horrible
life. You think so. Sure to be. Why?

914
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:40,840
Just because he wants to be beat and
everything. Did you catch you feel,

915
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:43,950
it seems like a normal guy to me.
You're saying

916
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:52,950
you're good life and then be
had the shit beat out of him.

917
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:56,080
Cause that, yeah, but some
people, is that always okay?

918
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:01,090
There's always in pop culture, let's say
in movies and I've heard it, you know,

919
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,500
thrown around by no,

920
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,900
not experts that the idea that um,
powerful people,

921
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:13,540
yes, the people didn't engage that
provide those services will say that,

922
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,240
that oftentimes are servicing people that,

923
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,470
that are success can't be
submissive in their life.

924
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,360
And this is just sort of
the way they act that out.

925
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:21,740
And so when they become submissive with,

926
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,800
by hiring someone is that they're
unhappy or they really just,

927
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,430
is it like a harmless thing? This
guy's a CEO, clearly have some company,

928
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:31,270
this is the president of Chevron. You
didn't remember it was Brooks brothers.

929
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:34,970
I guess I see that. I see the button
down. Shirt on. I'm just talking about it.

930
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,590
Yeah.
Oil Man there.

931
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,170
Um,
uh,

932
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:48,440
it's more of the compartmentalization
of trauma. Ooh. Right.

933
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,320
And so if somebody is a,

934
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,950
CEO's have a high probability to be
narcissistic and all the nurses and as a

935
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,820
response to trauma and then
when you've been traumatized,

936
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,550
you're using this pseudo self
to keep yourself pumped up.

937
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:04,390
There's a part of yourself you leave
behind that then get service through

938
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:08,410
reenactment of the trauma. Does
that make sense? It does make sense.

939
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,500
And reenacting the trauma can
be playful and fun and okay.

940
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,420
It's certainly doesn't fix the trauma.
It doesn't help the trauma.

941
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:20,440
And sometimes your retraumatized it's
going to be, we can make things worse,

942
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,610
but it's all that
compartmentalization of trauma

943
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,340
and, and, and this gentleman
who will call a non CEO,

944
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:31,970
there's probably just a big
compartment of trauma that he lives.

945
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,830
Yeah, he sort of, Eh, yeah, he started
in it. Right? I think that's true.

946
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,300
Yeah.

947
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:44,300
He sort of looks like he's like never
made it out and to compartmentalize the

948
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:45,880
sexualization of this,

949
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,340
he makes it a sexual fetish
and then it's something I will,

950
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,600
maybe he was sexually abused as
a kid or something that right.

951
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,440
Just physically you can
I ask you, uh, your,

952
00:59:53,441 --> 00:59:56,680
your take on something that we were
talking about? Some reason I just,

953
00:59:56,681 --> 00:59:59,740
I've learned it to read you guys and this,
two things now I've got very,

954
00:59:59,741 --> 01:00:03,530
very disturbing one is the impish
smile there. The corner of Tom's mouth.

955
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:06,550
There occasionally appears. And the
other is Christina, which is great. Yes.

956
01:00:06,551 --> 01:00:07,384
Then what

957
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:13,040
I see you suffering.
Go ahead.

958
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,960
No. Yeah. When you pointed out that I,

959
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,960
I'm a fan or I'm very into abnormal human.

960
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,000
Yes. Yes. You like
that. That's disturbing.

961
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,880
It does that disturb me? Uh, okay. Cause
those are two different questions. Yeah,

962
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:33,770
that's true. That's true. Uh,
does not disturb me. Okay.
Uh, I don't find it normal.

963
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:38,570
Yeah. I find it maybe a little bit
worrisome. It is a little worrisome.

964
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,160
Ah, I always worry. Yeah.

965
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:42,750
I've had lots of friends that have
been like that and they're like, well,

966
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:47,030
I love reading novels about
serial killers. I go, really?
Why? It's like, really?

967
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:50,340
Tell me why none of it's ever borne fruit
now. I've never been able to find it.

968
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:54,320
He sort of is, you're fine.
Any pattern where I'm like,
oh, that's why they do that.

969
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:58,280
I just, I've never, and it just, it just
strikes me as like, why? Yeah, me too.

970
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:02,660
So why, why is so dark? The dark side of
the force? Why are you there with him?

971
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,330
It's so disturbing to you.
I don't like the murder stuff.

972
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,050
And the reason I think it's funny that
he says he doesn't care about the murder

973
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:13,390
stuff. He just, he likes the APP. Makes
me laugh. I'll look it up. The hold too.

974
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:15,650
It doesn't necessarily, maybe you will
after. I like doing all this stuff.

975
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,040
I think part of this is like a
mad at my mom maybe or something.

976
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:21,590
And this is a way that you deal with
that. Yeah, I have. So then you are,

977
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:24,140
you're Bob. The way he would come after
me when I've started feeling better,

978
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,670
but I know you can handle it.

979
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:30,230
But the reason I feel comfortable laughing
at you is because you're professional

980
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:33,440
and you know what I do. I do remember
being exhausted by the end of last show.

981
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:35,150
I do remember that. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

982
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,310
I think I remember you saying
that emotionally exhausted.

983
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:41,720
I think getting together the same feeling
in my gut. Here's a good one. Oh good.

984
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:42,920
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

985
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,073
Oh,

986
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,960
I just saw our first reaction every time.
It's all I got to work there.

987
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:54,160
What is she doing? She's rubbing. Yeah.

988
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,560
No, I don't pull, you know what?
I don't believe her. No. Oh,

989
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,390
I think she's doing that for some, like
business likes to, to attract vampire,

990
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:04,620
you know what I mean? Some people that
are into that kind of fetishy stuffs.

991
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,610
I bet.

992
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:08,260
Yeah. And I just wanted
to share with all of you,

993
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:14,250
I felt the need to share me placing
menstrual blood all over my face and what

994
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:20,971
power it holds for us as women to fully
own this part of self that we have been

995
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,003
shamed.

996
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,440
Well, whatever it was, I didn't believe
it is sick. You didn't believe in a say.

997
01:02:26,441 --> 01:02:28,890
Yeah. The first I went out for a
thing and I went, wait, wait, wait.

998
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,400
She's doing it for a reason.
But also it could be a bit, um,

999
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,970
and attention seeking reason. It's
sort of stuff as it's, it's some,

1000
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,660
it's like either it goes under either,
hey,

1001
01:02:40,661 --> 01:02:43,390
I provide fetish services and here's
one of them are very, come get me.

1002
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,750
Or this is an artistic happening,
you know,

1003
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:50,210
as artistic expression or in her case
it's a political move thing. So, right.

1004
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,390
Reclaiming the blood and through
reclaiming it to get worse, show cycle.

1005
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,630
No fully allowed me to embody
like everything that I was,

1006
01:02:58,631 --> 01:03:03,250
it fully allowed me to have the freedom
to be able to express who I was in every

1007
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:04,380
way.
It mean to me

1008
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,270
this, um, this justification, this,

1009
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:10,270
but explanation for it sounds
like nonsense. Total bullshit.

1010
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,090
Total cause she's just an APP. It's all,
it's all bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit,

1011
01:03:13,091 --> 01:03:16,690
bullshit, bullshit. But I thought that
the, now she could be borderline, right?

1012
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,120
Because, because my original take on
the blood was like, oh, that's bullshit.

1013
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,130
And then as she's talking, well that's
bullshit too. So there's no real there.

1014
01:03:24,131 --> 01:03:27,440
There. Oh, borderline. Sometimes I'm not,
I don't know her. I'm not calling her out.

1015
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:31,530
She seems lovely. Whatever is world story
stuff where you find all your stuff,

1016
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:36,220
people send it from everywhere.
Oh my God. Oh my gosh. Um, yeah.

1017
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:39,960
And so, uh, the, it has that feel of Sar
posted it like look at this stupid bet.

1018
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,103
Yeah.

1019
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,480
By putting it in sports media,
I really found it just a kind of,

1020
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:56,481
gave an invitation to people to be able
to know that it's okay to share this

1021
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,030
part of yourself and
that it's not terrible,

1022
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,930
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah. Bullshit. Whatever.

1023
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:07,200
I don't know what her motivation
is. Good. I can't tell. Yeah. Um,

1024
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,100
Worldstar I didn't even put that together.
Horrible.

1025
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,600
You know, I've been trying to play, we're
looking all over for it. Is it here?

1026
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:19,440
I wanted to play for him.
That other guy breaking his leg.

1027
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:23,680
Oh No. Oh Wow. A genuine response to this.

1028
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,100
How about that? Hey, so let me see it.

1029
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:30,740
I'm interested now to what I was going
to tell you. It's kind of a side note.

1030
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,070
It's,
it'll do Braille.

1031
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:36,090
I was listening to a podcast about the
me too movement yesterday. Yes, yes.

1032
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,620
And there's, um, you know, millennials
and she goes, before the podcast began,

1033
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:44,310
she goes, I just want to give
a trigger warning. Oh boy,

1034
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,670
you're listening to this. You
might be triggered. And I was like,

1035
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,110
where are we going with this?

1036
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,240
I thought that I thought we'd sort of
move through that. Yeah. I've just,

1037
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,280
I've discovered I spent some time with
millennials this week, uh, and to,

1038
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:00,510
to big shocking things jumped out
at me. One, they do not use condoms.

1039
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:05,230
Zero. Zero. What? I was
talking to the teen mom on,

1040
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,410
it's about two 20 kids in
there and I was like, hey,

1041
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,410
we're talking about the rise in STI
is, and I go, you know, safe sex.

1042
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,430
I could see their eyes kind of glaze
over. I go, condom use nothing. I go,

1043
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:16,500
how many of you use condoms?
I just raise your hand.

1044
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,950
Not one hand went up that one
hand, one hand. I was like, oh,

1045
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,840
I need to start love lineup again.

1046
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:26,020
They're a snapchat page
or podcast or something.

1047
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:30,970
So that one jumped out at me and then
I've decided that millennials all have the

1048
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:33,400
dunning Kruger Syndrome. What's that? Oh,

1049
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:34,840
I thought Christina would
know that when we immediately,

1050
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:40,380
Denny Krueger is essentially a cognitive
distortion where you think you know

1051
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:44,710
more than you do or you think
you're better than you are.

1052
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,070
It's what essentially gives people the
ability to get up at American idol and

1053
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:51,100
sing like crap and then say,
I understand it's not a great,

1054
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,330
so that's done in Kruger.
It's actually a syndrome. And,

1055
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:58,420
and people have varying degrees of this
done in Kruger phenomenon based on their

1056
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,080
essentially lack of real knowledge because
they don't know how much they don't

1057
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:03,310
know. Right. They never,

1058
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:08,170
it's like a lack of exposure to depth
and therefore they feel like they know

1059
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:10,550
everything cause they're exposed to the
phone, they can get fired. Everything.

1060
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,820
It's reading the whole book.
They're just going to,

1061
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,860
they're not having any spiritual learning.

1062
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:18,780
They're just looking at a bunch of facts
and then they forgetting them and they,

1063
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:23,050
and they all think they know a lot more
than they do. So it's done in Kruger. Wow.

1064
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:27,340
So they are sexually active. I mean,
they're not just a bunch of pure puritan.

1065
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:30,120
I know they're not using condoms, they're
just not. And there's an opposite.

1066
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:31,720
Dunning Kruger or see this,

1067
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,430
the converse of the dunning
Kruger is the imposter effect.

1068
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,380
People that have large,
um,

1069
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,200
tremendous amount of expertise
often feel like an imposter.

1070
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,740
Most people in professions
to sorta go through a phase,

1071
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:46,060
at least a phase like that.
Yeah. So, wow, it's fascinating.

1072
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,480
Or Sti is just rampant,
just going up there,

1073
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:54,470
going up words if we're everyone got that.
But as we get the vaccine now,

1074
01:06:54,471 --> 01:06:55,480
so it's not that big a deal,

1075
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:01,270
but it's a no Korea and syphilis
going way up. Well it's treatable.

1076
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:05,160
Thankfully for now. I mean they're,
they're getting resistance. You know,

1077
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:08,700
syphilis is a, is a Shanker that goes
away and it comes back and surprise.

1078
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:13,040
You don't have like nasty pictures
like that for me to the medical grows.

1079
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,330
Yeah. Which is confusing. Again, I don't,

1080
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:21,150
I don't get that you guys are
novelists in so many ways. Uh, but,

1081
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,950
but uh, the simplest goes away and goes
inside and that's when it does, you're,

1082
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,190
it's damaged. Correct. Right,
right. It'll make you crazy.

1083
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:32,140
Raw Nature. Right. Well that's
the theory we do. We don't know.

1084
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:35,680
I think that's probably a good one.
Cause he, cause he, he was always sick,

1085
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:36,311
you know,
forever.

1086
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:39,730
And then all of a sudden it's neurological
deterioration and what makes me

1087
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,420
absolutely insane. Does your audience
know about your background in philosophy?

1088
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,050
Okay. Um, is that people go, oh, well his,

1089
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,550
his philosophy was so negative and
so disturbing. It drove him crazy.

1090
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:52,384
Are you kidding me?

1091
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,860
There's never been a case of psychosis
caused by philosophy or a belief system

1092
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:01,600
or a challenging problem of some type.
It's like mental illness, illness,

1093
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:05,520
a brain disorder. Did you ever
call our friends at pel? No.

1094
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:10,720
Don't bring,
oh,

1095
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,530
Jesus. Oh Man. Whatever's going to
happen. It's not going to be good. Uh,

1096
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,350
oh no.
Oh No.

1097
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,333
Oh No.

1098
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:29,410
Uh, you know what? I'm having
a strange reaction. Yeah.

1099
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,940
It's not as bad as it could've been.
Yeah.

1100
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,000
I thought he was going to lose his legs
because that car rolled over him and,

1101
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:36,770
and that truck sort of metal hit him.
He would lost his legs,

1102
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:41,230
but the scream is funny.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm here with you.

1103
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,150
It's dark side of the forest,
Georgia guys.

1104
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:46,240
She's a funny screen without a
single shift or pool or anything

1105
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:56,600
that make, why is that? Like, I
don't like, I know he's in pain.

1106
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:57,770
There was no bounces back.

1107
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,670
Hoe knows he's already
walking before the surgery.

1108
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,540
It's made an open fracture there.
Yeah.

1109
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,653
Okay.

1110
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,870
When I add,
oh no.

1111
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:17,520
Are you thirsty?
Oh my God.

1112
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,510
I don't want to breast feed.
You

1113
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,360
watch
suck me dry.

1114
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,480
Your wife seems to like it. Susie
may get out of this wall. Oh,

1115
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:41,090
thirsty.
Oh Wow.

1116
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,730
Is He, is he, is he producing milk? No,
but they're pretty nice nips, right?

1117
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,640
Men lack 10. Yeah, it's
called galactorrhea then.

1118
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,210
But I mean if you're on certain
medications, work on those nips.

1119
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:56,560
You really got to get on him right. To
make the blog bill. Bill come out. Yeah.

1120
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:02,590
You want to try?

1121
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,950
Wait, what's wrong with
this manager? This one?

1122
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:13,220
I mean, something's going on with
him, right? You go out with him. Uh,

1123
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:18,380
it makes me, I'm going to
guess, Oh, I don't know.

1124
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,440
But it feels like a gender issue,
right?

1125
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:25,790
Like he's identifying with the mom and
stuff and he wants to be that interesting.

1126
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,450
And I'm wondering if he's on hormones and
maybe sort of making his way that way.

1127
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:33,380
This is his sexual piece of that.
Now this is one of the earliest,

1128
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:35,370
your most vulnerable oldest clips.
Yeah.

1129
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:37,050
What do people have been saying
and thinking about it just,

1130
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:40,360
they just love it early.
Just gnarly. Yeah,

1131
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:46,510
but he seems very, I, he
seems quite at ease with all
of it. Very good at it. Yeah.

1132
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:49,640
He's a so he doesn't bother him.
He likes what he likes. Oh yeah.

1133
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:52,730
I don't feel bad than the
normal your mom's house way

1134
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,660
does it normally.
I feel so sad for these people,

1135
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:59,810
but I noticed there's
something about myself.

1136
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,500
I can't get my hands away from
my friends cause I'm so ashamed.

1137
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:08,710
Why are you so sure your shame?
No shame being here with you today.

1138
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,690
Cause I kind of know him. I
know what's coming. I know
it's shameful thing is I, I,

1139
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:19,260
I actually have empathy for
these people too and I feel like,

1140
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:22,500
I just think the behavior silly,
the behaviors funny yet,

1141
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:27,190
even though we have empathy
in, okay. Yeah, the behaviors.

1142
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,620
Silly zoom.
You think of this guy?

1143
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:36,950
My name's Jeremiah. You Shipman
I'm looking for girls for pussy.

1144
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,490
Okay.
There you go.

1145
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,830
Preclinical cause you're in a FACA
is you're looking for some action.

1146
01:11:45,831 --> 01:11:49,110
They live in Missouri.
Please

1147
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,700
call me at one to five or
seven or text me at one six,

1148
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:57,870
three.

1149
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,880
I just, to me that's
just desperation. Yeah.

1150
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:04,140
But I also think there's
something interesting with
the voice level in the eyes.

1151
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,550
You know it's like the voice is like,

1152
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:08,030
it's like this whisper but it
doesn't seem like he's whispering.

1153
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,130
Seems like he's talking now I'm imagining,

1154
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,370
I'm imagining he's really fat.
Oh really?

1155
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,370
And there may be like a
respiratory piece of this. Oh okay.

1156
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,760
You know what I'm saying? I was like he's
not fully because the camera's awesome.

1157
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:21,510
Right?

1158
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:26,370
I don't think his lungs can inflate like
that much or that much weight and the

1159
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:29,640
eyes are really not moving along well.

1160
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:32,190
I'm thinking that looks a little
substance here. We look at that.

1161
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:34,260
Look at the glaze.
Yeah.

1162
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:39,510
Yeah. Kiki. Motherfucker know you are go

swing time machine out of beef jerky.

1165
01:12:47,081 --> 01:12:48,150
So now we're getting into

1166
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:54,100
time machine out of beef jerky and he
wants a girl that can roll a blunt with

1167
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:56,470
her pussy was not possible

1169
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,993
Yeah.

1170
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,550
What do you want me to do? Oh No,
I want it early because that smile,

1172
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,460

good one to fives by.

1173
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,430
But maybe just like a really morbidly
obese guy. Yeah. Desperate. Desperate.

1174
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:25,990
A desperate. Yeah. That's the normal
sadness I feel. What's your videos? Yeah.

1175
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,240
Well this one will procure up. Hold
on, let me get you something more fun.

1176
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,090
But the beef jerky swing,

1177
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:32,013
what am I saying?

1178
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,440
This guy's in Burger King.

1179
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,843
Fuck.

1180
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,150
So He's, he goes in there. He's,
he's really, you know, not,

1181
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:55,650
he's actually over the cash
register, stealing, causing problems.

1182
01:13:55,651 --> 01:13:58,940
And then the employees take it the
matter into their own hands. Good.

1183
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,310
Oh, that's not good. No,

1184
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:16,990
it's that good. Hold cheese. He's got
like a leg brace on and then they keep,

1185
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:21,670
uh, they came after him. Well,
someone's standing on them right now.

1186
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:26,250
I want his head.
I got a sub.

1187
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,093
Do the guy

1188
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,380
shows up to get up.
Well,

1189
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:36,550
she was the guy who's standing on his
head to get off so that she can tase him.

1190
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,800
You know, she has a taser. Yeah.

1191
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:50,920
That was not good idea. And then that
was just a bystander. You got to slap,

1192
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,900
what is it bad or would it be,
if she's tasting the first guy,

1193
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:57,490
let's look is mentally ill,
do

1194
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,130
unmoved mover the prime Mary?
What's going on?

1195
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:11,320
Like what's the, what? What's
going on? Is that mental illness?

1196
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,050
Well, it could be drugs, right? Like,
yeah, that's always, if your choices,

1197
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,420
it's hard to tell to rule out.
That's right.

1198
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,070
We got to get a toxicology and
see what's in there and uh,

1199
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:23,620
and see what he's like when he's sober.
He's not totally wow.

1200
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,360
It depends what you call
normal, Tom. I mean,

1201
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:26,980
I've started to feel a
lot of things in normal.

1202
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:30,670
They didn't feel that way about an hour
ago. It's physical time with you guys.

1203
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,670
I could be, who knows
where I'm at? Had deaf.

1204
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:41,490
Jeez.
It's a little overkill on the tasing.

1205
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:49,210
He goes outside and he just gets
right on his, a little scoot. Scoot.

1206
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:54,250
He gets on his way. What is
that like a scoot for your,

1207
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,870
when you have a a leg that though.
Oh, they either think of the scoot.

1208
01:15:57,871 --> 01:16:02,500
They've put this chair chair
on wheels. Oh Wow. Yup.

1209
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:06,460
Well he, he needs that. He's got a broken
leg. I'd love to hear how that happened.

1210
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:10,660
The broken leg. A couple really good
ones. There was skiing in the Alps,

1211
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,120
I suspect holiday.

1212
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:16,870
I'm really John McAfee's sword.

1213
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,980
I remember McAfee antivirus
software. Yes. Yes.

1214
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,390
This man became very wealthy.
Oh.

1215
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:27,310
Cause he's one of the early guys that
got in on a software viruses. Yeah.

1216
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,710
So he uh, he kinda got
out. He got out of it goes,

1217
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:36,190
I could sit here and do this all day.
I'm in a parallel universe.

1218
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,720
I like, time doesn't move anymore.
If I'm going through the wormhole

1219
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,880
by, okay, Susan, am I okay? Am I
went pee? No, it's just not good.

1220
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,890
She's worried about me. She's worried. I
May, I may have her sit and watch them.

1221
01:16:48,891 --> 01:16:52,270
I just add to this business, it's what
you want to see, what they've got,

1222
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:55,750
the long nipples. So you can
see that one. That was great.

1223
01:16:55,751 --> 01:17:00,640
I got a first row view of her as
that was playing. She was like, yeah.

1224
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:05,770
So McAfee, I knew she liked that one, was
bought out of his company a while ago,

1225
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,980
left with nine figure there,
went down to Belize, um,

1226
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,100
and has since um,
been uh,

1227
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:18,320
chased by them for a
murder or to choose by who?

1228
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,410
By Belizian authorities or they believe
that he murdered a neighbor. Um,

1229
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,290
but I didn't watch this documentary and
then like in the midst of all of all the,

1230
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:31,110
his time that he kind of took over the
town he was in and believes, you know,

1231
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:35,270
the rich guy hired like 20 armed guards,

1232
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:40,190
bought the police, you know, cars
and boats and just craziness,

1233
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,053
kinda crazy.

1234
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:46,150
He also got in with some of the
local gals on a fetish of his,

1235
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:51,410
and I wanted to see your Tim doing this.
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. How weird is that?

1236
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:54,590
So here's the,
the girls brace yourself.

1237
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,430
But those were the first time I was
ashamed. What? Then I got used to it.

1238
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:02,240
But did he have you do,
um, sit on this hammock?

1239
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:08,090
They have my card as a whole 10 a hallmark
and after that he lays down on the

1240
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:12,360
hammock.
Then he m he would cut,

1241
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:15,720
cut a little hole and he would sit there.

1242
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,470
That's why he is cause he wanted to have,

1243
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:21,560
like Scott said,

1244
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,920
I didn't agree with that one has got
sex. And when you poop in someone. Yeah.

1245
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,650
Oh, what'd she call it? Scat. Scat sex.

1246
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:36,810
Scott Seq catchments into to this.
The Scots are particularly bad,

1247
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:42,260
but nursing is so he would have these
girls sit in a hammock with a whole shit

1248
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:46,520
in his mouth. Oh, I'm
sorry. I misunderstood.

1249
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:50,390
I thought she said he would
sit in a no, no, no. Shit and
Herman. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1250
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:52,820
You're telling me they,
they, it's pretty clearly.

1251
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:56,600
I understand where you've kind of heard
that, but yeah, but no, no. Again,

1252
01:18:56,601 --> 01:19:01,510
easy money. Great Gig. Great Gig. All
you gotta do is go over the fully, yeah.

1253
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,940
Noted here. Let's give, let's
go through it before we discuss.

1254
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,060
Hoping someone will easy peasy

1255
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,280
you shit in his mouth like that.
That's cute.

1256
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,280
I have never had done that before.

1257
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:18,160
And it was an experience
for a man under your butt

1258
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:21,110
to shit in his mouth.

1259
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:27,520
Did he ever have regular
intercore like that? No.

1260
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,980
None of that.
That was the only thing I did.

1261
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:35,400
So his only thing was
paying these girls titties.

1262
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,660
Was He masturbating when they did this?
They don't get into that,

1263
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:41,090
but I like to just in question
like imagine that he was, um,

1264
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:46,090
that would make sense, right? Because
this is a sexual fetish top level.

1265
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:49,210
Here's the thing, I actually wonder,
well, you know, I'm a pretty open mind.

1266
01:19:49,211 --> 01:19:53,110
A different people like in
different things. We know.
Whatever turns you on, fine.

1267
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,130
How can somebody get turned on by that,
I mean get turned on a,

1268
01:19:57,310 --> 01:20:00,010
how can they even get through? How
can they tolerate it? Yeah. Yeah.

1269
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:03,670
I wonder that too. I mean, how do they
not throw up like instantly, instantly,

1270
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:07,920
you know? I mean, you walk by
and I'm shit and like, yeah.

1271
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:13,400
Or even if they were gonna
shit on his face, he'd be
like, no. He's like, ah, here,

1272
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:17,720
how can he not? Does he get sick too?
I mean, yeah, you could get this is,

1273
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,870
this is what I was worried about for
you. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it was right.

1274
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,900
That's why I worry about for me, am
I doing it right? She eats my scrum.

1275
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:26,050
You're saying yes, I'm
worried about, and that's not,

1276
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:29,930
we're not in a third world country. You
know, we're here, although these days,

1277
01:20:29,931 --> 01:20:34,790
this bus answers starting to become
that. But, uh, for real. All right.

1278
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,130
The width of the sanitation
around homelessness. I, I'm,

1279
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:40,190
I'm mortified what's going
to happen this summer and I,

1280
01:20:40,191 --> 01:20:41,990
the city is not helping the,

1281
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:45,950
letting people suffer the streets and
there should accumulate a giant piles and

1282
01:20:45,951 --> 01:20:49,340
the rats accumulate on those piles and
we are going to have a big infectious

1283
01:20:49,341 --> 01:20:50,220
disease problem.
The summer

1284
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:54,050
defecation. Yeah. It's a
huge problem. Wow. Yeah. Um,

1285
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:59,250
and do you think that there's
a probability that when
somebody has a scat sex

1286
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,360
issue that it is okay,

1287
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:03,740
Kenna? I don't get as an
orange. I know I don't get it.

1288
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:05,900
I don't get it at all and I,
and I don't,

1289
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,600
it's not something you get
into with patients, you know,

1290
01:21:08,601 --> 01:21:11,150
at the level I treat patients. Yeah.
What do you mean you don't get into,

1291
01:21:11,151 --> 01:21:14,360
they don't admit to it or you just
as a come up and into this stuff?

1292
01:21:14,361 --> 01:21:16,760
I'm working out with people
and so I don't, I can't,

1293
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,590
it's quite it with anything because I
never have gotten into it and everything.

1294
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:23,480
Yeah, okay. Except somebody
just wildly, you know,

1295
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,420
way out into sort of a psychotic state,

1296
01:21:26,421 --> 01:21:28,730
which she kind of sounds like he is right.

1297
01:21:28,731 --> 01:21:31,820
Running around buying everything
and sir, he's, Oh, he's whacked out.

1298
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,250
He sounds kind of wacky. Yeah. And, and I,

1299
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:37,580
and I don't understand where
that comes from. How I had,

1300
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:40,040
we had a love line once we had a
woman that call Dan, she was, hey,

1301
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,990
she was a servant for this
kind of thing or whatever.

1302
01:21:44,991 --> 01:21:48,800
She was a prostitute essentially when
she said we had a guy who wanted that and

1303
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:50,380
she wouldn't do it.
So he goes,

1304
01:21:50,381 --> 01:21:54,740
can we at least put it in this top where
for me to take it home? Yeah, she did.

1305
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,890
I met. Wow. We started calling. We called
her Tupperware lady. That ever happened.

1306
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:58,700
I've met,
uh,

1307
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:03,560
I met a couple who does
videos online and they were,

1308
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:06,770
they were at a show and they were telling
me about, you know, they do sex videos,

1309
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,000
you know, and they sell them and
uh, one of their fans contacted,

1310
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,550
wanted her to shit and mail it to them,

1311
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:17,810
but also one of her to stick to a
specific diet for three days before.

1312
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:19,430
What was the Diet?
She was like,

1313
01:22:19,431 --> 01:22:23,180
he just made me eat these certain things
and he was like a hassle. Is it certs?

1314
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:23,520
Yeah.

1315
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,540
I don't know. But she goes, I ate
it and then shutting the thing and,

1316
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,840
and he sent her like two grand or
something. That's what I'm talking about.

1317
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:35,130
Is it that bad? The women are making
money. Not that catch your Flab,

1318
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,090
Christiana here. Is that what you're
saying? I love you to send me to believes.

1319
01:22:39,091 --> 01:22:41,640
Is that where no, no. She what?
He wants the Tupperware of job.

1320
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,030
He wants the two rather. Yeah.
Got It. Two grand for that.

1321
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,170
Did you do it for far less even?
That's easy money.

1322
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:52,370
Tim Horton's lady lady in the,
in the coffee shop last week.

1323
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:55,830
Uh, this sounds familiar. Oh yes. So
she would Duke it out for her yet.

1324
01:22:55,831 --> 01:23:00,400
That was extraordinarily extraordinary.
Yeah, that was, that was, yeah,

1325
01:23:00,401 --> 01:23:03,250
there she is. Yeah. And
she's really animated.

1326
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,890
Love to know what she was fighting
by. Oh, it was about that. She,

1327
01:23:05,891 --> 01:23:08,380
they wouldn't let her use the restroom,
which is sorted, nicely dressed,

1328
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:12,220
which I think is a stair right. She's
like [inaudible] mom and here she goes.

1329
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:17,220
There it is. I gotta go. I gotta. I gotta
I got a problem here. Hold out here. Oh,

1330
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:22,450
she is crazy. It's unbelievable.
And then look at this. Look at this.

1331
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,810
Yeah. Oh. Unless you
wiped your hands. Wait,

1332
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:28,330
what's your ass that's
arose that I have to, well,

1333
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:29,470
she picks it up on their barriers.

1334
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,480
And you haven't seen this
before or you've seen it. Okay.

1335
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:36,280
I figured I'd like Rappaport did a whole
commentary this good. It's pretty good.

1336
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,000
He's very funny. I was like,
I saw it on Twitter actually.

1337
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,800
Now the readiness was what? She had
that bowel movement ready. Yeah,

1338
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,810
and the chamber loaded.
What do you make of all that?

1339
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,560
That's why she needed to go to the
bathroom. She's like, she's like,

1340
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:55,430
it's got to happen. If you don't
believe me, this lady's problematic,

1341
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:59,200
uh, to this particular
location. Yeah. You kidding?

1342
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,490
This is a difficult person.
You are,

1343
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,550
I believe is the trouble that person.
I got to tell you.

1344
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:11,110
I'm really, I understand that and I
understand. You know why people are like,

1345
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:12,320
you need to get out of here.
Yeah.

1346
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:17,340
I always feel like it's so crazy when
anyone is refuse the right to a bathroom.

1347
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,110
Well,
what civilized world,

1348
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:24,370
my understanding is what came out of that
episode where they question those two

1349
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:28,090
African American gentleman that were
in the Starbucks was now that everyone

1350
01:24:28,091 --> 01:24:30,220
could use a bathroom under any
circumstances. If Starbucks,

1351
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:31,500
that's what I heard the new
policy with [inaudible].

1352
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,350
They can't serve you cups of bowel torture
and then be like, you can't shit here.

1353
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,510
I know. I mean, that's the
product. That's what, it's amazing.

1354
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:40,630
They let you use the bathroom if you
buy something. Yeah, that's true.

1355
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,470
I also think it is,

1356
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:47,020
it's inhumane when you're just out
anywhere and you're like, I need to pee.

1357
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:51,550
Strange should be not here to tell you
what in this town, in southern California,

1358
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:53,950
it's not that bad.
Most places within a couple of hits,

1359
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:56,290
you can find some brilliant boy.
You know what I mean? Usually,

1360
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:59,050
but you can be in New York City,
it's no,

1361
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:02,170
wherever you go for miles
and they're everywhere.

1362
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:05,700
Everyone's got a bathroom there.
Everyone's got that downstairs. I know.

1363
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:10,060
Crappy bathroom by the, by the supplies
was seven months pregnant lady.

1364
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:12,430
I walk in and I'm like,
I'm using your bathroom.

1365
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:16,570
I don't even fucking ask him like it's
happening, dude. I dare you to tell me no.

1366
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:21,430
Yeah, or what do you think?
I want you to look at this.

1367
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,190
There's obviously a strapper Krav product,
Christina,

1368
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:27,660
very clearly now because we don't
want to miss any of this gold.

1369
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:30,130
It's coming your way,
but I won't drop a Deuce in public.

1370
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:34,950
That's not happening yet at the all the
time and be all the time. Yes. You know,

1371
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,450
what are you think of? We're almost
done. Okay. I'm having a great,

1372
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,360
there's a grand finale.
The big for my hands,

1373
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:44,320
my face day. United States, he
knows that he's the Latin. Uh,

1374
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,870
so you've been not even

1375
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,670
so it's his version of he's
funny. He's funny. Yeah,

1376
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:58,330
he's good. But there's some things going
on with all that I haven't seen yet. No,

1377
01:25:58,331 --> 01:26:01,080
you can see them. He's been with the
sauna bed. He's been in the side.

1378
01:26:01,081 --> 01:26:05,930
I bet he does. Dentist it's brush
everyday. Deep brush is everyday.

1379
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,890
Yes. Stance. It seems a little
bit to lazy, but there's also,

1380
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:14,570
is there something that you
can pick up in his lunch?

1381
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,870
Uh,
uh,

1382
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,090
uh,
Eh,

1383
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:28,410
well he, he's got emphysema, right?
Is that what it, is that a pen?

1384
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:33,220
He's got the clip to his chest, her
microphone and uh, yeah, I know he,

1385
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:37,850
that's a, that's a airway
obstruction. You're hearing
that doll, that sound. It is,

1386
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,130
yeah. You guys seem to always give me
somebody with pulmonary problems. Yeah.

1387
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:46,390
Because it sounds so funny. Yeah. Yeah.
There should be a respiratory therapist.

1388
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,130
That's the word. The job for you.
Collect gobs of sputum, Alyssa.

1389
01:26:50,131 --> 01:26:52,280
That buddy shall people make.
Well,

1390
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,970
tell him why we think this is so funny
how the origin of the joke came. Well,

1391
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:58,450
hold on.
I'll get through the rest of it.

1392
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:03,290
Did it? We made it. No white dining. No,

1393
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,190
no, no. Go ahead.

1394
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:16,200
Oop. There it is. I mean this is a lot
of sign right there. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1395
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:20,260
Maybe a truck driver maybe. No, I don't
think, I don't think he's worth nine side.

1396
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,990
I think he's lived in the desert.
He's lived on that rock. Yeah.

1397
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:28,590
I don't think his started with a normal
brain. Oh really? Oh, interesting.

1398
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:32,730
That's a lifetime of cognitive
impairment interests. Really.

1399
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:37,620
Something for sure. So like your
whole life, you're not normal. Yeah.

1400
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,500
Yeah. You're like, no,
no sunblock for me again.

1401
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:44,940
He did that get in the usual long
school bus. Yeah. Oh really? Yeah.

1402
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,873
Gotcha.

1403
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,900
Good. I like him and I don't feel sorry
for him the way to everybody else. Yeah.

1404
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,320
He makes the best of it. Good for
him, man. Care what it looks like.

1405
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:57,021
Well,

1406
01:27:57,021 --> 01:28:01,900
I really lost my mind on this because
my producer Blue Band said he,

1407
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:04,430
uh, he names all these
files. Yeah. And uh,

1408
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:07,290
what really made me flip
out is that he named the,

1409
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:10,540
they're usually things like just
staying alive or like, yeah.

1410
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:12,760
Closer look at his
teeth. Yes. But he used,

1411
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:16,430
he called this one using lung
infection as an instrument.

1412
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:24,190
Yeah.

1413
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:27,520
He does have a pulmonary issue.
Yep.

1414
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:30,900
Salmon of lungs. Yeah. As a, as an
instrument. It's nice. I dig every,

1415
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,230
he makes the best of everything this guy.
See that's why I like her.

1416
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,740
You were saying there's a
chance he's a smoker though too.

1417
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:42,340
That would help explain some of the skin
stuff too, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. God,

1418
01:28:42,341 --> 01:28:46,310
I really can you see like he's Kinda got
to expect to see like tobacco stained

1419
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:49,640
fingers. Yeah, sure. Yeah,
he smokes definitely.

1420
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,610
I mean it looks like there's
a little discoloration here.

1421
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:54,050
You don't see that anymore. I
see a lot of that stuff. I bet.

1422
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:58,400
Especially with Rehab, right. Cause
you're working really ages your skin.

1423
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,010
But it's weird you guys,
people would, you know,

1424
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:04,680
I practice medicine long enough to
have seen historical stuff come and go.

1425
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:08,770
And this business of, there was a,
there was a women's thing for awhile,

1426
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:12,180
for a long while where
a woman's identity was,

1427
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:16,500
I'm the woman with the cigarette and
the Martini. Oh right. And that's,

1428
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:20,370
that's what, that's who I am is by high
liberate myself and to find myself.

1429
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,250
And when those women hit their late
seventies and I was telling them to stop

1430
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:24,084
smoking,

1431
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:28,410
you were thought I was telling
them to like give me your soul.

1432
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,650
Like they'd start shattered.
Like I can't,

1433
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:35,750
I'm sure you understand what you're
asking. Who I am. Yeah. It's my,

1434
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:39,270
my give up your belief
in Christ. Yes. Yes.

1435
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:43,460
That's who I'd be if I had quit. I loved
smoking. I mean I stopped, but you did it,

1436
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,543
but it wasn't,

1437
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:48,870
you wouldn't have a sick like a cigarette
holder and that kind of Korea crazy

1438
01:29:48,871 --> 01:29:51,240
bark. I don't know if it's just, you
can think of those old, those old,

1439
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:55,740
those old posters, you know. Oh,
they're great. And the imagery.

1440
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:57,930
It's something funny about in movies,

1441
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,630
I still can kind of romanticize cigarettes
popping in and out in the lighting.

1442
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:05,550
Yeah, the ritual of it. Yeah, you get
it. I get that. But at the same time,

1443
01:30:05,551 --> 01:30:10,050
it's so bizarre. Well, in life though,
when I see someone step out of it, sorry,

1444
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:13,500
what are you doing? I, I become that
person that way where I go like,

1445
01:30:13,501 --> 01:30:17,610
I can't believe this person is doing that.
Especially with today's knowledge,

1446
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:22,450
you that you live in the world now, you're
exposed to all that information. It's,

1447
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:27,590
in fact, I was last night watching, I'm
dying up here. Do you watch it a second.

1448
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:30,940
Okay. We'll, Goldie was up at three in
the morning and she's always slogan.

1449
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:35,520
I thought, damn, that would
work. You'd keep you use it
as a stimulant. Stay awake.

1450
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:35,751
I get,

1451
01:30:35,751 --> 01:30:38,640
if she wouldn't have that any more
smoke and drink constantly in that show.

1452
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:43,350
It makes me crazy. But it's
also 17 oh yeah. All right.

1453
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:46,950
Well we've come to see mother,
the mystery mystery songs.

1454
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:51,030
We've come to the, uh, Oh God, the final,

1455
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:53,340
this is the one we've really
been cherishing for you.

1456
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:56,490
And there was not a lot of poop today.
Like my son's warned me.

1457
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:00,770
That's interesting. Well, we
got to do our own discussion
of it. Uh, okay. Okay. Yeah,

1458
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:03,890
that was fun. But now we're going to
see if you're part of the gang. Okay.

1459
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:10,110
So here, what was that? What
did that say? See Susan,

1460
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,730
go close your eyes. No, you can,

1461
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:16,740
you won't be able to tell because it's
all in the audio, but it will please, uh,

1462
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,480
we'll, we'll bring her in for
her take on. Okay. Um, all right.

1463
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:26,510
So this guy has some advice
for just the general public.

1464
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:28,163
He's has advice,

1465
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:32,010
he has some thoughts on some things that
are actually medically related. Oh, good.

1466
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,670
And maybe you can support
or if you feel so inclined,

1467
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,100
a dispute what he suggests.

1468
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:44,600
Did you pet any kind of correct. How
disorder problems? I'm here to tell you,

1469
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,670
forget that bag or forget
about salad spaghetti,

1470
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,910
that Dick and plants and all that stuff.

1471
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,950
So I don't know if you believe
me or not that he like the same.

1472
01:31:53,951 --> 01:31:56,210
You smoked meth with a small limp.
Dick.

1473
01:31:56,390 --> 01:32:00,250
Did that get hardly any other way and
watch it get harder and than Lorez smoke

1474
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,830
harder. My Dick get this. Unbelievable.

1475
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,640
That could happen. That could happen,
right? Yeah. Okay. Well let's keep going.

1476
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:11,260
You want to take a video of whatever
I have videos. Just a still of me.

1477
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:14,710
I just got to get your face for
the audience that that's possible.

1478
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:17,320
It says a priapism is what he's
getting. Really. So really? Yeah.

1479
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,590
Now would you suggest to
somebody who's like, no,

1480
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:23,240
that is not a treatment for extra
socks. You shouldn't smoke. No,

1481
01:32:23,241 --> 01:32:25,360
he should not smoke meth.
But what if they're like,

1482
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:28,700
I've tried Viagra and
I'm trying to say no, no,

1483
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,640
I have bad but it's bad.

1484
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,670
But we were shocked to know that there
was some medicinal value to math.

1485
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,170
I say as a side effect, it's a side effect
that you get erect. It's a priapism.

1486
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:40,750
W I explained a priapism is like,
uh,

1487
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:45,450
is is what my radio parties
called clinical boner. Okay.

1488
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:50,490
It's like it gets extra from and can
come down and it can actually cut off its

1489
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:51,964
own blood supply.

1490
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,160
And this is a common
occurrence with no. Okay. But,

1491
01:32:57,161 --> 01:33:01,420
but certain medicines, certain
substances can't cause it even to the PD,

1492
01:33:01,421 --> 01:33:03,850
you fives, you know the Viagara isn't
that kind of stuff can cause it.

1493
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:08,080
This guy finds it so important. He
uses it. He likes it. Well I'll,

1494
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,670
I'll let him tell you.
Okay.

1495
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:14,200
You won't believe how good it
feels. Good. You're straight.

1496
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,700
He won't believe how good it builds.

1497
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,270
Your dickhead becomes so sensitive
that you don't need lube.

1498
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:23,800
You don't need spirit. You just strip that
Dick head this up and down four times.

1499
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:28,801
It's this band to do it and you
shoot and norm is very thick,

1500
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:31,600
hot,
white come.

1501
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:39,690
Those are details I needed.
Um, there's more, oh, this
more? Yeah. No, there's no way.

1502
01:33:39,691 --> 01:33:43,470
Just when you think it can't get grocer,
brace yourself is definitely more, okay.

1503
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,450
More calm than I'd ever done in my
life. And I know I'm gay. I love it.

1504
01:33:48,451 --> 01:33:50,910
Get blowjobs.
And I'd tell you what,

1505
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:56,040
I cannot wait to affect that.
Been hot, horny home man.

1506
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,890
I let anybody second give me a blow job.
Yeah.

1507
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:00,590
So that's, yeah, it says, here we go,

1508
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,970
good hypersexual and all that
stuff in math that happens.

1509
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,120
And you're saying like you don't
recommend anyone to do it though.

1510
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,530
Where Tom don't put words in
my mouth. I mean, how dare you.

1511
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:14,940
Why would I suggest something you
never say always or never in medicine?

1512
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,980
Well, here's the next piece that I
think both things are going to enjoy.

1513
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:24,780
My brother didn't believe me and when
he smoked with me, he put his dick.

1514
01:34:24,781 --> 01:34:26,520
I can't believe how big his dick was.

1515
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,460
He checked off for stroke
and shot the most confident.

1516
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:33,420
Every shot is like he's
only 49 and he's fine.

1517
01:34:33,421 --> 01:34:35,070
He has no neuropathy problems at all.

1518
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:40,210
He's Dick is even harder and thicker
and even more company believes me now.

1519
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,920
So to recap, yeah, he's
sold us on the math.

1520
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:49,810
Sol for erectile dysfunction is the
or other was not a believer, but he,

1521
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,340
when they smoked together,

1522
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:56,290
his brother pulled out his dick and he
couldn't believe how big his brothers

1523
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:59,900
Dick was and how much it produced. And
then he jerked off in four strokes. Yeah.

1524
01:34:59,901 --> 01:35:03,200
And it was so much and his
brother believes him now. Yeah.

1525
01:35:03,201 --> 01:35:05,030
And this gentleman

1526
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:11,720
is delighted and impressed
by very impressed. He also
pointed out medicinally,

1527
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:14,510
I was wondering if you could weigh in
on this. He said my brother is only 49,

1528
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:19,220
no neuropathy. Neuropathy
because he was having neuropathy.

1529
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,260
So he's like,
he's got like

1530
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:27,300
the neuropathy effect erections. Is
that why it's uh, with diabetes. Ah,

1531
01:35:27,301 --> 01:35:29,940
so maybe that's why he's
bringing it up at all. It's that,

1532
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:33,590
so I'm figuring he's diabetic
and so to just summarize,

1533
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:36,760
Tom Diabetic should
smoke crack and win back.

1534
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:39,350
Those are the people
that really benefit from,

1535
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:42,410
and you're putting your name on the line,
the doctor just stamp of approval.

1536
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,250
In fact, if in fact they get the, the,

1537
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,240
particularly with smoke cocaine and,

1538
01:35:48,241 --> 01:35:53,240
and sometimes it's bad diabetics get
horrible problems with, with these,

1539
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:58,010
with the diabetics are especially prone
to just severe medical problems from

1540
01:35:58,011 --> 01:36:02,270
both. Oh, horrible. Horrible, horrible.
And made these gone in short order.

1541
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:07,070
Is it possible that kid is
due for diabetic? He did it.

1542
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,580
He did it. He, you know, he could the
medical community get behind. Well,

1543
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:13,240
let's go get him. Let's get
him over to Harvard and, uh,

1544
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,900
bring them to the medical school or
unlock the mystery because the, the,

1545
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:21,910
the neuropathy line was giving me trouble
last time over this for this guy has

1546
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:25,010
been in our lives now.
I'm so glad to hear that.

1547
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:28,760
And I believe him biggest tableaus
couldn't believe it. Wait a minute,

1548
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:32,480
and I'm assuming that's his source
of his erectile dysfunction. Right.

1549
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:35,770
And that's why he's saying you're
blowing my mind. Wait, what's the,

1550
01:36:35,771 --> 01:36:37,870
the source of it is the diabetes,
the diabetes.

1551
01:36:37,871 --> 01:36:40,580
And that's why he's so geeked
to have a big hard dick. Yeah.

1552
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:44,270
From a little limp dick to a big hard day.
Now what's with a thick heart calm.

1553
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:49,100
Why is it so thick? And, and did my
wife just throw up? She was like,

1554
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:54,560
yeah. Um, it doesn't, it does
increase the thickness of your,

1555
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:59,450
you're dehydrated from math. Yeah. Right.
Yeah. And if you're sexually stimulated,

1556
01:36:59,451 --> 01:37:03,000
your prostate will begin to produce a
bit of fluid into the seminal vesicle.

1557
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:05,550
So it was probably just a little
bit more than usual. Yeah.

1558
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:08,840
He's stoked on it and he's just stoked
and he's got something coming. Well,

1559
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:12,530
so I'm going back on my private prison
thing. It may not be priapism that he had.

1560
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:15,300
It may just be his yeah.
Experience with math. Yeah.

1561
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:18,530
It sounds like what Dr Drew's saying
for our listening audience. Try it out.

1562
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:21,980
You know? See what happens. We're
going to have Tom try at first.

1563
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:25,220
[inaudible] right. Well it sounds
like he wants to be so interesting.

1564
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:27,660
Let's play it out here today.
You do anything illegal.

1565
01:37:27,661 --> 01:37:30,380
I don't want you to do anything illegal
and I don't want you to do anything or

1566
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:34,530
don't feel comfortable doing. Of course,
I promise you, if you can, Fannie body,

1567
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:37,790
you know that won't get you into trouble,
smokes and man,

1568
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:40,950
and the more you smoke
up that bow hardier deep,

1569
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,790
we'll get your dick won't get hard.
Let me try.

1570
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,780
I didn't want to see me go from too hard.

1571
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:50,010
I would do it this to clarify
and that will be tape it from,

1572
01:37:50,011 --> 01:37:53,610
this is small Dick, very
lamp and watching. Well,

1573
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:56,010
I want to know why you guys
haven't searched the land. Got It.

1574
01:37:56,020 --> 01:38:00,380
Ready? I mean, no. Oh, what happened
was I'll show it to you. I mean,

1575
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:03,750
I'm a little disappointed
when you personally,

1576
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,200
we shared this and we really
celebrated this tee shirt.

1577
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,310
There's a t shirt. No, no.

1578
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:15,330
There are two t shirts
and a hat and by the way,

1579
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:17,970
much to Christina's Chagrin

1580
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,220
it for stroke gang.

1581
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:28,480
A guy on Matt telling you to Jack Your
Dick for four stroke gang had the fourth

1582
01:38:28,481 --> 01:38:32,190
stroking motor shirt and the forest
oak and golf shirts. I would say,

1583
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:35,970
I would say that this would be,

1584
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:38,730
these are sort of billboards
against smoking crack.

1585
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:43,080
You don't know how the male mind
works. You don't get, it was like, no,

1586
01:38:43,081 --> 01:38:46,140
people don't buy. We had to
reorder this one within two days.

1587
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:51,120
We were restocking this one.
Now I have news for you.

1588
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:55,110
I'm going to Las Vegas this weekend. I
want to proudly wear that hat. Oh, I fuck.

1589
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,300
I wish I had brown hair. I would
definitely. Is there something else that

1590
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:06,460
I'm opposed to the four stroke gang as
a piece of Merch exing out half of our

1591
01:39:06,631 --> 01:39:08,400
audience.
There's no woman,

1592
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,450
normal mental faculties that
wants to wear a force. Surely.

1593
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:19,180
Oh my God. She wants to wear
shirt in Las Vegas for stroke.

1594
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,550
You're going to wear that shirt.

1595
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:27,540
She's been in this room too long.
You see what happens to people get scared.

1596
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,930
My shame diminishes. I started
participating with you guys. It really is.

1597
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:37,140
Christie. I just want
to interject. Excuse me,

1598
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:41,100
Christina saying this x is out half
the audience, the female audience.

1599
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,700
I just wanted to show you.

1600
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,820
It's the dude's getting them
to where I want to volunteer.

1601
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:51,900
Exhibit a is that a woman might wear that.

1602
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,360
She's wearing black guys who like to fuck.

1603
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:59,390
Fuck good for hot black guy and you want
to fuck me at 2195 black guys that love

1604
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,040
fuck and fuck good.

1605
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:07,380
If you were hot black guy and you love
the fuck black guys love to fucking fuck

1606
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:10,760
good. If you're a hot black
guy and you want to fuck me, it

1607
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:17,640
doesn't matter if you're hot
black guy and you want to,

1608
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:21,210
these are all listeners of
our show. Okay. Who they are.

1609
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:27,050
They're submitting videos of the try
it out. Guy Who you covered last time.

1610
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:30,030
Yes. That's the, they're all period.

1611
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:35,031
And this guy loved the fuck
the fuck if you're a hot block.

1612
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,780
What's weird though. Yeah.
It's not as disturbing.

1613
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:44,230
One of the women are doing it right.
There's charming. It's entertaining.

1614
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:48,480
But you try and tell me these chicks
won't wear the forest and they're fans.

1615
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:52,110
They're up there. There were proudly,
see, but, but again, there's,

1616
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:57,310
there's always a dude behind that. Yeah.
Yeah. There's always some guy going, oh,

1617
01:40:57,311 --> 01:41:00,700
we could do this. I want you, we'll put
a mustache. I did the great, yeah. So,

1618
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:05,530
so in a way it's not their own autonomous
decision making the results in the

1619
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:09,670
forest. It's a theory. I think some of
them would even get upset and be like,

1620
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:13,330
Dr Dre, oh, I would like to know, please
write in. Yeah. Because, because, because,

1621
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,430
because if that was your idea,

1622
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:19,820
the young lady and you
executed on your own slow clap,

1623
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,320
I will say too still cause
horror because that's,

1624
01:41:23,321 --> 01:41:27,230
we're evolving that as a
species to support. We are.
Oh really? You think so? Yeah.

1625
01:41:27,231 --> 01:41:28,660
I think true that our audience,

1626
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:32,710
we do have women that are that down
for they get done that they would self

1627
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:37,060
initiate this Tiwana no, I need
to know. I will say this in, in,

1628
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:41,560
in your defense of your theory,
when I was a touring last year,

1629
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:45,730
a lot of times women would
come up to me and go, uh,

1630
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,420
my boyfriend said to tell you yes.
And we learned this eye level.

1631
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:52,480
I work with coral reefs always go
because a woman would call with a prank,

1632
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:56,950
something. We go, okay, where's the Dude
Uber, which up to that and it always,

1633
01:41:56,970 --> 01:42:01,450
not 99% one hut, no one time there was
not, there was one time there was not.

1634
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:04,480
And we literally like befriended
her and said, you can't believe us.

1635
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:08,160
We had a neat nicknamed her and like,
you know,

1636
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,430
we just kept her around because it was
such a, it was, it was uh, you know,

1637
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:16,150
some o z a unicorn just to further
this we restocked to try it out,

1638
01:42:16,151 --> 01:42:18,760
which is that guy we restocked a ball hog,

1639
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:22,870
my water champ hat sold out.
So we had to recite that.

1640
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:27,090
And also it guess what,
guess what sold out and you hit your star.

1641
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:28,540
You're not Los Angeles shirt.

1642
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:34,630
That's a bunch of those are restocked in
the store merchant method guide to walk

1643
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:37,720
around with something unless vague. It's
just going to make the trip worthwhile.

1644
01:42:37,721 --> 01:42:39,790
It really is.
Cause I'm going to collect,

1645
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,920
see what your listeners or viewers
to see what I got. Oh you got, yeah.

1646
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:45,560
We need to know who they are, what
they're up to and I'm sorry, how to,

1647
01:42:45,561 --> 01:42:48,930
he's gonna be quite a weekend.
Your heart now.

1648
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:54,160
Wonderful people. Very nice.
This is a, this is such a treat.

1649
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:58,540
I mean I really want to make
this irregular like thing
where you come every once

1650
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:00,870
in a while. Oh yeah, yeah. The Bacon it,

1651
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:04,020
but she'll be on demand by your
viewers and listeners. Oh yes.

1652
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,570
I'd come here every week if were up to me.
It's so you got it.

1653
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:09,460
They have to want it. Day One. Believe me,

1654
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:13,480
it takes a while to you.
Last time,

1655
01:43:13,481 --> 01:43:16,690
I must admit I was much more disturbed
by the end. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah.

1656
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:21,310
So you need to up your game a
little bit, Tom. Well I think,

1657
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,440
you know the interesting
thing is you say Tom,

1658
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:26,650
but really what you're saying
is your mom's house listeners.

1659
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:30,430
You heard it from the doctor's mouth.
He doesn't think I,

1660
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:33,160
and I'd like to get into the anomalies,
the medical weird and stuff.

1661
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,440
I think you guys would like that with
me cause I think you don't have no,

1662
01:43:35,441 --> 01:43:38,890
you don't understand it did. It would,
if I could bring it to life for you,

1663
01:43:38,891 --> 01:43:42,110
I think you would have its own little
life. Well let's put a call out there.

1664
01:43:42,111 --> 01:43:47,050
You guys. Medical Anomaly, medical
word stuff. Stds in a weird, weird,

1665
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:51,300
weird, that's just weird behaviors. But
we're medical stuff. You'd be amazed the,

1666
01:43:51,301 --> 01:43:55,840
the, the array and you may not, you
know, it doesn't have to even be as sad.

1667
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:58,920
So many of your videos that
start out with me. Sad. Yeah.

1668
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,870
It could be just intriguing. I was about
to play a song that was in this folder,

1669
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:07,860
but then I realized that Dj
skull vomit sent that song. Um,

1670
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,420
that was so good.
Remember the one I played on my phone?

1671
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:11,850
I'm trying to remember it.
Yeah.

1672
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,760
I'm immediately a fan of anybody
named sculptural. I know there.

1673
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:18,770
So we had to Fart. BARF. Do you ever see
that bad fart borrow? Oh, you'd love them.

1674
01:44:18,771 --> 01:44:21,590
They were a primate masks and
you would never see their faces.

1675
01:44:21,591 --> 01:44:26,480
And they are this sort of hardcore
electronic fart bar. Jesus Christ. Look,

1676
01:44:26,481 --> 01:44:30,650
it's your life. You're like, okay. This
is called your mom's house scat anthem.

1677
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,240
Oh No. Produced by Fart Simpson. Um, yeah,

1678
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:38,510
so a doctor drew. Thank you so much. It's
such a privilege. I love seeing you guys.

1679
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:43,910
You want to say what? Are you good? Sorry.
Yeah, of course. What I said come say hi.

1680
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:48,220
At least we, we there. I
was too enraptured this, uh,

1681
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,960
your plugs. Yeah. To your plaque. Do your
plugs, come on. Oh, I get to do as plugs.

1682
01:44:54,961 --> 01:44:55,890
So you have to do it all.

1683
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:00,960
Well of course there's Dr Com where you
can find all the podcasts. Dr Do does,

1684
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,080
but thanks for having,
yeah. Tell us about the,

1685
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:08,130
and I'm sorry that this wasn't set
up. Uh, no, it's okay. The way that,

1686
01:45:08,131 --> 01:45:09,000
um,
you know,

1687
01:45:09,001 --> 01:45:12,660
drew comes in and analyzes these
things is like a very specific thing.

1688
01:45:12,661 --> 01:45:16,040
But I uh, you guys have
multiple podcasts. Yes.

1689
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:18,900
So the one we want you guys to
come on as this life podcast,

1690
01:45:18,901 --> 01:45:20,040
which you've done all that.
I loved it.

1691
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:23,140
It was going to try to hook you
up with the Janice Dickinson.

1692
01:45:23,141 --> 01:45:26,730
Loved to have a couple other podcasts.
I have to quit working so hard.

1693
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:30,360
It's really hard to pin you down and
now you're going to have a baby now.

1694
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,420
It's a mess. It's okay. See, I know
it will happen. And what's your,

1695
01:45:33,421 --> 01:45:36,580
do you have a couple of your own
as well? Well, I have one that I,

1696
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:40,560
I've done over the years with psychic
mediums, which, awesome. Yes. Sign.

1697
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:45,090
And you were amazing actually. Tom
Hated it, but Christina was great.

1698
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:45,871
It was a trip.

1699
01:45:45,871 --> 01:45:48,870
There were accurate about a lot of stuff
they predicted he was going to be a

1700
01:45:48,871 --> 01:45:51,680
movie star during, no, I
don't think, I don't remember.

1701
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:55,710
You were a little closed off.
I wanted to, I wanted to Redo.

1702
01:45:55,890 --> 01:46:00,870
I Dunno why I, I I got to
get, he was not digging it.

1703
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:05,610
I was sure I was, I was a
bit of a skeptic. Yeah. But
I liked, I liked your, uh,

1704
01:46:05,611 --> 01:46:08,220
the medium and she was very
nice. You know, they are, I mean,

1705
01:46:08,221 --> 01:46:12,870
it's funny because sometimes you get
great mediums with your guest and I think

1706
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,470
more of the spirits were coming
for Christina. Oh, she's,

1707
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:21,570
I have a better personality or they
want on that note, anything else?

1708
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:24,690
So all the, uh, part of
it that are podcasts,

1709
01:46:24,691 --> 01:46:29,691
this life you live Hashtag you live
is our popular one with addiction,

1710
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:32,850
not addiction,
but more celebrities like yourselves.

1711
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,130
And then we also have a new
one called swell patrol,

1712
01:46:35,131 --> 01:46:38,410
which is more fitness oriented.
You just show off the guns for us.

1713
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:44,670
There would is the host and so it drew
may not even be there like it's Mike show

1714
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:48,180
and he loved that video. He
sent it to us. The, Oh wait,

1715
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,280
did you send video at the woman

1716
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:56,360
pooping? Yeah, I got that.
I got that feed. That was,

1717
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:01,520
that's my catheter was Kathryn Woods
feature x y I think I just met him.

1718
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:06,170
Oh yeah, he's got, he's
got some good stuff. Yeah,

1719
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,150
but he's doing a fitness
and health podcasts,

1720
01:47:09,151 --> 01:47:13,530
which is very mainstream and we're really
digging it. I, I'm very excited for him.

1721
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:17,020
Excellent. All right. Um,
and then doctor Judith calm.

1722
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:19,110
Just go there and you can find everything.

1723

coming you guys. My favorites.

1728
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:44,430
Actually,
it's kind of funny.

1729
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:48,460
I'm taking one of my psychic mediums
to Vegas this weekend. Yes. Oh,

1730
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:52,720
I'm going to try to win some money. Oh,
good call. He didn't meet Rebecca fearing,

1731
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:57,280
but she, she's actually
going with me. Yes. Yes.

1732
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:03,420
And I'm going to ask her to tell me
what to do better. You want to come?

1733
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:08,010
I'd like to give you some cash now.
He believes in it.

1734
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:12,240
Do you mind if I go and I
come back on the simulator?

1735
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:17,430
No. Really? Seriously. I, well,
I like hanging out with Rebecca,

1736
01:48:17,431 --> 01:48:20,280
but I said wouldn't it be fun to go to,
I'm going to bed on a game.

1737
01:48:20,281 --> 01:48:25,200
What's the game? I'm betting on
Andrew the NBA finals. So yeah,

1738
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:26,580

seven is Celtics calves.

1740
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:39,390
Oh. Do you have any inclination
of what you're gonna do?

1741
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:43,570
Are we're going to put it all
on her? Yes. Yes. Interesting.

1742
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,300
Let me know how that goes. I've done that
before. And Are you going to wait for,

1743
01:48:47,410 --> 01:48:51,930
did Oklahoma was going to wage your
real money? Hell yeah. You are? Yeah,

1744
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:55,890
of course. It's called. It's
called real money. I mean,

1745
01:48:55,891 --> 01:48:59,760
you're going to throw a dime down on
this thing right now. I don't think so,

1746
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,490
although, well, we don't have
to pay my mortgage this month.

1747
01:49:02,491 --> 01:49:05,040
So I was thinking maybe I'm just joking.

1748
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:14,280
Well, if you guys want to meet
drew, there is a possibility.

1749
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:18,240
If you get into meth and
crack and serious drugs,

1750
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:22,370
he might treat you.
Yeah. You guys need to be

1751
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:27,640
a horrible way to [inaudible] having me.

1752
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:32,810
Here's drew.
Dr Drew,

1753
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:37,330
do you really? It's so uncomfortable,
but it'll make you look good on camera.

1754
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,880
I sat in a chair yesterday for a
shoot and it was a drummer's chair.

1755
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,690
It's comfortable. It's the weirdest thing.
It's supposed to be freer, Paul. Yeah,

1756
01:49:49,691 --> 01:49:52,970
this is good. I like it. Even
though I slouched down in
it. Most of the shows. Yeah.

1757
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,270
Yeah. Well thank you again for
doing this. All right. Listen,

1758

All right guys. Thanks for
listening. See you next week.

1761
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:09,683
Bye Bye.

1762
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:20,110
Did you get up after that?
But that sketch,

1763
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,470
how's it really good? My ancestors, Tommy,

1764
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,313
I'm a whore

1765
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:15,613
scanning.

1766
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,250
I don't need to my guy and

1767
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:26,940
it's not really that healthy orange juice.

1768
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,270
What do you like

1769
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:31,420
best about listening to somebody
scam? I mean, it's just like,

1770
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:32,910
I just feel it in meetings.
