00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,640
I always forget the point of these videos.
You get lost in them. Yeah. So wait,

146
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,360
which her eyes are already what?
And then she pulls this,

147
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,300
she pulls her already Asian eyes.
So she's Asian and she,

148
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,160
she does this with her eyes and she says,
I might look a little like that.

149
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,580
I smell a new bit for you. Yeah.
You got a new hour to build. Yeah,

150
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,780
I do.
What do you think I should say with that?

151
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,420
She doesn't say Ping Pong. You
added. You're tagging for me. It,

152
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,640
yeah. This girl has a lot of
really good Asian clips. Actually.

153
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,550
They're not even Asian.
She's aging and she, uh,

154
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,980
she makes a lot of videos
where she actually, she seems
like she is hood is shit.

155
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,670
I don't know where she's from,
but she acts like she's down.

156
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,060
Usually the people making these videos
are, what do you mean all videos?

157
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,970
Not that bright. Now the ones that
are like, I'm fucking this and that.

158
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:00,190
You all know me, I'm going to do
that. And you're like, all right.

159
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,330
I actually think she, this girl is
pretty self aware. Like, Hey Hitler.

160
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,820
Like, yeah, she's like a hey Hitler
vibe to her. She, she actually,

161
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,800
you know, we gotta talk about that
in a moment. Oh, most definitely.

162
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,640
It's, yeah, it's way different than
it grown. It's grown, it's grown.

163
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,610
It's grown quite a bit. Um,
where did this go? Oh No,

164
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,120
no. Hood is, fuck, I'm fucking kill
you. Like what's the point of these?

165
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,090
What is the point?

166
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,770
I'll kill a bitch.

167
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,020
I cannot believe we didn't
investigate that more Hitler. Yeah,

168
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,580
but let me finish with this girl first.

169
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,390
So my new favorite drop is this.

170
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,530
Did I do it again?
Oh,

171
00:12:56,531 --> 00:13:00,340
someone's been boning up on her
accidents this week. Practicing a lot.

172
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,710
Sounds like you're mocking or no,

173
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:07,050
I'm doing it exactly like she's doing
it does it sounds like you're kind of,

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,720
no. No. Okay. So here's what I hear.

175
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,610
Another clip of hers.
Yeah.

176
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:18,800
What does this genius have to offer and
why are you insulting her like that?

177
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,780
Sorry.
You're right.

178
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:25,090
Oh, Anna bad. My Day because I make
crazy as videos, but Chad bitch style,

179
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,100
he is talking for free and go home and
kiss your kids before you even brush your

180
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,680
teeth.
I say shit.

181
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,820
She does have a good point. That's a good
point. I know. Fuck no, I stand corrected.

182
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,230
Yeah. Now you feel stupid. So stupid.

183
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,090
Foolish. So a bitches suck. She's saying
you're, you're a horse sideboards.

184
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,180
I'm making fun of her for making crazy
videos. Like you're a bad mother.

185
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,070
You're saying I was wild.

186
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,450
But you hose are out there sucking dicks
for free and you're fucking going home

187
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:05,100
and kissing your kids. Brush you
teeth. Wow. Snaps, snap, snap,

188
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,070
uhmm pal.
Feel that burn

189
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,370
I think was interesting about these videos
is like, who's who's antagonizing you?

190
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,690
Like who's threatening you?

191
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,190
I think people make these videos where
they talk a lot of shit when they feel

192
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:28,360
powerless in their lives.
So it's, um, it's a form,

193
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,340
it's an expression of rage in a way.
It's like,

194
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,190
it's like somebody hitting a heavy
bag and beating the shit out of it.

195
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,940
That's a way of physically do it. So if
you don't, if not doing it physically,

196
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,110
you were doing it verbally.

197
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,900
You're doing it to a camera to express
maybe your rage and your lack of power.

198
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,730
I'm sure no one gives a fuck about her.
That's what my thinking is.

199
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:48,910
What is your problem with it? I'm
just saying, I think most people,

200
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,280
people who are not thinking about
you, you know what I'm saying? Right.

201
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,190
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

202
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm talking about people
who make videos that go,

203
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,190
if anyone wants to fuck with me,
I'll fuck right. That's right. Yes.

204
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,290
I don't mean to not like her.
I like her. Yes. It just,

205
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,020
I'm trying to understand where
she's coming from. Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,230
That's an awesome sound to make for the
podcast. It's also a video now. I know,

207
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:15,950
but I mean it's really cool for the
audio quality to SIF to beverages,

208
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,240
like the guy from TMZ.
Are you going to slurp like that?

209
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,950
Yeah.
Why do what I want when I want.

210
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll do the fuck I want and
nobody can tell me what my mind.

211
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,400
Okay, great. So

212
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,960
is that good? Yeah, it
was good. You do it now.

213
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,650
Ching Chong Ching Cha Ching
Chong do it like she does it.

214
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,130
She does it. She does it. All right. Um,

215
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,130
you want to feel me? You know
me? No, I'm talking about, yeah.

216
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,640
So you know what I'm saying?
I'm talking about feeling what I'm saying.

217
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,990
Long Time Mountain
filling. I me who's that?

218
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,460
That's half ounce. Oh, okay. But
that's in a proper interview.
Yeah. I'm saying, yeah,

219
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm, yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm,
yeah, that's what he sounds
like me. I'm yum. Yum, yum, yum.

220
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:20,690
Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. [inaudible]

221
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,960
there's a lot to get into.
Yeah. The video by the way,

222
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,980
if put up the video of it and,
uh, we had a profile shot going.

223
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,790
We're trying this now just to,
um,

224
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,820
really to get a feedback from the viewers.

225
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:37,860
So this is going to be a different angle.

226
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,940
You can tell us in the comments what
you think. Tell us if you like this.

227
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:45,300
Do you like the other video angle more?
Yeah. How do you want to watch that? Yeah.

228
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:48,830
How do you want to watch
the show? Let's screen. Uh,

229
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,770
so leave that up to the microphone.
It's different. It's different.

230
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,350
I see your book and I imagine it,
I finally took a shit today, babe.

231
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,060
I didn't shit yesterday, but I showed
this morning and shit all night yesterday.

232
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,700
That's not good. Yeah, it was okay
though. I just, I came out normal.

233
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,323
Hmm.

234
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,350
That's not normal at all.
What happened yesterday? Yeah.

235
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,460
I just forgot to take a dumb,
I don't know how that,

236
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,070
how do you forget it's taking
care of the kid, you know, we,

237
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:22,360
you and I were taking care of him all
day and my dad came over and then I just,

238
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:26,230
the day rolled and I forgot. I just didn't
have the urge to shit. I don't know.

239
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,180
Yeah. But it's okay. I made up for it. You
can stop worrying. I'm totally worried.

240
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:36,040
Is Everything all right now? Everything's
fine. Is Everything going to,

241
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,410
it's okay. You can stop worrying. Are
you going to make it? Yeah. How was it?

242
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,180
It was normal. It was just normal.
Like, I dunno, it was a clean break.

243
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,260
There was nothing on
the paper. Um, you know,

244
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,240
when I feel like when our son shits,

245
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,360
like he's had some fucking
disasters in his diapers lately.

246
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,130
Like I feel like guilty just wiping
it up and moving on with the diaper.

247
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:03,300
I feel like we should, we should shut the
shower, our son, you know what I mean?

248
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,190
Shit. And then bay them. Yeah.
Like he might get a bag the time,

249
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,780
I know seven times a day.
No,

250
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,620
but there should be like a baby blue
day that I can wash his asshole with.

251
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,260
Can we pay them? We do enough. Yeah. Yeah.

252
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,570
I'd like more like my instincts are
to bathe him immediately after. Yeah.

253
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,660
I mean if I shit the way he should and
all over my balls and my butt cheeks,

254
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:27,590
I might be like, you know, I'm gonna jump
in the shower after this. Right? Yeah,

255
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,140
that's what I'm saying. But we
just use wipes and we know. Yeah.

256
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,870
Let me wipe that shit
up. He's got no hair. No.

257
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,680
So you really are getting it off
of his skin. Pretty Clean Shaven.

258
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,620
What are you shaving her baby's hair
off. I shave his legs and stuff. Yeah.

259
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,870
I should have his legs in his chest.
That's awesome. Peach fuzz on his arm.

260
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,990
So I trim that. You cut it
off. Good. I use clippers.

261
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,820
Oh, you don't ever want to ask
you when you breastfeed him,

262
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,670
do you feel like going?

263
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,760
Yeah.
Are you

264
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,850
all on the graphic tee?
You

265
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,630
watch talk me dry.

266
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,823
Thirsty.

267
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,520
Well, it's always though that
gets me, oh, it's so gross.

268
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah. That's why I say it Ellis, every
time it's so weird that you did you,

269
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,490
every time you get them you go like fast,

270
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,430
come a little bit loud,
sign to suck me dry.

271
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,910
What is happening? You're
really fired up. I like it.

272
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,650
I get it. You think I'm saucy
today? You're a spicy. Yeah, I see.

273
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,330
Ooh, get sauce. Bearnaise yeah.
Yeah. You're really fired at

274
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,150
a German. It's so, it's, it minds
me. My Dad's accent a little.

275
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:13,430
I think that's why it's alarming to me.
Yeah.

276
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,530
What one your dad came over
yesterday just chillin, Bro.

277
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,990
Did you like that? Yeah, he came over
wearing like five neon colors. Yeah.

278
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,320
Did you notice it came
out of Real player player?

279
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,880
Like he had a bright neon orange jacket.
Here's what's up. And then like some, uh,

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,520
Another color, glasses. Shades were
yellow and he's like, yeah, I'm good.

283
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,700
I'm getting at, I'm doing my thing. You
feel me? Don't tell talking about I'm

284
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,460
his feathers.

285
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,520
Right. He's at the helm. What?
Mitch you, I'm saying? Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

286
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,920
Mutual home. Good motherfucker right
there. You know what I'm saying?

287
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,860
That's how you, that's how
I hear what your dad, yeah.

288
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,850
It's just how I know it's arts. Yeah.
How many other brothers and sisters,

289
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:06,350
what do you feel like? What do
you feel like when, uh, when you,

290
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,070
when your dad was spitting game yesterday?
It's so funny now that I'm a mom.

291
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,650
Like now that I'm a parent,
it kind of doesn't affect me as much.

292
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,010
It's like this weird thing happens
where you forgive your parents for their

293
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:19,860
personalities are like, now you're
just crazy. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

294
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,590
You think you've tried but he's got a
great personality. No, he's awesome.

295
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,590
But you know what I mean?
My Dad's not like, um,

296
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,820
like the all American Dad, you know, he's,

297
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,840
he's got his own stuff happening.
Very unconventional, I'd say. Yeah.

298
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,320
But Fun. Right? It's totally fun.
He's like Party Dad. He is party dad.

299
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,220
He's probably dead. I mean,
that's what I feel like.

300
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:45,690
Your dad sounds so weird.
Did he talk like that? Yeah.

301
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,470
Well he was spitting game
yesterday. Yeah. Like plans,

302
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,600
rolled takeovers kind of shit.

303
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,610
I know he lives in a really good mood
though. He loves being a Grandad.

304
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,930
I think this is really changed
him. Uh, he's really happy.

305
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,650
He keeps talking about
how good looking the is.

306
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,490
You said it like 10 times when you
left. Yeah. Doula. He was like,

307
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,730
this is a good looking kid. That's why
he's always like, some baby is so ugly.

308
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,790
This baby is not ugly. He's a really good
looking kid. Was, he's a big boy. Big.

309
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,990
Then I go, yeah, thank God. You
know, it's like he's, you know,

310
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:18,840
it makes you feel more comfortable that
he's getting sturdier and he's like,

311
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,670
but also as a man, you want your book
to be big. And I go, yeah. He goes,

312
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,230
yeah. I go, you know, I think we're
going to put Alison to sporks when he's,

313
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,950
when he's a boy and he goes as good idea.
Maybe tennis.

314
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,000
Tennis is good money. And
Dennis, I go, what about soccer?

315
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,330
Soccer's for poor people.
I go down,

316
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:42,630
we're not going to send them to Brazil
in a favela to play. He's going to play,

317
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:46,770
you know, in La. Yeah. Other kids?
No, no, no suckers for poor people

318
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,140
that is as good. There's money
in 10. Yes. How about Marshall?

319
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,590
And he's getting sponsored right
away. Yeah. Like what? He's hungry.

320
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,440
He's not going to make a living. Yeah, I
go. What about martial arts now? No money.

321
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:03,270
A martial arts. What is the money part?
I guess just like people with money.

322
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,020
Oh, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Well
then golf too, I guess. Right?

323
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,510
Which should sign him up for
golf. So boring. Oh my God.

324
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,020
What if that's his favorite
sport? I thought about that.
I mean, you never know.

325
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,610
I remember when we were, um,
probably like over 10 years ago,

326
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:21,990
my buddy read was about to have his
first kid and they knew it was a boy.

327
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,820
He was Luby's excited, you know, go
to baseball games and play baseball.

328
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,080
And I think one of, one of the other
guys, Casey or somebody goes, uh,

329
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,690
what if he doesn't like baseball?
And you'd like,

330
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:37,920
you can see it hit him in the head. Like,
I'm thinking about that. I was like,

331
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,470
well what if he lives or what have
you liked soccer? He goes, well,

332
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,930
I'm not going to go to the games,
but I still love him.

333
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,100
Please not going to support

334
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,510
his kid. Hey, I got a soccer
game today. I'll see you later.

335
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,970
It's terrible. Yeah, he was. He was
sold on that. Like I'm not going,

336
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,380
I'm as too boring. What if our son is into
something retarded that we don't like?

337
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,980
Like what's the most boring thing to
watch swimming, but that's fucking boring.

338
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:08,660
No swimming I could watch cause it was a
race. So race, race is always exciting.

339
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,230
Uh, if he sucks at swimming,
that would say, yeah,

340
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,900
like if he was like always laughs,
like swim.

341
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah. But no, I don't, I think is when
it's your kid, you don't really care.

342
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:24,040
I mean I would, I would go watch
them do anything. Don't care.

343
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,770
I'd watch him take a shit. Yeah,
we do watch and take shits.

344
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,560
That's true all the time. All the
time. We hold a mess. He's shitting.

345
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,180
That's my shit's in our hand.
I like, I kinda like it though.

346
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,330
It's like he's doing something,
you can't do anything wrong, kid,

347
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:37,230
whatever you want to do.
We support that.

348
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,080
Did Not say that I actually
meant to hit this. I'm like,

349
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,360
oh, but that button's right
next to the others. Yeah, it is.

350
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,870
I'm putting a little marker on it and
then her priorities. There you go.

351
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,590
There you go. There you go. Okay.
All right. Um, okay. Thompson Cora.

352
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, I got to tell people this
real quick. Um, God blesses you,

353
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,750
but also to anybody that bought the,
what blesses you?

354
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,030
Anybody that got the cane shirt. Um,
I've gotten a number of messages.

355
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,590
We would try and respond to everybody.

356
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,900
It was a presale and the Presale,
you know,

357
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:23,480
you sell it up to a point and then
they ship. So there's been a delay.

358
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,400
And for people that didn't know,
I apologize.

359
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,550
And here's what we're doing to
anybody that ordered a cane shirt,

360
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,480
you're all getting an extra
free item from our store.

361
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,790
Um, and that's how you, what it is.
It's just going to come in there. Uh,

362
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,610
but everybody,

363
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,590
everybody that ordered ones would get a
free extra item to make up for the fact

364
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,690
that a lot of people didn't
know it was a Presale,

365
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:48,380
even though it says it on the
order form. Um, additionally,

366
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,530
next week we should have a new
shirt and it will not be a presale.

367
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,120
It'll be an, uh, shipping, uh,
ship immediately order. Um,

368
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,970
so hopefully we'll be ready
to announce it next week.

369
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:06,890
I'm not even announcing it until those
are in stock. It won't be a Presale,

370
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,900
but I'm just letting you
know now if you got it,

371
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,460
you're getting an extra free
item to make up for any delay.

372
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,750
We just wanted to point
that out, okay. Okay. Okay.

373
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,540
What's the free item? Is
it, did you shave something,

374
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,920

I didn't want to tell anybody
but his pubic hair. Yes.

376
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,050
Do you think someone would pay a
premium for Tom Cigarettes? Pubic hair?

377
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,790
I would guess no.

Painted cause he did the, uh, that's
the youtube safe version. Yeah.

419
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,610
I liked that one better than on 60 plasma.
It's a much more hardcore,

420
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,330
but you ain't no mill Tommy. My,
Oh, is that her? Is that key man?

421
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,990
Oh No,
it's just another cool chick

422
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,600
tongue. My stick your
tongue in my os. How?

423
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,430
Hi, I'm Kim Man. I am a model. Yeah.

424
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,590
For more 60 plus melts
now 63 years of age.

425
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Yeah. This is my second time
around here. And surprisingly,

426
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I have an experience with two
young gentlemen who have a really,

427
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,200
really huge penis.

428
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,610
Oh God.
I liked her.

429
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:59,060
They to these tenets mutually
satisfying that she said that like,

430
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,470
I couldn't believe it. They
truly satisfied. I'm sorry

431
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,620
with two gentlemen especially.

432
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,040
What is amazing is,

433
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,560
is that I was able to take really,

434
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,570
really hard long penis
into my vagina as well as,

435
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,480
and there is solid.

436
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,990
Yeah. Her cadence is amazing. Yes.

437
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,730
I love when people who don't speak
English natively talk cause they do it so

438
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:39,430
differently.
So I'll sort of like the little stuff,

439
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:42,310
like making something plural
when it's not so funny.

440
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,640
Jan Demands, they're not gentlemen sweety.
Those are gentlemen you need to make.

441
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:53,320
You need a mason gentleman's. Yeah, yeah.
Real skew notion of gentleman's. Um,

442
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,960
well back to Hitler when,

443
00:30:55,961 --> 00:31:00,310
Hey Hitler first came on the scene.
Yeah.

444
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,590
It's like we just get,
sometimes it's just like a drop.

445
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,850
We don't really look into it. We're
just like, this is pretty funny. God.

446
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,590
So we played that and
then people were saying,

447
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,670
I think you guys are not hearing this
correctly. She's saying, hey Heather,

448
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:20,030
hey hiller her Hemler or Hitler,
Hitler,

449
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,430
Hillary's right hand man.
Let's not forget handler.

450
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:29,140
He doesn't get as much attention.
So then,

451
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,810
um, we go, okay, that's, it's, it's,

452
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,500
it's debatable. Right? So then last week,

453
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,060
um,
another audio clip came to our attention,

454
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,970
right? A blue band pulls it, sends it.

455
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,710
So people are saying,
that's Nicholas.

456
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,580
Other people like myself think it's lit.

457
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,470
Right. Um, and people were
like, no, no, no. It's,

458
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,200
it's know there's a debate.
Well,

459
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,260
what didn't occur to us until
a few days ago was, well,

460
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,030
let's look into these
videos a little more.

461
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,940
The videos on her page.
This is a girl named Danny.

462
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,710
Um,
she has countless videos.

463
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,910
I really don't know how many,

464
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:33,440
I don't know if there's a way to tell
when you get to there. Maybe there is. Um,

465
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,830
let's see. How many videos did she have?
Can you tell when you just hit this?

466
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:40,580
I Dunno. Danny Blue Band. Blue Band.

467
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,860
I can't really, I can't tell
grid. Does the grid tell you?

468
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,450
But it doesn't tell you how
many though. Right? People,

469
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,820
that's how many subscribers she
has there anyways, it is a lot.

470
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,210
It's a lot of videos
were paging through it.

471
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,400
I go out and just put up a ton of stuff.

472
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,230
What's one of the first videos
I see asking for Hitler's help?

473
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,220
H I. T. L. E. R.

474
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,290
Crazy Hitler asking for his help.

475
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,660
Hitler. It's me being me. I just,

476
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,263
yeah,

477
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,620
Danielle. Okay, so we know that the hills
a problem we talked about before it.

478
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,050
Yeah.
A few videos later.

479
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,540
The video is titled Asking for
Hitler's help. Number two. Sure.

480
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,530
So it's a second time.
It's so weird.

481
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,160
Hey, Hiller is Nini? Yup.

482
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,820
I have a really big problem right now
and it has to deal with Malen Allen,

483
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,940
new person. Oh Geez, lily.

484
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:05,941
Hey is stuck and smelling Allen
belly button and I'm a get him out,

485
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,440
but I can't,

486
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,330
so could you help me get him out?

487
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,940
So

488
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,620
that was a fear of going to help
with this. Hey, I don't have,

489
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,603
okay,

490
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,210
I'm having a really hard time getting
him out and I got my belly button.

491
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,660
Here's the thing too,
is that there's only one Hitler,

492
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,050
like after roller to most people
stop naming their children,

493
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:39,280
adults or Hillary as a surname.
So this is the fewer she is, she,

494
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:42,170
there's no other Hitler that, who else
could help like that? I mean, obviously,

495
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:46,210
I mean obviously I'm saying what else
could help? Like even in the afterlife,

496
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,870
he must have some power. They're probably
evil powers and maybe that's why she's,

497
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,240
she's uh, you know, back in
the dark in the lower, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I think she's,

498
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,630
she's saying a Baltimore, you know,
right. Yeah. Wow. Maybe. Yeah.

499
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,330
She's interesting by the way.
So her name is Danny. Yeah.

500
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,840
And she refers to people that watch
these videos and likewise. Dany JAKKS no,

501
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,540
that's great branding. It
is great branding. You know,

502
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,040
she's on top of a branding game.

503
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,940
This is called cause a video here
called warning about a lesbian video.

504
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,310
I don't know what this is about.
Um,

505
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,180
all right.
I only put ads.

506
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,370
Ruins isn't Louis Tomlinson.
That's the guy from one direction.

507
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
Is that right?
I don't know.

508
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm not a fan because
she has a lot of um hmm.

509
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,230
Let's see.

510
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,330
Isn't English pop? So yeah, I remember
of the, of the group one direction. Um,

511
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,840
she has a lot of videos to him.

512
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,800
Um,
let me see.

513
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,730
So to Hitler and then this
guy from one direction,

514
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,520
those are her two of blogging.

515
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,570
She has some to Harry styles who I
believe's another one direction guy.

516
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,460
That's a really crazy Hitler. Um, yeah.

517
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,090
Then she says, this is a
video called telling Louis
Tomlinson, I'm pregnant again.

518
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,840
MMM. MMM. MMM. Okay. Okay.

519
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,350
So you go through these and then it
says singing happy birthday to an end.

520
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:27,060
The title of the video. Big words. Yeah.

521
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:31,680
Lips and it's on youtube titles on Youtube
titled that way the word is totally

522
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:35,820
spelled out, not like astericks
or so. Yeah. Wow. So now there's,

523
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,350
there's no debate. Um,
it's not a very nice title,

524
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,760
I think even for your dany acts. But
here's the thing, much like, you know,

525
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:48,330
she's just reading off with the person's
name is, is that her fault that she's,

526
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,030
she's just repeating what's given her big
words. Yeah, I dunno man. I don't know.

527
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:58,110
There's, there's so many
videos, there's so many videos.

528
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,393
Um,

529
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,590
there's even one where she says
something to Sophia Smith and she's like,

530
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,230
Sophia Smith is bad.
And then,

531
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,130
and then the next week is called eating
Sophia Smith Pussy. Really? Yeah.

532
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:14,940
And she just looks the air.
What the fuck this chick is whacked.

533
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,490
Um, while she's off her meds. Big Time.
Yeah. I don't know what's going on.

534
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,293
Hey Dany yaks

535
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,550
talk about a personal moments on
'em because it's really personal.

536
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,454
But yeah,

537
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,570
I just have to say to those

538
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,540
like wanting to do, um, okay.

539
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,490
I basically don't why being on?

540
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,420
Because it's really
uncomfortable for me on top.

541
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,500
How to do annual SEC's annual. Yeah. Um,

542
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,940
uh,
why being on top?

543
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,900
It's really uncomfortable for me.
Plus I don't know how it is.

544
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,180
Do Annual Sec's annual site?
Maybe Hilary.

545
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,250
I love being on the bottom just because
oral sex there's a lot more comfortable

546
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,590
cause oral sex.

547
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,060
Sex is good for other people
that I just like oral sex better.

548
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,390
What up? No, you're leaving
that out all together.

549
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,960
I really don't usually talk about this
stuff on you to just be cause there are

550
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:52,560
like kids on youtube. Um, then

551
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,990
tell him all about annual section.
Then the Hitler stuff is normal for you.

552
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,140
Annual sex is um hmm.
Interesting choices we're making.

553
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,210
Yeah. I wonder if Heather can help you
with the annual sex and the click. Yeah.

554
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,270
Finding the click. Touch my click just
lik that motherfucker right there.

555
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,470
That's wrong with people.

556
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,770
There's a video here called asking
Simon Cowell to do me a favor. See,

557
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:21,170
I don't know if this is reaching the
people you're meeting this school.

558
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,350
I don't think it is. I think, no, I
think nobody that you're targeting.

559
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,503
Is that right?

560
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,993
Hey Simon,

561
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,400
I know you're actually a
one directions manager,

562
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:38,140
but could you like do me
favor like really quick?

563
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,640
Um, yeah, you got it.

564
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,350
I'm going to mail a gift to,

565
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,290
to lily for Valentine's Day
and if I do send a gift,

566
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:00,280
I dunno. I mean for her to think
that Simon cow was going to get that,

567
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,480
it's almost,
it's almost less likely that Simon cow.

568
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,950
We'll help you then Hitler will.

569
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,720
Yeah, I kind of agree. I don't understand
why you think Simon's a harder target.

570
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:15,010
No one's looking for Hiller. Yeah,
everyone's out for Simon, so yeah,

571
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,150
he really got an aim

572
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,590
a little lower. Yeah. I don't mean,

573
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,230
I think you should start with maybe
like a, like a mayor. The local dude.

574
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,530
Yeah. Maybe somebody on the city
council and then be like, Hey,

575
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:31,630
will you help me get this guy out of
a belly button that he's stuck in?

576
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,690
Because Hitler and Simon
callow are very busy guys.

577
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,940
Hello? First of all, he's
dead. Yeah. Um, he has a lot
of evil things to do. We can't,

578
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,140
but you can't bother and burden
him with one direction questions.

579
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,030
But I, but oddly enough, I, I could see
Hitler being like, I enjoy one direct,

580
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,360
like I could see him liking the
band on accent is very entertaining.

581
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,190
It's five white guys. I don't even
know if I realize this is nice,

582
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,820
but I don't really see what's there.
What do you know their songs? No,

583
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,190
I don't know their songs, but
they're, I know they're immensely, oh,

584
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:16,740
we can't play that on this
show anyways. Uh, yeah,

585
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,410
I'd say we should listen to them.
Oh yeah. And there's one here.

586
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:24,000
It's a nine second video. It says turning
Justin Bieber back into a male. Hmm.

587
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,883
I Dunno.

588
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,340
Back in to a male.

589
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,070
Is this for Hitler?

590
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,150
Hitler. Hitler request. It says it's a
spell. Oh, she's doing what she does.

591
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:42,470
She does spouse. Yeah. Yeah.
Wow. It's a lot happening.

592
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,410
You think if you had a
kid that was like this,

593
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,860
you may want to pay attention
to the youtube videos.

594
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm interested about this right
here because she has a video here.

595
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,920
I'll talks about the ying Yang
twins. Oh, I like those guys.

596
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,690
Yeah. Like, uh,

597
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:16,050
trying to get you off and they're
actually doing the dirty work.

598
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,620
So Amalia,

599
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,590
who's dirty work doing the dirty work?

600
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,770
Mama Mia, like, yeah.
Yeah. Like suggests she is,

601
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:34,540
her world is Yang Yang twins,
one direction.

602
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,040
Hitler, you know, housing, right.

603
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,523
Houses.

604
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,860
So this is, this is feeling very Shane
leash. That was going to say that.

605
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:49,010
And you know what's interesting,
the common thread with
all of these cooky shoes,

606
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:51,470
you tubers. Yeah. Poor audio quality.

607
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,470
You may never know how to produce
a decent video. Shane Lea,

608
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,100
same problem with the beeps and the yeah.

609
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,850
And the um, and then the
rappers, the fake rappers,

610
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:09,250
the music beds always too high on
their stuff. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

611
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,020
That's a sure sign of mental illness.
Kind of do this for you real quick.

612
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:14,923
Sorry.

613
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,130
Mid Show break now

614
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,970
because I need to be in there.
The Ah,

615
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,310
the little overkill.
Little over done. Okay.

616
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,400
So we solved the Hitler Nicholas Debate.

617
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,350
Um, you know, a lot of times
advertisers have asked, they go,

618
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,020
how do you feel about, um, a pre produced,

619
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,250
uh, advertisement? In other words, we
just give you a file and you play it.

620
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,270
And my feeling has always been no,
I think,

621
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:08,810
I think speaking directly to the
audience with products that we actually,

622
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,350
you know, use and endorse always works
better. There's more of a connection.

623
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,040
But there's this one ad that came in
where it was pitched to us and I said,

624
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:20,814
you know what?

625
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:26,130
I think it'll still work for our audience
even though it's not us reading the

626
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:28,800
copy it's made and then we play it.
Okay.

627
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,740
And so this is the first time
I'm playing it here on show.

628
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,150
Um, and you know, obviously if
you guys don't like it, you know,

629
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,680
I'll tell them and we'll read the copy,
but I just thought, let's give it a whirl.

630
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,740
So here's a, our mid show, um, ad

631
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,540
love,
delicious homemade desserts,

632
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:50,730
but recipes can be complicated
and takes so long to make

633
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,813
measuring

634
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,910
for delicious desserts
guarantee

635
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,713
delicious

636
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,980
scrumptious kids will devour this.
Similar A,

637
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:25,120
here's the cake mix, chips, marshmallows,

638
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,650
chocolate cookies.

639
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,430
Now here's one of my favorites,
just syrup, sugar, cinnamon,

640
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,710
and then just layer in some biscuits
for fresh and warm. Sticky buns.

641
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,660
There you go. I love this.
Do you know that I there,
the books are everywhere now.

642
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,470
Kicked there like at the pharmacy
and stuff. Yeah, I love it.

643
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,360
Well I think we got the verdict.

644
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,060
This is an ad we can play on the show.
I think you'll like it. I like it.

645
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,520
I mean hopefully the audience likes it.
I feel good about it.

646
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:04,230
What a great product. Clever marketing.
Yeah. Clever branding. Clever,

647
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:06,420
clever, clever. Pan On and
where you're going next.

648
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:08,680
But do you want to play the
thing that I brought in? Okay.

649
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,400
So do you want to set this up?
Cause I don't really know.

650
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,430
Like tell them what you did.
Well,

651
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,790
so on that steep bro,
I had a licensed psychotherapist on mark.

652
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,730
Uh,

653
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,730
mark Barone was on and he's from Seattle
and we talked about Carl Young and

654
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,200
synchronicity and I thought since
I have a therapist on the line,

655
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,830
why not have him assess your artwork and
given an analysis on what he thinks is

656
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,510
going on there.
Legitimately.

657
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:46,890
I've never heard you just said play this.
And I said, what am I playing? Go. Oh,

658
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,620
just just play it. Just play
it. So you had him look at it.

659
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:54,420
So this is a Skype session
with a psychotherapist and
we finished that steep bro

660
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:55,440
and I go, Hey, one more thing.

661
00:46:55,441 --> 00:47:00,420
Can you look at my husband's artwork and
just tell me what you see in the art if

662
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:04,500
it's normal.
And did he pull up my Instagram?

663
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,750
I emailed him a screen grab
of the painting that you did

664
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,360
call her home at last home. At last. I
didn't know the name of the painting.

665
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,890
So when you say the painting, I
have to figure out which one. Okay.

666
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,680
So this is what you did in Denver.
This is, this is on Instagram.

667
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:25,580
So the listeners can go to
your Instagram cigarette Tom,

668
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:30,160
and look at this quote,
painting art work. And

669
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,480
let's just see what a
licensed psychotherapist
says about what you through.

670
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:35,900
What does it signify here?

671
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,150
So with me is Mark Brown and he
is a licensed a psycho therapist,

672
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:46,390
Highmark by Christina. Thank you for
joining me. I really appreciate this.

673
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,910
Thanks for having me on. Yeah. So, um,
I've just emailed you my husband's,

674
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,070
um, art work that he did. He stayed
in a condo in Denver and the,

675
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,410
all the comedians leave behind
a piece of art for the home,

676
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,300
the house that they stay in. And first
of all, what are your credentials,

677
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,440
um, in, in psychotherapy? If you could
just let us know your background,

678
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,620
what's called a and m a,
which means I have a masters,
master of arts in sciences.

679
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,710
So,
but basically you are a,

680
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:21,810
you're a professional mental health
person. Yeah. Seven years for awhile.

681
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,620
Okay. So I've sent you the artwork
that we've been discussing.

682
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:30,550
If you could take a look at it and just
tell me, uh, what do you see here? What,

683
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:34,010
what would the mental health of a
person making this type of art or what,

684
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,360
what does it look like?
And please be honest.

685
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,710
Well, uh, so there's, there's a what, uh,

686
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,410
what I've never seen right away is
there's a lot of phallic energy here.

687
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,130
Interesting. There's a, first
of all, there's, this gun

688
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:57,490
is pointed and I don't know if that is,
this is a self portrait or not.

689
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,030
I think he might be.
Yeah.

690
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:07,360
Um, so there's this gun
with it with, uh, with, uh,

691
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,580
and it's purple, purple
gun with a red kind of,

692
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,420
some fire are kind of shooting
out of the front of it.

693
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,420
And then it's got this,

694
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:25,270
it looks like a male figure space.
So the gun is pointed towards his face.

695
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,750
And the other Phallic element is that
he's got a really long tongue that's

696
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:31,090
hanging out of his mouth.

697
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,110
So it indicates that there's some,

698
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:41,160
you know, maybe fear of this, of this
entered maybe this new students, this,

699
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,980
sorry. There's the way that he
is looking at it, the eye is,

700
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,840
his eyes are really like bulging out.

701
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:50,700
So it's like there's this like fear,

702
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,700
like obsession, you know,
uh, uh, Dick Obsession. Yeah.

703
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,570
This energy sounds about right.
And then what's,

704
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,600
what's interesting is that above
his head and above the gun,

705
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:08,630
there's this,
there's this kind of half,

706
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,160
half circle above him, which, which uh,

707
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:16,870
which looks a feminine,
I would say

708
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,930
it's a dark son. I told
him, but just listen

709
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:27,300
and it's, and it's black.
It's, it's pitch black. Yeah.

710
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:31,250
And so that's kind of like hovering above.

711
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,320
And so there's like this, um,
this female energy, which is like,

712
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,400
uh, you know, dark and
mysterious and powerful.

713
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,663
Wow.

714
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,940
Is it both is above him and
then, and then he's, uh,

715
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,340
yeah,

716
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,690
he's kind of, you know, like,

717
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,160
okay,

718
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,390
bound by this, you know, this,
this, uh, his own energy,

719
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,630
you know,
and then there are these,

720
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,170
okay.

721
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,880
His little fingers down at the bottom.

722
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,350
Okay.

723
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,750
It's, they kind of look
like, like claims as well.

724
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,780
They're bushes. The
bushes, you know, the, the,

725
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,970
the birthday, I'm sorry, when
did your husband's birthday?

726
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,920
April 16th. Four days from
the fears seen Aries? Yes.

727
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,230
Ah,

728
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,090
yeah. So fire, he's a fiery guy.

729
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,610
Very, so the, actually that,

730
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,140
can I tell you what I
actually painted was my second

731
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,700
okay.

732
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,820
Option. Oh, really? What was
the first one? The, first of
all, I should tell you this,

733
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,730
the way that I drew that painting,
it's the way that I draw it. You too,

734
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:38,390
with the bulging eyes and the nose.
It's my go to profile,

735
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:42,830
how I know the, um, the first
option that I was going to do.

736
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,630
And I only had second
thoughts. I was like, ah,

737
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,250
I don't know if they'll hang it up here.

738
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:51,251
I was just going to draw a big cock with
balls and have it just shooting ges out

739
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:52,334
onto the,

740
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,100
and isn't that interesting that Mark's
assessment is that it's valid because the

741
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:03,050
tongue is kind of a cock kind of sort
of how I would've drawn it. Yeah. Yeah.

742
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:07,280
There's a dick shooting his load
at your and your mouth. Yeah.

743
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:11,120
Is it a self portrait? No, it's
just, that's always how I draw

744
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,510
the me part. Is this,
um, the ominous? Yeah.

745
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,050
I don't, by the way, I don't hear mental
illness. Like you like to bring up black,

746
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,340
that black thing. He said it's supposed
to represent the s it's the sun.

747
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:26,743
Yeah.

748
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,393
Yes,

749
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,930
we got that to you. But it
looks, it's a black side

750
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:39,400
and it's, and it's shaped like a,
it's kind of shaped like a breast,

751
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,360
right.
And oppressive female breasts at energy.

752
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,200
So it's like this aggressive energy,
kind of like damp and his fire.

753
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,863
I wonder who that is.

754
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,890
Weird.
Huh?

755
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,870
So areas is a very
vascular and fiery science.

756
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:04,630
So I'm not surprised at all to get
a little bit, we were about it.

757
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,110
Energy. I feel it. I really feel,

758
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,990
I'm really not surprised that,
um, that there's this fiery,

759
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,610
fiery energy there.

760
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,350
Oh Man. Oh, I'm sorry. So that's
what you see in those, those bushels,

761
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,950
those things with fire.

762
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,743
I think there are,

763
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,440
there are a little kind of, which is
a fire. Yeah. Plain sexual energy.

764
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,250
Would you say

765
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,780
sexual or creative energy? They can be,
they can be kind of one in the same.

766
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,720
So you're dampening my creative. Yes.
I'm breaking your spirit essentially.

767
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,880
Like you have all this
phallic energy tonight.

768
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,490
I mean, that's what I've been
trying to get out with an it. Well,

769
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:53,560
it's actually a little more than that
if you want to keep Martin current

770
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:54,980
assessment. Yeah, a little deeper.

771
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:59,981
I would say maybe those are often the
I and the energy I would say is usually

772
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,890
identified as sexual in our culture. You
know, there's this focus on, you know,

773
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,780
male energy and you know,
we'll just everybody, right.
Everything revolves around,

774
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,260
you know,
the Friday and I think libidinal energy,

775
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:17,240
you're redirecting your creative. And
I'm, I'm obviously squashing your,

776
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:19,340
the dark cloud above. Yes. Uh Huh. Okay.

777
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,000
How's sex? Right. So that's the narrative.
I'm not saying that that's true,

778
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:27,990
but still what he's really
looking at is the gun,

779
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:32,700
which really I think over the represents
sexuality and then the little bunches

780
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:37,701
of planes underneath it or maybe more
just the creative energy is coursing

781
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:40,110
through his veins all the time.

782
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,980
Hmm. Interesting. And then
the oppressive, sorry,

783
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,470
does any of this makes
sense? No, I love it.

784
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:51,030
And then the oppressive female figure
that's dampening his sexual energy,

785
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:51,870
is that what you're saying?

786
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,540
I Dunno. You know, there's some fear.

787
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,910
I think there's just maybe
a little bit of fear.

788
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,090
I love that. I've always
been scared of you. I know.

789
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:04,560
That's why I love it that someone
else sees it. Yeah. I love it. I love,

790
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:06,910
love having an expert.
Isn't it great.

791
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,410
You should have mark do
more of your artwork. Yeah.

792
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,440
And also I'd like to have a gallery
person assess it as per value c and I,

793
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,560
I wanted to get a real artist to
critique it and I actually, I,

794
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:22,650
I tried and I couldn't do it in time by
the way that Shauna recognize like real

795
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:25,620
recognize real art talent.
Yeah. And then another artist,

796
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:30,400
you used my piece for inspiration. Oh
right. That was great. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

797
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:34,450
Okay. So he did really, did you see what
he did? I did. It was really spectacular.

798
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,150
I reposted it on my Instagram.
It is not so much better.

799
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,400
It's like a real artist
did it, you know, I love it

800
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,880
around the power because hey,
come on women or power for it.

801
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,790
Uh, uh, difficult because the drawing
is fraught with horrible things.

802
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,260
Terrifying things.

803
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,340
I think it's, I think it's, I think
it's great. I think he has a healthy,

804
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:05,900
uh, potentially healthy, a youthful energy

805
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,540
about him. That's interesting.
Cause he is 57 years old it,

806
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,390
yeah. No, well energy about him though.

807
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,630
Sometimes the incorrect on the,
you know, yeah. You old man.

808
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,560
He's very spry. Yeah.
He's very, very well.

809
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,960
So, yeah. Yeah. You know,

810
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:30,360
the ominous kind of breast of could be,
oh,

811
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,960
you let him continue to thing. I'm
57. Yeah. You're a horrible person.

812
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,170
That's good fun. It
also just be, you know,

813
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:43,120
that having to be having to be this,
this adult,

814
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:44,743
you know?

815
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,160
Interesting. Yeah. That
makes the, uh, the,

816
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:52,161
the power that tells him
no to his penile desires.

817
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,453
No.

818
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,250
If having to conform to
this, uh, to this, uh,

819
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:03,100
idea, uh, the, you know, what an
adult male is supposed to be. It

820
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,210
interesting. So yeah, that
would make sense. He just,

821
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,070
this is my husband's our work and he
just had a child with me and yeah,

822
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:12,210
that makes a lot of sense.

823
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,810
And you know, he's uh, yeah.
You know what's hilarious?

824
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,040
The tongue that the tongue was hanging
out, you know, it was just so, um,

825
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,130
whimsical, you know, it's just kind of
whimsical 10 code for, to, so it's like,

826
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,380
yeah, there's this ominous like
have to be a parent, but also,

827
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:39,020
you know,
being a useful kind of plants.

828
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,470
This guy reminds me of my cousin Bri.
Bri. Yeah. The way he sounds, he's sweet.

829
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:44,440
He's very sensitive. Should I
keep going? There's no other,

830
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,120
I mean that's the assessment
of your art work. I, there's,

831
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,790
there's more detailed if you
want to listen to it later.

832
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:54,440
I also asked him if you were normal
because you watch so much murder.

833
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,300
All the murder shows. Yeah. Do
you want to know the answer? Sure.

834
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,310
He said that actually,
yes,

835
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:05,840
because you're in touch with your dark
side and that it's a really healthy

836
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:09,290
expression of being in touch with one's
dark side. So there you go. You're,

837
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:13,340
I asked him to rate you on a scale of one
to 10 your mental health. And he said,

838
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:16,390
I, you know, and in all
fairness, he's like, I can't
really do that cause I kind of,

839
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,750
I'm familiar with both of you from the
show, the podcast, and I can't do that,

840
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,160
but I'd give him like an eight,

841
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,420
eight meaning on a scale of one
to 10 your mental health. Oh,

842
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:30,530
he listens to this show? Yes. Oh, and he's
familiar, you know, it's kind of biased.

843
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,670
Sounds like he's really
cool guy. He's sweet. Yeah.

844
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,640
You told him I'm 57 I
did. Yeah. Well I was,

845
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:42,440
I thought he asked me how old does he
look? In all fairness, I forgot. Okay.

846
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:45,140
So just so he knows now since
he listens to this show,

847
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:50,350
I am 36 and someone is having
a big birthday this year.

848
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,584
Let's talk about,

849
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,960
let's talk about that birthday
that's coming up for you this year.

850
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,590
I won't be able to see
this birthday for a long.

851
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:01,923
Really interesting.

852
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:13,050
What birthday do you have
this year? 30. And then plus,

853
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:17,090
how many are you excited for it?
No Big One. Can I tell you it was,

854
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:21,650
what's

855
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,190
devastating

856
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,000
is that Allie really have 10 decent
years left and then it's like the decline

857
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,360
towards death, you know, absolute 50 is,

858
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:34,160
and then you're just on a downward.
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's true.

859
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,250
But you can have a really
good run for 10 years. No,

860
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:41,870
I think for about 20 plus your second
if you're in decent health. Right.

861
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:45,200
50 to 70 is a really good
run, I think. Okay. Yeah.

862
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,230
But then when are you going to rehab?
When are you gonna get your second wife?

863
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,730
I don't think that's going to happen
until after 50 you think I have 10 years

864
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:57,640
left on this marriage and then, yeah. And
you're gonna get your 20 year old? No,

865
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:02,450
I would say 15 years.
Oh, you and I have left.

866
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,870
I think so. And then you're going to
trade me out. Yeah. Okay. That's not bad.

867
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,150
That's not bad. Good run. Real good.

868
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,180
Run 40 can you believe it?

869
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:15,560
I never thought I'd see 40 I
thought I'd be dead by now.

870
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,120
You know when you're 15 years old
and you're like already man. Wow.

871
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,080
What do you think you're going to be with?
I'll probably be like,

872
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,160
oh my second marriage. Yeah. Well I
don't think you'll get married again.

873
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:29,060
I think you're just going to
have, yeah, countless lovers.

874
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,840
Parallelize the few air lava
pool boys and stuff. Yeah,

875
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:36,860
I'll bang like hot young things. I won't,
I wouldn't, I can't marry after you.

876
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:38,000
I love you too much.

877
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,300
I would really be devastated
if we divorced for like a
whole day or two and then

878
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:48,410
I'd have to find someone else to grow.
How sad would you be if we split?

879
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,970
It didn't really think about it.
What would you do? Seriously?

880
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,320
What'd you even marry again? I don't
see myself marrying again. Too much.

881
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,570
It's too horrible, right? Yeah.
What would I want to marry again?

882
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,200
I don't want to marry. No,
seriously. No, it's too much.

883
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:07,860
It's like it's your whole life with this
person. What I would do is project life.

884
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,610
You know, I'd probably go
through like my intense, um,

885
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:19,360
you know, intense like slut
phase, right? It's normal, right?

886
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:23,360
So you go like, you know, you bag
like a hundred slots and then you go,

887
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,980
I got to fucking keep it together.

888
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,510
And then you find one that you're going
to date for a while. Then she's like, oh,

889
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,660
I can't wait for my wedding day.
And you go, oh, see you later.

890
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,860
How'd he goes on to the
next one? For sure. Yeah.

891
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,103
And then you're like,

892
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,860
it wasn't a towel.
And this is like,

893
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:46,140
this goes for almost all of
the moments in the scene.

894
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:51,141
It wasn't until somebody was actually
there telling me you have to in you or you

895
01:01:52,201 --> 01:01:55,440
have three in you that like it actually,
it kind of clicked. And I'm like,

896
01:01:55,441 --> 01:01:59,430
oh my God, this is actually
happening and I'm proud of my song.

897
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:04,440
That'll be, that'll be you after
the divorce. Yeah, for sure.

898
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:09,420
To Send me three and me. No. You know
what? I would jog. Just be alone a lot.

899
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,990
Drink a lot and read.
Yeah, I do. Just quiet.

900
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,900
I don't think I'd want to deal with
dude's anymore. You know, you're all,

901
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,900
you're all over it and imagine
aren't you just fucking over?

902
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,550
Probably 55 I get mad. Yeah.
Just blow my brains out.

903
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:27,450
No, I moved to Tahiti. That's what I
would do. And just live on an island.

904
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,190
I wouldn't even fuck with society anymore.

905
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:33,810
If we divorced a 55 I would go
to Ellis will be grown. Right.

906
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:38,910
Almost down when he's in college.
I'll go live in Tahiti. Yup.

907
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,880
And just live on the
island fish. Yeah. Dude.

908
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:48,000
Wild out and just get weird. Oh
yeah. Homesteading, whatever.

909
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:54,270
A bunch of plastic surgery.
Big chompers.

910
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:58,890
Big Old Steve Harvey's in my mouth.
Hey,

911
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,190
you're 22 I'm 55 Aria.

912
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,110
I want your veneers to be extra
bag and hang out at clubs in Vegas.

913
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,050
You guys want to have some drinks on me

914
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,440
and I'd be like that all guys
bought and I was all drag Scott.

915
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,080
We'll have like a silk shirt with
a big like fire pattern on it.

916
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,190
That's the sad you just described.
The saddest doors. The status guy.

917
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,250
It's the guy in the neighborhood that
drives the yellow for are you got a

918
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,060
houseboat
sometime?

919
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:43,200
Houseboat is the saddest
divorce guy thing. Aw.

920
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,100
That's when you know you blown it.
Living on a houseboat.

921
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:51,400
Kids every other weekend.
The pretty cool water

922
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,920
because I think the fantasy is they're
going to live like Miami vice course.

923
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,530
Didn't he live on a house but with a
crocodile or some bullshit dude. Yeah.

924
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,440
I mean I feel like if for some reason
talking about it makes me feel like it's

925
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:07,380
real. I feel so sad. Right?
Jeans. No, the houseboat.

926
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:10,770
I'm saying fuel is really written
like not the divorce part. Yeah.

927
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,940
No and that's the divorce part.
Well,

928
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,760
they'll cause a houseboat feels like
a divorce it, eh? Yeah. It's terrible.

929
01:04:17,761 --> 01:04:22,320
So I got all this stuff here now.
It's so just not,

930
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,190
it's amazing how little you need to live.
And Wifi is overrated.

931
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:34,730
Oh yeah. Rock sometimes.
Cause it was about, no,

932
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,650
I don't like a kitchen either. Got
this microwave. It works awesome.

933
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:43,470
Everything's microwave and I just need
an Arby's. Yeah. And it's so depressing.

934
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,500
It's depressing man. Anyway, so
did you like your art assessment?

935
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:50,460
That was really great. Thank
you. What's his name? Mark.

936
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,220
Mark slipped or private to mark.
Thank you very much mark.

937
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,500
I actually really did enjoy that.

938
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,760
And you can hear mark on this week's
episode of that steep bro discussing

939
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:03,270
synchronicity. Phenomenal therapy to
what's therapy and what's the point?

940
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,860
Damn cake.
Pineapple upside down.

941
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,160
Well you get hair plugs to oh yeah,
yeah. But I want it to really thin it.

942
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,190
Like really,
really go bald first and do like Doo Doo,

943
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:19,870
Doo Doo Doo like stabs in there.

944
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:23,330
It looks like little stocks
of salary all over my head.

945
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:30,100
Hey girls, the saddest is
when you show old guy. I mean,

946
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:33,940
I haven't been to a club in a long time.
I've been in clubs where you see,

947
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,360
you know, or at the bar.
Yeah. That guy. Of course.

948
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,600
What do you ladies drinking?
I got it.

949
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:47,320
Let me go around for all of them.
Hair dyed, jet black. Nice and easy.

950
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:52,090
Here's a good lesson for people.
I'm also single,

951
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,950
married,
divorced.

952
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,760
It's all about sending
the quality dick pic.

953
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:02,180
Yeah, my top pick.

954
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,670
Okay,
well number one

955
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,150
irks my nerves.

956
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,680
She did my Nigga baby oil was $2.

957
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,410
Get yourself together.
That's a pretty good list.

958
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:20,040
I didn't know Dex could get
ashy. Well, you don't see
enough black cocks. Oh, true.

959
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:25,680
If you did, you see something rational?
I wish I saw more even brown ones. Yeah,

960
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,760
sure. I didn't know. Rule number two,

961
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,530
make sure your shit is hard
and that was a good point.

962
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:35,940
That's good for every race

963
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,420
like this because we're all calm.
You say Amy and everybody,

964
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,530
grandma,
I don't know what he was thinking.

965
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:50,110
Girls are mean and petty and
that's the Shit we do now.

966
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:53,520
Anytime we look at your limp dick
ass picture, she's going to cry more,

967
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:02,140
right? Yeah, I agree with
that. Make sure, you know,

968
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:06,400
I've never been sent a dick pic other
than yours because we started dating

969
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:09,760
around the time cell phones started.
No,

970
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:15,120
I can sell phones back in 84 people.

971
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:20,710
Four people sending Dick Pics
in 2005 yeah, but I probably,

972
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:24,160
it was probably not like today.
Today. Yeah. No, it's a thing.

973
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:28,330
It's really much bigger now, but
I agree. It's like watch porn.

974
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,990
Nothing makes me angry. Or they
know a limp. Dick, especially you,

975
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:34,820
you get this hard before the scene.
You've expressed this before.

976
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,950
So I saw one of those like showtime behind
the scenes pornos and that's what the

977
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:41,980
director got basically mad at
the guy for. He's like, dude,

978
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:46,150
I want you to pull it out,
ready to go. And they gave
him time alone. They're like,

979
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:49,960
go get it ready. And the guy couldn't
do it, so they killed the scene. Oh Wow.

980
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,180
Said no shooting today.
It's a lot of pressure though.

981
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,390
I think he's a lot of pressure. I'm
ready to get in there though. It's again,

982
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:58,900
an important is that you're divorced
career. Yeah. That's a good,

983
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,520
I think it's a good second career.

984
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,910
I think that's just not a good
one in the early like in your 20s,

985
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:08,710
but good for your 50s and stuff. Well it's
a niche market. They got that old man,

986
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:11,380
young girl. But is it is it's also, um,

987
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:15,650
you know what the hook could be that
it's a self funded thing. Other words,

988
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,470
not someone's not going to hire me,
but maybe I produced them.

989
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,120
Myselves get a site, put
it out there. Hey, I'm 55.

990
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,500
I'm recently divorced. I'm doing these
pornos now. What do you think to do that?

991
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:31,850
Great idea. Maybe you could, uh, the
good news is your parents will be dead,

992
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:33,020
so no one's,
they'll be dead.

993
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:38,510
Our son will be in his sexual prime would
be a good example for him. And then,

994
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:42,950
um, it also could also, yeah, what fund?

995
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:47,180
Send more people to my standup shows.
It's always about selling more tickets.

996
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:49,820
So you go, hey, you like my
porno. Come see me to stand up.

997
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,700
That's a really neat angle.
Business Savvy.

998
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:55,060
Rule number three,

999
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,240
brainiac made sure she wants you a dick
pic ain't nothing worse than getting the

1000
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:04,090
eye known as dick pig. Like who are you
and who sent you with his lip as she did?

1001
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,720
Save yourself the trouble and get to
know it's also how you lying bitch,

1002
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,780
bitch. Yeah. You should. I think an
unsolicited Dick Pics. Not Good. Right?

1003
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:16,590
I, like I said, I've never, I'm
received and that's not a call.

1004
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:21,720
Don't send us your Dick Pics. Yeah,
no. Uh, I don't know, I guess.

1005
01:09:21,721 --> 01:09:24,750
Yeah, right. Do you include
the balls in a dick pic to,

1006
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,910
I don't think it's as important,
but they're there.

1007
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,350
I'd like to know that they're
there. You want, well, how would it,

1008
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,340
how would the person is saying you just
like, you mean like from above? Yeah,

1009
01:09:35,341 --> 01:09:39,210
like I want to see the Dick and the
balls because I think balls are neglected

1010
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:42,450
and they're often just as
important. So send those. Yeah.

1011
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,690
Let me see if those look high and tight.
If they're not, I'm not interested.

1012
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,620
I don't like droopy goat nuts. I
don't like, I'm hanging in sad.

1013
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,910
I'll ask my dad to send a picture of it.
Is His boss really hang?

1014
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:58,470
I saw them one time and know is
everything all right with what?

1015
01:09:58,471 --> 01:10:01,590
And I go your ball bag. Yeah. It looks
like it's hanging down on your knees.

1016
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,460
They look like to pig nuts.

1017
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:12,290
Seriously looked like cinder blocks that
are just in like a skin in a paper bag.

1018
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,930
That's about to tear open. Yeah. Do
they hurt when they get that hanging?

1019
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:20,250
I don't think so.
They look like they weigh a lot though.

1020
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:24,680
A number four,
make sure your Dick pic is memorable.

1021
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:29,490
Girls Gets Hen Dick pics a day.
Make Yours stand out like gift wrapping.

1022
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:33,310
Stick it in the ball to her favorite
ice cream. Kelly. Oh Shit. Pig.

1023
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,010
Do something with it. Other
than that, hold it like we
don't want to see you hope.

1024
01:10:36,011 --> 01:10:36,300
I'm still

1025
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,840
surprised that you don't think the
unsolicited Dick pic is a great thing to

1026
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:43,500
point. Like nobody wants that.
Oh, I don't want to see anybody's,

1027
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:46,260
which is the point she made and
you're like, I don't like unsolicited.

1028
01:10:46,261 --> 01:10:50,640
It's gotta be the worst. I imagine
if you're a guy, don't send a girl,

1029
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,780
just a dick pic thinking that it's
going to be exciting. I think the whole,

1030
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:59,340
the whole proposition of sending a dick
pic is ludicrous. Most women I do too,

1031
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:01,170
but what I'm saying,
I want to see a deck.

1032
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:04,620
What I'm saying is when you
send an unsolicited one's crazy,

1033
01:11:04,621 --> 01:11:07,590
you're really not just rolling the
dice. You're, you know, you're,

1034
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:12,840
you're at the risk of truly upsetting
someone. Yeah. So legal action, legal,

1035
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,900
also embarrassment. Why
don't you make sure that your
dick pic would be one. Okay.

1036
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,100
Or maybe she sends you a pick first.
You know like,

1037
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,580
oh here's a pair of scissors and my coach,

1038
01:11:23,581 --> 01:11:26,070
now you send me your Dick
pic scissors in my, yeah,

1039
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,750
the Dick pic is a very male thing I think.
Cause they have dicks other guys. No,

1040
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:33,720
no, no. I'm saying like you don't, you
know, who wants to receive a dick pic?

1041
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,240
Other dudes like it's not necessary.
I don't,

1042
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:41,241
at least from the women I know we don't
get that aroused by a picture of a cock.

1043
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:42,950
Like it's not the same thing.

1044
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,470
The same as guys also looking at
naked women badge is, I assume. Yeah.

1045
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:51,090
Like for us it's not, we, I think we
like to see a dick attached to a body.

1046
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,450
At least that's what, as a woman,
yeah. Show me the whole thing.

1047
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,020
Don't just send me your car. Who
Cares? Plus the scale. You don't,

1048
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,820
there's no scale in a,
in a picture.

1049
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:01,850
So I'll hold something next to
your deck would be your, yeah,

1050
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,970
that's a better poet.
Hold a can of soda next to your day.

1051
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:08,310
Some reference scale. Yeah.
Yeah. Cause I don't know.

1052
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:12,000
You can make it look enormous and it's
not wire. Yeah. Pick a fucking liar.

1053
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,620
Make fucking liar. Get
a hairspray can, yeah.

1054
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:21,000
There you go. Wow. I've sent a few
experience. Yeah, I'm on the road a lot.

1055
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,163
So

1056
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:26,810
let's see here. Um, oh,
this came in. You know,

1057
01:12:26,811 --> 01:12:31,460
you know about this guy, right? Martin?
Is it strictly shell? Shell clue?

1058
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:36,110
What's his name? Martin Shkreli. Uh,

1059
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:39,230
this is the guy who,

1060
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:43,050
he's the most hated man in America.
Um,

1061
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,750
he became really well
known, I don't know, six,

1062
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:51,620
nine months ago when he says,
uh,

1063
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:54,500
when he has the company
that he was a CEO of,

1064
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:59,950
bought this patent on a pharmaceutical
drug that helps like AIDS patients.

1065
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,270
And it was selling for something like 12,
$13 a pill,

1066
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,280
something like maybe $7 a pill
and he raised it to $700 a pill.

1067
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:18,980
Oh my God. And then there was just
huge backlash. What a pos is kind of a,

1068
01:13:18,981 --> 01:13:21,920
yeah. Oh, the biggest pos.
Then, not too long ago,

1069
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:28,090
he was arrested for a company that he
used to work for a hedge fund for like a

1070
01:13:31,611 --> 01:13:35,660
Ponzi scheme there. Oh, wow.
So everybody was celebrating.

1071
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,790
Apparently there's a new
thing here where he, um,

1072
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:46,070
it looks like he says a friend of
Kanye robbed him of $15 million.

1073
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,350
I don't know how that
happened because see,

1074
01:13:48,351 --> 01:13:52,820
it says I'm keeping his name in the
headlines. Oh, there's a new, you know,

1075
01:13:52,821 --> 01:13:55,430
a cognac out called the life of Pablo.

1076
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,070
He made a $15 million offer for
exclusive ownership of the album.

1077
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,600
Um, but it'd be put forth
50 million on the album,

1078
01:14:05,601 --> 01:14:10,601
only to be duped by a bit coin
thief by the name of De Quan or,

1079
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:17,050
um, and he's writing who
the fuck has my $15 million,

1080
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:21,880
uh, someone named. So anyways,

1081
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:28,150
so he's saying that, you know, all this
shit. Now he also, in addition to this,

1082
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:32,620
had a beef going with, uh,
Ghostface because he's the guy.

1083
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:36,010
Do you remember that? A
few, like a year or so ago,

1084
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,430
Wu Tang decided to release an album with,

1085
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:44,440
they would only make one copy of and the,
and it had like some crazy, you know,

1086
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:44,740
uh,

1087
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:49,740
cabinet chest made and it was one copy
and then the person who bid on it would

1088
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:53,800
own that copy and they could do as they
please with it. I didn't know that.

1089
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:58,750
That's okay. It's kind of a crazy
idea. Well he won. He, he owns it.

1090
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:03,580
There's Pos. Pos bought it for
$2 million. And then the idea,

1091
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:09,310
a lot of people thought that whoever would
do it would buy it and then share the

1092
01:15:09,311 --> 01:15:10,031
album,
you know,

1093
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:14,860
cause that would be the joy in it
had thing to do is share the album.

1094
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,730
Well he said he's never even listened
to it and it doesn't plan on sharing it.

1095
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,360
Wow. Just has to have it basically
like, you know, like a villain,

1096
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:26,860
like a sociopathic piece of shit
that he is. So yeah, he's a,

1097
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:29,830
he's a fucking wow.
What a cool guy.

1098
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,140
So this piece of shit, he's also
tweeted some bullshit to Ghostface,

1099
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,780
um, cause go said something
about him. So he called him, uh,

1100
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,540
you know, I dunno, it
caused some type of asshole.

1101
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:47,620
He said ghost is mad that the
Shaolin outsold his last five albums.

1102
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:52,510
Do the nonprofit rap rapper basically
saying he doesn't sell records anymore

1103
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,793
talking shit.

1104
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,800
Well there's somebody you don't want
to talk shit to this ghost face killer.

1105
01:15:56,801 --> 01:16:01,300
Right. I don't know if you remember, not
too long. Over the summer actually, um,

1106
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,530
uh,

1107
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:07,530
action Bronson talk made a kind of a
slight dig at Ghostface and goes put out a

1108
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:14,311
video where he just eviscerated
this guy for a full fucking,

1109
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:18,580
I don't know, 10 minutes. Um, he
just talked mad shit and he's like,

1110
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:22,230
you got a big ass bitch one day I
might sit that shit on fire. Yeah,

1111
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,010
it was my favorite line ever.

1112
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,080
I might sit that shit on fire and then he,
he has a his mean face.

1113
01:16:31,081 --> 01:16:32,000
It was like a fat kid.

1114
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,730
So Ghostface made a new video.

1115
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,840
This one is over 11 minutes long where
he's talking shit to this super bill and

1116
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:46,810
Pos Martins strictly whatever.
Um, so here's some stuff,

1117
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:47,644
some stuff right?

1118
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:54,060
Why is that not as far as mine.
Yeah.

1119
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:54,913
Hello?

1120
01:16:55,490 --> 01:17:00,000
Yeah. So I don't know why his bleak,

1121
01:17:00,001 --> 01:17:03,240
but Martin says, where are your
goons? Not as hard as mine.

1122
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:05,890
He was lifted up your skirt motherfucker.
So

1123
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,530
already Ghostface winds,
the entire thing

1124
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,360
goes to stop pretending. Stop
acting. Stop lying. Yo Man.

1125
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,670
Yo Man, you hilarious man. You
must be on real in a certain man.

1126
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,890
You know what I mean? It took
us out, man. It's like, Yo,

1127
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:26,120
you will forget supervillain man,
the man with the 12 year old bag,

1128
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,190
this will he be, his name was Corelli
right there when y'all see him.

1129
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,653
You know what I mean?

1130
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,900
He does. He is built like a,
like a young man. Uh, Martin,

1131
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,110
the Pos. Oh, it's 12 year
old buttons. Yeah. So He's,

1132
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,820
he's talking shit about his build,

1133
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:48,020
which, you know, I don't even know how
we change to this. Like this is goals,

1134
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:52,670
verse three to pay it like 2016 you know
what I mean? All you can do right now,

1135
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:57,670
just try to fly away in front of my face
with this is, this is, this is error.

1136
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:01,700
Check this place out, man called dot
knows anything. You know what I'm saying?

1137
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,260
Walking around with fake goes like,

1138
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:07,910
he's tough and he ain't got to a real
bone in his body. You know what I mean?

1139
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:08,863
I do know what you mean.

1140
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:10,760
Yeah.
I did all tough today.

1141
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:14,640
You won't come at me and you don't
go to check out with the 2 million.

1142
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:18,580
I was acting like we washed the rappers,
like I'm a washed up wrap up,

1143
01:18:18,581 --> 01:18:21,450
but you don't put a washed
up rap album for 2 million.

1144
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,100
Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah.

1145
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,900
Probably the best point is if
you're talking to shit to the guy,

1146
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:29,530
the you bought $2 million.
Yeah.

1147
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,450

1152
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,060
Do you understand that?

01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,850
It's talking about it's ghost,

1154

Wow. That is fucking hilarious. Wow.

1163
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:31,120
Oh, you don't believe you?
The people don't believe you.

credit that you might have.

1168
01:19:48,091 --> 01:19:50,820
Or like if you fuck with me, you're going

me? I'm talking about um, oh yeah.

1223
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,820
And I got to play this real quick
before I go to dental update.

1224
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,300
I was live tweeting

1225
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:55,390
[inaudible]

1226
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,700
so as I said, I went in for a
dental cleaning last week. I live,

1227
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:05,260
tweeted the event and
basically everything,

1228
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:10,120
I mean I got to talking to
my gums were number three.

1229
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:13,360
Like she was rattling off my number
three, three, three, four is in the back.

1230
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:18,610
And she chastised me, I need to floss
every day. She said, and I was like, look,

1231
01:24:18,611 --> 01:24:21,670
I'm a new mom. I don't have time to
fucking do this shit anymore. She said,

1232
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,450
y'all have to floss every day.
And then they took a full set of x rays.

1233
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,790
How many cavities do you think?
I have?

1234
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:33,560
Four zero.
Zero.

1235
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:39,970
So my teeth are in good shape, but I
did get reprimanded for not flossing.

1236
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:41,940
And truth be told, I haven't
been flossing. Is Madge.

1237
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:43,350
I had the beginnings of mom now,

1238
01:24:43,351 --> 01:24:46,000
so I'm not proud of it and
it shouldn't be proud of it.

1239
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,450
But she did get through
the cleaning and you know,

1240
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:51,010
I just got a little reprimanded.

1241
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,780
Subsetting we're building up
our floss game. I'll admit it.

1242
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,400
Have you been flossing

1243
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:03,990
