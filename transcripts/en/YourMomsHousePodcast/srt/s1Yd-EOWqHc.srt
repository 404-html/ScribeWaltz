00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,540
There's literally a handful of tickets
left. You better scoop those up now.

23
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,890
And I know it sounds like a long time in

do to get away from your awful family,

people are are saying yelling at me,

66
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:52,020

saying homie. Oh, mine out.
Homie. On out. Homie. On out.

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,690

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,640
Yeah. He's really, I'm sure
super excited about this.

72
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,540
Very excited. He doesn't know
what's happening. He doesn't know.

73
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,410
Let's get into this show is so much to do.
There's a lot to talk about. All right,

74
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:25,080
here we go. Oh wait. Oh Man. Yeah.

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,850
For some reason this didn't
go over [inaudible] morning
everyone. I don't know.

76
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,310
It sounds good already.
Uh,

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,210
dad mouth slit. I doesn't matter.
This smells you can tell. I think so.

78
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,860
Yeah. It smells like horror
garbage like fiefs mouth.

79
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,350
Okay. All right. I don't know why that
went that way, but Homey, man, oh man.

80
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:53,940
Out of his mouth. Looks
like it stinks. Poor guy.

81
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,790
I know. It's not his fault. Maybe he's
going to say something real sweet.

82
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,510
You're going feel bad. I doubt
that. I highly doubt that.

83
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,630
Good morning everyone.

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm on the job side getting ready to
start my day and I couldn't be happier

85
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:05,874
about it.

86
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,770
But what I'd really rather be
doing is coming to your home.

87
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,813
Yeah.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,340
Coleman,
your grandmother's hair.

89
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,020
So where are his top teeth? I Dunno.

90
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,230
And I also noticed that there weren't
so many molars on the side bottom.

91
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,130
It seemed like it was just kind of

92
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,900
see now how did I know? Just
based on the, the small,

93
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:51,620
narrow row of bottom teeth I saw,
I was like, this guy doesn't have,

94
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:56,180
I don't know if like over
here and over here, nothing
there. It's blank. Two, three,

95
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:59,690
four, five. You don't need a lot
more than five. I know that much.

96
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,030
Those are actually the most useless
teeth. The ones in the front, bottom row,

97
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,180
you don't need those for shit.
It's the Maulers you really need.

98
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,720
And those are the ones that fall out
the most. I feel he's right here though,

99
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,400
are the scariest dead. This
look nice guy. He's like,

100
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,910
I'm going to comb your grandmother's hair.
Fuck.

101
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,950
This might be a whole new lane of,
and by the way, this is also a guy,

102
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,330
this is who I see as being like,
Hi Christina. Good morning. Yeah.

103
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,980
And then like a door shuts and he's like,
do you comb your hair yet?

104
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,700
And you're like, mmm. Yeah, he's scary.

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,350
Is coming to your home.
Coleman,

106
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,340
your grandmother's hair

107
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,650
kind of like this a lot too.
Well I do. You know why?

108
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,420
Because I know what's about to happen.

109
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:54,240
We're about to have another
breakthrough in your mom's house videos.

110
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,050
This is going to be a whole new lane for
us. It's a lot of pressure on the video.

111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,630
I feel it though.
I,

112
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:04,860
my spidey senses are tango is going
for people that go that's coming either

113
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,820
don't know. I mean 98%
of the time, you know,

114
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,190
we are seeing this with you. It's not
like this is prepared. And I go, oh,

115
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,630
I know it's wrong. Let me tell
you why I think this is good. Uh,

116
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,780
the backgrounds terrible again,
he's in a class is wearing a shirt,

117
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:26,030
which is not protocol.
You know,

118
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,990
as we think that he's
a little too sensible.

119
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,320
He's got something weird to tell us
cause he's in a private and closure.

120
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,160
Isn't the car adding up?
Let's see.

121
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,330
You know, she needs it calm. You
know what's going to make her happy?

122
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,880
It makes me happy to do it.

123
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,380
Why don't you look Mike come to your
home and comb that hair out of your

124
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:47,520
grandmother's face.

125
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,540
What's happening?
I don't know,

126
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,580
but I was just expecting
like the next part he's like,

127
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,510
and then I'll her fucking
skull or common rise.

128
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,370
I wasn't going there with it but I was
going there. That's what he wants it.

129
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,670
He wants to come in your grandma's hair.
He wants to mash it down.

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,980
Like give him,
give her a good boy here.

131
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,050
He brushes it to the side parts,
it all might come there.

132
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,600
Skidway
that's what he really wants to do.

133
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,740
So it's so scary.
You know what's even scarier?

134
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,060
Imagine if this guy is actually, oh, we'll
say just a really nice guy. He's like,

135
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:30,510
Hey, was that a funny video?
I'm, I was scared to death.

136
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,770
I was just terrified.
Like his son was like,

137
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,650
make a viral video. He's like, hey man,

138
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,030
it's one about combing your
grandmother's hair. I was like, no.

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,920
Did read really wrong.
Read real scary.

140
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,770
He has to know he's creepy.

141
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,950
How about the dog?
Oh Shit.

142
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,460
What'd you let me come to
your home and pet the dog? No.

143
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,530
You know the dog needs it. It makes
him happy. I'm happy to pick the dog.

144
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,510
It's a win win situation.
Let me come to your home and pet that dog.

145
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,160
How is there not more to this? What
do you mean? That's it. That's it. No,

146
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,850
that can't be the whole video.
That's what I was sent blue band.

147
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,010
We need more information.
This can't be everything.

148
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,430
Um,
yeah.

149
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,390
Says he's living for Pizza Hut.

150
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,943
Huh?

151
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,930
I Dunno what, how was it? The whole video?

152
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,220
It doesn't feel like it's the whole video.

153
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,640
There's something nefarious going on here.
Come on.

154
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,640
Blue Band and he wants
to come in your dogs.

155
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,300
No,
she needs you to call home

156
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,470
blue band. Send me the rest
of this fucking video. Yeah.

157
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,490
This is not the whole story. Some
something's going on. Oh my God.

158
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:51,930
This baby's moving so fast. This kid
does somersaults and me all fucking day.

159
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,130
He's going to come out while gene.
You better brace yourself.

160
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,070
Oh my God, Dude. Oo Dancing on my bladder.

161
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,230
Anyways, um, I did my Netflix
shoot this last week. Great.

162
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,870
Uh, Las Vegas. What's well,
it's Las Vegas and our language.

163
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,120
A lost anus. Anus. I want to thank
everybody that came out to the taping.

164
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,130
Joey Diaz and I were on
the same night with Yama.

165
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:24,960
Nika and I gotta tell
you it was fucking chaos.

166
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:29,530
I think it was crazy. That was pretty
wild for people that it was crazy.

167
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,470
We're not at that show.
It was in downtown Las Vegas,

168
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:38,610
right on Fremont Street and a bar there.
Normally a musical venue.

169
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,270
It was called like backstage billiard,
so it was a proper rock venue,

170
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,150
but they built a special set for the
stage and then you have an eco went up the

171
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:53,710
gray than you are in the
wings ready to go now. Okay.

172
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,410
So I'm getting ready. I'm
fucking seven months. What?
Almost eight months pregnant.

173
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:57,980
Yeah.

174
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,900
And I'm standing backstage
and there's a music cue,

175
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:07,430
some rock song like Jeez, a cowgirl one.
Know Dan. I'm like, yeah, I don't know.

176
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,140
And then can picture too,
you know,

177
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:13,970
obviously there's a couple of hundred
people there. Yeah. Um, full, you know,

178
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,580
obviously crew for a production backstage.

179
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:20,300
It's like all the producers and all the
executives and there's video village.

180
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:22,700
It's just, it's very busy.
There's a lot going on.

181
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,210
There's a smoke machine rolling
the smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke,

182
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:30,190
smoke and there's smoke.
And then I'm standing right

183
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,210
there and I'm waiting for my cue to go
out on the stage to do the first show.

184
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,400
My first set ever of this taping,
right.

185
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,790
The smoke is going and I noticed that
the production person is having trouble

186
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,690
opening the door to the stage.
And like Fifo,

187
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,390
I watch our dogs and the brilliance
of Fifo, not so much bitsy. Uh,

188
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,780
but fif is that when he sends his danger,
you know what that dog does?

189
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,090
He gets the fuck out of the way.
Yeah. You see his spidey sense?

190
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,740
Yeah. Eyebrows actually ray. Yeah. Yes.

191
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,010
No, and I, I swear to you, and
I'm not saying this as a bit,

192
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,830
I did think of Fifo at that
moment and I was like, oh,

193
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,690
I think I should get out of the way.

194
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,170
Some tells me something bad is
about to happen. I swear to God.

195
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:22,490
And I moved away cause I was like,
this is dangerous. And Lo and behold,

196
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,410
a heavy fucking, I don't
know, seven foot door door,

197
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,200
what?
Indoor and this poor production lady,

198
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:34,340
she's opening it and it
falls like just centimeters,

199
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:39,020
millimeters from my hand and it falls
down and crashes down right where I was

200
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:39,920
just standing.

201
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,000
And of course everybody's freaking out
and they have to Redo it and reset it.

202
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:45,860
And I'm,
we're all in the back waiting to go up.

203
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,610
So that was what happened right before
I went up. And what I thought to myself,

204
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:53,210
this is really good luck because
when I had my first special taping,

205
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,950
remember that guy that took a shit during
my shell and then he kept flushing the

206
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:02,951
toilets over and over in Seattle and
I had to stop my set and be like,

207
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,110
is somebody going to
address the toilet flushing?

208
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,580
Yes guys taking a shit during my,

209
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,160
somebody was shitting in the middle
of my show and fucking up sound.

210
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,340
So I feel as though it's a good omen
when something like that happens and the

211
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:18,050
first tape, the first taping
went and was good. It was great.

212
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,940
The second one was even better and we got,

213
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,760
we got what we needed so it's
going to be a great show.

214
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,330
I hope you guys enjoy it and
thank you again for coming.

215
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,500
So we had a good time in Vegas.

216
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,140
New Gene. The A, the second show was
was killer. That was the jam. Yeah.

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,950
Thank God for a second. Shit. God,
they tape two shows every show.

218
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:39,210
I feel like every time I take something,
a specialist they shower. Yeah, for sure.

219
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,460
And you ended up, you always
end up, it's funny cause you go,

220
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,480
it's all about the second show.

221
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,180
You always end up using something
from the first show. Yeah.

222
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,730
You don't remember at the time,
but when you watch the cut you're like,

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,430
oh actually that was how I like it more.
Yeah. But the usually, I don't know,

224
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,300
like the vibe

225
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,440
energy's always better on the
second show because you shake the,

226
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:59,830
shake the nerves off from the first
show and then by the second one you're

227
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:03,340
relaxed. The audience, it's a little bit
later in the evening, other little loose,

228
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,470
but a man that was like, I got to
tell you, I don't, I'm not a huge,

229
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,030
we're not a huge Vegas couple. It's
not really our jam. Speak for yourself.

230
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,520
Um, but being in that downtown
location was just quiet.

231
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,380
I forgot.
Like I forgot.

232
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,880
Brought back the memories of our,
when we lived in Korea town,

233
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,300
downtown adjacent here. You mean the
rampart? Yeah, the Rampart Division.

234
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,290
Macarthur Park. Um, you
see a lot of kicky footers.

235
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,090
Kicky photos.
It's a,

236
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,440
somebody is in a wheelchair,
um,

237
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,560
but they have the use of their legs and
the way that they move the chair around

238
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,320
as they kicked her big
kick, kick, kick your foot,

239
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,840
they push and then they back up.

240
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:56,010
And sometimes they go forward
with their feeds and you go, oh,

241
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,810
you just feel like sitting. And
they're like, yeah, yeah. It's kind of,

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,360
it's not fair to the people that might
really need the wheelchair. Sure.

243
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,100
It has a ceiling. I remember
there was a kicky foot lady, uh,

244
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,160
down on sixth street there.
She rolled hood. Yeah.

245
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,180
And I saw a guy, the bearded
lady wasn't at the bearded one.

246
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,620
No, the bearded guy. There's a bearded
man with paint his beard on. Yeah,

247
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,450
I remember that guy. Yeah. But there was
this one lady that I used to always see,

248
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,530
but uh, downtown Vegas had a
guy cookie fighting. Right.

249
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,020
Cause several, a whole team of KCI
flutters. It felt like a whole,

250
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,350
a whole situation. And
you know, it's just,

251
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:34,740
it's not my bag downtown Vegas.
And

252
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,320
so we, we stayed in, uh,
uh, the, the, the morgue.

253
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,660
That whole section seems like it's a,

254
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,880
just a parole hearing
gathering. So there's, are
there court courthouses there?

255
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:52,640
There should be. I mean, yeah, there
are, but yeah, it just, Oh my God,

256
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,020
the Greyhound station is right there.
It is a great hand stitch the whole thing.

257
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:57,280
Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah.

258
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,260
But it was nice to kind of reminisce
because the early stages of our careers,

259
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:06,070
we did a lot of shows down there. Oh
yeah. Yeah. We used to do four queens.

260
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:06,720
I knew that.

261
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,550
Yeah. And I did the Golden Nugget and
uh, you know, these Vegas Palace station,

262
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,030
a station or liens.
I did the sands before it was gone.

263
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,820
I did the Riv before it was
going on in Harrah's was arrows.

264
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:22,560
That's where the Improv is. Yeah. The
trop I did that. I just do all of them.

265
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:26,340
And people will know when you do,
you know, you do the road, you're,

266
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,430
you're typically on most club. Weekends
are Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

267
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,720
and sometimes Sunday. Vegas you do
Monday through Sunday, brewed all.

268
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,410
So you arrive Monday and you do
one show a night until Saturday.

269
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:40,020
You two shows Saturday.
And uh,

270
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,580
I really thank God that I don't
have the gambling gene. Okay.

271
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,650
We don't have the fun gene. Let's back
it up. You and I, out of all the agents,

272
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,250
the managers,

273
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,250
the executives to other comedians on this
thing are probably the most antisocial

274
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,430
people. Yeah. Like we should be
fun and we're the least fun. Yeah.

275
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,040
I always get that.
We have no fun

276
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,070
ruin the wonderful, one of the
calls I got one time was a, Hey,

277
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:09,760
do you want to do just one of these
festivals? You know, I would been like,

278
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,900
Moon Tower or oh, you're one of
these festivals. And I go, well,

279
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:17,800
what's the like, what's the deal? And they
were like, well, it's not a great offer,

280
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,780
but it's like a great hang. Now
go, excuse me. And he's like, well,

281
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:25,510
you know, like all your friends
will be there. And I was like,

282
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:28,990
I don't care what my friends are here in
la. Yeah. And they're like, well yeah,

283
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,350
to just be with them in another
city and no. Yeah. You party. I go,

284
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:36,550
I don't fucking party. And
they're like, hey man, you
don't want to do it again. No,

285
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,330
I don't want to do it.
I want to do like a regular shirt.

286
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,630
I don't care if it's a
festival was involved. Yeah.

287
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,040
Well cause we can go down to the comedy
store and see those exact same people.

288
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,480
Then my festivals on sunset,
it's, it's easy. Yeah.

289
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:52,481
I don't need to fly to on Thursday
night festival or much Montreal.

290
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,370
Yeah. To fly across the world. No, I
know none of those things. They're like,

291
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,110
you're going to hang a no,
no. Go to bed by 10 yeah.

292
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,480
And that's what we did after the taping.
They were like,

293
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:06,690
we're going to go out now. We're like,
no, I'm exhausted. He is exhausted.

294
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,290
It's crazy to say to you, I
mean, you're fucking super price.

295
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:13,180
People still are like, you want to go
out? I'm like, no, I want him to lay down.

296
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,460
You're going out, right? No, no. Yeah.

297
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:20,870
You're going to leave your pregnant
wife nor the phones. Hell Oh my God.

298
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
I had two crazy,

299
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,890
crazy phone things into weeks in
hotels in Vegas where we get back,

300
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,220
we ordered too much food as
usual. We wind down our fun. Yeah.

301
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,150
That was our celebration.

302
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,720
Ordering too much Chinese dumplings
about whatever the fuck to go to bed.

303
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,460
So we're like, all right. You
know, congratulations. Big Win,

304
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,930
you know, great special.
Finally she goes to bed. I go,

305
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,071
I'm going to go to bed too.

306
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:53,420
I'm talking because I flew the
day before back from Charlotte.

307
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,230
Then the next day to Vegas,
I'm tired.

308
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,540
We laid down and was
like on cue the phone,

309
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,630
which is sitting on the nightstand
have this nice hotel goes dial tone.

310
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,570
The speakerphone goes on.
So you're like,

311
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,640
what's that? And you just kind of hit
it off like, okay. That was weird.

312
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,760
A minute later. Uh, so
then I'm like, well,

313
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,960
what's happened with this phone?

314
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,990
I just tried to like fix
it every 45 seconds or so.

315
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,920
It keeps going on. Did I try to unplug it?
It's like sealed. Yeah. Into the phone.

316
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:35,920
Yeah. Then I called down, hey,

317
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,820
how did you call down though?
I just called. I called
guest services from another,

318
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,210
from the other thing. Cause there
were two phones. Yeah. How did you,

319
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,740
I guess you picked the other line or
something like that. I don't know.

320
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,260
I was like, oh my God, I so tired
too because I had fallen asleep.

321
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,810
It wasn't right away, you know, both in
a dead sleep. I got up to Paris, right,

322
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,530
came back and then it started doing it.
Then I start telling them, I'm like,

323
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,950
here's what's happening with the phone.
They're like, okay, we'll try to get some.

324
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,190
I go, no, no, no, no. I was like,
you have to send somebody now.

325
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I'm going crazy right now and
as I'm doing that I hear like,

326
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,570
I don't like, I hear shit like
crashing, like what the fuck?

327
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,490
And you had met, I mean I'm
telling you at my full strength,

328
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,670
like you know, I mean I didn't try
to violently do it, but I was like,

329
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,630
oh this is not like a regular plugin
like this. You know what I mean?

330
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:28,420
Like it's not, it wasn't like a
regular, not a regular phone line.

331
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,990
It was like actually like, I don't
know. Sealed in there somehow.

332
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,990
Christina manage from the bed, seven and
a half months pregnant. She just go Bam.

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,050
And like the phone went flying off
and I go, ah, yeah, just send them up.

334
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,340
So then I take what you did,
kind of piece it back together.

335
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,110
And when the guy gets there and set
up being like, fix it, I go, yeah,

336
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,761
well I'm telling you,

337
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:55,780
Hell hath no fury like a pregnant woman
trying to get her two hours of sleep.

338
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,860
And that whole ordeal, by the way,
was that was like a 25 minute ordeal.

339
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,210
Of course it kept going up and the rage
inside of me, I was like, dude, I fucking,

340
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:05,380
I am exhausted.

341
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,150
I yanked it as hard as I have no idea
what could make a fucking phone do that.

342
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,260
I don't know.
Do,

343
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,260
I mean literally it's dial tone would
just come through the speaker like every

344
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:20,200
minute. But I, at that point
I didn't care. I was like,

345
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,710
I'm going to pay for this phone. I'll
give you $200 or whatever it is. I can't,

346
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,550
I can't listen to this shit.
But the best part is, um,

347
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,660
as you call down for, for
room service, remember?

348
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,430
And what did you say? Oh I ordered and
then she was like, cause I go, yeah,

349
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,840
she goes, okay, we'll be up in
like 30 minutes ago. Thanks.
Gambling jeans. And she,

350
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,000
I thought she had already
hired when she goes

351
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,170
like all her gambling jeans.
Yeah.

352
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,170
Well Cause I've been calling people
mommy and jeans like just openly and

353
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,850
rampantly. Zero pushback. No,

354
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,560
and I mean I'm calling technology
sometimes car just to be like,

355
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:02,490
why'd you call me Mommy? I'm like,
I'm just calling your mommy. You know,

356
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,300
I spent $40 by the way, on the slots.
I was walking through the slots.

357
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,310
He did just lots.
Yeah.

358
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
And I went up to 65 and I was like did
when I went down there and then I took

359
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:19,510
that money, I put it in another
machine. We had lost it in like 5 cents.

360
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,910
I'm, you know, I don't really
understand the thrill of gambling.

361
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,170
It's just not get it.

362
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,140
But I don't have the like it's
either excites you or it doesn't.

363
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,650
It terrifies me because I know how,
how hard it is to earn money.

364
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,120
I feel like it's the eastern block or in
me is like, no dude, I'm not doing this.

365
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:41,260
My friend, my money down the toilet,
Claudia is asking this question.

366
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,010
I've got to tell her
our nanny dose.

367
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,850
So,

368
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,500
somebody wanted to send you this.
Really check this out.

369
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,840
They have a little clap
back. Oh Shit. Here we go.

370
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,070
It's not that bad. Here we go
there. She said, how dare you.

371
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,480
I don't want to read. You can go ahead
forward. Hey Mommy, not reading it.

372
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,800
Brendan and Taylor here.

373
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,090
Just want to point out that me tailor the
female bought the shirt the first time

374
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:17,390
it was mentioned. Also must mentioned
I bought Brendan's Rub, Rub,

375
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:21,620
rub shirt as well. All my idea.
Female idea. So take it doctor drew.

376
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,970
Oh Wow. They're getting, they're
getting, they're engaged.

377
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:30,170
We're getting married very soon.
A congrats. Congratulations.

378
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,240
If you have any marriage advice.
Yeah,

379
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:37,040
don't marry this chick because she's
obviously got sociopathic tendencies.

380
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,770
Oh, that's your, she wrote
the email though, Babe. Oh,

381
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,310
you guys should then you're perfect
for each other. You both psychos.

382
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,780
If you buy these shirts together,

383
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,020
that's your advice to anyone that gets
a four stroke shirt is a disgusting

384
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:51,630
animal. No, no, it's, it's the forest
strokes and the rep both. Both.

385
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,660
She bought both. Yeah. Well,

386
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,940
you guys are clearly mentally disturbed
and you're perfect for each other and

387
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:02,180
the work is done. There you
go. Um, what dose do you have?

388
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:05,720
Two people married getting married.
I think they already have. I mean,

389
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,250
they look happy. Um, they have
obviously a shared sensibility.

390
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,550
What does it keep making each other laugh?

391
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,560
You gotta don't take yourself
too seriously. Give each
other haircuts, haircuts.

392
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,580
Um,

393
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,210
always you as the man always should cut
her hair and style and color her hair.

394
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Um, you should do her makeup. You should
do her eyebrows. Um, you know, you should,

395
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:32,120
uh, don't take her for
granted. That's good.

396
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,090
Don't take each other for
granted, I would say. Right.

397
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,200
Stay aware.
It's always nice to have gratitude.

398
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,890
So I think it's nice when people say
things like just basic, you know,

399
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,500
thank you's. You know what I mean?
Like you don't just go like, yeah,

400
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:49,580
of course you fucking made me
eggs. You, you say thank you.

401
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,780
I always try to say thank you.
I think we adore each other.

402
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,940
I think that's number one is to stay,

403
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,050
stay adoring and liking the
stuff you liked, you know,

404
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:05,051
10 15 years ago and to remember why
you fell in love with that person.

405
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,320
I know what I honestly of the only other
thing I would say is don't go camping

406
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,610
to fuck him. You know what I would say?
Why? Why? Because we hate camping. Well,

407
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:18,200
here's what I was going to say.
That Mary, somebody where you guys,

408
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,530
you people like always,
what do you have in common then?

409
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:23,710
No know it's what you
both hate and common.

410
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,890
That's really what's going to unite you
as a couple is both the both of you hate

411
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:31,280
the same stuff. For instance, Tom
and I, we don't go out late partying.

412
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:35,450
That's really not our thing. We both hate
camping. Yeah, we both hate concerts.

413
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,700
Both like to stay at home.
We hate loud environments.

414
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,630
Hey crowds,

415
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,840
crowds hate fucking cunt
servers can't servers.

416
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,390
Billy Joel, our mutual hatred.
I don't hate Billy jolt.

417
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,340
I don't know why you're putting it,
don't you?

418
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,580
I don't know why you put that on me.
Bruce Springsteen. I don't like him.

419
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,740
We both hate Dylan. Bob Dylan,
he's garbage. Trash, trash.

420
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,610
Frank Sinatra hate him.

421
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,720
You're really more United by the shit
you hate when you're a couple. It's true.

422
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,930
Um, I think things like
that too. You know,

423
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,680
Matt Dillon, when he was
like, he's a treasure. I know.

424
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,150
You expect to get the music. It's
funny because you really, people,

425
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,310
some people treat them music. The music
they love. Like it's family. Right.

426
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,970
You know, especially if they've been
listening for 15, 20, 30 years. It's like,

427
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,800
it's like saying, Hey, your dad's sucks
basically. Yeah. You know? But yeah,

428
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:36,660
you can't expect everyone.
I'd like to see course.

429
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,970
I think it's funny when
someone really gets the sounds,

430
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:46,590
they like to hear you having different
sounds. You like to hear it. Yeah,

431
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,070
my sounds are the best. And
you're like, okay, good teams.

432
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,550
I don't want to hear fucking,
oh my God.

433
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,460
The other one I love about sports is when,

434
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,680
when people attack a professional as a,
they suck.

435
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,820
Like there'll be like Lebron James
Sucks. And you're like, that's cool.

436
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,500
Like he sucks. Like, yeah.
Like he's okay. I mean,

437
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,040
we're talking about, you know, objectively

438
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,430
physical freaks of all, you can't,
you can't accept that. Fuck him.

439
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,730
He sucks. He's no good. Okay. Oh,

440
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:28,140
you know what I would suggest for married
people who are newly cohabitating or

441
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:32,370
who have been living together for years
by a cleaning lady, get a cleaning lady.

442
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,840
I think that alumni, a cleaning
lady, have a slave in your pantry,

443
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,500
but you said the word wrong,
but get a cleaning lady.

444
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,570
You got 40 bucks to spare.
Have someone else clean your home.

445
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,150
We did it when we were the brokest.

446
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,840
I think it was once a month
when you're like, all right,

447
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,200
this is what it was like a
little apartment and I think
someone would do it for

448
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,160
like 50 bucks.

449
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,100
It's the best $50 we ever
stab because when they are
done you're like, oh yeah, I,

450
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,330
I, I'll, I'll never keep it
like this. Yeah. So I think
about having a clean close,

451
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,150
here's what it does. It a alleviates the
fights between the two of you do too.

452
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:12,450
Who Cleans what in the house,
right. Preach, preach, preach.

453
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,560
I don't yell at you about your boxer
shorts on the floor or the song, you know,

454
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:20,310
yell at me for my sloppiness
because someone else fucking pigs.

455
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,350
Plus there's gross shit that you
don't want to do. Hey, you know,

456
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,530
stains on toilets and on a sinks
that are just, you know what I mean?

457
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:32,050
Like just from being Greg toothpaste
and shit builds and it's like,

458
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,490
and then you have to fight over who does
the toilets and who, and not only that,

459
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:39,720
you work 40 hours a week.
Most Americans work a full fucking weak.

460
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,040
Why are you spending
your weekends scrubbing

461
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,010
your toilet unless it's something you
really enjoy and all a lot of people love

462
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,460
to clean or you have to do.
Yeah,

463
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,730
but I'm saying if you have 40 by hammered
how much ever it is in your region.

464
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,080
Yeah.
Save your money.

465
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:56,590
I would rather that's really have the
cleaning lady then go out for fucking

466
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:59,760
dinner that month. Do you know what
I'm saying? It's, it's way more.

467
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,980
Uh, I dunno. I think it's a
huge life saver. Personally.
I think just to spite you.

468
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,790
Apparently the mommies have
taken over the romance,

469
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,340
the Rogan comment section
are those videos yet.

470
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,370
And it is like all rob rubs says like
thick,

471
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,860
hot, white come. My brother didn't
believe me so hard. I'm hearing it.

472
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,340
What's up with this one
here? No. People are like,

473
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:26,220
are these all bots that are responding
to it? Try it out right now. Right now.

474
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:30,210
Right now. Uh, Peyton Lafferty
take 10 or 12 Benadryl.

475
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,610
I don't think this is despite me is
I'm just, no, I'm just kidding. Oh,

476
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,600
whole man out. Whoa,
man. This is hilarious.

477
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:41,910
So it's very funny.
You cannot fuck with the mommies.

478
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,010
And there's another, you cannot,
a lady who mentioned this said,

479
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,581
uh,
hey,

480
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:51,620
mommy's first one to say the doctor drew
podcasts are by far my favorites. Yes.

481
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,870
His reactions are the best, by the
way. I'm going to do his podcast.

482
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,650
Great. The which one Hashtag
[inaudible] you live.

483
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,930
He needs to change the title of that.
I Dunno.

484
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,960
He's like life Hashtag
you live at Dr drew.

485
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,030
Like I gotta talk to him about this.

486
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,010
Um, I'm not sure it was called
I'm doing it Thursday. Uh,

487
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,240
I wanted to write in about Dr Drew's
saying there is always a man behind the

488
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:16,420
woman. We get emails about this
and that. It's not always the case.

489
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:20,950
I actually submitted a try it out video
on my own fruition the day after Tom put

490
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:25,030
his on Instagram because I was so excited,
but I'm not sure I sent it correctly.

491
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,090
Uh, it was actually me trying to
get my friends to do it with me,

492
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,140
not the other way around.

493
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,420
I actually find myself
intentionally slipping in the words,

494
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,160
try it out in conversation, know, so I
can chuckle to myself. I love what you do.

495
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,890
Your podcast giving me laughs
even in the darkest moments,

496
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,620
always keeping it high
and tight. Sophia, Sophia,

497
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,580
point out that I pushed back
on drew when he said that,

498
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:47,260
and I said that not our listeners.

499
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:50,570
I believe that the women that listen
to this show are self starters,

500
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:54,850
self initiators. When it came to funding
and creating these wacky videos. Listen,

501
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:58,420
if you're a girl and you're listening
to this show, yeah, you're already,

502
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,810
you're fucking thousand times cooler
than most checks. Yeah. And your,

503
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:04,480
your fucking head isn't on right. You
know what I'm saying? Like your flux,

504
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,280
just like I am. I'm, you know
the main mommy say that guys.

505
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,840
Who the fucking fuck? Uh, my gosh,
she's a sexual life. Fuck me.

506
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,860
Then you can move in, but you have
to fuck me and I, I need a lot man.

507
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,980
Pretty hot here, man.
She's too attractive.

508
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,520
It's almost serious power plug. I'd
be like, I gotta get this content.

509
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,930
No,
no sir.

510
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,950
You want to move in? Your friend could
movement. This is how I got porno starts.

511
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:39,920
I feel like she's, she's so pretty. She's
a model, right? A slate cow. I don't know.

512
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,080
Let's

513
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,650
go for a stroll through the,
where's the blowjob? Sorry.

514
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,740
This is the setup to the scene. Her
makeup looks great to, yeah, fuck me.

515
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,880
Piss on me. Cheese.

I'm a hot white trash come
down. Let's fuck. I'm so around.

519
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,410
I think everyone's like a Briggs. Yeah,
he's a Sophia. I don't know if we,

520
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:16,940
we got the same goal as the other videos,
but he did a great job.

521
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,660
You did a great job and uh,
uh,

522
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,690
please keep sending those videos
then every time you have that idea,

523
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,290
the four stroke one, are we going to
do it for a stroke guy next? Oh yeah.

524
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,340
Are we gonna do enforce
drugs with no traffic?

525
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,990
Rather he couldn't believe that biggest
dig was, that was my favorite part.

526
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,960
My favorite line is still
the neuropathy and uh,

527
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,240
people are when hashtagging that shit
on Twitter, like, yeah, no, no, no, no.

528
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,840
They're also putting it also,
by the way, it's really funny.

529
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:51,530
I'll be like,
ah,

530
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm going to be a Fort Myers November 1st
at your tickets here and there. Like A,

531
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,330
is there an entrance? Is there a special
entrance? If I have neuropathy issues,

532
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,320
Hashtag I couldn't believe
how his dick was so crazy,

533
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:09,430
so crazy. He jumped off, drove,

534
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,510
he's so impressive now on
your app. I mean, yeah.

535
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,250
His focus in life is fucking on
hold on. Before we move on. Yeah.

536
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,740
From the marriage topic. Yeah. Uh,

537
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,890
I want to let everybody know that we
were laying in bed last night and I'm

538
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:27,830
laying in my pregnancy pillow,
so I can't really move a lot.

539
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,720
So when I want affection from you,

540
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,260
I have to demand it like a Brussels
Griffon and come here gimme kisses.

541
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,260
Give me love and you fucking
gave me the laziest air kiss.

542
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,010
Yeah. I have ever seen watching. We were
watching something and you're like, Hey,

543
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:44,410
give me a kiss.
Yeah.

544
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:49,210
Instead what I did was I moved my lifts
to the right side of my face because

545
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,690
you're sitting to my right. I mean,
yeah. Even turn your head to the side.

546
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:58,880
Face, air kiss. I went, yeah, I like
that. Because you are watching a TV show.

547
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,120
I need to even want to turn your
head to look at me to air kiss me.

548
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,100
So you kept your eyes forward on TV
and then you, you side kissed. Yeah,

549
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,060
that's a lazy,

550
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,600
you also snapped me out of it because I
was actually zoned out and whatever we

551
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:15,350
were watching. So as soon as you pointed
out how bad that was, I did laugh.

552
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Preordained. Yeah. That was the Lazy Shit.
Yeah, it was real lazy. Yeah. I was like,

553
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,760
okay. There you go. No, no
neuropathy. What is this?

554
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:26,960
I don't know what the hell this is.

555
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,290
This message is for Thomas [inaudible].

556
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,040
This is Justin glassine with the
competitive water consumption consortium.

557
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,230
I just wanted to call to let you know
that we got your results back from our

558
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:39,180
fair competition,
your analysis department,

559
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:42,980
and to congratulate you on your latest
victory as the current water champions.

560
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,020
Wow.
Uh,

561
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,530
unfortunately we did find some performance
enhancing salts in your opponent's

562
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:54,220
sample. Uh, what was her
name? Kristina possessed sky.

563
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,320
Um,

564
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,370
but I can't talk too much about that
right now until the consortium puts out an

565
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:01,290
official statement concerning that issue.

566
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,203
Whatever.

567
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,231
Before I go,

568
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:07,380
I just wanted to add that after you
came down here for your analysis,

569
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,290
we cannot stop talking about
how great your presence was.

570
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,740
I swear I haven't been able to walk
into the break room without hearing my

571
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:16,900
coworkers. Were you telling
your stories or your jokes?

572
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,330
You just have such a great and charismatic
personality and we cannot wait to

573
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:24,750
have you back in the future.
Um, so it's all I got, you know,

574
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,480
best of luck to you in the future champ.
Well done.

575
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,370
Thanks Justin. That is such
bullshit. You whoa. Who is this guy?

576
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:33,020
He put them out to this. No, I didn't.

577
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,060
I swear to you that was just
submitted those Justin glassine. Okay.

578
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Justin Glass and it looks like the
city of Fremont is back with an update.

579
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,470
Thank God. Oh my God. Yeah. This
is a little gift and speech.

580
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,630
Actually, I'm a pussy boy. Oh, giving
back now downtown Vegas in the shit hole.

581
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,990
But I can relocate any place because
I get social security, you know,

582
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:58,750
and we carried,
I don't look my age of 66 huh?

583
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,940
66 I don't look,
my age is 66 86 fuck man.

584
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,220
Like God Damn Star Wars character,

585
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,180
which is I guess what the sound he
was making when it started, wasn't he?

586
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,353
I don't like it.

587
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,420
The Placebo. Maybe that'd be
white. Cause I like white, white,

588
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:20,940
white, white. And you could be mature
like me or well, you know, not too young.

589
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,270
It's actually, I'm looking at
delivery out with, you know, away.

590
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,400
Maybe we get it.
You like White Lady's done.

591
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,500
Ready for you to fuck me up any way you
want to do it. You wait. [inaudible] yeah.

592
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:38,030
Oh me anyway, come on. You wake
tramp. She has to be dominant.

593
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,190
You know we get it.

594
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,300
Maybe you want to put me in a closure
all the time and picks me up like a girl.

595
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,920
But then I dunno why he always resorts
to going aggro. He's like dress.

596
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,660
He wants to antagonize them
so that they abused him. Wow.

597
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,110
And then if I bay,

598
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,270
she can ask stuff her panties in my mouth
and duct tape my mouth and I be up to

599
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:00,594
a chair.

600
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,290
I'm going to paraphrase Dr
drew. Oh, the trauma. Yeah.

601
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,670
Yeah. He's been through a
lot, but he's, he was a free
mind. He was right there, man.

602
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,880
Yeah. I, we should have hung out with
them. The pussy boy. A free month.

603
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,850
That's right. You can go anywhere
though. It's the nice thing. Yeah,

604
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:23,650
he is mobile still. What do you think
about taking them in so disgusting. Look,

605
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:26,230
he's shirtless and I don't,
I love when somebody looks like it goes,

606
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,290
I don't look my age 66 that's
usually like women who will be like,

607
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,070
yeah, and I'm, I'm actually
really well put together pretty

608
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,510
well and you're like, uh, I like
how you make that judgment on you.

609
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,600
You're telling me the time they look
exactly their age or worse like this

610
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,770
fucking, it's seldom that somebody
doesn't legit look their age.

611
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,350
People who don't never say it.
In other words,

612
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,090
like the person who like
really looks down and goes,

613
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:56,170
you wouldn't believe how much younger I
looked at it. They just, they are that,

614
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,700
you know, it's like being like
smart people don't go like,

615
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:02,160
do you want to know how smart I am?
Like they just don't do,

616
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,040
they don't tell you this guy is 66 Bam.
He looks terrible.

617
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,820
Well yeah this is, I mean, I mean

618
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:15,370
he's got the smoke detector in the back
so that's good. The camera's facing down.

619
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,040
Hold it down. No shirt. So he checks

620
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,670
your mom's house requirements.
Yes. For a shitty videos.

621
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,520
If you had to white white,
White Lady,

622
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,650
give me hours.
Anyone's going to respond to that.

623
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,300
A real crazy person.
Somebody who is equally as sick as he is.

624
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,590
Nobody,
you know that's fucking out of control.

625
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,210
Did you see this thing that went viral?

626
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,710
This a kid talking shit to
this guy at a mark? Some shit.

627
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,480
Good. It's calming. No.

628
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,063
Okay.

629
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,593
Awesome.

630
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,783
This guy did it.

631
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,530
Voice call cause he's just
being like confronted by this

632
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,980
kid.
Look at the kid though.

633
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,110
He's fucking straight up on

634
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,280
this really weird

635
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,600
kid is like on them

636
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,830
started but it looks like the kid is um,

637
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,950
he said don't talk about
my mom or something. Hmm.

638
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,740
I like him
for him.

639
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,780
See he's putting these, he's
touching the guy. That's

640
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,810
what he thinks is right
now. They're actually, yeah.

641
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,450
Leaning a grown man in a kid or
leaning up against each other.

642
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,930
How do you think that
kid is 12 your ranch?

643
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,270
When I got to know more
about what happened here.

644
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,410
Is that something his mom

645
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,530
really funny video. Tom. Thanks.

646
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,250
What part of this is funny for you?
I didn't think it was funny.

647
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:26,360
I was just showing you the video.

648
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,100
I can't watch a little kid getting hurt
blue cars.

649
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,050
He was, I called him. Nene
starts to take to start testing.

650
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,790
Man. You're could just keep, cause he
just kept running around here. I said,

651
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:50,050
you need to tell it's
good to get out of here.

652
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,410
God told him to go and he went
down. Right. Where are you?

653
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,780
Bike ran back up here and started pushing.
Shown

654
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,930
who picked this one? Blue banner
videos today are fucking crazy.

655
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,410
What's happening. Um, I don't see anything
wrong with what the guy did though.

656
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,930
Pushing that kid down on the
ground. Yeah. I don't know, Dude.

657
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,400
Like he was swinging on him. The
kidneys checked you, but you have to,

658
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,720
you have to separate them.

659
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:21,240
Another adult should have
intervened and separated them.

660
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:25,750
You don't push a little boy down to the
claim. Is that little quick? He's 12 baby.

661
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,540
Yeah. He needed to be checked. We don't
push a kid on the concrete get crack.

662
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,460
It's just fucking, the kickoff
was was punching. Yeah. Yeah.

663
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:35,640
But you're bigger than him. Aren't there
rules to that? Yeah. Yeah. It's like,

664
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,240
this is what happened is be like, this is
what happens is that kid needs to know,

665
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,460
see what happens is that kid is going
to learn from this incident that if I go

666
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,820
ahead and just punch someone
when I'm angry, yes they could.

667
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,930
It could end poorly for me.
Right. So you need to be able to,

668
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,753
you know,

669
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,890
assess the situation and either restrain
yourself from punching when you want

670
00:42:58,891 --> 00:42:59,220
to.

671
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,120
Certainly don't think that you can punish
someone bigger than you and not have

672
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:06,240
repercussions. Yeah. No, I get
it. Look good. It is. I mean,

673
00:43:06,241 --> 00:43:08,970
he did the grab a machete to push
them on car. I mean, first of all,

674
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:12,060
it's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Yeah.
Fucking push a little kid on the floor.

675
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,650
But you're right.
This is called,

676
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,600
this is male thing where you guys have
to learn how to size someone back.

677
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,640
I defy okay.
Like I did him a favor.

678
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,680
I got to pee. I'm sorry I'm pregnant.
I got to go. Don't fuck that.

679
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,480
He should have fucked that kid. No, I said
fuck that kid. Fuck that kid is right.

680
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:35,340
Are You going to pee? Yeah. All right,
great. How was your p? Pretty magical.

681
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,660
I'm so fucking hungry
today, ma'am. All right.

682
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,280
It's like I have a person inside of
it is like that can't stop eating.

683
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,710
I got this bullshit.
Listen to uh, is bullshit.

684
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,990
It was the one doctor drew was
here. Oh listen. Or a praying lady.

685
00:43:48,991 --> 00:43:50,250
I take amazing dogs.

686
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,310
I always tell him for me that you have
to harass Burt before you eat yours.

687
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,190
Dude, you have to what? You'd
Harass Bert. Do you call me? Bert?

688
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,330
That's what they're saying. Call
me bird. Oh, let's hear it again.

689
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,980
I don't need to have for me.

690
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:09,330
Then you have to harass Burt before
you eat yours your ass first.

691
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,790
He said burst her ass
her ass first for me.

692
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,320
Then you have to harass
Burt before you ask for.

693
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,880
You have to eat her ass
Berg. Oh, last first.

694
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,860
He said he knows you saying he's trying
to say first and then said they can't.

695
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:24,511
You just,
yeah,

696
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:29,260
you're asking you for enough to harass
Burt before you eat her ass bird.

697
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,400
Burb instead I asked burgers.

698
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,160
We got to send it to him ma'am. Yeah,
it's totally unacceptable. Totally on.

699
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,430
It's all going to go do a show now. You
gotta you gotta show him that clip there.

700
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,940
That's it right there. Listen. Burb

701
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,830
first,

702
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:52,830
did you have to harass Burt before you
through his first not bird bird burp.

703
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,770
Burp. It's cute. Speaking of ass.

704
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
I was getting a mom's size yesterday.
Yeah.

705
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,940
And I was holding in so many
farts like the whole time,

706
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:10,800
like every times when they give you a
massage and they'll push down like from

707
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:13,020
your mid back to your
lower back towards like,

708
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,330
they're like they're showing
the fart where to go,

709
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,130
like heres your digestive track.
Well I lay on my side for these,

710
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,530
but I ate Mexican food.

711
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:27,050
I had like so much food and I was
the whole time I've relaxed, relaxed.

712
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:29,640
Then I'd feel the FARC come back
and then I'd have to clench, clench,

713
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:33,240
clench plans and then it waits. It would
wake me up and then it occurred to me,

714
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,020
wouldn't it be great to find him a Zeus
that actually encouraged your farts?

715
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,390
That was like, Oh yeah, right
now you got to let that far down.

716
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,950
Breathe in and push hard. Like with
the, like when the whisper, yeah,

717
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,323
you have to Fart.

718
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,770
Go ahead and give me that.
Yeah,

719
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,720
you got to breathe in and you gotta push
that far down and then they're like,

720
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:04,740
that's right.
I'm sure there is.

721
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:07,500
There has to be somebody that's like
the fart. I don't know if I would say,

722
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:11,100
I'm sure there is. I don't think
that that's necessarily correct.

723
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,960
Pharmacists in La maybe.
I mean if you put out a request,

724
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,640
I'm sure someone who likes bars
will be like, I could massage you,

725
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,060
but I don't know if there's
a FARC massage therapy.

726
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,110
The prerequisite isn't that they have to
like the fart but just that they don't

727
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,850
make you clench your ass.
Cause I feel like,

728
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,150
I feel like it takes away from
the relaxation experience.

729
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:32,940
If I could just let it rip
without embarrassment horse,

730
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,090
how much better would your massage be?
Yeah, if you could be. If you're like,

731
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:39,610
oh here comes a fart and they're like,
don't worry about it. Yeah cause I,

732
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,530
well you don't know if you have a,
a real rancid one or if you have,

733
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,880
oh mine are horrible right now because
I feel like I'm close enough to the lady

734
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:52,260
that we go to all the time. I was this
close yesterday. It'd be like, listen,

735
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,150
I got to rip one and you're cool with it.

736
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,320
She'd probably be cold it to probably
be cold and I didn't want to blast like

737
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,640
you. Of course. Of course. What if we
give pay somebody extra and be like,

738
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:05,640
here's the extra money.
If you just let me fight the whole time,

739
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:06,930
they would definitely say yes,

740
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,810
I dare you to do it next time we're
at like a nice lake place. He wasn't.

741
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,270
If I know what happened is I go,

742
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:16,140
if I ship you a little more they're
going to be like, no, no, no, no. Wait,

743
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:20,220
let me finish my sentence.
Do you mind tip you a little more?

744
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,820
If I can fart the whole time
my,

745
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,310
they're expecting the hand job offer
and you're like, I just got a far,

746
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,130
I just want to, and then she's like,
she'll probably go, people fart

747
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,840
all the time. I'm like, so do you mind,

748
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:38,770
cause I do feel like that's
the one hindrance to me.
Fully relaxing and enjoying.

749
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,800
Yeah. If I could just take
out that fart barrier.

750
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,040
If you have to far, far,
I'd be like, no, no, no,

751
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,710
but I need you to waft it to yourself.

752
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:50,180
No, I can. I like it. I like it.
I don't need the encouragement.

753
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,000
What about this guy you think
he would would let you fart?

754
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,150
Here's your massage.
The baby.

755
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,790
It's a baby chick coming aside and Nixon.

756
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,000
I can't take it.
Do you think

757
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,100
so? I kind of big black Dick.
Okay. And so let me dig back

758
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:15,660
on one horn. He chrysalis.
Sansa cancer claim. Okay.

759
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,993
Yeah.

760
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,560
He said Chrissy, with
your role. So tight hold,

761
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,860
come ride my pipe tonight.
And while the other things me,

762
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,020
I didn't even buddy

763
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,663
hold on.

764
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,180
Crazy heels on. Probably. Yeah.

765
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,340
He really should show them if
he's going to bother wearing.

766
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,970
I know that's a quite a outfit.
What is that?

767
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,230
It's nothing Tom. Just yeah. My,

768
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:47,250
my least favorite sexual genre.
Yeah. Is the crossing of Christmas,

769
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:48,150
the Lord of our birth.

770
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,410
The birth of our Lord and Savior with
sexual or sexualizing Santa's. Yeah.

771
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,220
I never understood that. Okay. Yeah.

772
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,480
I fucked sand our singing
Santa Baby. That songs. Yeah,

773
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:05,010
like that's the least. It's
just, it's a child thing.

774
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,360
It just so like how can we don't do what
the Easter bunny like fucking eastern

775
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:12,600
money. Yes. I'm sure
I know. I just really,

776
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,420
I really don't like the Santa here.

777
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,970
Is there one thing? I know you, I
know it puts you in a good mood.

778
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,180
We established this yesterday. Yeah,
I know. It can make you laugh. Yeah.

779
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,910
This is again,
part of a,

780
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:27,390
if you're wondering what makes somebody
happy through a marriage, it's like, okay,

781
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,900
knowing their sweet spots because
one thing I know about you,

782
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:36,360
you love music. You know you
love scatting. I love scouting.

783
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,320
How about group scatty?
Okay,

784
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,463
Lina.

785
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,680
That's rough man.

786
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,960
Well especially because it's a group
of Dorky white kids. Yeah, I know guys.

787
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,560
You're doing it better than their,
their, their laser Lee doing it.

788
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,470
They're going to get, well, you
get here taps cause all off rhythm.

789
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,170
They're doing it lazy though. They're not
even doing it. So you're doing it Chris.

790
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,100
You're like,

791
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,640
these kids are terrible at this.
This is terrible.

792
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,420
[inaudible]

793
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,660
no,
not the white girl.

794
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,840
Oh Jesus.
Please let the black kid do it.

795
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,140
I can't hear these fucking white
girls doing this. Let's get to him

796
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,673
please.

797
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,180
Is He doing it a hundred times better?

798
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,170
I think I might like scat cause that kid
did it well let me listen to a little

799
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,004
bit of soul

800
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,660
[inaudible]

801
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,200
it's definitely better
than the other people.

802
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:48,700
But look at all the kids looking at him
like, Whoa, wow, how can really do it?

803
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,350
How it's done.
This is embarrassing.

804
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,200
He got into it.
Don't you feel like,

805
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,200
like this is something you totally could
have fallen into and like elementary

806
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:03,130
school, oh maybe elementary school. Like
you can just make sounds with your mouth.

807
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,080
You know what I mean? Like um, you know,

808
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:07,060
like if you're like
I'm in the choir group,

809
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,720
I do music group at school and then
like the music instructor is like,

810
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:13,870
we're going to do this thing called scat
and you're like young and you're like,

811
00:52:13,871 --> 00:52:14,770
yeah,
what's that?

812
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,770
Well it's like this jazz thing and then
next thing you know there's a video of

813
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:22,570
you doing this shit. I mean, it would
not be, uh, at their age. No, no.

814
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,280
You're telling me like I was
six or something? Yeah. Yeah.

815
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:31,360
I'd say up until sixth grade you could
get sucked into doing stupid. No, no, no.

816
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,960
You think 12 1212 I'd be out.

817
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,760
He's this fucking game.

818
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,870
I think I could've gotten roped in
at 12 that would be the last year.

819
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,000
They can make me do something.
That's embarrassing.

820
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,460
1111 [inaudible].

821
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,350
Who's singing that was, that
one was better. Who's that?

822
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,820
Who's to his right and behind her we
can't see who it is. Wow. That one was,

823
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,270
that was my, that was actually the best
one yet. That was the best one. Yeah.

824
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,740
The first few were like

825
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,360
[inaudible] all together.

826
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:22,370
[inaudible]

827
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,540
let's see. That was better because
they rehearsed it. Right? This, this,

828
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,460
you know, the scat stuff was in.
It was terrible. What if our sons,

829
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:39,980
like, I just love to Scat Dad,
come listen to the scout record

830
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,810
and act like I liked this nonsense.

831
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,480
Fucking hambone this asshole.
Fuck.

832
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,610
[inaudible]

833
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,893
see now

834
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,440
the last time we played hambone
we did a kind of an analysis,

835
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:17,270
like who's less talented?
That guy or the lung infection song guy,

836
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,050
lung infection guy won by a landslide,
he killed it.

837
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:25,400
Now Pam bone versus scat.
Who's,

838
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:30,410
who's the lesser talent? Well,
that's a good question. I mean,

839
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,390
I think I hated a ham bone guy more.
Yeah.

840
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,140
But I think now that I've spent
some time in the scat world,

841
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,750
I definitely hate them. Well, here's the
thing, the people in the scat community,

842
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:49,550
they seem to be very earnest.
Like there's a very earnest love of scat,

843
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,370
but the ham bone guy,
I still feel like he's,

844
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,100
he knows that he's put
one over on the audience.

845
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,980
Like he's so smug with how he does it.

846
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:00,170
And of course that's what contributes
to why you hate him so much.

847
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,973
I've worked this

848
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,380
ham boning my whole life.
Yeah. It's not as, um,

849
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,570
yeah. The other ones just seem so
innocent compared to him. True, true.

850
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,250
What would you rather watch that group,
scat video or handbook for an hour,

851
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,530
an hour.
You're buying a ticket,

852
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:24,470
you're driving your parking
of the two without question.

853
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,010
I think I could at least get lost
in the fact that he does movement.

854
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,090
And I know, but they were terrible. Okay.

855
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:37,091
Would you rather watch an Andrew
Lloyd Weber musical or Hambone?

856
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,043
Hmm.

857
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,270
You got to end here thing the, the
Andrew Lloyd Weber musical. It's ours.

858
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,360
It's not just one hour. It's like two
and a half, I'm guessing. Two and a half,

859
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,660
three hours, right. Um, yeah.

860
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,640
To watch a musical or
you got to watch an hour.

861
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,140
I about Pam. Whoa. I would take it now.
I would take the Andrew Lloyd Webber.

862
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,620
I don't want to see a three hour anything.

863
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,270
I don't want to see three
hours of like the best standup.

864
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,370
I don't want to see a three hour
movie, three hour. I knew that.

865
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,410
I really hate going to something
that long. It's too, it's too much.

866
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:22,680
It's too much to too much, too much. Um,

867
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:23,980
this,
I

868
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
know also you'll enjoy this on
the way out of the show here.

869
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:32,290
We got to wrap up here soon. We got
to go to that meeting soon. Yup. Yup.

870
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:33,961
This point,

871
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:38,010
the information that we have is that
there is a male subject who has dedicated

872
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,010
his intoxication level

873
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,640
spewing poop all over the house.
What should I buy?

874
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,950
Carry here? What's going on, Gary?

875
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:55,750
She thinks I'm too drunk
to grab home. Okay. And uh,

876
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,120
I don't think I am, but,
okay. Let me ask you this.

877
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:05,050
Have you used the bathroom on
yourself? Well, yes. Okay, cool.

878
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,420
My main thing is this point,

879
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:09,500
I just want to make sure you don't
have any pcs on you anywhere. Oh,

880
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,520
I cleaned myself up in the bathroom.
Okay.

881
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,560
So I'm done when I have gas. Right.
It's a little bit more I got you.

882
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,920
But is it a crime to shit on oneself?
Well, let's, let's see what happened.

883
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,150
Hang tight right here for me for just a
second. Okay, let me go talk to Mindy.

884
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,670
Okay.
He said he cleaned himself up in here.

885
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,570
How much he's done twice. Oh
Wow. Yeah, I know. Seriously.

886
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,650
I don't mind him. Right. Okay.

887
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,940
Look at the front of the,

888
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,940
is this a crime for somebody to miss the
toilet subreddit and residents that we

889
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:47,390
didn't miss it? Look, there's
strict streaming down the

890
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,610
are some of my all over my walls.
Yeah.

891
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,900
And I need boots poopy underwater
today. My kitchen. I'm like,

892
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:59,400
what is wrong with a
little bit disgusting? Yes.

893
00:57:59,401 --> 00:58:03,500
How will you might want
grab your dog? Hey, nasty.

894
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,780
I don't want the dog to get,

895
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,750
but is this, isn't this just like
a domestic issue? Sounds like it,

896
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:13,260
but also it sounds like she's helped.
Like she's like, will you talk to him?

897
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:14,970
I don't think they're like,
we're going to arrest him.

898
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,170
She's a good friend of mine. The lady and

899
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,770
I went to a bar and going further apart.
Yeah.

900
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:32,220
She's pretty picky about Cleveland
does. Sure. Yeah. She sounds like

901
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,510
real uptight. Yeah, she's good.
Yeah. What's wrong with her?

902
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,480
Here's the deal. Um, this officer's going
to be nice enough to take your home.

903
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:43,314
Okay.

904
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:47,520
She's going to take you home or not try
to push her forward out or anything like

905
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:49,820
that. And this car or pay, I
don't want to let you do what?

906
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:53,970
Try not to fart out or do anything in the
car with you to make a mess in his car.

907
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:54,804
Okay.

908
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,850
I think I just had to tell someone,
don't fart in this guy's car.

909
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,060
Oh that police officer had
the tell a civilian like,

910
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,440
could you not push your farts cause
you shit when you fart usually. Yeah.

911
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,900
I got to get a paid leave. I was
in there. Don't open that bag

912
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,760
in my car. We're all live out here and
you can come back and get those pitches.

913
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,500
A marriage,
a bag up.

914
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,810
Poor police officers.

915
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,590
Did you imagine getting called
out for this fucking nonsense?

916
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,610
Some drunk guy shitting myself in case
he happens to try to push her forward out

917
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,660
on the pushes out a little bit more again,
they can get all over the seat.

918
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,250
They're blonde girl right there.

919
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,420
You're going to try and do everything
you can to stay on that the entire time

920
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:45,650
you were in this car.
Okay,

921
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:50,820
no shit. Yeah. God bless the police. I
mean those are good cops right there. No.

922
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:54,210
Are you serious? I'm being serious.
Yeah, those are nice ones. They're like,

923
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,680
are you kidding me? What a Gig? Give
this fucking asshole. Could you imagine?

924
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,920
I mean, look, I know the
police get a bad rap and stuff,

925
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:06,921
but the amount of just nonsense you
have to deal with on a daily basis.

926
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,830
I mean you and I deal with drunk
people all the tall the time. Yeah.

927
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:17,010
And you add alcohol to somebody who's
already got their wires loose a little bit

928
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:20,790
and it is just like kerosene on
the fire. I mean, like this guy,

929
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:24,390
I'm sure when he's sober he probably
doesn't do that as much, you know?

930
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,780
No alcohol killer drugs and
alcohol man. All right. Which song?

931
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:29,820
There's two songs in my folder.
You want to pick one?

932
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,680
What do we got a one's called piss
on me by Logan stake. One is called,

this one by Chris Spence.

Piss on me. Okay. Piss on me. Here it is.
