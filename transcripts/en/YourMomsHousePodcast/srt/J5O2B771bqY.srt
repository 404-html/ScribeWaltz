You want to explain yourself,

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,660

You're very excited about this.

I feel like this is your, your project,
your baby that you've been gestating on.

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,560
We're in the early stages of,
uh,

12
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,930
getting a new studio space
for us to expand the show.

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,640
Big surprises around the
corner guys. It'll take a
while. It'll take a few months.

this whole wow thing going on.

I'm two weeks from delivering
a human being right now,

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,310
just two weeks before a person comes
out of my vagina and it's a miracle.

18
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm even sitting here talking to you

66
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,600
so all that Tom segura.com/tour.

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,000
I say what I'm trying
really hard not to do,

68
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,230
cause I breathe really
heavily when I'm pregnant.

69
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:40,110
I'm trying not to do what your dad does
into the phone. Like what's the worst

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,490
latest thing was when I, when I
finally was like, what? Like I go like,

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,510
what the fuck's going on? What are you
doing? He goes, just our breathe. Yeah.

72
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,600
And I go, no, it's not. It's
not just how you breathe. Yeah.

73
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,270
You don't just go,
what do you think's going on?

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,860
I mean, something abnormal. You can't just
be like, that's how I read. No it's not.

75
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,010
It's not how you treat labored breathing,
labored breathing.

76
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,710
That's why I breathed that way. Cause
I'm, you know, 37 weeks pregnant. Yeah.

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,590
And I shouldn't be this heavy,
but my fat Indian Stepdad who's dead now,

78
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,190
he looked like this all the time
cause he had a lot of hard fat.

79
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,610
What was it you called? Visceral
fat and yeah, and he was always like

80
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,580
to, so it has something to do with
having a big fat belly. I think.

81
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,570
Well maybe it does. I Dunno. He um, uh,
he totally just exude, just goes like,

82
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,440
well I do tell me, I mean that's just how,

83
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,750
oh my God, this just our brain
just harboring, oh my God,

84
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:42,584
you're going.
Yeah.

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,670
That's how you breathe. No, it's not
like you have shortness of breath.

86
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,770
It's not healthy. It's definitely
not a healthy way to breathe. No.

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,020
Like it kills me more. He's answered
to it then that he's doing it.

88
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,980
You know what

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,330
I mean?
Like when someone is just goes,

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,630
that's just how I know it
is not just how you do it.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,540
Cause I'm also around you when you're
not doing that. How is that right? Yeah.

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,690
So when is he not doing that? I
don't know. It's just like TV.

93
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,570
It's more like a resting. He
doesn't break read that way. Oh No.

94
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,160
Do you think he's excited? Maybe and
it's like excitement, breath very well.

95
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,570
Could be, but it's not, it's not like
something you should just ignore and go.

96
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:25,640
That's just his breathing pattern.
It's not

97
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,460
just my way, just how I do this.
Dad just people had all the time.

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,930
I go to the doctor. That's just
how Ip, yeah, that's just how I be.

99
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,900
But it's like how we get, he's always
read like how as humans we just get,

100
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,780
we adapt to the bad things.
Instead of being like, Hey,

101
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,720
I should probably go to a doctor,
has no outlet next to my nightstand.

102
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,020
I just can't plug in over here.
Guess I won't charge my phone.

103
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,200
Makes me fucking crazy.
That's his explanation.

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,360
Why are you breathing so heavily? Just
how I breathe. It's, but it's not,

105
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,550
you're right. There's something,
there's some neuropathy issues.

106
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,740
Definitely someone neuropathy.
Uh, before I forget guys.

123
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,860
they're like, wow, her stomach
keeps getting beverage.

124
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,200
Is she pregnant? Is she
really pregnant? Yeah.

125
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,710
People keep saying I'm as
fat as Burt and I don't know.

126
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:20,600
Do you think that my stomach looks as big
as birds? His stomach bigger than mine?

127
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,150
He has. He thinks out of the
bird's fatter than, I mean not fat.

128
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,950
This is in fact this is a child, but,
oh, he looks like you as triplets. Yeah,

129
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,590
he's huge right now. He's really
big, but he knows he's really big.

130
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:38,510
He's really big. I talked to him.
He does. Yeah. He say just, um,

131
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,140
just when he's just been going
hard. You know, he's been traveling,

132
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,350
touring a lot and uh, he's, uh,

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,530
he's still riding the marathon flames.
Oh.

134
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:51,980
So he still thinks he's burning calories
from running one marathon in April?

135
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,980
Yeah. The answer is yes. And
you're really kind of went

136
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,520
crazy after the marathon. Yeah. It's
been months, months, Bro. I get it.

137
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,590
Shit. Uh, yeah. So he's gonna
he, he just goes, you know him.

138
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,990
It's either hardcore one way or the other.

139
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,210
Yeah. Well, I saw a picture of him,
you showed me on Instagram. It doesn't,

140
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,200
it doesn't look good.

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,510
Nothing. None of it looked good. No, no.

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,700
Yeah, it doesn't look good. He looks
heavy. It could be the lighting,

143
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:25,930
but I don't think so. I don't
think so. You know, pictures are,

144
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,310
it's pretty brutal.

145
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,710
Sounds like my dad talking
about his breathing bad
light. It's not a good light.

146
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,410
It's just how I breathe,
how I breathe.

147
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,380
I feel totally normal and natural,

148
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,620
but that is a common dad breath thing,

149
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,970
like with her fat when they're fat,
it's really fat isn't it?

150
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:55,110
Isn't it just means I guess. I don't
know. I mean my Indian fat Stepdad,

151
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,330
that's why he did that because he,

152
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,920
he was really terrifying to sit next to,
I'm serious.

153
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:02,620
I've sat next to him when he's
doing that and I go, are you okay?

154
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,090
I'm fine. Terrifying. Have you? You're
fine. He's like, I'm fine. I go here.

155
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,380
You're going like that. He's like, oh, I
feel fine. Like completely dismisses it.

156
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,750
Yeah, no. You know what he does to his,

157
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,770
he'll put his arms around
his body and then come

158
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,450
and you'll see like his chest rise and
fall and the arms too and you're like, oh,

159
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,430
you're really going hard there.

160
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,880
You're really working hard and you're
just sitting here like, I wonder,

161
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,530
has he been for a physical?

162
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh yeah, yeah, no, I called
them. I always check on it as a,

163
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,700
as a health and he had some tests run
everything you like past everything was

164
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:43,700
like flying cars, Pyne, Pyne,
Pyne. Hmm. So maybe it is just my,

165
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,360
we breeds, I don't buy it. I don't buy
it. I'd need to hear a doctor tell me.

166
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,480
It's definitely normal. Well, if
he started breathing like that,

167
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,390
I would hope that you'd run to the
hospital. If I was reading like that,

168
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:59,100
I would know that is not how I breathe in.
You breathe just sitting here.

169
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,950
Yeah. And it's also, it's not
every phone call and it's not,

170
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:09,290
every situation is odd.

171
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,800
It's gotta be due to excitement or maybe
some physical activity. He's just done.

172
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,270
We got to pay attention to when
the heavy breathing begins.

173
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm going to start paying attention more.

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,740
You're really gassy today.
Exceptional.

175
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,150
But you've already taken two
shits too. Yeah. You took one.

176
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,550
You take to Nate came back from Ellis
school. You take a shit. That's it. Oh,

177
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:38,390
I thought you went upstairs to take
another one. No. Oh, just change shirts.

178
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,740
He farted a lot after your shit,
which is like not normal.

179
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,170
Usually brings that whole
theory and the question.

180
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,420
Well Cause Brown makes the fart slow down.
Yeah.

181
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,040
Well in your case
sometimes it the forts come

182
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,090
out more.
Some days.

183
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:59,140
God just gives you gifts all day long
and then this could be one of those days.

184
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,030
Yeah. Yup. Interesting. You're ready to
jump in this? Sure, sure, sure, sure.

185
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,160
I got a lot of topics.
Yeah.

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,753
Does

187
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,870
your phone

188
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,340
think

189
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,893
don't

190
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,030
go to your mom's house?

191
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,750
Personally I don't think I would be
embarrassed and I'll tell you why I don't

192
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:43,280
keep saved things on my phone is God
pulling up my search history? Yes.

193
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,090
That's an issue.
But saved items.

194
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:50,780
I don't keep thinking saved.
Who's saving pornography? I Dunno.

195
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,610
I feel like that's kind of a,
I mean you only,

196
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,050
what you save is you save the horrifying
thing to show your friends. Right.

197
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,800
The jokey stuff. Yeah. The joke you
stuff, the really outrageous stuff,

198
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:05,180
which everyone knows that you're doing
that just to kind of shock people,

199
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,940
but God knows when you're trying
to shock people. Yeah, he knows.

200
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,560
And do you think he got invented
porn stars got invented porn. Yeah.

201
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,680
He knows when you want to come.

202
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,830
He knows that there's stuff that if
you're going for your common stuff,

203
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,070
you saved the comm stuff. I don't
think so. I don't know. You know,

204
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:22,000
but I've heard the guys do and I,
they share that the,

205
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,140
they're good clips with each
other. I've heard guys doing
that. Really? Oh No, dude,

206
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:30,020
you guys are all fucking
nasty shit. I don't, uh, I
don't have the type of friend.

207
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,170
I don't have it. I really
don't. The guy who's like, hey,

208
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:37,730
I dropped off a lot to this clip. You
might want to jerk off to it too. Um,

209
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,060
yeah. No. Well that doesn't
really happen for me.

210
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,560
I don't have friends that are like,
this is gross.

211
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,960
You want to a man know what
makes you come. But this
made me, it's not like that.

212
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,080
It does seem rather personal.
It, yeah, it does. Pornography.

213
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,110
Now you'd get the penis out,
you'll pull the skin.

214
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,340
A lot of people then there was
circumstances. Yeah. Circumstance this.

215
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:02,390
So it's very, um, I don't think
I'd be embarrassed either.

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,130
I don't w what's on there? Pictures
of my kid. Yeah, some stupid things.

217
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:10,980
I've written jokes like, oh,
okay, that's not really my auntie.

218
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,440
She's embarrassed of the stuff on her
computer and she's projecting out stuff

219
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:18,770
that she pulls up when
she wants to. Rajan, Rob,

220
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,450
rob being that person.
Like what is wrong with us?

221
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,010
Like what is wrong with these people?
What was timed? If I could do all that,

222
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:31,200
that's a lot of time.
A lot of times to yell at strangers.

223
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:34,680
And here's the way I found out about this
lady. She's got a youtube channel now.

224
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,340
Boy,
she does this shit all the time.

225
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,750
She travels all over the world who
her channel. It gets like, you know,

226
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,670
a hundred views a video.

227
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,290
So I have no idea how she funds this.

228
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:52,250
She does this or she go crazy trips.
She does these crazy, she talks about,

229
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,360
you know, uh, it's her trips. Yeah.

230
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,260
And then the best is that
she's in Europe right now.

231
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:01,760
You see everybody who walks by Europeans
are so much more comfortable with this

232
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:04,280
stuff. They don't guilt, guilt,

233
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:09,050
trip people for watching silliness.
It's nonsense. It's absolute nonsense.

234
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,810
I mean, this is what she wears that
Amsterdam. Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

235
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,160
Okay.

236
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,070
Even that's an eyelash. Yeah.
Yeah. They just kind of like, oh,

237
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:47,480
this is a really crazy
person. Littleness. Yeah.

238
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,380
They're really treating her
as such, you know? Yeah.

239
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,943
No,

240
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,960
you don't realize that. That's
just a story. Metaphor. Well,

241
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:19,150
it's also quite a bummer to think that
you've traveled all the way to Europe in

242
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:22,690
this beautiful square and the only thing
she's doing is yelling at people for

243
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,680
jerking off. I know.
God put your shit down.

244
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,490
Go put the Bible down and go eat a waffle.

245
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,020
I wonder little beer if you're this crazy.
How do you get through?

246
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,700
Like how do you get through breakfast?
Like Perry,

247
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,290
who crazy to interact in life,
but you're, you know what I mean?

248
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:42,580
Like you don't know how crazy this is,
but you know how to get on a plane. Yeah.

249
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:45,010
And you buy a ticket. You can click
on the Internet. You buy a ticket.

250
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,290
You have a passport.
Yeah. How did she do that?

251
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,040
How does she then the God messages
kicks in after that. I don't know.

252
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,340
Or did she have a husband and he's
got a fucking get an ear full of this

253
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:57,850
nonsense every day. This lady doesn't
have a husband. I don't think so.

254
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,300
It's so weird to me. There's no men
putting up with this nonsense. Elise.

255
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,980
She's got a purpose in life. You
know what I mean? It's her thing.

256
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:10,720
Then she's traveled from
Tennessee to Amsterdam to be like,

257
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:13,720
what's on your phone?
At least she left the United States.

258
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,660
A lot of Americans never do. Yeah,
that's true. I'm proud of her.

259
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,123
That's true.

260
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,390
Does
Amsterdam?

261
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,770
Yes,
everyone does.

262
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,030
I'm a nerd.

263
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,140
I said, well, what all those
people are there for you, nerd.

264
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,920
You're a fucking fucking Dork.
That's the leader of the door.

265
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,440
That's why everyone went there in
the nineties when I was in college.

266
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:47,850
That's like the first destination.
That's when, yeah, no one could get,

267
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:50,850
we'd go to Amsterdam. You go walk
around the red light districts.

268
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:55,050
He hookers and stuff. P in the
streets. Yeah, that's fine.
No, she still goes there.

269
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,483
He tests too.

270
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,550
What happens in Amsterdam
not staying in Amsterdam?

271
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,760
What happens in Amsterdam

272
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,280
or shop?
God,

273
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,700
you know, when I was in, um,
Charlotte, a couple of years in a row,

274
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,040
there's a corner there on what does it
try on street where somebody is up there

275
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,330
doing, not this stuff, but
some similar thing preaching

276
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,600
the corner. It's interesting.
It's so annoying. Childish. Well,

277
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:34,370
it's childish to think that God is keeping
score cards on people's jerk sessions.

278
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,770
Yeah. And like what are
you masturbating to time?

279
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:40,100
Is it Hetero or is it weird
how hard you come though?

280
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,280
Like he's grading it. I hope so. I don't
think he's got that kind of time. But no,

281
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,440
it seems like he has more important
things going on. And then again, he is,

282
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,360
God knows everything.
Right.

283
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,190
And we're saying him a gender right now.
Oh.

284
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,890
Oh Shit. He is. God, you know,

285
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,920
I'm sure a lot of people listening right
now who are nodding along. Thank you,

286
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:05,750
Tom. Thank you. I'm offended.
You know, it's so funny. Every,

287
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,520
every month with our boy and I'm
sorry to assign him a gender,

288
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,300
but I mean look, these people that
are really hung up on this shit,

289
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:17,360
like you're assigning gender
properties to kids. Like,

290
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,970
I don't know if you've ever
raised a boy or a girl. Why?

291
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,950
That shit's pretty innate.
Like glaring. Yeah.

292
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,740
I'm not forcing trucks into his
hands are forcing dirt on him.

293
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,420
He just gravitates to it naturally.
Yeah. It's pretty innate.

294
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,220
Yeah. He's all dude. And you know, I
tried giving them dolls than like it.

295
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,701
Oh.

296
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:41,640
I think a lot of it has to do with this
social construct that he's been brought

297
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:42,474
up.

298
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,773
No.

299
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,040
Do you think marijuana? Marijuana,

300
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,870
how come nerds always call it marijuana?
They're racist. Oh, is that right?

301
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,420
Racist term. Marijuana. Yeah.
What are you talking about?

302
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,170
Uh,

303
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:04,170
I did this a show where they play this
clip that marijuana is actually racist.

304
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,600
Then the word interest,
you'd be saying cannabis.

305
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,840
Oh, the medical term is cannabis. I see.
I see. Well it's marijuana. A white.

306
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,780
Why is it racist?
Because I don't know.

307
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,490
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, cause
it was used to, I don't know.

308
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,870
Marijuana.
Why?

309
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,530
Cause it's racist ass.

310
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,310
The term was used to knock on people
of color and their devilish ways. Ooh,

311
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,120
the word itself is an inherently racist,

312
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,280
but it was used by American prohibitionist
to exploit racism and xenophobia.

313
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,900
So by using the m word, oh, right.

314
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,070
Crashing against Mexican immigrants.
Here we go. Let's go on a quick history.

315
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,980
Shall We? Oh Geez. We'd have the American
elite since the 1840 [inaudible].

316
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,070
It was even sold over the counter as
medication to treat insomnia, Migraines,

317
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,150
and rheumatism. But it didn't
become controversial. And
to the early 19 hundreds,

318
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,770
when millions of Mexicans migrated to
the US following the Mexican revolution

319
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,580
with them,

320
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,850
they brought muddy water and their customs
is milking it casually and regular.

321
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:11,050
Yeah,

322
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,620
I get it. So if you say muddied one
though, you're implying that it's

323
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,550
saying marijuana. Oh, for good.
Because it's racist ass. Oh,

324
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:26,040
for God's sake. This is
what I did. The podcast.

325
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,780
Okay. Ethan Cline and he la Isla, um,

326
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,080
sounds like a Mexican name.
She Mexican Israeli. Hmm. Um,

327
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,210
but they played this for me. Okay.
And how do they feel about it? Well,

328
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,290
I know how I feel about it.

329
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,760
I feel like this makes a lot of sense
and I'm not down with racism of any form

330
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,680
or any kind. Yeah. And I think
that when people do say the m word,

331
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,100
they are really rubbing it in
the faces of people like me,

332
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:03,630
people of Latin descent,
people have uh, families that,

333
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,690
that grew up in these areas and that
had been marginalized for centuries.

334
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,170
And so I, yeah, I stood up for this
guy because I'm also fucking stupid.

335
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,200
So
that's just how I feel.

336
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,980
The m word and that's my favorite is
the amp. And you can't say marijuana.

337
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:24,580
Of course. You could say marijuana.
Unbelievable. You should say marijuana.

338
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:27,460
And the thing that you should really do
is find this guy and say marijuana to

339
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:30,520
him all the time. Let him get
upset. My favorite, he's, he's like,

340
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,760
it's not inherently racist.
It's like racist adjacent.

341
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:39,070
Like once you hear this fucking long
ass convoluted thing, now it's racist.

342
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:43,450
This is this, this, this is
a perfect example of Christ.

343
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,300
The end of the world. Yeah.
Well, the end of the world,

344
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,440
and this is liberals
who've lost their gardens,

345
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,460
this is far left wing.

346
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,540
Liberals get it in their heads that,
um,

347
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,510
you know, that everything is a problem.
Every language, everything is a problem.

348
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,710
Every look, every indicator,
every day. What's your, you
should meet people and go,

349
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:10,180
what's your pronoun like when the
nonsense takes over. Yeah. It's, um,

350
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,130
it's,
it's really a liberal thing.

351
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:17,131
It's the social justice warriors and
far lefties who are just as crazy as the

352
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,400
far righties and the Internet. I'll tell
you the biggest problem I think too,

353
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,390
is that people can search for
something and get this much tiny bit of

354
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:30,190
information on a huge topic
and now they're fucking
suddenly experts on it. Oh,

355
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:34,570
but you didn't, he didn't see this video
of this thing. It's like, dude, listen,

356
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,380
it's so silly. Everybody.
So it's out of control. Yup.

357
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,640
Everybody's out of fucking control.
It's absolute nonsense.

358
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,380
Everybody's so fucking sensitive
about shit that doesn't matter.

359
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,400
It doesn't even fucking matter. The main
things we should stop saying marijuana.

360
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,590
I know. That's the biggest problem
in the u s right, idiot man. I know.

361
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,390
He's offended.
My favorite.

362
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,490
I'm really offended when
people say the word marijuana.

363
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,970
I like when you get offended by
something that absolutely nobody,

364
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,680
it doesn't register to anyone. You
know? Like if you're like, um, uh,

365
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,800
you know, you should really be careful
when you say watermelon. It's like, wait,

366
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:13,760
what? Why? They're like, well, you don't
know the history of watermelons. No,

367
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,960
no one else does either.

368
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,850
Most of us are just trying to keep a
roof over her head and raise our children

369
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,400
and trying to make, not make them
assholes. You know what I mean?

370
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,980
When Armenians first got to this country,

371
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,170
one of the only fruits they consume or
watermelons. So when you say watermelon,

372
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,150
you're really talking about the plight
of the Armenian immigrant. Oh, okay,

373
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,150
well I'm gonna eat some watermelon
now you can go fuck yourself.

374
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,910
And the saddest part,

375
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,260
the scariest part is that if you
say what we're saying right now,

376
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,090
like people will light you up because
people are so fucking irrational now.

377
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,870
A license to be outraged against
people with common sense.

378
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,320
That's the current thing.

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,410
It's like just somebody saying
something logical and reasonable.

380
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,080
You can be completely outraged
and be applauded for your
outrage. Right, exactly.

381
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,380
And that's 2018 and it's social
media to a lot of these nut bags.

382
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:16,280
They congregate on Twitter or whatever
and they all group together and gang up

383
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,600
and it's, I, I again, I don't think in
reality it's a huge majority of people,

384
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,530
but it's fucking idiots like this who
put these videos together and then a

385
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:28,910
smaller group of idiots who have nothing
going on in their lives on Facebook can

386
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:33,440
get people think you're outrageous.
If you back talking about process,

387
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,750
somebody got accused of a crime,
uh,

388
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,750
let's wait to see what they have to save
for it. And they're like, no, wait, what?

389
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,510
You don't think that person, you don't
want to hear what they have to say. No,

390
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,560
I know. Because now reality
is whatever you say it is,

391
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,190
there's no such thing as an objective
reality anymore that we all take part in

392
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,230
because everybody's allowed to have
whatever crazy fucking opinion they have.

393
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,190
It's cool, man. Do you
like, listen, it's not okay.

394
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:07,970
There are certain things that are
fucking empirical evidence. It's true.

395
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,590
The earth is round guys. Sorry.
You know science reason, logic.

396
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,130
Now you just invent your reality.
Marijuana is racist. Guys can't say that.

397
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,670
Those pictures from space
or manufacturing, there's
a huge conspiracy going on.

398
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,440
It's between like every scientist.

399
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,780
I think they're controlling that in acids.
Definitely involved.

400
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,090
Astronauts are involved. Yeah.
Satellites are involved. Russians,

401
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:42,710
Putin or all together.

402
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,970
Just to make people think the earth is
round because the benefit of that is

403
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,400
that and then

404
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,890
then you can go for a ride on my boat.

405
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,570
So this is um, different. This
girl is coming out of surgery.

406
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,833
Parents.

407
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,033
Uh,

408
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,720
that's a special talent that you can
stick that all the way to the back of your

409
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,420
neck. Don't act like you
haven't been done before.

410
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,180
Just for people listening
and not watching.

411
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,060
This girl came out of surgery and they
gave her a popsicle and she, she goes,

412
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:46,890
you want to see my special talent?
And then she deep threaded her popsicles.

413
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,900
She said that so sincerely to her mom.
That was fantastic.

414
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:59,300
I love it. Yeah, you
haven't done it. You slash

415
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,250
get all the way to the back of your neck.

416
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,680
Don't act like you
haven't been done before.

417
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,763
She's right.

418
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,210
She's right.
Your mom's definitely done that before,

419
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,690
but maybe you're better at
it. That's true. Yeah. Maybe
her, maybe mom's a little.

420
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,660
Do you think your mom does?
Does it? Oh, no, no, no.

421
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,200
I don't think so. She didn't
know what that was? Yeah.

422
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,850
What do you mean she never knew what that
was like when we talked about blowjob?

423
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,010
Like she was like, what?
We're like oral sex. Ah,

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,760
because the mangoes peeler. A
peeler. Yeah. What does that mean?

425
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,890
Go like pee in your mouth? No, no.

426
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:42,860
Like you're going to put where he
pees out of and your mouth, you know?

427
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,300
That's what she thought. She was like, ah

428
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,240
man. I was like, what about looking
at his anus mom? Oh yeah. All right.

429
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,190
That's so off the table
for her. Oh, you and me.

430
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,940
And we should try to bring that
up when they come out. Yeah.

431
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,540
It'd be like if dad really washed
though, like it's really clean. Never.

432
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,570
It would never happen.
Or would you give his cullo kiss

433
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,400
so she'd be so sad.

434
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,000
That's terrible. But yeah, we should
do that. Encourage that. Terrible.

435
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,390
Yeah. Anyways. Um, you know,
it's really neat in our marriage.

436
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,120
You the other day it's,

437
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,620
it's been so like a week ago
now you came home with a salad.

438
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,250
Yeah.
And you normally don't eat in the bedroom.

439
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:38,590
So I don't know what the box
was doing in our bedroom.

440
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:41,950
You were very good about
eating in the kitchen, but uh,

441
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,120
you finished your salad and it came in a
clear plastic box and then you had like

442
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:51,121
a regular fork and you left the salad
box and the fork next to my sink.

443
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,660
We have a his and hers.

444
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,760
And you chose to place it next to where
I brushed my teeth and do stuff and then

445
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:01,990
I just didn't do anything about it and it
stayed there for like five or six days.

446
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:06,220
Now is that good? It's
great. What's happening?

447
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,480
What happened with the,
tell me,

448
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:09,040
walk me through this because
you've never done that.

449
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,800
Brought the salad at home and I went
up to see you. You were upstairs,

450
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:18,634
you've been resting

451
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,370
and I sat there and I just talked to
you while I ate my salad and when I was

452
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:31,801
done I just put it in the restroom and
then I went to shower and then I noticed

453
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,650
you put it in there. You were
talking to me eating. Oh, okay. Okay.

454
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,230
So sat up on that chair.
Right. The gray chair and I,

455
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,440
then I went to the bathroom
to shower after the workout.

456
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:47,180
I put the box there with the fork and
then kind of forgot it there and then I

457
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:50,170
realized, wow, it's
really like art, you know?

458
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,990
Seeing this beautiful
empty plastic salad box.

459
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,050
Fork. Yeah. Kind of makes you
think, who's been here before? What?

460
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,740
What did they go through?
Right.

461
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,380
What I enjoy too is watching
the leaves turn Brown. Yeah.

462
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,180
Well it was like a live art piece.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

463
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,370
Like all the green lettuce,

464
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,060
slowly Wilton and turn Brown and
then black and then all this. Yeah,

465
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:19,510
the contents inside started to rot.
It was kind of cool. It was very cool.

466
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,650
Very cool. Thanks for putting that
box. Hey, I got to say you're welcome.

467
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,150
You're very welcome.
I enjoyed it quite a bit,

468
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,040
but I finally did take it down.
You disappointed and complained a lot.

469
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,770
You tried to shame me
publicly on Instagram.

470
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,980
You know I did shoot
your typical route cells.

471
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,880
People loved it. They're like, he's
sending you a man message. What's the,

472
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,810
what's the message?
What are we trying to send me?

473
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,660
I don't think there was a message.
It's kind of disrespectful.

474
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:53,320
It's the way if you let the
dogs run through the house
and then they shit in the

475
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:56,880
kid's play room, like to show you
like fuck this kid. But I didn't,

476
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,190
wasn't trying to show you anything.
A sign of disrespect.

477
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,630
It was a sign of laziness

478
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,120
and also a obliviousness cause I honestly
would leave there and not notice it at

479
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:11,140
all. Yeah. I honestly didn't notice it
either for like two days cause I'm really,

480
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,580
I'm really sloppy too. I take
full course so sloppy. Come on.

481
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:19,360
Do you think I'm messier than who's ma?
Who's the messy champ?

482
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,270
Champ. You're gross. You know your grocer?

483
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,040
Yes. Okay. Here's why
your grosser than me.

484
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,260
You leave food, like the salad box
rotting in the blows plastic salad box.

485
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,100
You Shave your beard, your
back, your balls in sink in your

486
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,880
side,

487
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,780
and then you leave the hair there and
then like to clean up the majority of the

488
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:48,950
hair. And then he was for days. No,
no, I don't leave a full shaving.

489
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:52,310
I cleaned that up and there's
hundreds of hairs. Thousands of them.

490
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,720
So little ones are left behind.

491
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,320
They get stuck in the toothpaste cause
you'll spit your toothpaste out. Yeah,

492
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,340
that's part of the artwork too.
Um,

493
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,950
you've hocked a luggy in the
kitchen sink. I remember that. Yeah.

494
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,730
You're pretty good with a shower.

495
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:11,570
Other than like the Hobo showering where
you slow Snot rockets and you pee all

496
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:15,800
over me and stuff like that.
I feel like you're, you're,

497
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm pretty messy though too.
Like I leave supermoon everywhere.

498
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:23,240
I drop things and I'll pick
them up, pick them up, clothing.

499
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,080
I'll just leave everywhere. Care. I
can't bend over right now. So just found,

500
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,990
I know this has nothing to do with
right now. You don't pick up your messy.

501
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,790
Tell him I say yeah,
but who's the messy champ?

502
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,443
Hm.

503
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:41,570
I think you are because in this
completely imbalanced and unfair society,

504
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,740
women are held to a different standard.

505
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,190
So you're messier because you're a woman.

506
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,500
That's true.
Cause I sh I'm supposed to be house proud.

507
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:58,260
I'm supposed to be more kept,
right? Like, like, yeah. Yeah.

508
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,610
Come on now we'll say you
do have impeccable hygiene.

509
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,070
I do like to keep myself
clean. Very clean person. Yeah.

510
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,580
I brushed my teeth way more
than you. I do, I floss more.

511
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,680
I Have Dj, dad mouth. Uh,

512
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,660
by the way, this is not going to have
to also tag it on another announcement.

513
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,570
Um,
but at this might be the week now.

514
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,050
They moved my hot ones and I didn't know.

515
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,470
So I think I've mentioned
in a previous episode now,

516
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:34,520
but now it's coming out July 12th.
This shit,

517
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,540
this might even be out,
uh,

518
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:41,000
after it comes out because where we were
prying to prerecord a bunch before the

519
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:45,380
baby. Yeah. So I don't
know when this obviously,

520
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:50,390
so this is either coming out right
before July 12th or a full week after it,

521
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,540
in which case you can tell just how far
ahead of time we're recording things.

522
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Okay. All right. Um,

523
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,950
I like talking about the diarrhea I
had the other night. If you don't mind,

524
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,130
that'd be really great. I mean, okay.
So I was so hungry. I've been not,

525
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,790
I had steak for dinner,
Brussel sprouts and a potato.

526
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,830
An hour later I was starving.

527
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,070
Are you going to look at me and
pay attention to me to talk?

528
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,240
And then I had a thing of
yogurt, blueberries, Muesli,

529
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,200
and then an hour later I had
toast with peanut butter.

530
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,980
What are you doing? But now I'm
pregnant. I'm starving. And then

531
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,011
point out though,

532
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:34,011
before you get to your messy browns
that for a long time for this pregnancy,

533
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,950
it's the other way you're always
having, you're struggling. Yeah,

534
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,290
it, that's the, that's the fun part.
You, you can't really shit for a lot,

535
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,440
a long time. And then sometimes
just get diarrhea. Anyway,

536
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,180
I started woke up at like three in the
morning and just the fucking flood gates

537
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,820
had open and diarrhea all night.
Don't you hate that?

538
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:55,821
Of course night diarrhea is just worse
because then you can't sleep and then the

539
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,880
next day or like still feel gross.

540
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,540
It was terrible the whole
next day I was like, ah,

541
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,270
I can't even move
because you didn't sleep.

542
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:10,890
You know the worst part about
night diarrhea that takes
you into the next day is

543
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:15,270
that it restricts your coffee. Yeah. Then
I'm fucked up. I can't have my coffee,

544
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,540
I can't have, my body will just
really fucking shut down. If I do,

545
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,300
you can do it,
but it's like smoking with the flu.

546
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,480
It's not a good idea. I used to
do that when I smoked cigarettes.

547
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,980
Stupid.
Where are we?

548
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,060
I would like give myself a day or two
without smoking and then by day three I'm

549
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:44,820
like, it's fine. Now
will go away eventually.

550
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,300
So I had night diarrhea and then the next
day we went to go see Sacara Sacara or

551
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,640
Sicario sicario too,

552
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,280
which was outstanding. I
loved it. It was so good.

553
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,710
It's so good. It's really
good. Um, has a what?

554
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:06,540
Josh Brolin.
Benito El Toro.

555
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,060
Really fucking good movie man. It's kind
of, it's good cause it's a stand alone.

556
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,880
Like you don't have to have seen
the first one. No, not at all.

557
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,870
It is a total stand alone. And then
you're kind of watching the Angela,

558
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,990
I want them to make a third one for
sure. Ghana. They left it open. Yeah.

559
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,630
Josh Brolin. Uh, is that
his name? Yeah. Looks Amaze.

560
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,740
Now Emory Brent wasn't in it,

561
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,170
which I'm really upset about
cause I really dig her.

562
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,090
But Bonito del Toro was, I
love him. You've always loved,

563
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,410
love him. Cause he's like a Puerto Rican,
you know, I love my Puerto Rican. Yeah.

564
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,550
I gotta say that he
looked fucking haggard.

565
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,720
He's a little worn.

566
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,160
I mean he was so bloated and fat
that his eyes looked swollen shut.

567
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,960
I looked like he would drink the night
before and show up on set. I mean,

568
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,110
I believe that he's lived hard.
You know,

569
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,740
I believe that for sure. I
love him. I think he's so key,

570
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,180
so great as an actor
and stuff. But man, he,

571
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,670
and it's such a fucking double standard
because if you look at Emily blunt in

572
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:12,570
the first movie, she weighs 90
pounds. Her skin is flawless.

573
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,230
Yet these leading guys can be total
animals, total fat, fucking pigs.

574
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,970
It's kind of bullshit.
Yeah. He's um, I dunno,

575
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:25,320
I feel like he's just gone hard. Yeah.
He's just, he's lived hard for a minute.

576
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,360
It shows, it definitely shows. Yeah. Um,

577
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,910
I'm trying to figure out the,
uh,

578
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,800
with this new car. Yo, let me see.

579
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,450
Cause he definitely,
we watched the car,

580
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,600
you'll one the other
day and it definitely,

581
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,510
do you think he looked better or worse
in the first movie? He definitely better.

582
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,760
Yeah. Yeah. And then he's been riding it
hard. Yeah. I think he just parties, man.

583
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,800
I think he drinks it looks like a drinker.

584
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,753
Yeah.

585
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,880
What are you doing? What he was trying
to look at a picture of him. I mean he,

586
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,500
his eyes look really bloated.
Like, like, like sodium.

587
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,863
Yeah.

588
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,290
Believable. How, what's happening?

589
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,230
He always had heavy eyes though
when I kind of liked that about him.

590
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,330
He always looks Kinda,
Kinda, um, rough. Right.

591
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,600
Which is this thing about him
right there. Yeah, it looks great.

592
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:24,140
He's a fucking great actor. He's
amazed. He's soaked. So talented. Yeah.

593
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,770
Love Him. He's so fucking fun
to watch, man. He's fantastic.

594
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,130
He was great in the movie, but again,
it just makes you wonder like God,

595
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:36,000
he's fucking serious. Double standards
between men and women in our business.

596
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,970
Like if you look at these fat fucking
animals to work until they're old and,

597
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,940
and just look at fucking Marlon Brando,
that slob.

598
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:47,130
What did he wait?
At least three bills.

599
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,060
He was a disgusting mess and he was
still starring in movies. Marlon Brando,

600
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,920
let's see what, he looked like a
fucking mess by apocalypse now.

601
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:58,590
He had to read everything off of
cue cards. He was so out of it.

602
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,080
Yeah, he was at the end there. Yeah.

603
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,130
I mean they still let him work.
Look at him. Look at him. Oof. Yeah.

604
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,980
Yeah. He's real big there. I mean, yeah.

605
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,580
I like to see a female actress that looks
at Shitty. It's still working. No Way.

606
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,020
Oh my God. He looks like shit on a step
and look at him in his youth though.

607
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,000
Hot Tamale. He definitely,
Oh, who's that fight?

608
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,860
Some mother fucker. No, that's him in his
heyday right there. Yeah. Looking good.

609
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,900
Yeah, but he got, he got
enormous. There's Jack. Oh yeah.

610
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:43,340
Nicholson doesn't look too good, but
he's not working. He's retired basically.

611
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,340
Yeah, he's retired. Brando. God,

612
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,970
he's definitely,

613
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,440
and even my beloved James Gandolfini.
I love Soprano's.

614
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:58,430
I think I they James got off and he
was such an amazing actor, but fuck,

615
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:01,730
he looked like hell to, or you were
watching that movie the other day? Yeah,

616
00:41:01,731 --> 00:41:05,420
with he and Julia Louise Dreyfus,
I think it was called enough sad.

617
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,250
It's a cute little movie on iTunes.

618
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,270
It's a little romance and you're looking
at them side by side and you're like,

619
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:15,980
I think that is similar age and she's
just rail thin trying to fucking hold it

620
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:19,910
together. And he, he is so
fucking fat in that movie.

621
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,130
Just so fast like this. So it's just the
one that he died right after that. Yeah,

622
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:29,120
I think he did and he was really big.
And now it's such a bummer.

623
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,160
Yeah. Yeah. I know. It's
really, it's fucking,

624
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,930
um,
it was pretty crazy.

625
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,890
French champagne and then our
favorite and Orson Welles.

626
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,393
He was real

627
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,400
beg at the end. Really fucked up. Yeah.

628
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,753
I was googling

629
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,760
and I found this great
list on rank or dot. Look,

630
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,300
by the way,
he looks like shit.

631
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,260
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Like this whale. Fuck.

632
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,500
And they let them work. These assholes
work until they dropped dead. Like really?

633
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,780
Yeah. No, that's true. Really.

634
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,270
Yeah. So here's your
a, I pulled it up also.

635
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,370
Yeah. Read the, read the title of
list, which is my favorite thing ever.

636
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,630
It's called the most
successful obese Americans.

637
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,700
Really Nice list to be a part of.
Could you imagine? It'd be really

638
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,950
your PR guys like, Hey, you made this
list on the first sentence it says,

639
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:34,280
the most successful obese Americans
include men and women who,

640
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,600
despite being overweight,

641
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:39,320
have found mainstream
such a shit list to be.

642
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:42,140
Everyone wants to be on lists and then
you get this, you're like, what the fuck?

643
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,360
Why are some successful
fat people who are sorry?

644
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:52,070
Who are some successes for some being
obese has caused the public to question if

645
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:54,200
they were fit for their
individual professions.

646
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,160
Athletes like John Daly and
bay route, Blah Blah, blah.

647
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,920
Obviously pundits of trash in New York,
New Jersey,

648
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,160
Governor Chris Christie for his weight.
Um,

649
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,990
sadly for a few of
these obese celebrities,

650
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,500
they're overindulgence and
created contributed to their
death. Well that's, yeah,

651
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:10,090
of course.

652
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,060
Hey, by the way, I'm not
shitting on people for being fat.

653
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,920
I'm just saying like if you're a lead
actor and film and you're supposed to be a

654
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:22,921
sex symbol and you're not a character
actor and the fucking ridiculousness of

655
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:24,190
this double standard.

656
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:29,191
Like Marlon Brando got to look like that
and when all and work and [inaudible]

657
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,080
kinda barely hanging in there.

658
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,380
Geez, come on. He doesn't
look clean and look good.

659
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,570
He doesn't like Dunlin good look like,

660
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,020
like a Orson Welles or Marlon Brando.

661
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,240
You say he's on his way. He's another
few. Another sicario three. Yeah.

662
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:48,780
We'll see what it looks like by the third
is stolen. Oh my God. This list though,

663
00:43:48,781 --> 00:43:50,190
I mean right off the bat,
I'll tell you.

664
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:54,050
I know they have Steven bomber
as number one. Who's this guy?

665
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,470
So he used to be fat. No, I
know. I'm saying I've seen
him in person. He's whatever,

666
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:00,480
like 20 pounds overweight.
He's big deal.

667
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,260
He was the CEO of Microsoft
after Bill Gates. Okay. Um,

668
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:10,110
and that he owns the clippers now. It's
crazy to put him on know, be successful.

669
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,330
He's not, he's totally normal.
Dick Cheney Cheney. I mean, again,

670
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:16,830
he's probably,
he's overweight,

671
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,350
but to be like you did it
despite how enormous you are.

672
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,680
He's like old guy fat and he's
nice. He's a normal guy. Fat. Uh,

673
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,540
Kevin James, James, Super Fat,
Super Fat. Come on, do Kevin James.

674
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:33,870
Super, super fat dude.
Watch king of Queens.

675
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,660
Maybe not in this photo.
Watch king of Queens next to Leah Remini.

676
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:41,370
He looks like a fucking porpoise. I mean
the guy is, how fast do you think he's,

677
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:45,540
not that you're saying super fed thinking
were saying, look, I'm telling you,

678
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:48,720
watch old king of Queens when
he's wearing like as ups alpha.

679
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,430
What about right now? I
don't know. Right now.

680
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:54,060
I think he slimmed down since that I'm
talking like I would say when King of

681
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:58,980
crunk Queens was at its height,
he was a real whale. I mean,

682
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,710
and he was wearing that outfit
and his legs are Chunky.

683
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:08,040
We Kevin Smith fucking slimmed down.
He looks crazy to call him.

684
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,540
Super Fly was no they got,
yeah.

685
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,070
When he was doing king and gains.
I'm saying you,

686
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,310
the term you're using is not correct.
Well what super was super fabulous.

687
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,260
Super Fat because, but I'm saying he
can't throw him in that cat also. Okay.

688
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,690
All right. So our scale is a little
different. I see what you're saying. Yeah.

689
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,600
You're describing the way you're
talking about is someone like, dude,

690
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:31,350
that's super fast. So Ralphie super
fat is what you're saying. Okay.

691
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:35,630
How would you describe them?
Do you not think Ralphie? Okay,

692
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,800
we need to create a scale here
cause you never want to say scale

693
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,510
super fat is Ralphie and
then one step under his Bert,

694
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,180
is that what you're thinking?
Bert Burton.

695
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,440
Ralphie are kind of neck and neck close.
Okay.

696
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,810
Trying to find oh good on that one. And
they look Super Bay there. They will may,

697
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:01,150
maybe we have different
standards for what super fat is.

698
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,440
It's not like this is a specialist just
came out. No, that's different. That's,

699
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:08,190
that's because he lost weight
motherfucker. I'm trying
to say this is right now.

700
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,110
Right now. Right now. Right
now. Right now. 30 pounds
overweight. Now he looks great.

701
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,600
He looks great. But I'm saying it the
height of the king of Queens. I know,

702
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:22,020
but that's still like,
but it's not face.

703
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,840
It's not fucking,
you cannot say that.

704
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:29,680
This is anything like Ralphie fat.
No fat. No, of course not. No,

705
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,990
I agree with you. No, I agree with
you. I mean, looking at their Alexa,

706
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:37,230
Leah remeny is that layer. She's
cute. They're cute together.

707
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,470
I love Kevin James by the way. I
think he's super cute. I liked him.

708
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:44,280
Have these super cute and super fast.
I like Pesky.

709
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,820
I like huskier guy,
the fat pack.

710
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,790
And that's his brother who's
hilarious too. Yeah. Yeah.

711
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,140
And he said funny. Anyways,
he lost a bunch of weight.

712
00:46:58,141 --> 00:47:01,710
But you watched those king of
Queens. I know. Oof. All right.

713
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:06,240
I mean I watch, yeah,
you got to kind of thick.

714
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,040
But the camera also ads. Of course.
I still think he's that bad.

715
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:15,600
It's good now. He does now I, yeah. Okay.

716
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,740
Kathy Bates, there you go. There's a
lady or lady finally and she's great,

717
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,180
but she's always been the
acceptable, unattractive. Why

718
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,490
she acts so town. She's guy
talented. So we get her a pass

719
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,330
is what Hollywood is thinking.
Yeah. If you're really good,

720
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:36,450
they don't care what you think.
Your guy be exception. Yeah.

721
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,400
Ah Shit. I read that. I read
the frank where like how they,

722
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,190
they use actually the respectful photo.

723
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,170
They used a 60 year old photo.
Cute.

724
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,980
She's big as fuck shit.

725
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:57,981
You do yourself a favor and Google Aretha
Franklin tits right now and there's,

726
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:02,670
I mean those milkers are just
junk.

727
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,230
I'm in lost a bunch of weight now.
This is actually a,

728
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:10,180
a post weight loss photo now. He
was pretty fat. He was huge. Huge.

729
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:15,280
So that I would say make sense.
Not Super Fat, no fat burn fat,

730
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,353
but fat.

731
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,290
He think he was fatter than Bert at
its fattest or Burt's fatter than John

732
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,530
Goodman and Burt's
always been fatter than,

733
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:26,531
than then John Goodman and Kevin James
was not as fat as John as fattest.

734
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,120
Good point. Okay. And by
the way, uh, oof. Rosie,

735
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,030
Rosie O'donnell, she's
always been just big. Yeah.

736
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,630
But I feel like she carries it.
I don't think she would look normal brain.

737
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,650
Who fucks this guy? Harold Hamm. Hmm.

738
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,910
American entrepreneur.
Entrepreneur. Yeah. Gas Business.

739
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,110
Pioneering in the development
of the large, I can't read
it. State of resources.

740
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,280
I don't know. I guess I'm on, he's worth
the nine point $3 billion. Dang homie.

741
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,360
Which decreased from 18 point
$7 billion so much. My God.

742
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,080
Uh, Charles Barkley. I mean,

743
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:08,710
it's always been a thing for child like
the Charles Barkley is that he's been

744
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,510
overweight,
but again,

745
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:15,220
he's like fat for a ridiculously
talented pro athlete.

746
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,290
He's not like, you know, well,

747
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:21,640
don't you think pro athletes get a pass
because they've been in such incredible

748
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:24,190
shape for the majority of their law.
He was always Chunky,

749
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,910
even though even as an active
player and he was, you know,

750
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,420
it was thought of like the critique was
that it was a basically a little bit of

751
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:36,040
a, a lack of discipline. Oh,
you know, that he was just
like indulging, he was like,

752
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,910
I still fucked people up, so who gives
a shit? Um, and then he definitely,

753
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,660
he ballooned at one point.
Like he really ballooned after retiring,

754
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,930
which is also kind of normal
because you're not exactly sure. Um,

755
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,920
so he's always had like a little
bit of a weight thing, but I mean,

756
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,460
I could see why people would call him
fat, but again, successful, obese,

757
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,780
successful in such a
ridiculous Kirstie Alley.

758
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,550
She's always fluctuated as lecturer.
Oprah.

759
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,940
I mean technically maybe,
but she's always, you know,

760
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:09,730
weight's always been this thing
with her too, up and down.

761
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,010
I wouldn't say obese Al Roker and
he was super fat at one point.

762
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:19,750
He was fat. He did the, he did. He's
got duct that weird neck and head now.

763
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,600
Yeah. When they get super skinny, like
200 pounds or something, you know,

764
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:29,300
it's harsh. Yeah.
Roseanne. She got skinny.

765
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,810
Does she do bypass? I don't know, but
she lost a bunch of what it did. Yeah.

766
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:39,080
Yeah. He's staring Christy super. I think
he had botched surgery. Is that right?

767
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:42,980
I think so. Damn. So did that one. Um,

768
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,200
there's a football coach that had
botched, botched a bypass. You can die,

769
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:53,150
you know during that. Yeah. That's pretty
risky. Ruben's stuttered, so we're fault.

770
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,460
Who's this guy? I Kabaka Botarro. You
don't know who that is? Big Sumo Guy.

771
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:06,410
He's fat and he's always been
fine. Michael Moore. Michael
Moore? I don't think so.

772
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,570
Did he?
I think he got skinny,

773
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,430
so really I follow him on Instagram.
Let's see.

774
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,910
Okay.

775
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:20,770
Michael Moore, I think he was going
through a skinny phase or something.

776
00:51:20,771 --> 00:51:21,604
He tried.

777
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,360
Did we lose weight?

778
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,640
I don't know how he did.
I thought he went through a skinny face.

779
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:35,520
I want to say it looks
like he's transitioning.

780
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,830
I see him on our TLC show
this week, man. Coming.

781
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:45,280
A woman is going on.
Yeah, they get softer.

782
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,430
They get 2000 chalky.
All

783
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,470
rush.
Limbaugh's definitely fat.

784
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,080
I feel like I could definitely
make it to this list,

785
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,430
but I did a few more specials.
Al Gore.

786
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,370
He can't be on, he's not obese. No,
that guy looks super fat. John Daly.

787
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,610
Drew Carey lost it all. He did.
This is a silly list at this point.

788
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:14,130
We're just getting out there. This is
bullshit. Sumo wrestlers. Carnie Wilson,

789
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,630
remember she was one of the fat Wilson
Phillips. Who's this fucking guy?

790
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,820
Yeah. Okay. This list is
absurd at this point. Yeah,

791
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,280
but I'm with you that in
the movie business where
this is the moneymaker guys,

792
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:31,380
get a lot of guys get a pass.
Well then again,

793
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,290
you look at some dudes like
your friend Mark Wahlberg,

794
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:39,120
who's a lead actor and he
stars and everything and he
looks at amazing crazy and

795
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:41,430
you're like,
that sets a fucking movie star Dude.

796
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,850
Well that's the standard standard you
should said is if you're like you're the

797
00:52:44,851 --> 00:52:47,790
lead of the movie. Yeah, look
good. You got to look good.

798
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,270
And who are like the people like
him, the Rock, Ryan Gosling,

799
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:54,210
he looks at maze and even in comedy,
you know,

800
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:55,740
you look at starring
in movies all the time.

801
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:00,600
Kevin Hart is like in crazy good shape.
That's so true. What about that dude?

802
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,620
What am I fucking thinking?
I'm cruise is still in crazy good shape.

803
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:09,330
Cruise looks amazing for his age. Fifties
or something to that guy. Never ages.

804
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,670
Yup. Um, oh Bradley Cooper. Yeah.

805
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,390
That guy is in fantastic shape.
He just looks comedic actor.

806
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:22,080
He doesn't look like Bradley Cooper.
He does a hangover and all that stuff,

807
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,740
but he's just like a
movie star. Yeah. He um,

808
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,490
he just looked like normal.
Good.

809
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,930
Like he doesn't look like
Mark Walberg shape. Right.

810
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,330
He just looks to fit and health.
It is Mark Walberg Jesus Christ.

811
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,540
But he's just like, like he's not
eyes, obviously not overweight.

812
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,450
He doesn't look like he's crazy yoked.
He just looks healthy. It looks good.

813
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,370
He looks like the hot dad at preschool.
Yeah.

814
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,750
When driver kid off
and you're like the day

815
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,110
everybody's like, day. I would by
the way, 100% beyond that list.

816
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,830
Now that I think about it, if,
if I was more successful them,

817
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,500
if I was more successful, they
would definitely be like, ah,

818
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,140
there's a fat Netflix guy
who despite his weight,

819
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,760
I'm sure despite his morbid obesity,
Thompson Sigora prevails. Yeah,

820
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:13,710
that's really crazy. I
think I would be to, uh, um,

821
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,720
hey, mommy's really nice. Thank you.

822
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,520
So I hope all as well listening to the
podcast about the guy's friend using

823
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,950
subtitles preemptively
laughing at the jokes.

824
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,330
I do agree for the most part that it's
a bad move to have those on if you don't

825
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,470
have any hearing problems.

826
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,820
I however do agree with
keeping subtitles on. Oh,

827
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,980
I keep them on because I can't hear
it from one of my ear pussy and other

828
00:54:37,981 --> 00:54:41,080
airports. He hears just fine.
It's just what he wrote.

829
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,140
But it's also because sometimes it's
easier to comprehend with a comedian is

830
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,240
saying when you read the text
in case you miss something.

831
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,940
I don't always look at the
texts when watching standup.

832
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:56,020
It's also a case of add or I won't have
patients to hear what the comedian will

833
00:54:56,021 --> 00:54:59,860
say. So I'll read the text on the
screen, wait for the delivery,

834
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:02,500
and then I will laugh.
It's Kinda like what I was my theory,

835
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,210
which was having anxiety about the
moment of wait. Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.

836
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,390
It all comes down to a
matter of preference. Anyway,

837
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,300
that's my answer to the question
about having subtitles on love.

838
00:55:13,301 --> 00:55:17,980
You Keith Jeans High and tight of
the baby comes out of maize. Chris,

839
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:22,610
thanks Chris. Um, whatever your
ear, Pussy your pussy. So Steve,

840
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:25,890
I feel like that's something
that was said. Your Pussy. Yeah,

841
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,220
I feel like it was said
dog con. Yeah, I dunno.

842
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,070
I definitely feel like,
um, that was mentioned. Um,

843
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,860
yeah, so subtitles, let's see.
There's more subtitles here.

844
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,920
Um,
what this person says.

845
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,911
I mean,
look,

846
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:47,911
I'm watching a Danish show right now on
Netflix called Rita and I fucking hate

847
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:52,870
it because you just know you're
missing out so much on, on, you know,

848
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:55,180
you don't speak the language visitor.
I know it's a different thing,

849
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:59,560
but reading dialogue is significantly
different than just being able to hear,

850
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,790
oh yeah,
I hate it.

851
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:05,640
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Um, so there's,

852
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,330
there's more here for this.
Um,

853
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,810
somebody wrote in for the youtube
subtitles. We didn't realize this.

854
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:16,740
This will either help the subtitles are
for lunatics argument or the home here.

855
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:19,260
Now confusion. Here's an email. Uh,

856
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:20,910
I don't think I didn't
think about it until today,

857
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:23,560
but I put subtitles on your
recent Youtube podcast.

858
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,300
I think we have the answer for our
perverted piss on me. Beat me champ. No,

859
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,910
she doesn't translate perfectly,
but you'll see,

860
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,050
I guess there's subtitles provided on
youtube videos like this fucking shit. Uh,

861
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:39,370
but it says home here. Home.
Yeah. Question here. Now.

862
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:43,690
Attached to a screenshot. Um, anyway,

863
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:48,280
love the show. I also enjoy shouting
for stroke gang at mini golf. Steph.

864
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,440
So look at this right here.
This is the subtitles.

865
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:58,690
Look how happy Natasha looks to be. Fuck
me. Piss. Somebody beat me at home. Yeah.

866
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:02,860
Now, yeah, at home.

867
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,250
I'm home here now to further the point
that what is being said is clearly,

868
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:17,860
clearly home here now at home.
Now it says at home,

869
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:21,280
Ya know, we got this email. Hey,
hey there. Todd and Christine.

870
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:27,160
Initially, I didn't think why IMH
mustached Casanova was saying,

871
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:30,160
I'm home here now.
I thought he was saying how a man out,

872
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,390
as many listeners have
sworn that he is saying,

873
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,800
but I still wasn't totally convinced
and realizing that the problem with the

874
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:41,410
audio is that it is too
open to interpretation.

875
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,160
I instead played the video and
carefully watched his disgusting mouth.

876
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,580
Then multiple times at half speed there
you can clearly see his mouth open for

877
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:52,264
the first word.

878
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,440
His lips come together and then open
again before saying the second word.

879
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,500
This is solid evidence that his first
word is I'm now for the second word.

880
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,480
You'll notice that his mouth forms
a circle, which we already knew.

881
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,440
Then his lips immediately come out
together again, just as they did before.

882
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,600
Clear evidence. The second word
is home. Wow. For the third word,

883
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:16,450
the important thing to take into
account his, his east coast accent.

884
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,200
There's no hard are instead is
replaced with an a or your sound.

885
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,110
So here becomes here or here.
Right?

886
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,370
Because of his intoxication from being
on whatever's on and also because of his,

887
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:32,230
a sheer, an immense excitement at all. The
homeless convict caught coming his way,

888
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:33,760
his words slurred together.

889
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So home here becomes home with a
soft why sound homea like home?

890
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:42,800
Yeah, home. Yeah. Now
the last word is of no,

891
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:46,660
but debate and is obviously by all
accounts now there you have it.

892
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,400
This lyrical gangster, this poet, this
man of intrigue and mystery is saying,

893
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,170
I'm home here now I'm home. You
know like that. Yours in jeans,

894
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:56,981
Graham,

895
00:58:56,981 --> 00:59:01,840
here is a video of it
being played in slow Mo.

896
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,653
Oh Shit.

897
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:21,120
Yeah, my homie are now.
Wow. That was indisputable.

898
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,620
I mean, I don't know what some
of these people are hearing,

899
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,180
but he's definitely,

900
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,730
I'm home here now, mom. Yeah.

901
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:39,740
Now it also speaks to the whole
message of come over and over.

902
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,860
I'm here. Try this out, do
whatever you want to me.

903
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:47,660
I'm hoping I gave you my address. 2195
that's right. I'm a home here now.

904
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,260
Contextual evidence supports
this and also the accent,

905
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:55,340
which is really interesting that this
person points out I'm home. He on now. He,

906
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,550
he won't say his r's hard.
Very interesting.

907
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,170
It's very interesting when a
compelling, compelling, yeah.

908
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:06,830
This presale went nuts
here for the new one. I,

909
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,090
this is absolutely one of my top favorite.

910
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:15,950
Your mom's house shirts. I just, I love
everything about this design. I love it.

911
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,270
I just love this. I, God bless
whoever drew this one sketch,

912
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,950
Chris drew this what?
All the different,

913
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,610
all the different possibilities
of what he's saying.

914
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:32,930
Although I've obviously on team home
here now there's homie out homie on out.

915
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:37,220
Hold me down. How a man out home right
now hold me out. Hold a man down,

916
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,870
own me in and out.
Hollow me out.

917
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,140
Everything that people think
they're hearing is on that shirt.

918
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,600
It's really great and the
drawing is just spectacular.

919
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,400
Go to merge method.com/tom to grow or
you go to [inaudible] dot com just click

920
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:53,720
on the store. It looks terrible
too, and that drives wrong. Yeah.

921
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:58,090
There's never a point where he looks good,
which is wonderful. It's just so fun.

922
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:02,120
Would not be the star of a movie.
Maybe he would actually. Oh right.

923
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,490
Benito del Toro's looking a little home,
man. I'm here right now. The rough.

924
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,470
I've been an issue and I'm like, good. Um,

925
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,890
somebody wants to know some
advice on a knife sharpening.

926
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,510
Rah Rah Rah. It sounds like your domain,
bro. I know. Let's see what he has to say.

927
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:20,990
Hey Jean, this is Kevin from
Montauk. Todd and Christine.

928
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,240
As someone who was not circumstances,
I have quite a sensitive helmet,

929
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,630
so I've been trying to
desensitize my glands penis.

930
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,610
Despite my commitment, however,
the review, the results
have yet to materialize.

931
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:39,410
I've been rubbing and rubbing and
rubbing 50 times left right forward,

932
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:43,790
back and down everyday sharpening the
knife, but the results are very slow.

933
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,770
If anything,
it's way worser than before.

934
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,740
I'm still reaching totality
and only four stroke.

935
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,770
Although my brother suggested
I try to lay off the meth.

936
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,570
Since I have no neuropathy, I'm starting
to consider alternatives at this stage,

937
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:58,910
such as sandpaper,
wishful thinking,

938
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,630
changing my pronoun controlled
chemical burns or becoming a hermit,

939
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,830
not which route to take. Hoping
you can offer insight. Anyway,

940
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,600
I just felt I needed to share.

941
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:11,600
Maybe this information can help
other dog cons with similar issues.

942
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,620
Keep up the good work and fuck
me in my ass, man. Kevin. Wow.

943
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,520
That's a real nice message. Cousin.
Wonderful letter. Yeah. That's a

944
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,530
really good way of putting things,
um, known rapid the issues. Yeah.

945
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,940
So I dunno. Um, how do you,

946
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,950
how do you desensitize the glans penis?
I was asking,

947
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:38,980
it seems like he's already, he's doing
what, what the great doctor advised.

948
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:43,960
Right. Which is you, you
have to work, you know,

949
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,850
you have to rub, rub, rub all the time.

950
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,710
Me saying he's doing that,
it's making it even more sense.

951
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,210
I don't understand that. I mean in my
experience, obviously you're usually more,

952
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:55,440
you know,

953
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,440
trigger happy if you haven't had
those soft touches in a while,

954
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:07,350
you know, it makes sense because
you're not yeah. Sensitive. Right.

955
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,870
But then the more you do it more,
yeah.

956
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,000
You are more sensitive. Right. Cause you
haven't touched it though. Right. Right.

957
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:18,470
But maybe it's also you need,
you need a lady friend or a guy friend,

958
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:23,330
I don't know what you're into and
um, someone to, to work with on it.

959
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:24,164
You know,

960
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,800
I think alone it's different because you
can be in control of yourself alone and

961
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,990
then you're with somebody else.

962
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:34,080
Oh, you bus real quick. So he needs
someone else to help him rub, rub, rub.

963
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,060
So, and then make it not such
a shock, you know, not such a,

964
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,950
a surprise to your
system. Like, oh my God,

965
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:45,300
there's somebody else
touching it right now.

966
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,650
Oh, right, sure. I, you
know, hey, this is your,

967
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:53,860
I had a friend in college who told me
that he was so excited that he was with

968
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:57,640
this girl and they went back to his
place and she just touched his leg and he

969
01:03:57,641 --> 01:03:58,220
came and

970
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,640
oh no. He was like, ah,

971
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,560
I know. I was like, no,

972
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:09,570
cause I've had a definitely
had like fucking eight seconds,

973
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,310
you know, where you're
like, here we go. Ah.

974
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,460
But I never had someone
touch my leg and it happened.

975
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:19,790
No. That's the sad part about being a
guy that's gotta be really tough. Yeah.

976
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,780
Because once you blow your, your stuff,
then you got to wait to regroup. Yeah.

977
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,020
You know? Yeah. It's trying to build up
your supply. That's the thing though.

978
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:29,700
I remember talking to,
I talk to you about this one.

979
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,950
I talked to Rocco about it that
time when he came to the show. Yeah.

980
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:37,230
What did he say? He said, uh, he's
like, you just need to work a lot.

981
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:41,640
He talks about like professional,
he's talking about the shooting films.

982
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,320
I was like,
well how do you control your,

983
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:48,010
uh, you know your your shot? And he's
like, oh, he's nothing. And I go,

984
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,190
yeah, but how, how does somebody
start? He goes, you work 30 days,

985
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,770
you'll have complete control.
So he was saying like, well,

986
01:04:53,771 --> 01:04:57,280
I thought it made sense too because
if you're talking about, you know,

987
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,750
let's say I don't have sex for two
weeks, right. And then, you know,

988
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:04,780
I've been traveling, I come home. Yeah,
that's not going to be a long one.

989
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,720
But then if you have sex
four times that week,

990
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,310
by the fourth time you don't fit. You're
not that sensitive. It makes sense.

991
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,580
It does make sense. But this guy's
writing, he's, he's doing his,

992
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,100
his training and he said
it's still not working,

993
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,160
cause I don't know how to advise them.
But here's what I'm thinking.

994
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,400
Is He training rob rob to the point
of big docking or he's just rub,

995
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:31,580
rub rubbing without any,
any, uh, circumstances? Well,

996
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,380
master circumstances, um, you know,

997
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,180
lesson is that you're
supposed to 50, 50, 50,

998
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:42,790
50,
50 with not without [inaudible].

999
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:47,110
That's where I think the logic might be
flawed with the rubber up guy is that

1000
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,840
maybe if he big ox so much,

1001
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:54,010
maybe that'll help build his
tolerance built the uh, you know,

1002
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:57,310
cause if you're constantly Bogar king,
doesn't that help?

1003
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,320
Like what were you doing was
saying? Yeah, but you don't want to,

1004
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:03,940
but God all the time you want to,
what you need to do is rub.

1005
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,080
And then if you feel it happening before
you want to, you pull back. I don't know.

1006
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:12,190
Listen, this is who you're learning this.
No, you pull back. You don't go like, oh,

1007
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:16,280
it's stroked number 15. And you feel
it go, you pull, you stop. Right.

1008
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,680
So that you learn to have more control
over it. It's gotta be rough though.

1009
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:25,120
This guy's checking it off a
lot. Yeah, it's neat topic.

1010
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,490
Hope you learn to come when
you want to come serve.

1011
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,850
God's not watching you though. Yeah.
Showing what's on your fucking phone.

1012
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,160
Go to hell in a minute.
You think this is funny or no?

1013
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,870
Nope.
Already now

1014
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:47,290
a man on a swing.
He's standing growl.

1015
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:51,480
I don't like it already. Pretty
cool. Look at that. He's doing

1016
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,300
whoa.
Huge swing.

1017
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,633
Yeah.

1018
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,840
Is that my tribe? It sounds similar.
It does sound kind of similar. Right?

1019
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,770
So he went
here.

1020
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,750
Okay.

1021
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:15,260
Yeah. I don't this one. This
is why he's going to fly.

1022
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:21,050
Fuck. And then he just
went head first into that.

1023
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:25,970
Good Dude. I think he's all right
though. I think he's all right.

1024
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,940
That was a big flip though.
It's a lot of them

1025
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:38,190
funny or no? Nope. Don't think so. No,

1026
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,610
I don't like people getting hurt jeans,
but I mean he's not hurt.

1027
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:44,550
How do you know that?
Is there a followup video?

1028
01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:48,000
It shows him walking around and talking.
Yeah. Oh, where is it? Let's see.

1029
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,413
They

1030
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:00,710
try and get this message
back from this person,

1031
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:06,950
that person. Well, we talked
a little bit a week or so ago.

1032
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:09,710
A couple of weeks ago about certain guy,

1033
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:13,460
we found his video and then he saw
that we played as video and now he has

1034
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:17,580
something to say then
in long neck, gay, um,

1035
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:22,770
under this much snap bronchus that
Tom just mean like a few days ago.

1036
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,720
And I'm calling in La fucking
in there thought, well,

1037
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:32,090
she's shit about me.
I don't get called out.

1038
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:35,030
I made fun of him saying out of your mind,
first of all,

1039
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:37,520
this is the respectful
thing. Oh, is it? Well, yeah,

1040
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:42,230
he's not going to call it rose to men.
He's really scared.

1041
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:45,950
That's the more fucking
names. Oh Shit. See,

1042
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,140
I mean daddy around day.
Yeah.

1043
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,990
You know this better my neck like that.

1044
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,610
You put some respect on my neck piece.

1045
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:04,160
So daddy wrong neck because of
shit. The side, he starts with Shit.

1046
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,990
So I hit him up yesterday.
Yeah.

1047
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,330
And um,

1048
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:12,700
we had some conversation
going on Instagram and I said,

1049
01:09:12,701 --> 01:09:14,530
you know,
I don't think I could handle these things.

1050
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:17,470
You got to find an appropriate opponent.
You know,

1051
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:23,080
I don't really think I'm the guy
to, uh, to fight him, you know?

1052
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,730
I just don't think that would be,

1053
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,030
well, you're a little
older. Yeah, I'm okay.

1054
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,560
Geographically maybe wouldn't work out.
Yeah. This kid's not in California.

1055
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,050
He's in Flint, Michigan. How? Okay.

1056
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,730
Anyways, he's on Instagram
and he posted, I,

1057
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,060
I immediately thought when he was
challenging me to a find it go,

1058
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:49,010
don't think it's an appropriate fight.
What about him and crazy look so and so.

1059
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,570
I,
I suggested that and he's like,

1060
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:55,670
I got to check him out. He's
like, I'm gonna check them out.

1061
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,880
And then he put this on
Instagram goes cigarette Tom,

1062
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:02,150
I'm going to kick crazy lokes ass.
Oh Shit.

1063
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:06,320
I got hands faster than Mike Tyson
share this to let crazy looks. No,

1064
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:07,580
I'm not fucking around.

1065
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:12,410
I also want to join your podcast on a
call so I can say a little something to

1066
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,350
him. Okay. And then is
it Hashtag [inaudible]

1067
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,840
I'm not knocking around
and he made this thing,

1068
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:20,363
uh,

1069
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:25,210
damn long net versus crazy. Lokes
he's really, he's ready for it.

1070
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,630
Well that would be quite an interesting
match between those two. Absolutely. Yeah.

1071
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:35,790
So his name is Davy gravy. That's what
it says. Is that his Instagram name?

1072
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:40,890
No, Instagram. He's damn long
neck. Damn. Damn long neck. Yeah.

1073
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,270
Okay. So I hit him up. I was
like, dude, call in, you know,
but I haven't heard back.

1074
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:50,300
Maybe next episode we'll have an exclusive
with damn long neck and crazy looks.

1075
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:53,640
Maybe there will be some
kind of confrontation plant.

1076
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:57,980
I really hope we can get crazy
looks and long neck to get it down.

1077
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:02,940
We've really silly a crazy lopes.
If you're out there, you know,

1078
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:05,280
it would be great to have you to

1079
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,570
send a message to long neck about
fighting. I mean, here's the thing.

1080
01:11:09,571 --> 01:11:13,860
I Dunno if long neck knows that crazy.
Lokes is in the gym all the time. Oh,

1081
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:18,660
Robin training. Yeah. And he's training
a lot. I see them and we sparring,

1082
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,860
hitting the bag.
I mean,

1083
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,930
so I saw long next hand speed
and that's no joke. But no.

1084
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,200
But as far as fight experience,
I don't know.

1085
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:32,730
I mean crazy looks is always at the gym.
While it looks like a long neck here.

1086
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:37,050
Trains bare knuckled. That's
true. Totally different fights,

1087
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:40,770
street,
totally different style of fighting.

1088
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:44,970
It looks like we got to see what's going
on with these two. So, uh, I'm a big,

1089
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,350
big fan of both guys. I can't believe
you're resurrecting crazy low. I know.

1090
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:54,150
Well I never thought I never saw
it that that would happen. We,

1091
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,510
we want crazy legs back.
Put some respect on my name.

1092
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,790
He said put some respect on my neck.
He did really cool. Really funny.

1093
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,600
Oh Man.
Well let's see what happens

1094
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,430
with some respect on my name.
Yeah.

1095
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:17,060
And he said he called our
podcast a broadcast broadcast.

1096
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:21,540
So now we have a podcast and a broadcast.
Close enough.

1097
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,540
Close enough.
That's really good.

1098
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:29,570
So very excited at the potential
of a live fight between these two.

1099
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,490
I'm excited to hear back from crazy lokes.
It's been a long time.

1100
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,260
I want to see if he's still
rapping and training like that.

1101
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,610
He's not doing all those things,
doing his thing, stuff like that,

1102
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,760
stuff like that.
This was going to blow your mind.

1103
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,080
Look who is here again doing this thing.

1104
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,680
Okay.
Not Crazy legs.

1105
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,270
You noticed it.
You noticed that your name's Keegan

1106
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:20,550
sticking into sticking in a sticky note.
Sticky in stay United State.

1107
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:25,120
You noticed that United States United
sticking in that he's back. I love this.

1108
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:28,060
Where is he? He's a, he's an a.
Looks like it's that Coachella.

1109
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:33,720
He says
he's indoors this time.

1110
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:39,430
Last teeth is what it seems like.
Yeah, he's got less. He's got one, two,

1111
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:42,760
three right now. He's not
in the sun, which is great.

1112
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,600
He needs to be out of the sun. Yeah,
glad he took shade. He took shelter,

1113
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:01,110
man. Close enough. I like it. A
whole new outfit. Whole new look.

1114
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,190
Really exciting.

1115
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:06,770
I didn't know he had another part
to this on has just come God,

1116
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,020
it's a little sun damage. Don't waste. It

1117
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:15,130
has to stand there and then you can go and

1118
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:17,723
stay there.

1119
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:22,720
I love it.
I love,

1120
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,670
this is so exciting.

1121
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,750
The file says Christina's
dad is the new hot sensation.

1122
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:34,010
He's touring all over the world now.

1123
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:38,230
That's your dad. Is that where you ended
up? I did here. He moved to the desert,

1124
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:43,600
got married to some Vietnamese lady,
and now they're in the desert.

1125
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:47,950
It could be my dad. I don't
know. I haven't seen him in
awhile. It's been awhile.

1126
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:51,860
I know. Who knows. They

1127
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,670
stay
United States United.

1128
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:06,540
Such good work talent.

1129
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,520
You know what I got?
I bring it up. I just,

1130
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,030
I want everybody to know I'm
super proud of you, Tom. Yeah. Uh,

1131
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:20,540
you reached gold medallion
status it Starbucks. Yeah.

1132
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,020
Medallian what are you now?

1133
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,310
I Dunno. I was forever. I was wanting,
I'm, you know, like an old person.

1134
01:15:26,311 --> 01:15:31,311
So I'm resistant to certain changes and
everybody jumping on the thing and I did

1135
01:15:33,871 --> 01:15:36,030
not get that APP for a long time,

1136
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:36,891
which is crazy.

1137
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:40,520
I'd kept telling you that way you
can preorder the drink you go in.

1138
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,980
It's just how I breathe.

1139
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,660
So I just didn't want anything to do
with it. I hear Ya. I finally did it.

1140
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,713
And,

1141
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:51,180
and so for those who don't know,
Starbucks has an APP.

1142
01:15:51,181 --> 01:15:54,960
You just prepay and then you can order
your drink in advance of you going to the

1143
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:56,880
Starbucks and it's there
waiting and you just

1144
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,910
pardon? Oh God, I don't
know what held me back.

1145
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,510
You're now, you're in, you're in it

1146
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:05,500
now. Mobile order for sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Then they were like, congratulations.

1147
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:08,280
You hit this status. I don't
know what that means. Well,

1148
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,960
what's but what's your status?
I don't know.

1149
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:15,250
It just said like gold and then something
else came in and I just do you get

1150
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:20,110
special perks? That's what I don't
know. Like when you go assuming, no.

1151
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:24,640
Here's the thing that they know me so
well at the one that I like to go to. No,

1152
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:29,130
for the mobile order. They're now
doing my splash, even though I don't,

1153
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,440
they know the splash splash.
Exactly how much the splash is

1154
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,110
and they're doing it even
though it's not on the order.

1155
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:42,520
There's Tom's order and being
like, oh, he likes to splash.

1156
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:46,700
What an exceptional Starbucks location.
I know they're the best. They're the,

1157
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:51,150
you know, I will say, because we'd
go to the, there's a couple places.

1158
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:55,190
Oh, sip of what water. I'm
sorry. Hold on a second. Yeah.

1159
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:00,390
You're drinking brown liquid and
you're wet. I'm thirsty for water now.

1160
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:04,780
Oh, and what did you just do? Reach
for water. No, you didn't reach her.

1161
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:09,680
You just asked if you could
have a sip of water. My right.

1162
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:14,180
I like you to specifically say that
right now for the listen because I have

1163
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:18,620
water on the table. Jesus Christ.
But let the record show Yana,

1164
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,340
Mr Segura who claims
to be the water champ,

1165
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,970
did not have water at his desk today
at work. And I did. And he just,

1166
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:27,980
he's drinking mine right
now and he's so thirsty.

1167
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,920
You're parched cause you don't
drink enough water. It's obvious.

1168
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:36,110
It's a stupid argument. No, it's
not a stupid argument. So anyways,

1169
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:41,840
yeah, we've been to a few
in the neighborhood and they
are like the Dream Team.

1170
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:45,890
Starbucks. It's like, you're
like norm from cheers.

1171
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:50,450
You walk in and they're
like, Tom, hey, you're here.
Welcome. We've got your drink.

1172
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,440
It's amaze. Really crazy. They're
super friendly and they do the,

1173
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,170
they do a great job.
So shout out to our local,

1174
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:02,530
you know, branch. Good job
guys. Queef or fart too.

1175
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:05,620
My main mommies and the deans of jeans,

1176
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:09,670
my wife Christina and I had been
debating this topic for five years now.

1177
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,580
I know that you two have the insight,

1178
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:15,070
knowledge and mental fortitude
to resolve this issue.

1179
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:21,010
When having anal sex, air gets pushed
into the brown barrel and is expelled.

1180
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,050
I don't have anal.
The question is,

1181
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:26,380
is this escaping air a fart or a Queef?

1182
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,090
Wow. It's definitely a
queef. This person goes on.

1183
01:18:31,091 --> 01:18:34,750
I am firmly in the Queef camp because
just like a queef air is being pushed into

1184
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,880
the hole during the act of penetration,

1185
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,540
it's not naturally generated within the
body like the gas that composes of a

1186
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:44,080
fart.
My wife backs Brown,

1187
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:49,240
claiming this escaping area is in fact
a fart based solely on the fact that is

1188
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:49,601
leaving.

1189
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:54,550
The butthole is my belief that a fart is
born from within and the Queef is made.

1190
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,780
If you trace a queef back far
enough to its point of origin,

1191
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,690
you will find that the
air came from the outside.

1192
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,140
A fundamentally different
story than that of the Fart.

1193
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:06,640
We come to you with humble hearts,

1194
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:11,410
assured that only youtube can create
the intellectual discourse needed to

1195
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:15,220
resolve this issue and we will
fully respect your final decision.

1196
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:21,040
Uh, save our marriage respectfully.
Edward, they're really in peril.

1197
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,660
We are the fact that this married
couple is having sex in there.

1198
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:30,300
How you say his wild?
Um, it's like a regular,

1199
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:34,350
it's wild. I think married,
regular anal is kind of wild. Yeah.

1200
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,670
I guess I don't know why we don't do, I
don't do anal holes. It's probably why.

1201
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,270
My opinion is that it's kind of wild,

1202
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:46,570
but if I liked it I would probably
request it. That's true. Jam. Yeah,

1203
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,750
that's true.
Now Yana allow me to present my case.

1204
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:54,510
Well, I love me. I'm telling you, I
even as I was beginning to read this,

1205
01:19:54,511 --> 01:19:58,830
I was immediately team queef because what
do you mean team? Please clarify. Well,

1206
01:19:58,831 --> 01:20:00,240
I mean it's a quiff.
He's right.

1207
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:04,410
The thrust is creating an air pocket.

1208
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:08,160
Air is being pushed into her
butthole and then is coming out

1209
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,420
as a queef. It's air that
wasn't generated from within.

1210
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:15,780
It's from the movement.
It's a queef. Yeah.

1211
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:20,810
I'm going to have to differ in opinion
here and why by definition a Queef is a

1212
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,513
pussy fought.

1213
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:28,020
Now the air you're describing coming
from the woman's anus is actually queef

1214
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:31,050
like in nature. However,
is not a queef. Why?

1215
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:35,430
Because a Queef by
definition is a pussy fat,

1216
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,940
therefore coming out of the
pussy. Yeah. But this is a,

1217
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:42,120
this is a different location, Yada.
This is simply a different location.

1218
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:46,530
It is a different location and I
respect that logic, but it's still,

1219
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,770
it's an anal queef it's air.
It's anal.

1220
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:54,890
Queef it is a Queef like scenario
coming out of an anus. Yeah.

1221
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:58,170
Now the Queef is by definition a pussy.
Fuck.

1222
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:02,020
So if we're going to change
definitions here, this is absurd.

1223
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,590
The definition is a pussy fart.

1224
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:08,430
But it's a anus fart.
Correct.

1225
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,800
But it's not a fart fart.

1226
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,930
It doesn't necessarily matter.
It does matter.

1227
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,680
It does matter when it comes out of a
butthole. I'm not saying it's a fart. Now,

1228
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:22,230
here's the real definition we go.
We have to think about here.

1229
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,660
It's not exactly a Fart, but it's not
exactly a queef because like I said,

1230
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:30,180
by definition,
queefs come out of vaginas.

1231
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:34,680
It's kind of a hybrid of the two.
I'm going to say it's like a, uh,

1232
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:39,130
Corfe a Corfe. Well,
what is, what is a, uh,

1233
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,910
uh, an asshole? Queef it's an asshole.

1234
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:47,610
Queef but it's not a proper queef.
It's not the same.

1235
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,640
You can't start calling anal queefs.
It's an anal queef.

1236
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,060
But it is not a vaginal queef. It's
not. It's definitely your queef.

1237
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,770
And it's not a pure fart. It's not a pure
foreign, it's not a pure fork. It's not.

1238
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:02,340
It's an anal queef which is
different than a traditional Queef,

1239
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:07,890
you know? No, I, I'm
sorry, but I, I'm a purist.

1240
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:12,050
I stand by my definition that
a Queef is a pussy fart. I see.

1241
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:16,840
That's got to come out of a pussy.
Well,

1242
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:21,690
I mean, do you even care?
I do. F A. R. T. Yeah. So,

1243
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:26,460
but you think it is still considered a
queef? I do think it's an anal queef.

1244
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:30,960
Queef is not necessarily by
definition of Pussy Fart.

1245
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:36,110
A queef is about the idea that
it's thrust generated air.

1246
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,730
Correct scapes.
Crap.

1247
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:43,720
That that thrust and that air
can come from two sources,

1248
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,020
multiple sources.
The thrust can be from anything.

1249
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:50,760
The escape of air can be from
any, a whole, any hole. Now see,

1250
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:53,490
that's what we got to go to his admin.
Is it in Miriam Webster?

1251
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,060
Can we look up wave?

1252
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,610
I think that that would
decide this once and for all.

1253
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,070
Let's look at a proper definition
of what a Queef is. Um,

1254
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,020
it says the sound is somewhat
comparable flatulents

1255
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:11,220
to flatulence from the anus but does not
involve waste gases and thus often does

1256
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:16,741
not have a specific odor associated
slang terms for vaginal flagyl.

1257
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:22,900
Lynch include Vaart, Queef, n Fanny fart

1258
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,350
vaginal and that there,
your honor is the hook vaginal flatulent.

1259
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:32,520
You're going to have to be a purist here.
I'm clearly a purist.

1260
01:23:32,521 --> 01:23:34,920
You're going to be a little looser
on your interpretation here.

1261
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,690
Yeah.
Okay.

1262
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:40,890
Hmm.
But if I had to argue in court,

1263
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:43,240
I'm going to stick to the
definition of vaginal,

1264
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:45,960
a flashlight. But then
how do you, how do you,

1265
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:51,780
you are also on board with the
fact that this is not a waste gas,

1266
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,240
you know,
escaping,

1267
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,760
right? Correct. The difference
here is that it's not a pure fart.

1268
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:02,310
We're going to give it its
own name. It is a, uh, uh,

1269
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:06,850
anal, an anal Queef, which is
different than a traditional queef.

1270
01:24:06,851 --> 01:24:10,630
It's like a sub category.
I got you have a pure Queef

1271
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:15,390
uh, by the way, we have another, uh,
subtitler weighing in here. Okay.

1272
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,080
You just want to let throw on my,

1273
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:22,170
on my own 2 cents on the proverbial poop
pile of opinions regarding the issue of

1274
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,120
watching standup specials
with the subtitles on it.

1275
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,360
I am a transcriptionist and the company
I work for also does closed captioning,

1276
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:32,170
so I'm very familiar with how they do it.

1277
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,880
The guidelines of the company sets for
the projects we work with require us to

1278
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:41,260
change slang to grammatically
correct language. For example,

1279
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:45,700
Gada has to change to got to
know I'm gonna is, I'm going to,

1280
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:49,360
so in this respect, absolutely. 100%.

1281
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:54,280
Subtitles will shit all over the
delivery of standup love you guys,

1282
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,420
JC settled nuance.

1283
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:02,830
You can't do it that
way guys. No. Yeah. Uh,

1284
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,550
here's a little game.
You see these guys right here?

1285
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:12,480
My life. So this is a
the piss on me, right?

1286
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,670
Beat me or fuck me games is crazy. So
what you're supposed to do here? Yeah,

1287
01:25:16,671 --> 01:25:18,220
I got it already,
I think.

1288
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:21,630
I don't know why this is not letting
me do both. At the same time.

1289
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:27,540
Oh for fuck's sake, I'm not going
to play you play. I would rather,

1290
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,710
I would uh, have a, would you
rather have source of share it?

1291
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:33,270
This question Rachel originated
on the why each sub reddit.

1292
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,920
I thought maybe the main mommy's would
like to weigh in a user myth of 1886

1293
01:25:37,921 --> 01:25:40,980
submitted a post titled We'd
Rather Fuck Marry, kill.

1294
01:25:40,981 --> 01:25:45,120
And why with these three recent
your mom's house podcast superstars.

1295
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,180
However, because fuck marry,
kill is an awful game.

1296
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,160
And since you'd have to be homeless,

1297
01:25:50,161 --> 01:25:54,260
a thug or just out of jail and considered
marry one of these human scrubs I've

1298
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,040
suggested we update the game a bit.

1299
01:25:56,250 --> 01:26:01,250
So I would the woods would we rather
I've proposed to you is between the tried

1300
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,720
out guy,
the Sissy Fremont Street and shit pig.

1301
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:10,870
Who would you rather
fuck piss on and beat.

1302
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:14,990
I really liked the pain of the water
champ and also Christina on this pressing

1303
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:17,780
record.
Stay glass in Corey.

1304
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,680
So you just have to say who do I want
to fuck? Hold on, I want to piss on.

1305
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:23,030
Who do I want to beat the shit out of.

1306
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:28,540
And the three superstars
are the try it out guy,

1307
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:33,800
the Cecilia Fremont and
the Ima shit pig shit bag.

1308
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,700
Whenever you want to call them.
That guy pass on me.

1309
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:42,290
Fucking God with this on me.
Beat me or beat.

1310
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,630
Yeah it's pass beat or what?

1311
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,030
It's pice beat and fuck like

1312
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,080
this is terrible. Oh my God. No,

1313
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:57,640
I don't know how much I cool.

1314
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,900
Fuck yeah,

1315
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,810
I dunno.
Well here's what we know for sure.

1316
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:08,990
The three of them. Oh this is
interesting when you can kind of,

1317
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:14,710
we know for sure that all three
want to be physically assaulted.

1318
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:24,260
This guy says kiss on me,
be me. You know. Yeah.

1319
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:25,790
He's like,
beat the shit out of me.

1320
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:30,110
This guy specifically asked to be beat
the shit out of by white women with

1321
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:35,030
tattoos and actually antagonizes
them. Yes. Hopes of attracting.

1322
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:40,031
He is down with it even though he would
like to choose a certain type and this

1323
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:45,380
six son of a bitch was like, you
can just shit in my mouth. And, uh,

1324
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:50,420
and so we know also that these two outside
guys are down with being pissed on,

1325
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,630
which is one of the questions here.
So,

1326
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,510
so far the three of them
are done with being beat.

1327
01:27:56,970 --> 01:28:00,800
So what I'm saying is you don't have
to feel guilty about beating you one of

1328
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:03,490
them. That's really why I'm
bringing it up first. Yeah.

1329
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,200
The three of them are down with it and
this guy wants you to really beat the

1330
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:08,090
shit out of him. Like, um,

1331
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:12,620
the difficult thing here is we know
that the outside two guys here,

1332
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:16,280
the try it out, guy and the shit pig
are also down with being pissed on.

1333
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:21,560
They encourage it. Right. Okay.
This guy is not, and you know,

1334
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:24,080
the hardest decision of this
whole thing is who to fuck.

1335
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,710
That's the biggest problem I think you
really have to do is eliminate people.

1336
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:28,753
You know,

1337
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:34,090
I think the greatest thrill would be
from beating the sissy of free months.

1338
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:38,540
I want to hit him the most.
I feel like he antagonizes you,

1339
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:41,000
he wants you to do and he's a bit aloof.

1340
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:45,230
There's a sense of a little bit
of arrogance. He's taunting you.

1341
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:46,430
He's daring you to do it.

1342
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:49,580
And I kind of want to give that guy what
he wants because it's a shit head about

1343
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:52,400
it. I wouldn't mind giving him a
beating. Allowed me to shove him.

1344
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,820
I agree with that one then the pissing,
it's like they both,

1345
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:59,660
these two guys both want to, it's
really cool. Can you tolerate fucking

1346
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,353
yeah.

1347
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:07,200
Who would you want to fuck the tried
out guy or the dog? Shit Guy. I mean,

1348
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,390
I think it'd be more tolerable
to fuck this guy on the end here.

1349
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:14,540
On the right side. Why? Uh,

1350
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:19,730
because I think it could be a house
of horrors with this guy and this guy,

1351
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:25,830
the shift pick guy. It's
a little bit more, um,

1352
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:29,010
like he's just,
he's going to do what you say.

1353
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:34,430
Yeah. He, he seems more together
then try it out. Try it out
guys. Just a mess. Okay.

1354
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:35,840
Here's what we're going to do.
Try it out.

1355
01:29:35,841 --> 01:29:39,320
Guy Gets pissed on because he's such a
hot mass. He's totally out of reality.

1356
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:40,760
Yeah.
And then the dog

1357
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,240
guy gets fucked. That's what I'm
saying. That's what I'm saying.

1358
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:47,190
However you fucked the dog shit guy.
He's going to,

1359
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:49,460
except he's not pushing back on anything.

1360
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,400
Does he want to be fucked?
That's the thing.

1361
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:56,170
I feel like he wants more of abuse then
he might want the piss on me and then

1362
01:29:56,171 --> 01:29:58,750
the tried out guy. The trout
guy wants to be fucked, Tom.

1363
01:29:58,751 --> 01:30:03,280
That's all he focuses on is, fuck
me. Fuck me. I want to be fucked.

1364
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:08,290
That's the thing. That's all he's asking
for is come over here and fuck me.

1365
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:12,730
At least in a keys offering it for,
you know, everything. Black eyes,

1366
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,880
uh, jail. Whoever just fucked me.
I need to get fucked a lot, man.

1367
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:23,210
I'm a shape pay.
Okay.

1368
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,540
Okay.
Okay.

1369
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:32,470
I've done, I've heard. I need to
know. I've heard about everything.

1370
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,290
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to Piss on that guy.

1371
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:36,780
We're going to piss on that guy
because all he wants his deck,

1372
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:40,690
he sounds like he wants degradation.
He wants to be humiliated.

1373
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,190
Fuck the other guy wants to fuck it.
Seems like to me,

1374
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,340
you're just giving people
what they want. Well, yeah.

1375
01:30:48,341 --> 01:30:50,200
Then it's mutually beneficial,

1376
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:55,230
but this is about what you want and it's
time to stand up for what you want to

1377
01:30:55,481 --> 01:31:00,460
do. Right. But I want to do what's going
to be a greater, a better experience.

1378
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:01,420
Do you know what I'm saying?

1379
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:04,870
I want to match up if we're going to
do love who are most turned on by?

1380
01:31:04,871 --> 01:31:05,860
How about start there?

1381
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:11,700
Go there and then build out from
that is a hard question to answer.

1382
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:16,410
Who Do you want to make?
All of them are just so tantalizing.

1383
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,630
Which one turns you on the most?

1384
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,310
I think this,

1385
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:26,390
this would be the most tolerable to
look at up close to this shiny teeth.

1386
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,660
Hey, I'll come to you. See, I mean
I could hang out with this guy.

1387
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:40,050
I could definitely, I could get into
being like, hey shit pig. Get over here.

1388
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:44,520
Thank you. Saying shit bag. He's
has a heavy accent shit bag.

1389
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,550
I think it might be full peanut.
Yeah.

1390
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,980
I would rather hang out
with to try it out guy.

1391
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,540
I would just be less because of
the cool shit that he would say.

1392
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:58,200
I would laugh so fucking hard. He's so
whacked out. More predictable. Involved.

1393
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,010
Yeah.
That's why he's

1394
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:04,090
more fun to hang. He's a better, hey,
I don't think he's a fun hang that guy.

1395
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:07,810
Just boring. He's like a run of
the mill, you know. Humiliate me.

1396
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,180
Try Now guy.
It's a wild card.

1397
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:14,170
Like you're going to see some crazy shit
when you beat the fucking snuck out of

1398
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:18,910
the free month. Sissy without question. He
gets the beating. We're doing that. Yeah.

1399
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:24,790
I don't want to fuck the dog shit guy.
He's too fragile. He seems too fragile.

1400
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,370
I think the tryout guy can handle a fuck.
Yeah.

1401
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:32,950
That guy can handle being peed on.

1402
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:36,250
He wants to be peed on and it's going to
be a better experience because he wants

1403
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:40,150
him Google. Google. I don't like
this guy will get the speech

1404
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,930
me up any way you want to do it.
You wake coach me anyway. Come on.

1405
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,920
Like tramp.
She has to be dominant

1406
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:56,910
and picks me up like
a girl. Oh Geez. Yeah,

1407
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:01,090
so he's definitely into it though.
I don't like he's emergence wise.

1408
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:03,820
If you're looking for a fun experience,
I think he's going to provide it.

1409
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:07,310
He's the most annoying to
me. You know, he's a chef,

1410
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,640
which means it would make
sense to beat him. Yeah. Yeah.

1411
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:10,720
He really fucking annoying.

1412
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:14,680
Just still amazed that you want to fuck
the try it out guy because he wants it

1413
01:33:14,681 --> 01:33:15,850
so badly.

1414
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:19,810
He's willing to give you a lease
and a key and put himself out there.

1415
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,150
So would you do that?
You would do the strap on him as soon.

1416
01:33:22,151 --> 01:33:25,000
Cause that's what he wants. What I
have to be, I have to be a black guy.

1417
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:29,440
What I'm saying so you could get a big
black strap on and give it to him and he

1418
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:31,060
can handle it.
He's there.

1419
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:36,150
The other guys too fragile and he would
cry and be Weird but I could pee on that

1420
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:40,360
guy and it would be fine. He would
want that. I'm fucking that guy.

1421
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,970
You're fucking the teeth.
Yeah, dog shit. Oh yeah.

1422
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:48,850
And you're pissing on try it out.
Walk me through your logic here.

1423
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,600
I just think it'd be easier to be
around a clearly really submissive,

1424
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,130
somewhat believably, more stable
guy, which I think should big is,

1425
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,480
and I think try it out guy.

1426
01:34:02,481 --> 01:34:07,481
I just want to piss on them and take
off and I'm beating sissy to a pulp.

1427
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:11,530
He gets beaten. He's annoying. No, he
gets, he gets knuckle sandwich for sure.

1428
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:16,020
Um, yeah, that's where I guess we agree
to disagree on it. Just so, I mean, uh,

1429
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:17,770
we'd sure love to hear from you guys

1430
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:26,140
on this very important
debate. Yeah. It's, you know,

1431
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:30,850
potato Patato I honestly,
the the dog Shit Piss Shit Guy.

1432
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:34,630
He annoys a shout to me to try it out.
Guy amuses me.

1433
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:37,990
I would want to hang out with them.
Yeah. I wouldn't want hang out with them.

1434
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:40,540
I'm saying voluntarily, but
if I had to, I would be him.

1435
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:45,880
There are to try it out,
try it out.

1436
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:51,060
Musical by Severen from New Zealand
and there's try it out by Jim Kay.

1437
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:57,620
I know what we do here. We've got
to try it out. Try it out. Um,

1438
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,400

to hear the New Zealand New Zealand,

1440

their accents a lot.
Okay. Um, here it is Jane.

1441
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,430
Unless it's something crazy weird or
something, then I'll, uh, if it's,

1442
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,920
if it's like super fucked up,
I haven't heard it,

1443
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:17,600
then I'll just stop it and play now, but
okay. If not, this will be signing off.

1444
