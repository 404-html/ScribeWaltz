00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,570
Uh,

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,390

Go to your mom's house.

54
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,710
A man.
Okay.

55
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,560
This made me laugh. Brought back a lot
of memories actually. And Your Dad. Yeah,

56
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:21,180
of course. Do you feel like you'll never
know that type of joy? I've thought,

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,910
why can't I be like this?
I wish I knew this.

58
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,540
This feeling. Yeah, like just
laughing and stuff. It's so not funny.

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,270
I mean it's just, it's super joy. So joy.

60
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,390
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's like

61
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,703
multiple,

62
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,010
multiple choice questions.
You sound,

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,250
are you okay? All right, so funny. I
can't believe I'm blanking on the front.

64
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,100
The best part about that,
by the way,

65
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,050
that's either that is my dad laughing
at his own thought, like his own joke,

66
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,380
right? He goes to answers multiple choice.
This guy is reading a joke book, right?

67
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,190
Like a de a Corny, yeah. He's like,
there's an ultimate dad Boehner.

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,160
Don't you wish the bar was super low
on humor for us like that can we just

69
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:24,270
laughed a little. I wish I could walk on
stage and just fucking do this. I know.

70
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,510
Look at this guy.
All right.

71
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,760
Bear walks into a restaurant and says,
I like

72
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,030
came and get through the arts
into your restaurant and says,

73
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:43,140
I like the grill

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,240

to says what's with the big

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,120
okay. I can't even say
it. Got It. What if,

76
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,880
what if he's a real pos in real life
and he beats the shit out of this way.

77
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,710
Like how much you like that? I know.
It makes you laugh. You sick. Fuck

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,630
me. That means you, you're
so fucked in your head.

79
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,580
Was that thing I was telling
you about? Uh, no I don't.

80
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,143
Nope.

81
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,600
In the green room and Bray
a couple of weeks ago,

82
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,470
Josh potters with me and one
of the servers came in and she,

83
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,100
we were,
the TV was on,

84
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,840
I think tiger was playing and started
talking about like member his, how,

85
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,660
how fucking on top of the world he was.

86
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Then we started talking about how
Tiger Tiger fucking dumb name is tiger.

87
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:51,110
I know that a few times, but you
hear it and you're like, okay,

88
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,130
well that's Brendan Schaub son's
name is tiger. Yeah, it is.

89
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,400
Yes it is.
Sorry Brennan.

90
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,120
Okay.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,890
And, and in this case it's a nickname in
Brendan's. It's his real name. Great Name.

92
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,300
Did I say so?
Uh,

93
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,380
so when tiger was on top of the world,

94
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,890
it's like just how on top of
it he was. Yeah. And then he,

95
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:18,580
he had all these hoes on the
side like so many hoes. Right.

96
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,750
And we were just talking
about, you know, imagine,

97
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,170
well just like how backed up he was,
what it was,

98
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:30,310
we're pressing to act out in the way
he was acting out and we can't wait to

99
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,330
throat fucking ass. Weird. Pretty crazy
stuff cause he was a pretty buttoned up.

100
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,410
He is a pretty buttoned up guy. Well
yeah I mean golf in general like that,

101
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,380
that image is real straight laced.

102
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm going to throw fuck the shit
out of this horror right now. No,

103
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,190
I mean John Daly was the only
guy who was openly like that.

104
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,750
But I mean he also had like some real
problems and he also was never nearly as

105
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:56,650
good as tiger is. Like the best
thing we've ever seen. Just dominant.

106
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,610
Started it like two years old
and he was dominant though.

107
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:03,820
I mean just kicking people's ass every
week in this thing. A lot love, big time.

108
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,440
Big Time Golfers. They'll have, you know,

109
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:10,000
a few big wins in their career where
they're competing every week. But like,

110
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,320
you know, having like all these
majors like week after week,

111
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,390
just crushing people.
Anyway,

112
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:21,391
we're talking about this about imagine
them being one of those girls and you

113
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:25,750
know he's throwing you cash on the
side and some of them are cool with the

114
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:26,251
arrangements.

115
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:29,740
Some of them probably like a lot of
times with these things start to get like

116
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,780
how come I'm not like the main girl,
you know?

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,540
And he had too many going on to it yet.
No one wants to be second or third place,

118
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,910
not real. And he's just like don't
fucking make eye contact if you see me

119
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,100
in the hotel because he had those
like arrangements like I know,

120
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:50,101
you know he would arrange the hotel
through one of his buddies or you know his

121
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:53,740
handlers. But also it was like,
you know, make sure no one,

122
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,170
you don't me in the lobby.
Okay. Cause he's tiger.

123
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,540
So he gets to maintain
all this make sense.

124
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,530
If you're the Ho like that's your
job is to be, if you're a good whoa,

125
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,650
you're supposed to be like of course.
But what happened was,

126
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:10,380
I think he started to get, some
of them were like, wow, you know,

127
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,370
they're also around somebody who's
so like so famous and so rich.

128
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,030
I think they started, some of them
started to get like, I want one more.

129
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,690
Where's my stuff? Yeah, I want some
stuff. I want some stuff too. Anyway,

130
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,720
then we started talking about,
uh,

131
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,770
other well known people and
I'm like, this is like, oh,

132
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,170
Jay. Not even like, I know.

133
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:40,950
I imagine Oj, you know, approaching,

134
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:44,370
you now be like, hey, how you
doing sweetie? And you're like, Hi,

135
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,000
if I'm 20 years old and don't,
and 1994 never happened. Yeah.

136
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,880
I was born in [inaudible] 96
or 2000,

137
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,090
but what was the other girl? Casey.
Casey Anderson. What was her name now?

138
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:00,460
And I know you're talking about,
but I know she's a real sicko too.

139
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,400
What's her fucking name?
I'm Casey Anderson.

140
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,780
It's Casey, uh, Shit.

141
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,170
I ain't got no bandwidth
for this stuff anymore.

142
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,970
I don't follow these cycles like you do.
I don't have as much interest,

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,620
if you will. Casey, Casey,
Anthony, Anthony, Casey, Anthony.

144
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,120

151
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:54,030

Yeah. It was found like the,

152
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,220

Yeah.
That's an interesting story.

222
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,950
That's a neat idea.
I try and stuff for

223
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,990
like I, yeah, I mean,

224
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:00,210
I don't know that this is such a
funny idea that I'm wiping tears away.

225
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,620
I'm not sure it's a tier wiper. Like I
see kind of why I technically, it's funny,

226
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:09,620
but it's not, it doesn't
get me the way. Well,

227
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:12,710
this is my version of these guys show,
right?

228
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,860
So you want to finish that guys
joke. Oh yeah. Let's see what the,

229
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,370
the bear says.
The bartender says yes to get clear,

230
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,520
walks into a restaurant and says,

231
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,970
I like a groove cheese.

232
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,230
What's with the big pause?
The bar tender ask.

233
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,350
That's the joke. Joke. My parent
doesn't even have a double

234
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,830
closing. Did you get that?
I get the grilled cheese.

235
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,483
I've heard it,

236
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,273
yeah.

237
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,130
Oh, you know what? Maybe he
didn't tell the joke. Right.

238
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,750
I would like a grilled cheese.
What's with the big pause?

239
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm a bear paws. P A u. S e p. Aws.

240
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,240
Is that a joke? Because I'm like, wait,
that's not even a dry. So he said,

241
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,200
I'll uh,
I'll have a grilled cheese.

242
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,540
Right. But he didn't tell
the joke properly. Right.

243
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,070
That's exactly what my dad would do.
Exactly right.

244
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,410
You would miss the point of the
joke. The whole timing of it. Yeah.

245
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,610
Yeah.

246
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,040
What joy number when we called my
dad and we'd go outside though.

247
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,520
Oh my God,
I love it.

248
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,600
I love those jokes. Oh, I
got a whole bunch. Okay,

249
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,120
so how can you tell a blonde
has been using your computer?

250
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,190
I don't know.

251
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,960
There's whiteout all over the Monitor.

252
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,440
I got one for you too. Okay,
go, go ahead. Go ahead. Okay.

253
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:09,980
This lot is sitting at a bar
in Chicago watching the, yeah,

254
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,010
the one of these bars where they had
the TV behind the bar and some guy up on

255
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:16,900
the ledge and getting ready to jump.
So this,

256
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,090
this guy sat next to her and he
says to her, it's too wordy already.

257
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:26,710
This is the six o'clock
news. And uh, he says, uh,

258
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:31,630
I bet you he jumps and the bond says,
I bet you your drink.

259
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:36,000
He doesn't. And all of a sudden, okay,

260
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,280
the guy jumps. And so the,
the guys at the blind is,

261
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,970
I guess you owe your $20. And he said, no,

262
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,940
that was for a drink and we can't take
the money cause I saw it on the five

263
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:50,060
o'clock news and the blinds this.
So did I.

264
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,590
But I thought he might change his mind.

265
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,920
I think that's hilarious.

266
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,150
Let's see. It was, it's so poorly
told. Well there's, it's too wordy.

267
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,830
The setup was too convoluted. It's, I was
like, and this is the six o'clock news,

268
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,350
like, no, it'd be like,
okay, a blonde and an guy.

269
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:17,300
We're sitting at the bar watching
the six o'clock news. Yeah. The door.

270
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,670
You can I say about the time
and then have the punch be like,

271
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,230
I saw the slide earlier
time. Right. You know,

272
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,100
there's a lot of ways to tell that
joke efficiently. Yeah. He did not. Um,

273
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,020
you know what's funny about
your father is that he, um,

274
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,640
he's kind of an old school kind of dude
and he loves to point out that I'm a

275
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,450
woman constantly. Oh yeah. Like I'm
not really sure know, Christina,

276
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,340
we were watching your special on Netflix
and I think what people like the most

277
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,880
is that you're a woman telling
me jokes and these things like,

278
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,410
yeah.
Yeah.

279
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,450
So any loves to make fun of
me being blonde in California.
[inaudible] loves it.

280
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,210
Loves it. Yeah. I mean, this shit is just

281
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,470
my God.

282
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,620
See, I think Nice Casey has any Oj
stuff's way funnier. Right? Try It,

283
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,270
try it on a crowd to see
if they think it's funnier.

284
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,860
I think we'll get feedback just from this.

285
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,770
I a million a million cycles are going
to write in and say how wrong I am and

286
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,630
how brilliant that is. I know,
I know. How wrong you. Oh yeah.

287
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,450
They always side with the psychopath.
Tom. Christina has just the squared.

288
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,430
Tom's Tom's right.
That's

289
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,320
your whole psycho squad of,
of people. Yeah. You know,

290
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:41,550
these are the same derelict to buy the
shirts that I don't think are great.

291
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,380
Do you wanna know something amazing? This
is, this is how good God is. God is good

292
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,420
all the time. I'm too
blessed to be straight. How,

293
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,700
how good is God right now? This was
completely unplanned. She had no idea.

294
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,090
None. I didn't tell her, but I didn't prep
you on this. No, you just bring that up.

295
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,470
Added to the store. Oh, less than an
hour ago. Oh, what is it this time?

296
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,700
The piss on me featuring my face,

297
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:14,170
your mouth open and some
tears. Um, Geez, this Tom,

298
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,820
this is a presale right now.

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,600
This is the image that was on my
Instagram that did so well. Um,

300
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,310
that we, uh, everyone was like, puts
us on a shirt. I was like, okay,

301
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,340
so great. Yeah, this was a,

302
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,520
I wonder how many people are going
to want piss on me and beat me.

303
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,840
It was like beard at guy's mouth open
on their chests, but you know, uh,

304
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,730
a judge that kind of a thing.

305
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,790
X h h creative x as a 22 year
old artists who made this.

306
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,240
Um, by the way, I also,
it's not for sale yet,

307
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,360
but I also send the
design to our sock guy,

308
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,210
so hopefully there'll be some piss on me.
Beat me socks.

309
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,340
It's exciting.
When's the FTT Rit?

310
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,550
Well this is all you're
throwing all that at first.

311
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,860
Good tongue replaces that Dick.

312
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,060
Somebody feel like they
crack the code here. Hey,

313
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,850
I crack the FCT RTD code high Hitler.

314
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:14,470
I became fascinated with the puzzle
presented to the y community.

315
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,600
I think I have solved it.
Um, I took to the streets.

316
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:24,601
We can walk around pronouncing FTD Archie
phonetically making eye contact with

317
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,420
each person. I pass in hopes
of assistance for inspiration.

318
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,960
I got some dirty looks from some
zooms herbs with blue hair. You're,

319
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,500
they thought it wasn't up to the task,
but I did not let just disheartened meat.

320
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,970
By the time I got home,

321
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,200
I remembered my past relationship with
a Jewish woman and drew from the letter

322
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,240
number association in the Hebrew language.

323
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,780
So I made the chart of the
English alphabet a to Z,

324
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,510
counting from one to
26 signing each letter,

325
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,540
a numerical value FTT RTD added
together is 75 the value of the acronym.

326
00:22:56,081 --> 00:23:01,081
Why am h got me 46 and the P for podcasts
yields 57 seeing that the sum of FTT

327
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,490
RTP was the reverse of the sum.

328
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,700
Why Mhp was all the proof I needed,

329
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,870
that this was indeed a high level
puzzle orchestrated by the main mommies.

330
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,390
Reinvigorated I press on,

331
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,030
I solve for the value is [inaudible] 79
and mommy's 86 knowing that these would

332
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:26,680
surely come into play, I saw I was all
I needed to solve the riddles. Crazy.

333
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,180
So now with the number, the numerical
values associated with each one,

334
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,230
you have to solve the problem.

335
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Mommies minus FGD RTD equals
1111 is the value of p.

336
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,400
So adding 11 to why match gives you 68.
Subtracting 11 also gets you 68.

337
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,430
Jesus Christ. Now, I have demonstrated
irrefutably that the relationship

338
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,750
between FTT RTD and mommies.
Oh my God,

339
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,620
this is a lot you guys. Yeah. Anyway,

340
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,440
I can't even keep reading
and design added the lexicon.

341
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,900
We shouldn't be lean furniture as FTT RTDs
in the same vein as mommy genes. Okay.

342
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,030
So he's saying we should just,
he found that relationship betweenF ,

343
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,800
g t R tds and the word
mommies. Yeah, you solved it.

344
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,820
It's not an acronym, but a word to
be spoken as its own entity. Gotcha.

345
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,280
I like that. We can call each other
FTT. RTDS is really great for us.

346
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,540
The tongue places that deck,
uh,

347
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,080
this won't be the person for great times.
Rub that Dick Tea Rtd.

348
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,923
Uh,

349
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,990
Bert is definitely FCT RTD.
Want to go for it? Go for it.

350
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:42,160
Go for it. That guy, too retarded to die.

351
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,070
Uh, for good time. Right to dean,

352
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,130
because that girl to ride the Dick.
Fuck gays and ripe the death.

353
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,820
I don't think so.
Okay.

354
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,680
Wow. People keep and then
look at this amat amazing, uh,

355
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Seagal.
FTT Rtd image created by Evan.

356
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,130
Amazing.
That's great.

357
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:15,710
What song on his neck
there as this neck fat.

358
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,670
There's just nothing that he's
wearing. One of his Asian, you know,

359
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,570
it's a great portrait.
His eyes and his mouth are so small,

360
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,030
so fat. He's so fat. Uh,

361
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,250
looks good. It's a great image.
Thank you. Haven't, um, yeah,

362
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,760
so, you know, we were
sharing the other day,

363
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:40,760
whereas a chording stories made me laugh.

364
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,020
Fat guys losing weight too.
Retarded dating.

365
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,450
Would you ever date and are worded person?
I'm sorry,

366
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,633
what?

367
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,190
Would you ever date and are worded person?
No.

368
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,470
Okay. Why not? Or would you, would
you hook up with and are worded,

369
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,640
but what if she's super hot,
babe? Just listen. Hear me out.

370
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,740
What if she's so fucking
hot? He's everything. You
want big, all sloppy titties.

371
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,670
Tiny ways. But donk, donk
gotta be so retarded.

372
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,260
But why?
But why not do I mean,

373
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,520
is it wrong for a normal person to
hook up with an are worded? Yes,

374
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:33,380
of course they need light. They
like doing it too though. I know,

375
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:37,040
but you have a, it's like I'll get
up with a drunk person, you know,

376
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:41,900
it's like you have too many uh,
advantages over them.

377
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:46,590
Like you don't know that they
can say no, you're just, you're,

378
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:51,430
you're intellectually superior. You know,
you, you, you can't do that. Okay. I mean,

379
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,550
but what if they're super hot?
Well

380
00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:00,050
really it's about what level of disability
someone has for this type of thing.

381
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,250
Right. Good point. So if
somebody is, I mean let's see,

382
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,840
some like a little bit slower than you.
You could a little slow.

383
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,250
Well that happens all the time. Right?
And marriages, we've seen it. Sure.

384
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,870
I'm going to go where you live
it and then, then there's a,

385
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,090
but then there's something where
it's definitely, yeah, I hear it.

386
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:25,920
It is a bit like taking advantage of
an innocent yeah. Right. Like a child.

387
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,190
So what about Slingblade are worded is
that guy and go close it wasn't he like

388
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,810
mm, like granting a lot. Yeah. Is he out
of the question for dating? I don't know.

389
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,050
I mean it's a character.
It's a, it's a, it's a,

390
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,980
a non are worded person
playing but he's not fully,

391
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,690
he's not full are worded. No, he's,
so that's a question could, could,

392
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,390
could I, could you date Slingblade
right. That's really for you.

393
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:54,810
Do you think you could, well I think
remembering back to that movie,

394
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:58,130
I feel like he's not your type.
He's not my right.

395
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,410
What about Tom Hanks in
um, hey, wait a minute.

396
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,090
Tom Hanks in guilt. What's a movie?
The stupid one with the Jannie.

397
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,830
Oh yeah. Stupid is as stupid
does dude. She hooks up with him.

398
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:14,880
They even have a kid together. Spoiler
alert. And how has that ethical,

399
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,030
she hooks up with Forrest Forrest Gump.
That's the name of the movie. Hello

400
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,140
back on my mother and father's
play into my life. No, no, no.

401
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:25,060
She had the mundane bill for me.

402
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,530
Come over to the audience
that around after and he had
her looking at the ground,

403
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,860
I dunno know no floor after what
ahead of me. A hole dug out,

404
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,840
lay down and oh

405
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,180
no, he's a problem. I think he's
pretty with it. I just don't,

406
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,650
I don't like where he's from.

407
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,960
Like I don't want to talk about
holes in the ground and stuff.

408
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:46,820
You don't even know. I don't
think it'd be a good date. I mean,

409
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:49,990
I don't think you'd have a great date. I
grew up in the San Fernando Valley, like,

410
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,300
I don't know. Could you do it
with him? Yeah, I think he's,

411
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,570
he's at a level of intelligence.
Yeah. I don't think it's unethical.

412
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,090
You don't know.
And I love Billy Bob Thornton.

413
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,590
I think he's definitely sleep with
Forrest Gump. Well that's the thing.

414
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:08,591
Jenny did rite aid Jenny
and then they had a kid.

415
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,400
Yeah. So you can apparently, and
he make a hit movie about it.

416
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,430
Yeah. You, that's a good point.

417
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,530
I forgot about your box office success
after you do this. Right. It's a win win.

418
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,640
Yeah. So you would sleep with Forrest
Gump though? I don't. I don't.

419
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,360
He's not my type. I like the edge of a
sling blade or guy more than [inaudible].

420
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,710
Which one would you do it with?
Forest or sling blade. I mean,

421
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:36,760
I think slingers into some
rough shit personally. Yeah.

422
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,570
Without really knowing much about them.
All that wiggling and it was a,

423
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,010
I mean he's, I feel like
he's pretty rough. Yeah.

424
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,110
I don't think it's going to be like,
I think forest is gentle.

425
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,640
It has like anger staff
that he's repressing. You
know it's going to come out.

426
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,020
I mean he'll,
he'll slice your tits off.

427
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:58,021
I think forest is going
to kiss your navel and he,

428
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,450
he was always so afraid of free.

429
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,350
I don't think. Is it unethical to be
with him? Apparently no. Then they met.

430
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:11,490
Like I said, they made a hit movie.
Everyone loves the dime the movie. Yeah.

431
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,290
You know, that's a good, good point.

432
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,150
What's her name that you know who's
Janet? You can write pen Robin. Right?

433
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,260
Do you think that he made her sniff
her butt after like in house of cards?

434
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:31,261
She made him sniff her if forest her
sniff is but be really fucking awesome.

435
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,160
That was in the scene.
That definitely stolen.

436
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:39,880
That would have been such a better man.
I come over here,

437
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,360
it's like a forest do it.
He's like sniff but doing much.

438
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,090
I ate lots of peas and carrots.

439
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,930
Does it smell like chocolate there

440
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,890
do you think? Huh? Do you think they're
sexy? It probably was just sweet sec.

441
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,070
He didn't do anything.
I remember he would freeze.

442
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:03,280
He kind of went just lay there
and he loved it. He's an innocent.

443
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,990
Why isn't that unethical though? I think
it is. I think that's not cool if her,

444
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,390
but apparently he, you know he
wanted it though. That's the thing.

445
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,710
He really loved Jenny. Yeah.
She wanted to help him.

446
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,330
She diverge a nice time.
I

447
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,250
mentioned this guy munching on your box

448
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,730
telling you the story as I don't want
to hear the stories as he's going down.

449
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:32,470
I knew he stops. Too many words
already. Looks up back down.

450
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,540
I don't like the words the talking
and it's so boring. So did you,

451
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,270
have anybody caught you that
was like this? I did actually.

452
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:43,670
There was a guy I worked with at the
Department of Public Safety at the

453
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,660
University of San Francisco and my work
study job, I worked in the parking booth.

454
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,260
So I handed out like I worked in one
of those boxes for like four years,

455
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,590
handing out parking. And then there
was another job you could have,

456
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,650
which is called the Charlie unit,
where you gave tickets to people.

457
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:58,960
And I refuse to do that.
Well there is a kid,

458
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,020
it was way too old to be an Undergrad.

459
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,880
He was like 25 and he lived at home with
his parents and he was kind of a sling

460
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:07,640
blade adjacent, if you
know what I mean. Yeah.

461
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,040
And one time he did ask me out on a date,
what'd you do?

462
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,280
I was so stunned. I didn't, cause I talked
to him a lot. Like he stopped by the,

463
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,910
the parking booth and I talked to him
and I was always amused by him cause he

464
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:20,710
was super weird and funny,
you know?

465
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,830
And I think he misinterpreted
that as me being interested.

466
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,860
It's a tough thing to adapt to when
people are nice too sometimes. Yeah.

467
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,700
And I get it like with guys, especially
in college, like you're just,

468
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,850
you're hunting for that stuff
when you start just talking
to them, we're like, oh,

469
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:38,200
this is the one. Yeah, I feel badly.
And then he, uh, he's like, so you know,

470
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:42,470
if you ever want to go out on a date and
eat dinner. And I was so stunned. I go,

471
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,780
I don't eat. I'm such a day. I know.
I was like, oh, I don't eat. Huh.

472
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,060
And I tried to deflect it. No, I
didn't mean I was trying to be funny.

473
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,210
I think at the time,
I know that was bad.

474
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,270
There was one guy went on a date with,
it was a car salesman.

475
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,590
We were 21 years old, 10
minutes into the day. He goes,

476
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:05,520
I've slept with over 76 women. We were
20 years old. And I was like, Ooh,

477
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,350
I gotta go. Where's your curious
to how good he must be? No,

478
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,670
I don't think the way you do.
I,

479
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,530
I was more of afraid of like diseases
and stole this peg is going to get down.

480
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,610
Is that right? Well you sleep with like
street stragglers. Excuse me. Oh my God.

481
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:20,810
You're,

482
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,070
you talk about your past like you find
these women and stragglers like gutter

483
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,890
gutter slots. No, I don't. Gutter slugs.

484
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,900
You one you thought you got aids from
and since she and you're in your act now,

485
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,980
you just, you recall her so fondly all
the time, but was the closest that I,

486
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,040
there's a time that I definitely thought
I had aids the most. You're so dumb.

487
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,420
I mean you had unprotected sex
with a woman in Africa twice.

488
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,860
Okay. Um, yeah,

489
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,920
I think about that. Uh, but we're,

490
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,880
we're what's your worst suitor?
Well, I mean I had one time, uh,

491
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,840
severely disabled person gave me a flower
and asked me to be their boyfriend.

492
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,870
That's nice. Yeah, I didn't
know how to handle it at first.

493
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,710
So I was volunteering at a
school with the kids, you know,

494
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,660
with a disability. And when, when
the, she gave me, she was like,

495
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:16,000
be my boyfriend. I was like, oh my God. So
I want it to the teacher. And I was like,

496
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:18,880
I don't know what to do.
And she told me like, just,

497
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,340
just tell you you can't because
you already have a girlfriend. Yes,

498
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,900
that's what I did.
That's sweet. That's not,

499
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,220
that doesn't really count.
No, no, no. Well, no,

500
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,380
but I mean like what about nasty bitches?
You've had like a nasty bitch.

501
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,290
The okay man, this one, this is fucked up.

502
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,090
I feel bad about this one kind of.

503
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,840
So I was at a bar on sunset and this is
like in my early thin days here in La

504
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,490
and I was just, I did it. I
wasn't really a bar proper,

505
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:59,491
but I happen to be out with a friend
and we're at the bar and a woman just

506
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:04,750
approached me and it, here's the
thing about bars, this is no joke.

507
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,440
You know they are dark bars at night,

508
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,170
have favorable lighting and beer
goggles, help tale. But I wasn't,

509
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,600
I wasn't, I mean I have maybe a beer
or two. I wasn't fucked up. Yeah.

510
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,930
And she just approached
me and she was like,

511
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:23,530
hey blah blah blah and like very
forward. And I was like, okay.

512
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,930
She asks me for my
number. I was like, yeah,

513
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:30,340
all right.
I gave her my number,

514
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,600
had a small brief conversation and then
I split and she called like either that

515
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:43,401
night or the next day pretty quickly
to set up going out Friday or Saturday.

516
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,490
And I was like, okay, cool. And I
went and I picked her up. Oh Man.

517
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,420
Oh Man. It was so bad.
What I was seeing was so,

518
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,350
so bad. I was, I it to just be
like, I got, I, I have a hernia.

519
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,180
I just, I mean who I saw, I had
zero recollection of her. Yeah.

520
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,530
Really the lighting lighting and yeah,
she was just nasty.

521
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,410
It was, she was, yeah. It was
fucking upsetting. Wow. That's,

522
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,340
but I mean, I was nice about
it, but I was like, mm,

523
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,820
no. You know, what did you do? Uh, we
went to like, somebody was having to wait.

524
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:27,800
She knew was having a party somewhere. I
just, you know, the whole time I was like,

525
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,040
I got to get out of this.
I was trying to be like nice about it.

526
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,180
And then I remember
there was music playing.

527
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:39,830
You don't actually remember is that the
party that she took me to had somebody

528
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,150
deejaying and sister Nancy BombBomb.

529
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,970
That's our song that you
and I, but I didn't know the
name of that song yet. Yeah.

530
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,510
And I remember that at
that party she took me to,

531
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:53,540
I went up to the DJ cause I
had heard the song before I go,

532
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,710
what's the name of this song?

533
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,130
And he told me and then that song we
came something you and I bonded out early

534
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:04,400
in our relationship because that's
your phone. Then we went back to her.

535
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,870
No you did. No, no, no. I had to
drive her back and she was like,

536
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:11,630
do you want to come in? And
I was like, no. She's like,

537
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:16,040
do you want to just like park here? And I
was like, no, do you want to? I was like,

538
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:21,010
no, none of it. That's so
horrible. But that was,

539
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,020
I wasn't a dick about it, but
I remember being, I mean, what,

540
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:26,150
what was the thing to do there?

541
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:29,900
Should I have just like at the beginning
saw her been like, oh shit. Okay.

542
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,750
No, I mean here's, here's
where the kids today have it,

543
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,070
right with this app dating is that they,
they don't commit to dinner.

544
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:41,010
They don't commit to a lengthy thing.
They commit to like coffee. Yeah.

545
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,710
So if you don't like that person, you
got a quick out like, oh, I got diarrhea,

546
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:48,530
I got to go. Yeah. And
that, that's a mistake.

547
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:52,100
I think that we could've preempted
that whole thing of making the date

548
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:56,690
potentially shorter. Yeah.
That's basically what they
do today. Evening from me.

549
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,350
Yeah. It sucks. It nothing's worse
than a bad date to and you're like,

550
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:05,390
and then my fear to offend, I just stuck
it out. Yeah. I didn't want to be like,

551
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,820
I don't find you attractive.
Well, here's the thing,

552
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,950
because if you think of
it in a humane fashion,

553
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:13,640
like you can be kind and maybe get to
know somebody and just spend the night.

554
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,580
And I was trying to be humane, but I
think she was like, well, we're on a date.

555
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,320
And I'm like in the U

556
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,130
I n n e bitch. No, but that's true. If it,

557
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:28,040
if she can't sense that you're not vibing
on her sexually. It's kind of, yeah.

558
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,900
Didn't I tell you a couple of an ass?
I told you about one girl who,

559
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,581
who was oh yeah,

560
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:38,581
this was a funny one to me where we were
in college and it was like junior year.

561
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,250
Um, and the end of the year
was approaching. Oh yeah. I,

562
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,740
I was hanging out with her and we were
in my dorm room and we were making out a

563
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:52,120
little bit on my bed and then I just
remember getting like a shove and she's

564
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:56,740
like, you're snoring. So I fell asleep
on her, not on her, but you know,

565
00:38:56,741 --> 00:39:00,520
next to her. And I was like, what? She's
like, you're snoring. And I was like,

566
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,370
I mean it's late.
I think she didn't marry yet.

567
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,990
That's the whole lifetime of that shit.

568
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:09,991
And she left and then she was going
home for the summer and she was like,

569
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:13,780
well, I was staying at school. So she
was like, it's like four hours apart.

570
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,270
And she goes, well, you know,
here's my number or whatever, let's,

571
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:21,610
because we went out a couple times,
you know,

572
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,090
let's stay in touch the
summer and you know, maybe see
each other. And I was like,

573
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,780
yeah, cool. And then I just never
texted her or called her or anything.

574
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,760
And then in the fall she rolled around,
she was like, you're an ass like day one.

575
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:36,280
And I was like, why you didn't
text call once? And I was like,

576
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,103
I mean,

577
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,490
see, I would've played it cool. I
would have ignored you and been like,

578
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:45,060
whatever dude is a fucking asshole. Like
tell him with my whole thing was like,

579
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:48,000
I just felt nothing for
the guy doesn't call,

580
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,600
he's not interested and
she wasn't unattractive. I
was like, I just, you know,

581
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,600
it's not, it's not your jam.
Hostile. Angry Hungarian. Yeah,

582
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,040
the gigantic or we need to
Franklin tits. Yeah, exactly.

583
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:05,240
You're waiting for your genes.
That's right. So it's a combination.

584
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,970
I just was like, whatever.
And then I dunno,

585
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,830
we went out like once or twice more.

586
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,130
Oh, you did go out with her again?
Yeah, but I mean, I mean, you know,

587
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,310
it was like I got guilted into it kinda
sounds like there wasn't even guilted

588
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:22,750
into it. I was just,
that's a dick move cars.

589
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:25,360
Then girls think that you're
interested if you're like, ah,

590
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:28,670
there's no one else in south
care. Totally. We'd stayed. Yeah.

591
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,910
Friendly. It wasn't like bad with
her. It wasn't bad. It was fine.

592
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,990
There was one guy I dated in
college who was super cute,

593
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,800
but there was too much of a
language barrier, language barrier.

594
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,120
He was a Spanish exchange students.
I love them.

595
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:47,940
You know me come on
Puerto Rican Spaniards.

596
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:51,170
I married if I can say Gouda.
Um,

597
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,470
and he was so sweet and so
just kind to me and wonderful,

598
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,870
but he didn't speak enough.
You're a fucking Jody. So chasers.

599
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,730
So I kinda,
I kinda perse we couldn't go.

600
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,310
I just felt like I can't talk to
this person. How weird is that?

601
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:07,390
I can't just hide the, I'm not
a dirty slot. Like you are,

602
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:12,030
you just hook up with every old
strap. This guy from Spain, Barcelona,

603
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,600
he spoke so little you couldn't
even, yeah, it was tough.

604
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:20,490
Like he was his first year here. We
went on a date and I, I liked him.

605
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:24,180
Like I said, his energy was great. He
was sweet, super sweet. But it was,

606
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,190
there was such a barrier culturally too,
like, you know what I mean? We're eh,

607
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:33,920
yeah.
He was sweet.

608
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,590
That's what you would've done to me. No,
he was sweet guy. He's, he stalls. We,

609
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,260
we still, uh, every now and then on
Facebook. Oh Jesus. Really? But through,

610
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,790
through other college friends in
a group of friends. Yeah. Yeah,

611
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:51,690
me too. I have a couple of girls who
I thought were so smug and Hans Suite,

612
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,670
but their language science day,
smoking hot day. It was cute,

613
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:59,840
but he wasn't smoking hot.
You're much your, I still,

614
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,890
you know, check in on it when you die.

615
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,890
It's a college friend.
He became a circle of French for sure.

616
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,870
Is He married now? No, I don't. I
don't even know. I have to ask him.

617
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,690
I'll have to ask him.
Are you married one Jose?

618
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,450
I tried to think of other bad dates.
I mean I feel like they're all bad.

619
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,330
Dates are just terrible.
That's probably why I wasn't a big dater.

620
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,300
I felt I just not good at it.
I don't like it.

621
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:32,410
I have to know the person
and then we then you'd go for

622
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,150
why don't you do it to me?

623
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,590
Huh?
Hey,

624
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,750
thank you.
Earn that one.

625
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,760
You earn that one with your one
Jose emails that nobody knew about.

626
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,760
Nobody knew. You can log into my
Facebook any day and see the big extreme.

627
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,580
Yeah, I had my headphones
off. I can only hear.

628
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,340
Oh Geez. That was good.
That was good fun. Um,

629
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,200
we have a great guests coming up in a
little bit here. And why do you hate me?

630
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,530
Cause it was so nasty.
But you know we have to talk about,

631
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,270
because we were watching some show,

632
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:42,970
we were watching below deck and
I'm not gonna put my headphones on.

633
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,690
I took it off.
I know I'm playing other clips.

634
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,550
Nellie's what other BARF clips line?
No,

635
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,970
I don't think I was born yesterday. So
I don't know your tricks. I promise.

636
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,760
I promise. Nope. We're watching
below deck. Put them back on. Nope.

637
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,240
Cause I don't trust you. I'm not
going to play anymore. That dirty. No.

638
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:09,950
Will you need to put them on dirty Latin
trickster. I'm not going to do a bar.

639
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,360
We swear on our children's eyes.
I want you to say,

640
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:17,770
I swear in our children's eyes. I swear,
I swear I wouldn't say that. I swear.

641
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:23,350
Children, plural. Mother of two of your
children. I just want to, I swear to God,

642
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:26,620
if I hear a fucking Barb said, no,
I'm not playing it. I'm not. I'm not.

643
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,010
We're watching below deck.
Slowly putting him on.

644
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,560
We're watching deck and there's girls,
like,

645
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,980
one of my favorite things you
do is this dumb girls lace.

646
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,390
Well,
there's a face on your stars.

647
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,110
There's a few favorite things
you do. Oh my God. Oh my God.

648
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,500
Oh my God.
Seriously.

649
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,100
Seriously.
Oh my God.

650
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,843
Oh my God.

651
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,440
We have to go get her son soon,
but before we do, oh my God,

652
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:18,180
you guys are so disgusting. Yeah. I
Til I got to put my kids to the, uh,

653
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,790
there's a super flirt guy
who's flirting with all these.

654
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,180
He's flirting with every girl on there
trying to hook up with the garage. And uh,

655
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,480
one of the girls,
one of the girls,

656
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,340
like out of the,
you're the right guy for bed.

657
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,760
And he's like,
why not just that?

658
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,820
Because I lot of bit tried to apply hot
pepper sauce the way by a dotted tries.

659
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:45,260
My mom loves her. I, he
waits, I, his spoils her.

660
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,670
That's what I would look at,
far

661
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,480
a Todd bits about it.
Just like daddy about pretzels.

662
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,880
That's the worst thing you can do is, is
girl, it'd be like, you are a princess.

663
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:58,840
That is the worst.

664
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,520
You're so special that somebody should
treat you exactly the way I treat your

665
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:04,300
mother.
Right.

666
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,300
But people forget that your mother
most likely bore a few of his children.

667
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,470
Yeah. Probably raise those babies.
Took care of the husband for a year.

668
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,510
You guys have been together.

669
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,660
We've been through ups and
downs and licked his bean bag.

670
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,110
Dark does cock for years.
And

671
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,420
what did that

672
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:29,250
when things weren't great.
Yeah. And like, yeah, yeah,

673
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,220
maybe given him a sympathy handy,
you know, three weeks postpartum,

674
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:39,770
still stitches, healing,
milky tits underneath,

675
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:41,950
pull down,

676
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:45,530
maybe throws her husband and bone cause
she knows it's been a long time since

677
00:46:45,531 --> 00:46:49,520
they've, right. So you go like,
hello, this is a, that, that's why,

678
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:52,870
that's why she gets, that's why your
mom is treated so special by your dad.

679
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:57,650
He's like over time. Yeah. The
love grew into a special thing,

680
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,400
right? It's all you should initiate
dating that way. Well, it's first of all,

681
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,390
there's nothing,

682
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,310
there's nothing less attractive than the
girl who leads with the prince ass car.

683
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,660
It's so gross. I went out with a girl one
time out of here, out upon signing up.

684
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,730
This is like, I would have
died. A guy misses lay. I smell.

685
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,840
This is the sound of my voice and
Mrs, uh, like the touch of my head,

686
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:26,130
I thought that's one of the last ships
or bay like told me that a few times.

687
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,350
Yeah, it's attractive. Right? Can I, can
I tell you the problem with women best,

688
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,710
the way I smell this is all about
guys, this is wrong. This is wrong.

689
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,770
The reason women think this way is
because of soap operas and romantic movies

690
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,850
with, uh, you know, what's his name?
Ryan Gosling and all this horse shit.

691
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:47,320
They fill our minds full of nonsense.

692
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,050
It most guys aren't going
to do that for ya know,

693
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,140
and the guys that will are full of
shit. All right. That's the problem.

694
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,700
They're a fucking total FTT.
Our tds total shit run for the hills.

695
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:02,410
If he's goring thumb rings and fucking,
you know, sensitive guy, forget it.

696
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,190
Um, that's true with
the princess girl, man.

697
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:07,810
You're doing your daughter's a disservice.

698
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,350
I told her just be your
own person and yeah,

699
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:15,070
try to find someone that she likes him.
He an equal. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah.

700
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:19,110
You didn't want to be relationships
that are on pedestals. Right.

701
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,200
Cause then she's implying the power
balance should be that I'm on top. Yeah.

702
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,130
And this guy of worships me. Yeah.
It's so weird. It's very weird.

703
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,070
There's also Mike Tyson coming jokes.
We're jumping in.

704
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,200
I did not tell him Mike
Tyson one. Okay. Yeah,

705
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:38,440
I did tell an Oj I was
telling her earlier, well boy,

706
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:43,240
imagine if you went out
with Oj on a date now,

707
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,080
but you didn't necessarily know
everything. No. You do. You kind of know,

708
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:49,510
but you're kind of not.
Yeah. You kind of like a,

709
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,160
you're willing to go out on a date with
them. Yeah. And then he takes you out.

710
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:57,660
You have a good time. Yeah. And then
you started poking out. Good time.

711
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:02,850
You start hooking up and as you orgasm
is like the orgasm of your life.

712
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,390
Yeah. He leans in and whispers in your
ear like, I cut those motherfuckers next.

713
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,233
Yeah.

714
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,980
And then that just makes you come
harder. Yeah. You're cute. You're like,

715
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,610
wow, now can I only be, can I only
listen or watch true crime? To have a,

716
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,520
like a, a massive orgasm sets you
up for a fetish, I guess. Yeah.

717
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:28,280
It looks like you two are Kendra
jokes spirit. I had no idea of. Right.

718
00:49:28,281 --> 00:49:33,160
Do you like murder shows too? Uh, I just
got into evil genius. Oh, it's great.

719
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,100
Okay, so you're into that one. It's
great. Yes, I'm good. I'm excited.

720
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,770
I think it's like I,
I like murder shows and I,

721
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,380
he like gangster shows.

722
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:46,640
I think for the same reason because I
secretly want to be a gangster and a

723
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:50,100
murderer. Oh there you go.
Where it's like, but I'll
never do it cause it's like,

724
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:54,770
you know wrong. It's an escape.
Yeah. Who are you ordering first?

725
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,840
Let's talk about it. I mean I think
you've got to go family members. Oh,

726
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,670
certain family members.
Interesting choice. I agree.

727
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:05,930
Now I'm on board with family.
Yeah, like extended family.

728
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:10,280
But like just those extended family
that whenever their name pops up on your

729
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:14,610
phone you're like, oh, I'm
about to be miserable. Yeah.

730
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,023
That's all really good.

731
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,330
Like that's my whole goal in life is to
be the person that when my name pops up

732
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:26,540
on your phone you don't
go, fuck yes, that's it.

733
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,530
That because we all have those people in
our lives where that person never calls

734
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:32,360
you and goes, hey, just wanted to say,

735
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:36,650
I just saw your work and congratulations
and the life and oh my life.

736
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,790
It's going well, everything's fine.
Like you just have some people in your,

737
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,600
in your world where that is never
the appearance. It's like, all right,

738
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,790
this phone call is going to cost me
a couple thousand dollars, you know,

739
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,020
and it cost me a few days
off my life probably. Yeah.

740
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,340
Just because of the stress
and all that and you know,

741
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:59,270
and it's never just a simple
fix. It's never just like, Hey,

742
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:03,090
uh, I know you have AAA. I don't have
AAA call AAA and get triple. It's,

743
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,530
it's more like, Hey, I'm at
a Pr, I'm going to prison

744
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,630
in Morocco and like,
you can't afford to go to Morocco.

745
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:14,990
I got here long story, uh,
it, you know, it's like,

746
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:19,991
can you go to the State Department
and it's like this huge thing do,

747
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,760
are you good at the blowing off? Yes. Yes.

748
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:27,380
So he didn't get to learn it
though. You're like, you get better.

749
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,940
I'm blowing off family or anyone,
everyone.

750
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,590
I'm teaching my wife
right now because there's,

751
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,560
because she's such an
accommodating Combinator and,

752
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:42,080
and she's such a loving giving
person. Yes. Yes. She's a good person.

753
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,730
She's wants to make everybody happy.

754
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,790
She brought cookies over four cookies
for you in a hole and homemade juice.

755
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:53,690
Yeah. Come on. Homemade juice.
So yeah, apple, ginger, we're
going to clean out your,

756
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:57,890
Colin's great, uh, well
that, that on the show. Yeah.

757
00:51:57,891 --> 00:52:01,550
So like she's a good person who,
whenever crazy family or friends calls up,

758
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:04,040
she's like trying to be very,
she's trying to be very helpful.

759
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,170
It's going to solve the problems.
And I just,

760
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,280
I finally to like sit her
down and be like, no, you can,

761
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,130
you can just not do that. She's
like, yeah, but then they'll,

762
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,350
then they'll not like me. I'm
like, they already don't like you.

763
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,760
They're already just calling you up to
use you for because they know that you're

764
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,600
the helpful one.

765
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,560
So just don't be the helpful one that
that's why I'm so envious of some of the

766
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:27,950
members of my family that
are just complete fuckups
cause it's like no one would

767
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:31,230
ever call them. No one would ever
call him and be like, Hey, uh,

768
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,980
you've been in jail three times in,

769
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,860
in and out of various rehabs
and you may have killed someone.

770
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,620
Could you help me move?
Leggy let, let, let,

771
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:44,030
like no one would ever say that your
family, cause Tom and I, we compare crazy.

772
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:48,740
I've got a lot of alcoholism, mental
illness. We checked those boxes.

773
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,950
I think like, I think like we're playing
like dysfunctional family. Bingo.

774
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,810
Alcoholism. Yes. Mental illness. Yes.

775
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,460
Hoarding. We got, yeah,

776
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:09,280
we got one hoarder. Uh, I think Tom,

777
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:14,180
how does it go if there's pathways?
Oh yeah. Yeah. So level one is like,

778
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:18,680
I like a lot of shit
too.

779
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,510
Um, is like, uh, basically, um, clutter,

780
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,450
a lot of clutter. Trash. Yeah. Nothing

781
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:31,080
is rash starts at three. Okay. So then
it's just trash. If it's like Vcs,

782
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:35,130
Florida ceiling, but there is a
pathway if they leave a place to walk,

783
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,910
I think that's a four. But it's still
like this person is in deep, deep. Right.

784
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,500
But if you need a shovel to get from one
room to another or if like five is like,

785
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,380
there's like, yeah, there's rats
here, but you know, they're nice.

786
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,780
That's level five where they, where
they shit they shit and they're like,

787
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:55,040
there's no plumbing here but, right. But
they also don't see a problem with it.

788
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:58,410
Like someone will be like, did you just
shit like an open bag? And they're like,

789
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,100
where do you feel like they don't even see

790
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,400
live is in the toilet
that no longer works.

791
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,930
And it just piles and piles of selecting
your shit. You're just like, I can't,

792
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,360
I uh, because they don't
have children. They're like,

793
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,980
I created this shit in my body
and I can't get rid of it. Yeah.

794
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,880
There was a few epitopes, map packs and
that's the guy's name. And he called in.

795
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:24,180
We had him on like years and years
ago and I met him, he's a great guy.

796
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:28,770
And we were talking about the level fives
and there was a couple episodes where

797
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,610
there's a few times where he was like,
this is not salvageable.

798
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,880
And one of them was so bad that the whole
episode was just to get the person out

799
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:43,650
of the house. Yeah. The convince him to
leave and then they burned the house down.

800
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,470
They turned it.

801
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,200
Sometimes that's the only solution is
you just come in with a blow torch and a

802
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:52,770
bulldozer and you guys like,
cause what are you saving?

803
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,780
What slice of them you're saving
important stuff. Like I need that.

804
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,820
I need my nose hair from 1987 and helps
them and all they do is find a new home.

805
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,780
Yeah, I know exactly the same. Yeah.

806
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,310
I like how five they would always,

807
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,690
they would always tie together on
that and also on like 600 pound shit.

808
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,970
They'd be like, they'd be like,
you know, like either like I like,

809
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,810
I just even like his food tastes good.
They're like,

810
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,740
when did you start gaining weight?
They're like, when my dad died and did,

811
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,760
is that when you like start eating
a lot more than they're like,

812
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,920
and then they're like, do you think
it's probably related? And they're like,

813
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,430
I don't know. Yeah. And the same thing
with the hoarders. They'll be like,

814
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:34,560
my wife left me in 1973 and they're like,

815
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:39,630
when did you start hoarding 74 and
now nothing will ever leave me again.

816
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:44,660
I have my house of everything.
Yeah, a lot of trouble. God,

817
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,320
they should just have it because like
all those shows are like on the learning

818
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,330
channel or discovery channel or something.

819
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,060
They should just have a
shot in Freud channel.

820
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,650
That's all the fucked up people in this
world where where we can go and go,

821
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:02,840
okay, I'm not that bad. Of course.
That's why we watch all the top

822
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,850
age gap, age gap. Love his girl.
I seen that. I haven't seen it.

823
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:11,430
That's on Netflix but just
the title of it and I'm man,

824
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,820
it's like I'm 60 she's 19 great man.

825
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,240
I'm always curious about
that. You mentioned was that
too right? Was like I'm not,

826
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,820
I don't drink a lot cause like
the whole age gap love thing.

827
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,590
I was once.

828
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:31,770
The youngest woman I ever dated was 20
years old and I was 29 and I dated her

829
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:37,291
for like two dates and I ended it when
she didn't know who Johnny Cash was like

830
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:40,030
literally didn't know.
You know there was a walk the line movie.

831
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:44,140
I'm not even expecting you to
start. Yeah, like she's like, Ooh,

832
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,820
now I can't.
That's his damn girl.

833
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,410
You guys have a conversation with

834
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,690
their friends.

835
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,350
I just think the threat of the prints
that I don't want to print that. That's,

836
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:09,750
that's a little pretentious but I feel
like a print that I identify as a print.

837
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:15,690
That's the same way Bruce Jenner said
as a woman, but he's not really buddy.

838
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,373
I'm a print that.

839
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,720
I just want to find a guy

840
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,810
like weekends or whether you would
sleep before it's got burned out.

841
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,570
We jumped over, we jumped over
it. Whereas we have an intro.

842
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,550
We jumped over.
Our dental

843
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:41,130
dental update is brought to you by get
quip.com and we are going to ask our

844
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:46,740
guests, Brad Williams, like a horror
movie and hip hop. That's awesome.

845
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,900
Love that. Brad, do you have
a nice smile? Thank you.

846
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,960
Let me take care of your terrorists who
they're perfect. They're really nice.

847
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,900
Braces. Gotta love it. Do you do
general upkeep pretty well? Yeah.

848
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,610
Uh, yeah, I do general upkeep. And uh,

849
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,830
you happened to go to the dentist every
six months. You really do it. Yeah.

850
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,710
Not everyone does that.

851
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,510
It's weird because your normal is what
you perceive everyone else's normal to be.

852
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,480
And when I find out that people don't
go to the dentist every six months,

853
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:18,240
I'm like, wrong with you? Like
my mouth is fine. I'm like, oh,

854
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,520
and it's preventative.
Yeah. My friend just, uh,

855
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,970
took his daughter to the
dentist and she had 16 cavities,

856
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,150
16 and I'm like,
what?

857
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,940
How does it like we might be dealing
with a possibly unethical Dennis.

858
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:41,600
Oh really? They're like,
ah, you have 194 cavities.

859
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,830
This is a joke because it's true.
But I'm gonna tell you the joke though.

860
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,390
So I told the story about
how many years ago out here.

861
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,560
I went to the dentist and I
did go a celebrity dentist.

862
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,960
I was working for the show,
extreme makeover,

863
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,500
and they were giving this deal out for
whitening. So we, a lot of us went there.

864
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,480
And during the general exam,

865
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:06,190
the dentists' not the celebrity dentist
we had of his trainees. Sure. It goes,

866
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:08,560
well, you know, let's just do a general
exam. And then he goes, you know,

867
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:12,490
you have 13 cavities, I have
13 cavities. He's like, yeah,

868
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:15,160
do you want to get them filled? And
I'm like, well, I don't know man.

869
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:19,880
This is kind of a lot to take
in right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

870
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,420
They're like, it'll be like $5,600. You
just want to just take it right. I'm like,

871
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,890
what? Just yeah, and I might be a PA,
I don't know man. Yeah. So I was like,

872
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:29,900
just let me fucking think about it.

873
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:33,760
And so I go to another
dentist and he's like, uh,

874
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,760
you don't have any cavities. And I'm
like, what do you mean? He's like, dude,

875
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:39,220
you remember tell you that
was full of Shit. So yeah.

876
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,130
Is this whole thing like I
have a similar story, but yeah,

877
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,360
six months later she was like,

878
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:47,930
you know what happened the one time I
went to the dentist and there's like you

879
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:50,810
have 13 cavities. And then I went to
another dentist and he was like, no,

880
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:53,480
you didn't get it. And I'm like,
that's my story is what happened to me.

881
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,220
I won't tell you what happened to me know.

882
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,260
Cause I had dental insurance for the first
time. I lied. My friend Eric, he will,

883
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,460
he will uh, backup my story. I
want Eric to weigh in on this.

884
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,110
He will weigh in on this.
I went,

885
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,850
cause I had dental insurance and I
went to some scumbag who was like,

886
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,350
you have like, uh, a lot of cavities.

887
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,500
And then I went to my Hungarian
dentist and the valley, there you go.

888
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,400
Who's now retired? He again,
I could waste on boss.

889
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,880
And he said this guy, he's a
fucking liar. You're a scumbag

890
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,610
necrotic guide. You have no
cavities. This is bullshit.

891
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,070
Isn't that it isn't an amazing,
uh,

892
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,460
I once saw a doctor that was supposedly
like a specialist for dwarfs cause we a

893
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:41,360
little people often have
like respiratory problems.

894
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:44,770
It just kind of were like
pugs. Yeah. You know, kind of

895
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,623
we can't breathe.

896
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:52,640
So I knew that I wouldn't see
this doctor and he goes like, he,

897
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:55,730
and this is back when I was
like 10 and he goes like,

898
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,180
oh you have like severe
like respiratory problems.

899
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:02,600
Like we need to like prep you for
surgery like in that like in the next two

900
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:07,000
weeks. Right. Or else you
could die in your sleep any.

901
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,890
And he's saying this to my mom and
my mom's like freaking out and she,

902
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:15,620
she calls my dad and my dad's like,
oh hold on I gotta friend one second.

903
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,260
We go, we go and we see the
friend who's also an ear,

904
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:22,040
nose and throat doctor and he just looks
and goes, you're, you're, you're fine.

905
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:22,903
I don't know what the fuck.

906
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,980
And like we were like prepped for
surgery like the next week and it's like,

907
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,910
what would he have done?
Just cut my throat and look
it and go, Nah, we're good.

908
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:37,370
Charge him like is that there's people
out there that can do the dental world.

909
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,480
It's much more common. Yeah. But this kind
of shit, that sounds quite terrifying.

910
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:44,540
Yeah. That's like a whole like,
Brad needs a lung transplant.

911
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,430
We're going to have to do it today.

912
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:50,900
He's saying things that you can't even
have a, he needs a new frontal lobe.

913
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,560
We that that's the cause
of the dwarfism because

914
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:58,780
bad frontal lobe. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
So if you just make that the cash,

915
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:02,810
are you guys ready? Ready to do it?
Let's do it. We're ready. God scumbag.

916
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,060
That's crazy. Um, yeah,

917
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:07,960
but you have nice teeth and keep them.

918
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:13,870
So you have raised as any weird
dental things. Yeah. I had said

919
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,280
I didn't lose my baby
teeth for the longest time,

920
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:21,281
so they had to pull 12 teeth at once or
a lot of little people jokes associated

921
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:24,120
with it.
I haven't even

922
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,600
lost the, I didn't lose my baby
teeth or as I call them teeth.

923
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:33,600
Yeah.

924
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,720
So they had to yank all them at once
and they give me a lot of laughing gas.

925
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:38,543
Yeah.

926
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,600
Remember how old you were or
this was basically between
the ages of Eight and 12?

927
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:46,260
I had a lot of dentists, Rama. Oh, do you
did have a lot of dental issues. Yeah.

928
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:50,070
Yeah. Yeah. And then that is common.
Uh, not for dwarves just for me,

929
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:52,890
but if you will. But if you look in my
dad's mouth, you're like, yeah, I get it.

930
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,000
Does he have dad enough? He's got like,
oh, like he looks like one of those,

931
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,880
he looks like the part of the
bugs bunny sketch. We're bugs,

932
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:03,750
throws a grenade into his mouth and like
shuts his mouth and then just real like,

933
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:06,900
yeah, that's what his mouth looks like.
I'll fuck up. Yeah. Just all fucked up.

934
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,250
But like they're all there, but they're
all at different angles. Wow. You know,

935
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:15,000
and he's never addressed it now.
Yeah. Yeah. Why would you do that?

936
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,400
I was saying that because
we talk about bad mouth,

937
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,670
like just how like if you think
about your dad, dad's in general.

938
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,970
I'm talking about like Dads,
people our age. You're never like,

939
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:28,440
oh he's got a really nice
mouth kind of stick. Yeah.

940
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:31,850
I mean I'll run, I'll see my dad
just be like, Hey, oh you know,

941
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,850
he's visiting and meet you for lunch.
And then I'll just walk up to him,

942
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:38,100
give him a hug and I'm like, have you
brushed your teeth today? He's like, yeah.

943
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:43,170
I'm like, it's most terrible. He's like,
really? Are you serious? I was like,

944
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:47,700
yeah, I go dude, eat a mint. Eat something
too. Yeah. Just to be at least his mouth,

945
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,680
his mouth, dry mouth all the time. Like,
yeah, like what your morning mouth is.

946
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:56,940
Yeah, it is true. I think. I think they've
just gotten the full, don't give a fuck.

947
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,510
That's true. Full cause you see that
with like clothes. Yeah. You know,

948
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,810
it's like are you, you'd be like, are
you wearing that outfit? He's like, yeah,

949
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:08,610
why I don't care. No one's touching
his dick. It is about Dick Touches.

950
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,630
Definitely. Yeah. If you're trying
to get someone in touch your Dick,

951
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:17,190
your standard of fashion high chain,
everything is way higher.

952
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:22,110
Once you're totally tapped out.
Why would I do anything?

953
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,230
Offer these dictations right
now.

954
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:27,930
Speaking of Dick touches forest.
Okay.

955
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:32,040
We're talking about whether or not it's
unethical to sleep with somebody who's

956
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:35,640
not on your mental level. And we're
like, well, at a certain point,

957
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:40,410
obviously it's like you would have
well, judgment, intellectual skills,

958
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,830
right. Mentally retarded. Right. Okay.

959
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:48,630
Cause like all right, because I'm trying
to think of like not Forrest Gump, but,

960
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,140
uh, not Slingblade what was, uh,

961
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:54,720
what she did a it,

962
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,430
the movie was called the other
sister Juliet Lewis. Yes. Her.

963
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:03,660
And in that movie, so she was
like, yeah, she was when she was

964
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,300
Juliette Lewis and the other sister
plays like a mentally challenged woman.

965
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:13,590
Right. But she's not fully,
she's not like life goes on.

966
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:17,770
Right. And then what's it
called? The other sister. Yeah.

967
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,480
So I, I think if you are in that
spectrum, yeah. Cool, cool. You know?

968
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:27,040
But once you get to the point where
it's like a w w it's like drool once for

969
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:31,630
yes, like you know what I mean?
Like once you get to that level,

970
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:35,520
it's like that. All right. Now what
about, what about Forrest Gump?

971
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:39,730
Was Jenny ethical or unethical?
I think I,

972
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,350
I think Jenny was fine.
Yeah. Funny Lawn. The level.

973
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:49,270
But, but he's sweet and sincere
and genuine love for this woman.

974
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:53,380
Now you could almost say that she was
unethical because he loved her so much.

975
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:55,420
Not the actual physical part of it,

976
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:59,980
but because it's like you could take
advantage of him. She did black.

977
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,240
I'm saying though,
is that unethical?

978
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:06,650
It's like I don't think in that
situation it was, I think like in that,

979
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,090
and that's the thing,
there's a there, there,

980
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:12,970
there's a spectrum and where are you
on that spectrum and it, like I said,

981
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:17,150
if it's, if, if, if I don't
even know what that was.

982
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,390
That was from the of the other sister.
Oh,

983
01:06:19,391 --> 01:06:24,190
that was a Giovanni Ribisi who
plays the boyfriend whose movie,

984
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,970
I mean, come on. It's mentally
challenged. People fucking,

985
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,590
and it's a movie.
Is this a,

986
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:38,350
is that a song? Yeah. Shit.
Oh, that's savage garden.

987
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:45,850
Yeah. That, yeah,

988
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,540
it goes, yeah. Just like,

989
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:53,903
yeah.

990
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:01,240
I mean she's Kinda nice voice. She
seems off. Would you fuck this guy?

991
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:07,210
I mean that's, yeah. Is that
wrong? Well, he's creepy.

992
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,980
Creepy, creepy thing. Serves
me more than the mental acumen.

993
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:16,380
The guy just sounds like he'd be like,
Hey, want to get in that van? I got some,

994
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,490
I got some duct tape for you.

995
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,700
Sit down and watch episodes of
2020 together. He's been not,

996
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,940
this guy would not be giving you
neck kisses. No, that's just,

997
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,030
that's like a Lenny of
from of mice and men like,

998
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,100
just think he's going to fuck
the back out of something

999
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,780
floats out.

1000
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,850
Now is it politically incorrect for actors
to play mentally challenged or are we

1001
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:45,030
done with that? We'll see. And now, uh,

1002
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:48,490
there was just this article as
we're recording this where someone,

1003
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,640
someone got in trouble
today because they're,

1004
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,630
they're getting cast to play a gay
person and they're not gay boy. Right.

1005
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:57,890
And I'm thinking like, all
right, big thing with like trans,

1006
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:01,270
you can't put your eyes with the scarlet
Johannson thing. Yeah. She tapped out.

1007
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,730
Yeah. It's like, I get that. All right.

1008
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:08,470
When John Wayne was playing gangas con,
that was fucked up.

1009
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,320
All right. When he was like,
oh, we're gonna go over there,

1010
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:15,130
I'd get some Hmong goals. Like, yeah.
All right. That's, that's wrong.

1011
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:18,620
When a w was,
was it Mickey Rooney or Andy Rooney?

1012
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,500
I think Mickey Rooney Wa wa one of
the Rooney guys. The, uh, he, he,

1013
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,870
he played a Chinese person in,
I think it was 16 candles. No,

1014
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:31,790
it was a breakfast at activities. Right.
It was her, that was print that's off.

1015
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:36,770
That was horrific. And he did it
with buck teeth in and the glasses.

1016
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:40,050
Yeah. That was the me. So sorry.
That's where that came from.

1017
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:45,280
Is that packed the cataract
cataract? Oh yes. Yeah,

1018
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,900
that's bad. But like, but
back then they were like,

1019
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:52,460
this is one of the best
comedic, but you're like, this
is fantastic. Well, I mean,

1020
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,380
yeah. Yeah. Some movies don't hold up.
You know, Dumbo is a prime example.

1021
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:01,880
But like, yeah. Some words.
Yeah. So like, yeah, that is,

1022
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:03,950
that is completely egregious.

1023
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:08,000
But when you have people like it's
called acting, you're, you're,

1024
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:10,310
you're playing someone,
you're not. So now like,

1025
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:14,360
are we only allowed to have
people that are like, oh,

1026
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:17,450
well he's an accountant. While you
can't get a fake accountant, right.

1027
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,930
Uni How dare you not use an actual account
and there's real accounts out there

1028
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:23,180
that could use that part. No. It's acting

1029
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:27,050
bullshit. Part of, yeah. To, to me
of like the scarlet Johannson thing,

1030
01:09:27,051 --> 01:09:27,640
which what happened,

1031
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,020
but I don't know what happened through
Hanson signed on to play this. Um,

1032
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:36,070
I think it's based on a real story. Yeah.
About, so a trans person, right? Yeah.

1033
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:40,160
And so there was this huge
backlash like, hm. Um, you're,

1034
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:44,600
you're using a cisgender woman
to play this transport. Yeah.

1035
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,430
There are plenty of trans women out there,

1036
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:51,410
but here's my big beef with this addition.
There's a fucking fly here.

1037
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:55,500
Yeah. Additionally, to the, let's
say, well, why can't, I mean,

1038
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:57,410
it's like Brad saying it's an actor.

1039
01:09:57,411 --> 01:10:00,410
So I get why you're saying get
the authentic person to play it.

1040
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:05,530
How about the business side of this
where people buy tickets to see scarlet

1041
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:08,570
Johansson,
guess what?

1042
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:13,700
There is not somebody
currently in the Trans Space.

1043
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:18,560
Right. Who is as big of a draw as Scott
and I know you, the argument can be, well,

1044
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,830
a good movies, a good
movie and, and like, yeah,

1045
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,270
they just need more
opportunities like this. Okay.

1046
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:28,100
But the people who want to make this
movie, right. Our bedding on, hey,

1047
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:31,080
if we can have a movie
star plays a apart exactly.

1048
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,600
Can Recoup this investment. Yeah.
You can have this hot, gorgeous,

1049
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:39,950
big titted beast playing right. This part.
Right. And who I would love to see her

1050
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,300
play a trans. Yeah. That'd be
so interesting to some degree.

1051
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:48,620
Even some people were getting mad at the
Rock in that, uh, tower tower movie did.

1052
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,240
Yeah. Because it wasn't because he
had one leg, he, he, he, it's like,

1053
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:54,350
and somebody's like, well, you what?

1054
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,610
You couldn't find an actor who
actually has one leg. It's like, no,

1055
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,290
but not the rock.

1056
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:04,850
The Rock is the most bankable
movie star on the planet right now.

1057
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,260
This movie would not have fun debuted
the way it did. And by the way,

1058
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,410
if you're a person, and like I'll, I'll
say this from my perspective, okay.

1059
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,500
Because yeah, there's been
times when, uh, uh, all right,

1060
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:19,950
the guy who played the dwarf in
the Lord of the Rings, not a dwarf,

1061
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:25,140
all the dwarves in snow white
and the huntsmen not tours.
All right. They got, uh,

1062
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,110
you know, uh, they did on the very,
the most recent, uh, Willy Wonka,

1063
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:32,430
the chocolate factory, the one with
Johnny Depp deep. Roy is a dwarf,

1064
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:34,200
but they just clone him a bunch of times.

1065
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:36,270
And rather than using other
dwarf factors, it's like, yeah,

1066
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,220
I would have an opportunity
to be mad about that.

1067
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:42,270
But if you told me right now that like
Chris Hemsworth was playing a dwarf,

1068
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:46,650
I'd be like, awesome. Yeah, that's a
great representation for my people.

1069
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,990
So like the rock, it's like, yeah,

1070
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:53,190
if I wanted a representation of the people
with prosthetics who wouldn't want to

1071
01:11:53,191 --> 01:11:55,950
go for the rock because the,
uh,

1072
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,350
because the people who are missing limbs,

1073
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:02,190
the only famous one we know about
you right now is Oscar Pistorius.

1074
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:06,270
He killed his wife or his girlfriend
or whatever the fuck. So that's,

1075
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,230
that's what we have that's in our
minds about you. So why not Iraq

1076
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:16,150
and their defense? A lot of, uh, people
who were, um, uh, what are you missing?

1077
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:16,984
Limbs

1078
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,890
were super supportive of that movie
because I saw a couple of things and they

1079
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:24,680
were like, oh, it's awesome. And the
Rock's awesome. Like representing us. Yes.

1080
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:28,050
But of course people want to get
mad about everything anyways.

1081
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,840
I think now people have this
sort of thing where, and, and,

1082
01:12:31,841 --> 01:12:35,590
and I hate it because there are people
that have legit causes to be angry,

1083
01:12:35,591 --> 01:12:38,050
to be upset, to be offended. And I think,

1084
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,590
but right now there's some sort of weird
group mentality where if you aren't

1085
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:45,310
offended by something, you
feel like you're not included.
You're like, oh my God,

1086
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,810
I'm not poor.
I'm not part of the cool kids.

1087
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,820
All the cool kids are
getting mad about this thing.

1088
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:53,350
I should be mad about this thing.
Or You're searching for your thing,

1089
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,340
whatever that is.

1090
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:57,550
And it's like just or you could have
a coconut smile and shut the fuck up.

1091
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,550
It's a group think thing to get onboard
and people aren't really thinking. No,

1092
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,760
they just, they just want to be offended
for the sake of being offended. So lame.

1093
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,450
Speaking of your, uh, I could advice
them both mega history, your tribe.

1094
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:15,760
Do you know that, uh, Hungary
has abolished gender studies.

1095
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:22,090
Can I mention my tribe is
the most sympathetic to
everybody in the beginning of

1096
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:22,923
the week,

1097
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:28,240
24 hours from the Ministry of human
capacities and the Ministry of Justice to

1098
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:29,590
comment on a proposed amendment,

1099
01:13:29,591 --> 01:13:33,370
which declares that no gender study
courses can be launched in the future.

1100
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:39,160
All right. Wow. You know, so some people
sound he'll move forward and there's like,

1101
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:42,240
no, no, thank you. [inaudible] Shit.

1102
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:46,900
You don't want this bullshit. It's
an, an ideology, not a science.

1103
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:50,470
So they're going to do away with
it. All right. You know what?

1104
01:13:50,471 --> 01:13:54,430
I will say in defense of my people,
they don't like what they don't like.

1105
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:59,230
They don't want it and get the
fuck out. Jews, Jews, Albanians,

1106
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:00,100
Gypsies.

1107
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,750
I love that you led with juice.
That's like we killed him and they,

1108
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:12,520
they reelected a guy who
had a openly antisemitic

1109
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,040
blah like, right. He's
like, they're a problem.

1110
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:21,430
A lot of people are hungry or like this
guy, it makes less sense. I mean Jews,

1111
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:23,700
right? I mean, yeah. Yeah.

1112
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,280
Like we can't really talk shit in America
with our current situation. But yeah,

1113
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:31,390
I guess what I'm saying, at least the
Hungarians are open about being, you know,

1114
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,750
racist and wanting to keep
everything the way they like it. Hey,

1115
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:35,584
you know what though,

1116
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:40,420
I'm a fan and this is the thing that uh,

1117
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,530
when someone takes this next statement
out of context, this will end my career.

1118
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:52,590
I'm a fan of someone overtly being a
racist just because then it's like,

1119
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,150
oh,
your races suck.

1120
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:59,770
I should avoid you where
your clan robes everywhere.

1121
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:02,710
So I can be like, oh, not talking to you.

1122
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,090
The worst is when you talk with someone
and you gel with somebody and you're

1123
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:09,400
friends with someone. They're like,
oh my God, this is a great person.

1124
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,180
And then they slip in the
comment where the where they're
like, yeah, I mean, yeah,

1125
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:14,830
it's great that we get to hang out here,

1126
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:17,320
but this place really gone to shit
since I started letting the blacks,

1127
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:21,910
and that's when you go, oh,
did not know that about you.

1128
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,680
And now you're shocked. Like,
no, I'm a fan. If you're,
if you're a fucking racist,

1129
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,330
be a racist all the time so we
can all just be like, oh, okay,

1130
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,590
so be open. Yeah. So don't live in
Hungary. That's the point. Yeah.

1131
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,420
Do that. You know? It's
like the people were like,

1132
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:43,030
he won't make me a cake for a gay wedding.
It's like,

1133
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,360
is that the only baker and how there,
there's other bakers.

1134
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,550
If someone was like, I'm not making a
cake for your midget wedding, I'd be like,

1135
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:51,911
okay,

1136
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:56,911
I don't want to give you money right
now is let me give you money fighting to

1137
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,350
give the risk of money.

1138
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,250
Let's change the outside.
It's like,

1139
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:09,780
you're never going to stop
bullying going stop racism. Never.

1140
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,110
It's like trying to stop the wind.

1141
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,450
People are fucking crazy
and dump this world because,

1142
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:20,830
because before we had Mexicans and
blacks, we hated the Irish. Oh,

1143
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:24,340
that's true. And it's like, how
would like the Irish, he's like,

1144
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:29,050
we all hear the Irish at one point where
they're like, ah, fucking my hoolahan.

1145
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,260
He's the reason why I'm not
successful in life. So like, we'll,

1146
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:35,440
we'll find a way there.
There's dwarves, no joke.

1147
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:38,770
There's dwarves that hate other dwarves.
What's that all about?

1148
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:43,590
Why do they hate the fuck if I know,
like they're, oh my God. But it's like,

1149
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:46,120
they're like,
what are they saying?

1150
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:50,290
It's just like their type of
dwarfism is like, like fucked up.

1151
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:51,520
Or like they,

1152
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,120
they shouldn't receive the benefits
of certain things because they're, uh,

1153
01:16:55,270 --> 01:17:00,200
because they're, uh, uh, healthier
dwarf. So it's like, oh, we need, like,

1154
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:04,810
we need, we need funding. We need
attention because we're so fucked up.

1155
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,830
He has hypoplasia, uh, he's not
very fucked up, so he get anything,

1156
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,870
like it's that kind of shit.
That's nice.

1157
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:16,170
Right? Yeah. So it's like, you're never
going to stop this. I know you can never,

1158
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,033
you can't

1159
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,650
do you accept that the world is full of
assholes and people that just want to

1160
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:24,770
complain about everything. Actually have
an example of one right here. Okay. Uh,

1161
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,550
this,
uh,

1162
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,850
well I'll just play a moment for it
for you and then we can talk about it.

1163
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,713
All right.

1164
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,360
Whichever your chicken.

1165
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,900
Okay, wait. So here's the
setup. Okay. I heard rape. It's,

1166
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:50,930
this is a at cafe gratitude.

1167
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:55,931
These are animal rights activists
that are basically all three of them.

1168
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:02,270
Yeah. So they're talking about
the fact that would many paper,

1169
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,300
so many paper that their case credit,

1170
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,930
artificial insemination
of livestock is rape. No.

1171
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Something that cafe gratitude the Vegan
cafe owners are doing on their private

1172
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:19,190
farm in Hawaii. So this is
like the setup here. Okay.

1173
01:18:19,191 --> 01:18:24,191
How good is your life that
you have to be like out of it

1174
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,290
all?
You know,

1175
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:29,980
we got vets that can't get the
correct mental health care.

1176
01:18:29,981 --> 01:18:33,100
We got a written racist things going on.

1177
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:36,760
We've got genocides going on in other
parts of the world and you're like, Eh,

1178
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,370
I think all, I think artificially
inseminating cows, that's my hill.

1179
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:44,260
That's what I'm dying on is I want
to find something, man. It's so,

1180
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:49,830
I would love for these protesters to hang
out with someone like the black lives

1181
01:18:51,461 --> 01:18:56,200
matter protesters and just compare story.
Anything else or anything else?

1182
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,060
Just like, oh, you're here because you
want more funding for cystic fibrosis.

1183
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,730
That's nice. You want to know
what they're doing to cows?

1184
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,640
They're artificially inseminate.
They're raping them.

1185
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,640
How's these psychos?

1186
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:14,560
These three cycles are elitist is off
going. That ain't, that ain't right.

1187
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,870
I'll show you a raven, a cow. I,

1188
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:19,960
these three fuckers are,

1189
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,500
oh,
I protest.

1190
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,920
They have a megaphone and they're
yelling at cafe gratitude about,

1191
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,090
uh, they're, they're saying, you
know, uh, any tight, what does it,

1192
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:36,410
rape is not love. You
can't compassionately raped
someone as they say that,

1193
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:40,790
that guy walking the dog.
Yeah. Says Mike Tyson did.

1194
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:46,040
And then, then he said Coby
Bryant did. And then he goes,

1195
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:51,170
uh, to somebody else I think are
maybe the camera guy says, show him,

1196
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,060
you know, he says, show him your
chicken. I Dunno, he's saw it,

1197
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:55,260
but here's the whole thing again.
And then it goes on.

1198
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:07,980
Great.
Show me your

1199
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,310
chicken is shown here to say,
oh,

1200
01:20:12,311 --> 01:20:16,200
and there's a woman that cow suit
tell Matt talking about with this.

1201
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,850
But here it continues.
It continues.

1202
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,370
She's still on the magazine.

1203
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,330
Wonderful. Sarah Silverman
had a few good [inaudible],

1204
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:36,770
some dandies lot of female
comics. Actually plenty of
grey rape jokes out there.

1205
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,380
There's some solid ones.
You guys a pretty good one.

1206
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,013
Funny.

1207
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:47,950
I mean for just a pedestrian walking by
protest those solids pretty good. Yeah.

1208
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:48,893
And

1209
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,100
she says

1210
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,730
rate my six foot 200.

1211
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:06,580
How much were ridiculous?
Could this be,

1212
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:12,250
does it go on? You know, and I know
where this calf is. This in Santa Monica,

1213
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,820
I think of Venice. Do you know what that
is? It's like blocks from the beach.

1214
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:20,050
It's a nice day. The Sun Shining and
she's doing this. You're like, this guy,

1215
01:21:20,051 --> 01:21:21,670
he just got off your bike or something.

1216
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:25,240
We'll go have lunch and then someone's
on a megaphone. I tried to rape me,

1217
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:31,830
go to the beach lady,
hold off here.

1218
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:32,860
Here's why.

1219
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:37,890
Here's one of the people who I blame and
in these situations is the boyfriend or

1220
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:44,941
spouse or whoever of these women who win.

1221
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:49,600
Because if my wife came to me and
said, oh, I'm going to go protest that,

1222
01:21:49,601 --> 01:21:54,040
I'd be like, oh, like, cool.
What? Um, what are you protesting?

1223
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:58,430
Did you know if they're
artificially inseminating
cows and that's rape and they,

1224
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:02,410
I mean, I'd be like, yeah, you're not
going outside today. You're, you're, no,

1225
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:07,080
just stay in bed. Let's just Netflix and
chill today. Let's go get some cookies.

1226
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:11,590
I always talk about like if I
started grief dancing or wearing

1227
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,070
these behaviors, I'd be like, would
you leave me? And he's like, of course.

1228
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:21,070
So that's crazy. That's literally,
that's literally why that is.

1229
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:24,260
Have a spouse love is aware of
that. They can check you. Yeah.

1230
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:28,510
My wife has checked me many
times. I'm like, you're not
wearing that. That's dumb.

1231
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,630
That's a minimum level. Yes.
That's, that's bare minimum.

1232
01:22:31,631 --> 01:22:34,000
Not like a belief system where it's like,
yeah,

1233
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:38,230
I'm going to spend a gorgeous day
in Venice protesting the artificial

1234
01:22:38,231 --> 01:22:42,370
insemination. You can
cafe. It's a Vegan cafe.

1235
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,350
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

1236
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,383
Right?

1237
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:57,490
Women's sounds like Vince Mcmahon.
Danielle, Josh, Mike. All right.

1238
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,540
Joe Hayes cut up Sheoak

1239
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,570
I want that to be my,
so

1240
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:07,743
Jeff,

1241
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:14,740
that's another thing too with
these social justice warriors.

1242
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:18,190
It's like she's taking it out a
car. Like, do you know what I mean?

1243
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:21,520
Like you say rape was good.
No. You saying like, Hey,

1244
01:23:21,521 --> 01:23:26,520
fucking actual rapes were committed
and you're not mad about those. Yeah.

1245
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:31,690
You're mad about the cow, the fake cow
rape. He's making kind of a dad joke.

1246
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:35,440
Yeah. And it was like, I mean
it's not whatever. It's not great,

1247
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:40,090
but it's not good for like for like
a non comedian who just walked by.

1248
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,360
He's like, yeah, that'd be bride
dead. And they still are you?

1249
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:47,900
Everyone's still cooking careers.
Yeah. In the public eye problems there.

1250
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:53,290
I know, I know. It is. Hey Stan, a funny
about what gets take like people who get,

1251
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,790
um, you know, career's
taken down now. Yeah.

1252
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:01,430
For like jokes and they're like, no. Coby
Bryan. Yes. Settled a rape charge. Right.

1253
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,130
Mike Tyson went to jail
for raping someone. Yeah.

1254
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:10,840
Legitimately and be more like, uh,
yeah, but yeah. Yeah, but they,

1255
01:24:10,841 --> 01:24:14,680
they paid their debt to society.
True. But as these, and sorry,

1256
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,350
he's going down the road.
Fuck some girl.

1257
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,090
His fingers all that's right.
God,

1258
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:25,630
that's the most embarrassing part of that
whole thing. Total list of the throat.

1259
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:29,860
Fucking yeah. It's,
it's weird what you're,

1260
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:34,870
what you're choosing to take down.
Yeah. It's arbitrary and that,

1261
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:38,320
and that's what I mean is that, is
there, is there, there's many legitimate,

1262
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,800
horrific things that are happening
in this world that we should shine a

1263
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:46,030
spotlight on and should work to fix.
And then there's this,

1264
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,630
I think because there's some stuff
that's just take downable like he is,

1265
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:53,500
he's on sorry thing. It's like that's
it. That's an attainable shaming goal.

1266
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:56,530
Whereas like the Mike Tyson
and the Colby, right? Like,

1267
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,720
you're not going to do shit,
lady, you're protest. Why?

1268
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,670
Because Colby could still make
a, make a three. There you go.

1269
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,880
There's too much money. And somebody was
saying, you know the make you cum guy.

1270
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:11,720
Yeah, I'll make you come. Yeah.
How can I forget? Oh wait, no,

1271
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,480
this story and I love that guy.

1272
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,220
What
does that,

1273
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:25,110
what's the context of this video where he,

1274
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:25,751
first of all,

1275
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:30,670
he really does a nice job of framing
himself out and he posted these kinds of,

1276
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:34,310
gets a little bit dog refer at least.
Yeah. He could post these guns on sound.

1277
01:25:34,311 --> 01:25:37,270
Now that's what these guys like
post a daily video where you,

1278
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:39,640
I'd like to have some pussy,
my face

1279
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,900
and then talks about how
good of a lover he is.

1280
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:48,130
And so we found like a barrage
of his videos like this is

1281
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,820
to have a woman in my home.

1282
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:58,960
What's he watching? I'm trying to
like, oh, that's Rachel Maddow. Oh No.

1283
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,440
They get their salary.
He's mad.

1284
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:03,130
Oops.
They don't care about their partner.

1285
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:08,690
So he's like, um, I'm not like that.
Um, see, this is when I see this,

1286
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,310
that's when I'm like, yeah,
minority report had it right.

1287
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,820
We should just be sending the van
to his house and be like, yeah,

1288
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:21,320
we're picking you up. I haven't
done anything. You will.
You will. You're going to,

1289
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,400
you're going to do some shit.
What? And we're like, yeah,

1290
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:29,690
we're like 99.9% sure you're
going to do something.

1291
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,700
It's kind of creepy.

1292
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,250
I even went and Beaumont

1293
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,470
before I, before I went boom, boom. Yeah,

1294
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,380
I doubt it's a boom before.

1295
01:26:46,381 --> 01:26:51,100
Is that the tactic to get the ladies?
Absolutely. I just walked up to him again.

1296
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:52,610
I make it

1297
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:58,250
a lot before I'd go really
just peaked around throat.

1298
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:03,840
I have that effect on then a lot of these,
okay.

1299
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,670
All the same.
Took his teeth out for this one.

1300
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:11,770
Have yet. There should be somebody
out there wants to her cup crisper.

1301
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,340
I wish I could pop me a rich woman
harder or younger or whatever.

1302
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:22,280
Older, younger, whatever. I hope older
because looking at him you're like, yeah,

1303
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:23,114
you don't deserve

1304
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:30,790
to have anybody. He won't always got
a goatee. Now he really wants you.

1305
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:35,930
Can I get a soul patch for the next one?
Somebody wrote in,

1306
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,840
I was watching the, Oh,
I'll make you a calm guy.

1307
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,690
And I noticed his nose and
how it's crooked as it goes
towards the right side of

1308
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:46,460
his face.
Clearly it's been broken.

1309
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,540
I like to think it's been broken from
him talking this way to women in public

1310
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,560
and the women or her hot black
guy that fucks and fucks good.

1311
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,180
Decided to smack him around.

1312
01:27:56,570 --> 01:28:00,430
And this might be why he says
things to his camera now, Nolan.

1313
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,810
Yeah, I mean it might be right. Strong
theory. Yeah. Strong theory theory.

1314
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:10,130
Very uh, yeah. That, that, that makes
a lot of sense. This can't work.

1315
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,980
I know

1316
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:17,870
there's one or two savages out there or,
or if he does it's like,

1317
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,610
it's like, all right, but then at
the same time we say it can't work,

1318
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:26,630
but then there's women that date
serial killers, you know what I mean?

1319
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:31,360
So it's like there's nothing, nothing
can really surprise me anymore. And the,

1320
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:34,830
and yet there's some people that
are single like good people. I know.

1321
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:38,960
That's the amazing part to me is making
his videos and it's always the same

1322
01:28:38,961 --> 01:28:42,450
thing over and over and over.
Well we'll find out that he,

1323
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:46,550
that he married one of the my 600
lb life women. That'd be great.

1324
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,750
That would be great. I just want a woman
to sit on my face. Challenge accepted.

1325
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,900
Let's see if you come
out of this one alive,

1326
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:56,330
why would you make a
video without your teeth?

1327
01:28:56,331 --> 01:29:00,560
And that's the crazy because
you know it's smoother.

1328
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,520
That's the craziest

1329
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,590
thing. It also hasn't, sorry.

1330
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,150
It has a sign that you're doing
on purpose. No, I did on accident.

1331
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,720
We do it on purpose sometimes.
Yeah.

1332
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:17,850
There's some people that have been in
our lives for like more than a decade.

1333
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:22,160
Who are your house? Christine? And
I'm like, she's good Christine.

1334
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:25,050
Well at least I ate.
At least I stopped myself.

1335
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:28,170
I go but it'd be,

1336
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:33,171
but also good for you for not getting
mad cause I hate those people that like

1337
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:33,751
they,
they,

1338
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:37,560
their name is Brittany but they spell
it with like three teas or something and

1339
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:41,970
then they get mad at you when you're like,
oh bri t t and what you're like, what?

1340
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,890
Excuse me

1341
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:51,390
as far as the threat is,

1342
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:58,190
um, three days in a heart
instead of a dot. Before the eye.

1343
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,800
Um, prednisone at this folder.
I haven't seen this here,

1344
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:06,801
but it says it's no fucking God.

1345
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,770
Yeah.
Cause you've gagged like twice.

1346
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:14,070
We played one earlier.
She got really,

1347
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,450
Oh this says racist dog owner.
So here's the deal, man.

1348
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:22,200
My wife and I recently adopted
a Chihuahua puppy. Okay.

1349
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,060
I feel like it's very important that
this dog stay connected with its cultural

1350
01:30:27,061 --> 01:30:27,894
roots.

1351
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,340
Therefore we have been teaching
the dog commands in Spanish.

1352
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,980
I'm going to laugh at this. This is
going to be so great. It's a spite,

1353
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:37,740
not really speaking or
knowing any Spanish myself,

1354
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:44,730
friends and family think we
are strange for doing this.

1355
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:49,470
But I strongly believe that not training
about it this way makes you a racist

1356
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:50,304
piece of shit.

1357
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:54,720
Why should you have the right to
whitewash your dog's heritage?

1358
01:30:55,140 --> 01:31:00,140
I'd like to hear your opinions on this
since Todd is half Mexican or something

1359
01:31:02,071 --> 01:31:04,860
like that and Christine
can weigh in as well,

1360
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,800
despite her opinion being tainted
with white privilege. Thanks.

1361
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:15,540
Wow. Love the broadcast. This on me.
Beat me. I need to get fucked a lot,

1362
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,910
man. Chris. All right.

1363
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:24,660
Well I have to say this is
genius on this man's part.

1364
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:29,570
I think it's fantastic. Yeah, I
mean, I think you should learn alpha.

1365
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,390
Maggie,
if you have a German shepherd,

1366
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,820
they have those German shepherds that
you can get there were like trained in

1367
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:40,300
Germany and then they, they only
know commands in German. Amazing.

1368
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,780
The Brussels Griffon is from Dallas.

1369
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,460
Maybe that's why it's
such a fucking stupid dog,

1370
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,320
just because we're speaking it
to it in the language they speak.

1371
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:56,970
What four different languages in
Brussels? Major hub, but I mean,

1372
01:31:56,971 --> 01:32:00,130
French is the dominant language.
Clearly Betsy needs

1373
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,940
to be hearing more from trying
it. Let's try it tonight. We, eh,

1374
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:10,170
March,
I would love to see,

1375
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:14,830
but to me that I mean that, that person's
obviously being funny. Right? Yeah. Okay.

1376
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:17,380
Okay.
I'm not talking to a dog like this.

1377
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:27,130
That's me talking to it. That so
fun. I lose my God damn mind. I mean,

1378
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:33,040
see that's the thing is like
racism without evil intent.

1379
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:37,990
Hilarious. Hilarious. Yes. Larry,
you mean this dog? We should,

1380
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:40,840
I should teach you a command
to teach your, your Chihuahua.

1381
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,320
I've been watching El Chapo,
the series on Alex,

1382
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:48,880
which is not just in Spanish,
but it's all Mexican slang. Um,

1383
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:53,650
so maybe teach your dog,
uh, seeing that the way,

1384
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:57,350
like you said way is like
a, you know, it's like dude

1385
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:03,460
dangled, took a meek
to tangle. [inaudible]

1386
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,330
Django. I have to eat something.
Well it's like I have your food.

1387
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:08,230
It's fucking good.

1388
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:13,240
Chingona and then just
you hit the Mallory,

1389
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:16,270
just tell him that that could
be like when to attack someone.

1390
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,470
You just see someone

1391
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:25,690
and it's a Chihuahua. So it'd be
hilarious. So you can do it as a joke.

1392
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:29,350
There you go. Cause it's not going
to be like, it's not like if I,

1393
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,390
like I have a 70 pound pit bull,
so if I said like attack,

1394
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:37,580
like I could let Jimmy and we like
terrify someone. She's his cries.

1395
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:41,260
Your dog train like that? No, not at
all. He's the sweetest thing ever.

1396
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:42,970
So like you would never do it,

1397
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:47,890
but like now I'm tempted to just like
walk up to people and like Diego Kale,

1398
01:33:47,891 --> 01:33:51,430
you know what I mean? Like have someone
like freak the fuck out. Cause you would,

1399
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:56,240
oh my God, I'm, I'm just fasten.
Yeah. He's a massive, massive best.

1400
01:33:56,690 --> 01:34:00,490
He's just, I mean, granted it's me,
so he's massive to me. That's right.

1401
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,580
Sounds like we see him
and it looks like R. Dot.

1402
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:10,050
What's a saddle doing on him?
I think I got here. Uh, yeah,

1403
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,340
my God. Yeah. Uh, we, we
actually got the dog. Uh,

1404
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:18,340
my wife got the dog when I was in
Houston, Texas. Oh, I wasn't even there.

1405
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:21,940
Really? Yeah. How long ago? This is like,
this is like a month and a half ago,

1406
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:26,590
so yeah, it's a new dog. Yeah. I
mean new dog. And his name is Diego.

1407
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,630
Diego rescue or a yeah. Yeah, they uh,

1408
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:36,430
they found him chained to a church in
Compton. I'm a dog stuck life. Yeah.

1409
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:40,940
But he's, he's the
sweetest dog and like, uh,

1410
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:45,220
I feel weird telling these stories because
I know bill burr had that bit where

1411
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:50,200
it's like his wife got the dog got also
got a pit bull while he was out and then

1412
01:34:50,201 --> 01:34:54,040
he was nervous like coming
home to the dog. Um, but yeah,

1413
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:57,500
so I had to come home to the dog,
like really scared because I'm like,

1414
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:58,550
well I'm walking.

1415
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:03,140
So I had like my wife come out with the
dog on a leash and like meet me outside

1416
01:35:03,141 --> 01:35:06,470
the house and then I walk the dog and
then I walked the dog into the house.

1417
01:35:06,471 --> 01:35:10,190
So it's like I, I'm, I'm, I'm
a dude, I'm fucking alpha.

1418
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,220
And then the dog immediately
got gun in the house,

1419
01:35:13,221 --> 01:35:16,340
just turn around and jumped on me and
started like licking my face and I'm like,

1420
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:21,160
love the dog. That's good. Well,
and it has no hostility from doing,

1421
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:25,880
it's the best.
Then like when a midget walks at pit ball,

1422
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,410
everyone just goes like that.
That's,

1423
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:31,820
that midget knows something like
that's a bad reality show. Yeah,

1424
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:36,410
I was on it. That's the weirdest part.
Pit boss. Yeah. You were on Pippa?

1425
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:41,350
Yeah, I did a roast of Shorty
Rossi. Oh Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1426
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,430
yeah. Wow. What was one of the jokes?

1427
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,390
Fuck some something about he
likes pit bulls cause its head.

1428
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:49,160
It looks like a pit bull testicle.
I don't know.

1429
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:54,830
Do you find that with certain cultures
of people react to you differently?

1430
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:57,620
Like I dunno,
the same cultures that are wowed by magic.

1431
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:05,890
I had a joke in my attic

1432
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:09,780
that different races respond to me.
That's what I'm asking. Yeah. Yeah.

1433
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,550
And it's true where it is
true, right? Yeah. Oh yeah.

1434
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,240
Like give us some insight and,
and all right,

1435
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:20,980
I'm essentially going to do my joke,
but at the same time it's real. So,

1436
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:25,370
uh, white people are very, like,
when their kids stares at me,

1437
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:30,560
it's like he's the kids curious.
The parent is horrified.

1438
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,230
Right. It's like, and they're like,

1439
01:36:33,231 --> 01:36:37,400
grabbed the kid's head and like turned
violently turn the kids had away and

1440
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:41,800
stuff like that. And that's,
to me, that's, that's a
bummer cause it's like you're,

1441
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:44,630
you're trying to tell the kid like,
this person doesn't exist. Don't, don't,

1442
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:48,710
don't acknowledge my favorite.
And if people are like,

1443
01:36:48,711 --> 01:36:49,580
well then what should we do?

1444
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,200
My favorite thing ever that that apparent
did is literally walk their kid up to

1445
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:57,620
me and say, hello sir, this is my son.

1446
01:36:58,010 --> 01:37:02,570
He's not quite sure why you're smaller,
but I wanted to come and say hi to you.

1447
01:37:02,571 --> 01:37:05,870
So he, so he knows that you're, that
you're just another human being.

1448
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:08,900
And then I went, thank you.
Thank you for doing that.

1449
01:37:08,901 --> 01:37:12,410
Cause then I got to talk to the kid and
people think, oh, was the kid, the kid,

1450
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,760
the kid,
he was like five or six.

1451
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:19,330
I could've gone with a joke and
be like 27, you know, but like,

1452
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:23,240
like people freak out about their
kids because they think like,

1453
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,630
they think they have to make up these
magical stories for their children. Like,

1454
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,940
oh, well, you know, um, he,

1455
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:32,900
the tooth fairy came and when the
tooth fairy shrinks down teeth,

1456
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:35,690
they got some dust on that guy.
And then he like,

1457
01:37:35,691 --> 01:37:37,640
he shot like they think that it's like,
no,

1458
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:40,950
I literally just tell kids when they
go, why you little? I go, all right.

1459
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,750
You see how that person has blonde Terry?
So that person has black hair. He goes,

1460
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,710
that person has no hair. Yeah,
some people are really tall,

1461
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:47,990
some people are really short.
That's all. And they go, okay,

1462
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:50,540
that's what you told that like five
or six year olds and they go, okay.

1463
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:53,870
And that's all you need to tell
kids is like essentially the truth.

1464
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:56,700
And they're like, oh yeah,
yeah. All right. And then
cause that's what they want.

1465
01:37:56,701 --> 01:38:00,580
They want the truth. They want to learn,
they want you to get some fancy story.

1466
01:38:00,581 --> 01:38:04,640
So yeah, the, the, the, the white
parents are always more like, ah,

1467
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:08,970
he ate gluten. You know,
like they like freak out.

1468
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:10,050
Uh,

1469
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:15,050
Mexicans and Latinos in general say shit
but in Spanish because then they see

1470
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:20,390
that I'm obviously a gringo and a
so they say shit, but it's like I,

1471
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:23,250
I know all the words for dwarf.

1472
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:29,160
So it's like [inaudible]
like I know all that shit.

1473
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:34,540
So when I hear those little keywords
that's go Kaitlin, you know?

1474
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:37,503
Um,

1475
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:42,570
and then my favorites are black kids
cause they just don't give a fuck.

1476
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,820
They don't care. They
don't care. I'm literally,

1477
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:52,780
I'm literally kid walk up to me and be
like, what the Hell is wrong with you?

1478
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:59,700
It was the greatest thing and
I'm just like, yes. Awesome.

1479
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:03,270
Good for you. Dad's right behind them.
Yeah. What the Hell is wrong with you?

1480
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,720
I got questions like,

1481
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:12,450
why you short as hell man.
Genetics,

1482
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:14,610
Jesus Christ genetics.

1483
01:39:14,611 --> 01:39:18,090
I bought crack from that motherfucker
laying up like tap and like look at him.

1484
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:22,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. I don't like that.

1485
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:25,380
Like a wheel house. Great. Yeah.
That's your wheelhouse. Yeah.

1486
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:29,190
Say something to say that I have an answer
for everything when it comes to that.

1487
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,750
Oh, that's why it's always,
that's not what I said,

1488
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:42,390
but yeah, like that's when someone like
does like a real basic heckle. Right.

1489
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:46,110
I just kind of look at him like you
really think I've never heard that before.

1490
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:50,550
What's the thing you hear the most?
Oh so like a Leprechaun joke or something.

1491
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:54,420
And this is in life or on stage?
Both. And on stage. Oh yeah.

1492
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,910
I've gotten like where's your buttock?
Gold

1493
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:00,620
from the stage. And I go, it's a,

1494
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:05,010
it's at your mom's house after I paid or
when I fucked her, cause she's a whore.

1495
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:09,320
And then like everyone goes nuts.
It's like it's my first time. Yeah.

1496
01:40:09,321 --> 01:40:13,260
You'd be like, Oh yeah, I'm stumped
with the, with the fucking Leprechaun.

1497
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:16,800
Haeckel I got nothing.
And you just,

1498
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:18,690
we've talked about you
on this show before.

1499
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:23,750
I've heard people have tweeted me and
said that you guys say very nice things

1500
01:40:23,881 --> 01:40:28,690
about me. So thank you.
Destroy it. There is no,

1501
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:34,910

like many, many years ago. Very bad knob.

1502
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:40,110
Oh yeah. It was fucking terrible. But
yeah, I mean, I ate a bag of dicks.

1503
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:43,080
Jerry did. Okay. And then
you went up and I was like,

1504
01:40:43,081 --> 01:40:45,340
there's no way this guy's
going to salvage this.

1505
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:48,840
You fucking destroyed

1506
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:55,600
the specials. And that told this
story. This was salmon. Well, we were,

1509
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,800

there. You're right, it was Larson. Yeah.

1510

like Brad didn't bring us,

1513
01:41:18,881 --> 01:41:21,160

And he was like,

will take care of the rest were like,

1515

Like I've Jay. And he was like, he's the
way, I didn't tell that guy to do that.

1517
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:34,630
I 100% okay.
I just want that to be clear.

1518
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:38,410
One of the nicest people and well that's
why everybody is happy for your success

1519

1521
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:47,710
but everybody is thrilled for your
success because you're a good guy.

1522
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:50,040
Oh thanks man. Yeah, I'll watch.

1523
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:52,900
That was a great show cause like you
look back at that show, you're like, oh,

1524
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:55,660
those are all like, yeah,
back at that time we weren't.

1525
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:59,650
But in terms of like they
talk about like the uh,

1526
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:04,480
draft class, the quarterback class of
1983 with like Jim Kelly, John Elway,

1527
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:07,630
like it was a great show. Like it's that
it's that kind of thing. We were like, oh,

1528
01:42:07,631 --> 01:42:11,620
all these guys like went on to do like
fucking amazing things before I forget.

1529
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,630
I did the degenerates together. Yes,
we did. Yeah. Coming out in the fall,

1530
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:20,260
and I don't know if they're
calling it the degenerates or not,

1531
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,880
but something like that.
It's me, you, it's a

1532
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:32,020
big Jay Oakerson a young Nigga centers
and lies of trainer was the trigger.

1533
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:36,820
Trager sorry. Yeah, Dude. This
guy though, this guy was like,

1534
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:40,330
he was constantly, he was like, Brad,
you want to do you want him to go for it?

1535
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:43,060
And I was like, dude, what the fuck?
He's like, well, you guys know,

1536
01:42:43,061 --> 01:42:47,540
like you're not closing this year.
And we're like, okay, fine. Yeah,

1537
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:50,920
but you don't have to keep reminding us
that. He's like, yeah, this is Brad show.

1538
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,980
Ah, fucker. You're going to
pass the ball to Coby, right?

1539
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:57,730
Like you're going to do Douche
douchebags and your audience. I mean,

1540
01:42:57,731 --> 01:43:00,520
they have to just be eating it after,
you know what I mean?

1541
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:04,450
Like the guy that yelled
at the Leprechaun, oh dude,
no one turns that person.

1542
01:43:04,451 --> 01:43:09,310
He goes, great. Hackle fucking
great job. I mean, really?

1543
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:13,790
Yeah. You really made the show. But
like, that never happens. Sorry,

1544
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:16,360
I interrupted you because I'm
curious to hear about your life too.

1545
01:43:16,361 --> 01:43:19,440
So what other things do people say
to you that's like so lame? And

1546
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,210
I mean, like the Leprechaun
things pretty constant. Uh, now,

1547
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,330
uh,
now that I'm married there we,

1548
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:32,620
we get questions a lot like strange will
just walk up to me and my wife because

1549
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:33,520
my wife's not a dwarf.

1550
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:40,750
Like they've got questions like,
like what?

1551
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:44,840
Like everyone wants to know how we
met. Like everyone's just like, ah,

1552
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:50,180
how, how'd that happen?
Yeah, that's fucking rude.

1553
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,780
Cause like, I know what they're
thinking and they're like, all right,

1554
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:59,270
someone ordered someone. You'd
be like, ah, this is a weird,

1555
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:02,570
yeah. And then then I have
to tell them and that,

1556
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,490
that freaks them out even
more because, uh, how did you,

1557
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:09,320
I don't know what he meant. We uh, I
met my wife, this is a 100% true story.

1558
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:13,190
I was doing a radio gig in San Francisco.
Um,

1559
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:15,170
I didn't know anyone there.

1560
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:18,920
I was living in San Francisco and you
were living there. I was living there,

1561
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:20,900
there very briefly.
I got this rate.

1562
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:24,500
I did like four years in a row
where I did 48 weeks on the road.

1563
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:27,860
I was burned out. Someone said like, Hey,

1564
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,570
there's this radio gig in San Francisco.
Do you want to be a morning show guy?

1565
01:44:30,571 --> 01:44:34,610
He was like, yeah, what's the money
get good. Awesome. I'll take it.

1566
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:38,780
So I did it just to get off the road.
So to start with this show,

1567
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:40,490
I knew no one in San Francisco,

1568
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:44,140
so we played this game on the show
called Tinder or Grindr where I,

1569
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,470
where I would flip a coin and
based on what it would land on,

1570
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,470
I would go on either a
Tinder date or grinder date.

1571
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:53,800
This is how you hope it gets better.
So then I did it,

1572
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:57,230
did land on a grinder date one time
and I did go on one Grindr date with a

1573
01:44:57,231 --> 01:44:59,810
lovely, a redhead, uh, that we,

1574
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,440
that he insisted that we just called them
ginger bear. I never got his real name.

1575
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:08,290
Uh, and he was amazing. He was the best,
uh, so caught up or know of course, uh,

1576
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:12,620
up up dumb. No, it was the weirdest
thing cause like we told them like, hey,

1577
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:15,410
you know, Brad's not gay. I'm not gay.
Like when that's not gonna happen.

1578
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:18,380
This is just the way I can meet people
and meet friends and stuff like that.

1579
01:45:18,381 --> 01:45:20,510
And he's like, yeah, that's
fine. And he paid for everything.

1580
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:22,340
And like at the end of the night,
I'm like,

1581
01:45:22,341 --> 01:45:26,330
I should probably just jerk this guy off,
like I should do something.

1582
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:27,563
Aw,

1583
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:33,910
yeah. So, um, then a listener
called in and said, okay,

1584
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:35,020
you guys do Tinder,
Grindr,

1585
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:39,280
but have you ever heard of this other
APP called Thrinder? And we're like,

1586
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:42,310
what the hell is then Thrinder and they
said, oh, it's Tinder for threesomes.

1587
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,660
And I'm like, well obviously I should
get on that watch. That's an APP.

1588
01:45:46,661 --> 01:45:48,670
I should be on it again,
a Tinder,

1589
01:45:48,671 --> 01:45:52,600
it's not called Tinder anymore or it's
not called Thrinder anymore cause Tinder

1590
01:45:52,601 --> 01:45:57,070
sued them. So now it's called
field f e l d a. So yeah,

1591
01:45:57,071 --> 01:46:00,190
that's what the name of the
APP is. And uh, so I go, yeah,

1592
01:46:00,191 --> 01:46:03,700
I'll go on this Thrinder APP.
That sounds great. And uh,

1593
01:46:03,701 --> 01:46:06,280
I matched just for
threesomes. Yeah. And well,

1594
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:08,470
you can go on and match with two singles.

1595
01:46:08,471 --> 01:46:10,320
You can go on as a couple
match with a single. Oh,

1596
01:46:10,321 --> 01:46:13,330
I got go on as a single match
with a couple or you can
match with another single

1597
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:16,960
and be like, okay, so we gel. So
now let's go find the third. Uh,

1598
01:46:16,961 --> 01:46:20,100
so I go on with the single like
let's just baby steps. Let's try it.

1599
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:24,400
Deal for a bit. This is for a radio bit
or no? Well yeah, this is for a radio bit,

1600
01:46:24,401 --> 01:46:27,140
but at the same time, my head, I'm like,
I want to get a fucking threesome. Okay.

1601
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:29,830
So yeah. Uh, that respect.

1602
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:36,040
So I went on the APP and uh,
I matched with a single woman and we were,

1603
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:40,300
and we were like, all right, cool. Let's
meet and make sure we're not psychos.

1604
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:43,150
And we met and we weren't Psychos,

1605
01:46:43,151 --> 01:46:48,110
but we work on that APP strictly just
for like, let's just hook up. It's a,

1606
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,010
it's a thing. Yeah. And then at the end
of the first day, we're like, we, we,

1607
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:55,980
we can't hook up cause this,
there was like something here.

1608
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:59,820
There was a connection.
Yeah. And that's my wife.

1609
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:05,910
Two years after that, two
years after that, I proposed
to her. Wow. I'm on. Yeah.

1610
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:09,330
Marijuana threesome out.
You dirty fucking filthy hookers.

1611
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:16,350
Horse Lot sex ended up,
yeah,

1612
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:19,350
a couple of slots.
And you ended up finding love.

1613
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:22,420
How insane is that when sleds find love?
Yeah.

1614
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:28,300
That's unbelievable.
It's so you met,

1615
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,550
do you tell black people
this whole story when was

1616
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:37,260
in front of their children? Let me
tell you about the birds and the bees.

1617
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:39,540
Sometimes the birds and the
bees want to add a caterpillar.

1618
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,040
Yeah,
that's how we met.

1619
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:49,860
It's an insane story and
a, that's remarkable. Yeah.

1620
01:47:49,861 --> 01:47:53,940
So when people say like, Brad, why
are you like, why'd you settle down?

1621
01:47:53,941 --> 01:47:58,370
It's just like, cause I found a hot
Chinese woman that likes three ways.

1622
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,010
What was I waiting for?
Like what's where you're like,

1623
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:06,090
oh I'm going to hold off for something
better. She met her in San Francisco then.

1624
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,560
Yeah, Marin, San Francisco.

1625
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:12,120
I lasted about not like four
months on the radio show.

1626
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:15,360
How did you get out of the, don't
you have contract? I paid it off.

1627
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:18,330
You paid off your contract. I
was that miserable. You hit it.

1628
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,570
What was the worst part? Is it the
morning? Not even the mornings.

1629
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:24,060
The worst part is that when
you're done with the show,

1630
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:28,650
you sit down and meeting after the show
and some guy who has worked his way up

1631
01:48:28,651 --> 01:48:31,530
to be program director tells
you how to be funny. Oh,

1632
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,780
that's the thing where he's like,
here's what you need to be doing.

1633
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:37,860
That's the part where I was literally
like, I know I can't do this.

1634
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,120
I can't have someone who's
never been funny in their
lives. Help me. Tell me how,

1635
01:48:42,121 --> 01:48:43,800
tell me how to be funny because of that.

1636
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,680
Because at that time I was 12
years in and then he'd stand up.

1637
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:50,890
Do you have an agent goes
make the call for you? Like
he's got to go. Yeah, I mean,

1638
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:53,010
I, I told the agent, I was
like, I'm out. And they're like,

1639
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:55,560
it's going to cost to you. I'm
like, don't care. Don't care.

1640
01:48:55,590 --> 01:49:00,110
Give me back on the road giving back. Just
write a check to them. They're gone. Go.

1641
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:04,710
And uh, how many days a week were you
doing it? Five. Yeah. So, and it was,

1642
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,581
it was the morning show.

1643
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:10,581
It was 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM funded it
all from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM was great

1644
01:49:11,091 --> 01:49:15,090
until you did it. Have Fun doing on the
show was fantastic. That was a lot of fun.

1645
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,290
A lot of fun bits.
The people that were on the show were uh,

1646
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:22,500
were really talented and
that part was amazing. Uh,

1647
01:49:22,501 --> 01:49:26,880
it's just every other part that sucked
like afterward and then finally getting

1648
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:30,300
out of all the meetings and show prep at
like three o'clock and now you're like,

1649
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:31,320
well it's three o'clock.

1650
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:34,710
I have about two hours to do something
and then I have to go to bed.

1651
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:36,210
That's how long you have to be there.

1652
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:41,280
W I mean cause after the show then you
go to a meeting and you run down the bits

1653
01:49:41,281 --> 01:49:44,970
that work, especially as a new show.
You, you, you went on the bits that work,

1654
01:49:44,971 --> 01:49:48,130
the bits that didn't, and then
you plan the show tomorrow and how

1655
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,900
do you know it's a radio show?

1656
01:49:49,901 --> 01:49:52,180
There's no audience that you
can actually hear the laughter.

1657
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,290
How do you know what worked and
what did not work? Director is God.

1658
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:01,120
And just, and that's why I was like, no,

1659
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:04,540
I can't, I can't do it. He
goes, you need a live audience.

1660
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:07,180
They'll tell you what's funny.
Yeah.

1661
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,170
And we had great reaction
on like the phone lines.

1662
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:14,140
People would be calling up and be like,
this is, this is amazing. This is great.

1663
01:50:14,141 --> 01:50:17,170
We haven't heard anything
like this before. And then
like, yeah, that didn't work.

1664
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:20,950
Uh, that's not, that's not what you do in
radio. It's like, that's a dying medium.

1665
01:50:20,951 --> 01:50:25,550
So maybe let's not do what you fucking do.
You fuck

1666
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:32,120
you. Fuck you. Fuck you twice. Okay.

1667
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:37,470
I would love to see two Hungarian
people who know Hungarian still fighting

1668
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:39,550
English. Oh man, that's the best part.

1669
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:44,620
Your mother queen of Laura's got
fucked her ass hole. You'll fuck ass.

1670
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:52,420
She prepared me for meeting her mom.
Like my mom's wild and I was like,

1671
01:50:52,421 --> 01:50:56,680
my mom's crazy now. My mom's like
real pretty nuts. I was like,

1672
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:59,830
sure.
And it was like for like a month.

1673
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:04,720
And then we went to lunch and she
was like, hello? She goes, hi,

1674
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:07,660
nice to meet you.
And she turns to Christina and she goes,

1675
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,540
I was at a blooming dads
in this fucking cunt.

1676
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:16,900
I couldn't. I said, fuck you
bitch. You take it back now.

1677
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:21,100
And I was like at a restaurant.
I was like, oh my God,

1678
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:25,230
I was so happy though.
I was laughing so hard.

1679
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,530
Can I tell you that you're the first
man I ever brought home that laughed at

1680
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:32,590
that shit and that's why we're able
to be married. You Know Casey Anthony

1681
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:38,230
killed her daughter as she gave
you a blow job, right? That's true.

1682
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:42,080
That is the other side of
this car. Oh Man. Yeah.

1683
01:51:42,081 --> 01:51:46,890
Cause you see that and you go, oh great,
there's another broken toy like me there.

1684
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:50,950
You fantastic. Not so much
fun. It was fine. Christine,

1685
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:54,340
we've got an email that says,
did Tina take a monster shit,

1686
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,660
she looks lighter to Mac.
Did you

1687
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:07,390
ask me one of my favorite jokes that
you ever did? Where you talking about,

1688
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:12,010
I didn't know I was pregnant
womb to take a shit,

1689
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:15,220
but it wasn't as shit to it.
Tom was a baby

1690
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:19,810
that show,

1691
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:22,940
that show was another show that should
be on the shot and four channel,

1692
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:26,950
100% and the other show.
What's the other one? Dude,

1693
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:29,170
we watched it.
We got the TLC APP.

1694
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:36,040
You can watch a show on the road.
Basically the network you're describing,

1695
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,070
it's like fucking, you know, uh,

1696
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:43,560
it's addiction boarding,
right? 600 pounds,

1697
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,870
600 pounds. And I'm black. Like it'll
be combinations of things. Holidays.

1698
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:56,100
I'm Mormon and 600 pounds getting those
hands and I want to marry three dwarves.

1699
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,020
It's all these things. So
anyways, we're scrolling through.

1700
01:53:00,021 --> 01:53:02,270
We watched lost in transition,

1701
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:05,990
which is about people transitioning
like in the middle of their marriage.

1702
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:10,400
Like you guys are too old and then you
go, I'm a woman. Wow. I was like, what?

1703
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:14,360
So it's those. Okay. And these
were scrolling through and we see,

1704
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,990
I still didn't know I was pregnant.
So open that up.

1705
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:23,060
This is about people who had burr gave
birth, women who gave birth, right.

1706
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:24,460
Didn't know they were pregnant.
Yeah.

1707
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:29,270
And then a second time gave birth and
didn't know they were pregnant again.

1708
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:34,420
Another big shit. And I was
like, fuck it. Not Again,

1709
01:53:34,421 --> 01:53:38,850
not a bad shit again. It was all
fog. That's a big shit. Whoa, whoa.

1710
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:41,320
What is that?

1711
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:46,110
That show is basically the plot
of the hangover too, right? Yeah.

1712
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:50,830
They're like, this can't happen twice.
It's weekend at Bernie's too. Of course.

1713
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:54,370
It's every horrible seek or they're like
the unbelievable situation that made

1714
01:53:54,371 --> 01:53:58,360
the first one amazing. Even
now it happened again to
not know you're pregnant.

1715
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:01,810
You have to be so mentally
ill or so in denial,

1716
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:06,610
like the brain can actually block out a
lot of stuff when you're trying to not

1717
01:54:06,611 --> 01:54:09,940
listen. Christina, why while you
tried a woman's playing this shit,

1718
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:12,250
let the men talk about how
you know you're pregnant.

1719
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:16,520
Please Polish Jesus. I
mean, I knew nothing about,

1720
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:20,170
I know this fucking
dumb, broad ideas, words,

1721
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:24,910
words like this. Can you
imagine not knowing? I mean,
you saw me at the very end.

1722
01:54:24,911 --> 01:54:27,760
I couldn't even, I could barely walk.
Like days before you give birth,

1723
01:54:27,761 --> 01:54:31,990
you were ready to hop in Vegas at the
special. That was eight months pregnant.

1724
01:54:32,290 --> 01:54:36,220
He was shy. Eight months. Yeah. And you
were wearing this horror cowgirl outfit.

1725
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:41,440
Oh girl. How dare you
paint that. Oh, sorry.

1726
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:45,940
I thought you meant my dress
and I actually wore, I was
like, oh no, no, no, no, no.

1727
01:54:45,941 --> 01:54:49,750
Not that spectacular. And that outfit.
Thank you. They put me in a, yeah,

1728
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:54,700
it's bad for the Bachelorette party.
Yeah. You're a bachelor party.

1729
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:59,770
So you were in like a Bret Michaels
sparkly pink cowboy hat. Great.

1730
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:02,840
We were talking about, by the
way, sorry, the, um, you know,

1731
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:06,560
people who you see in public on
speaker phone and they're like, Hey,

1732
01:55:07,230 --> 01:55:11,600
no, I'm a, I'm going to walk in now, but
what's that? And then you're like, dude,

1733
01:55:11,601 --> 01:55:14,900
you're on speaker phone. Yeah. And
they'll have a full conversation. Yeah.

1734
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,780
And just how, you know, we should just
have bullet to the back of the head.

1735
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:21,830
Oh yeah. All of them. The
assembly. I don't like that
you're on board. No, I don't.

1736
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:26,770
Finally, it's weird because there,
there's certain things when,

1737
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:32,170
here's how, you know, a movie villain
is a good villain when it's wrong,

1738
01:55:32,171 --> 01:55:36,400
what they're doing. But in your
head you go, I totally get it right.

1739
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,170
I totally understand it.
It's a great point.

1740
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:42,910
So like when thanatos wants to
kill half the universe and say,

1741
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,010
dude,
we're

1742
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,190
fucked up,
we,

1743
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:49,620
there's too many people and not all of
them are good and we just have to wipe

1744
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:53,220
that to kill half the people
have a horse that's wrong. Right.

1745
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:57,030
But damn it that I kind of want that
to happen. As you start with India,

1746
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:01,500
where does it fit? I'm just
saying what did he do? It, it, it,

1747
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:05,560
it's random. It's completely
random. There's, there's that,

1748
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:07,890
there's actually an APP and it's,
it's stupid,

1749
01:56:07,891 --> 01:56:09,450
but you just type your
name in and then you hit

1750
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:15,000
enter and then it says you were spared
by Thanos or you were killed by that. Oh,

1751
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:19,800
I was spared just saying it. Ah,
so yeah, I, I'd still be here,

1752
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:24,300
but us, he's taking no prisoners though.
It could be anybody. Yeah. Anybody. Wow.

1753
01:56:24,301 --> 01:56:28,790
So yeah, and like, so yeah,
that's obviously something
that should not happen.

1754
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:31,470
You should fight to make sure that
doesn't happen. But at the same time,

1755
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:36,960
if you're one of the ones
that stage, you're like, wow,
there's a lot less traffic.

1756
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:42,480
Nice. This is nice. I saw this. This
is my own recording. Okay. Okay.

1757
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:45,800
In Starbucks where this guy
was eating his breakfast. Yeah,

1758
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:48,600
the coffee and we're all just trying
to get our coffee. Enjoy your morning.

1759
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:52,060
This motherfucker's on hold.
Yeah, with Bank of America. Okay.

1760
01:56:52,061 --> 01:56:55,470
That's it on speaker phone.
Puts the phone on speakerphone on the,

1761
01:56:55,471 --> 01:56:56,000
just on the [inaudible]

1762
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,090
Taylor. It's him in the
red shirt there. Okay.

1763
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:06,500
So we all have to listen to his cold.
I don't want to hear that shit. Right.

1764
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:09,140
Just a total fucking psycho.

1765
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:10,700
As we talked about this,

1766
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:15,701
those people exist or they watch their
videos at full volume or listen to their

1767
01:57:15,771 --> 01:57:19,460
music. Full volumes. Oh,
we, oh, we went to, uh,

1768
01:57:19,461 --> 01:57:22,340
my wife and I went to a movie
and three rows ahead of us.

1769
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:27,730
There was a guy like on an iPad and
like no headphones and like listening to

1770
01:57:29,031 --> 01:57:32,840
videos while a movie's going on while
the movie's On, while the movie's on,

1771
01:57:32,841 --> 01:57:34,040
not during the previews,

1772
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:39,250
just movies on and he bought out
the iPad like no one said anything.

1773
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:43,910
No. My, my wife threw a quarter
at them and gay older. Nailed it.

1774
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:48,350
That's fucking really risky, right?
Yeah. But at the same time, what he do,

1775
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:53,980
he just got up and like turned around and
then sat back down and close the IPAD.

1776
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:58,130
It was, it was like a full fucking
psycho. I looked at my wife like,

1777
01:57:58,131 --> 01:58:00,320
I've never loved you more
than this moment. Right.

1778
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:05,460
Told me a story about a guy who was at
a movie theater near him and put his,

1779
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:10,000
he put his feet up on the chair. Yeah.
Start talking on the phone. Nope.

1780
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:14,840
My Dad got a local sheriff
walking around and was like,

1781
01:58:14,841 --> 01:58:17,450
there a guy in there making a problem.

1782
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,700
I love you said that the sheriff
went in there and fucking knock.

1783
01:58:22,701 --> 01:58:27,690
The guys feed off. The guy's like, get the
fuck Outta here. Ah, I love that so much.

1784
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:29,030
It sounds like some Florida shit.
Right.

1785
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,220
I was expecting that to go horribly wrong.

1786
01:58:31,221 --> 01:58:34,490
Like the Sheriff looks at
your dad and goes like, hey,
you're crazy. You're going,

1787
01:58:34,491 --> 01:58:37,580
oh no, no, that's, that's
awesome. See like, yeah.

1788
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:42,040
That's when I just think, and I lit. I

1789
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:47,020
literally think that we should develop a
birth control in a spray where when you

1790
01:58:47,021 --> 01:58:51,850
see that you should just be like,
eh, that camera and just take that.

1791
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,410
Not Permanent.
It's like,

1792
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:58,120
it's like a two week birth control that
where it's just like, all right, you know,

1793
01:58:58,121 --> 01:58:58,661
permanent,

1794
01:58:58,661 --> 01:59:03,550
white well I think might give them an
opportunity Q test administered well

1795
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:06,400
listen,
well that takes away the Forrest Gump.

1796
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:10,960
Like this is what this guy said.
He Goes, my name is Collin. Yeah,

1797
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:13,990
I was listening to the big
you guys recently had about
people talking on phones

1798
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:17,410
and video calls on speaker
without earphones in public.

1799
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:21,430
I work at regional trauma hospital and
the other day I was working on triage

1800
01:59:21,431 --> 01:59:25,360
patients in the Er lobby and there was
a middle aged woman who kept repeatedly

1801
01:59:25,361 --> 01:59:29,680
using the voice commands on her phone
to call people and then putting the call

1802
01:59:29,681 --> 01:59:32,110
on speakerphone and
loudly talking to them.

1803
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:36,550
I have patients coming from motor
vehicle accidents, having heart attacks,

1804
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,430
strokes,
all matter of life threatening problems.

1805
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:43,240
And she's loudly screaming into her
phone about what kind of spaghetti she's

1806
01:59:43,241 --> 01:59:46,780
going to have that night. So I can't
even hear the person in front of me.

1807
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:51,340
These are the worst kinds of people.
Oh, congratulations on the baby.

1808
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:54,010
I'm sorry Tina.
But Tommy will always be the water champ.

1809
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:58,240
I'm all finished them all done in time
for Moose suit by Hitler's Collin from

1810
01:59:58,241 --> 02:00:02,110
Fort Pierce. Oh, that's
wow. Road for me. That is a,

1811
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:07,050
that's insane. Like, yeah, if
that's the point, like, Hey,

1812
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:10,800
this guy is like, oh, I have
vitals and they're dropping.

1813
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,930
And then you've got to hear like fucking
Marinara sauce. What's going on, man?

1814
02:00:13,931 --> 02:00:18,931
You imagine if you're like of like they're
coming to you and like saying like,

1815
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:24,520
Hey, I'm your husband. Um, do
we pull the plug? Like he's not,

1816
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:25,960
and all you hear

1817
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:32,710
in the background and add some Oregano
you, but you're just like, kill him.

1818
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:36,880
Just fucking killer. Fucking
fucking kill him. Not the past,

1819
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:40,310
not the grade at the slice. And they're
like, the husband wake up. You're like,

1820
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:43,570
kill me. Kill me. I don't live in
that world. I want to live here.

1821
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:48,200
If I like to batch your Starbucks example,
if someone has a piece,

1822
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,840
if someone calls me and I'm going to
Starbucks, I'll leave the Starbucks,

1823
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:59,900
leave the Starbucks to take to take that
phone call or like just go to my corner

1824
02:00:59,901 --> 02:01:00,231
or whatever.

1825
02:01:00,231 --> 02:01:05,231
And like I'm so like hypersensitive
to like how my shit could ruin someone

1826
02:01:05,951 --> 02:01:10,540
else's name. These people don't
like how you not, they're just not,

1827
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,770
they're just not aware of it.

1828
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:15,310
They're totally unaware and
football season is approaching.

1829
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:20,500
We're wondering DTE talk,
we taught CTE talk.

1830
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:23,790
When does a lot of the preseason started?
Yeah.

1831
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:27,740
So precision is already
gone for four weeks. Um,

1832
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:30,790
I just finished the man cave and
my house. I'm psyched. Ready?

1833
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:34,900
We are talking about, you know, there's
a lot of, you know what I'm saying is,

1834
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:38,890
and we always keep track of who says,
you know what I'm saying a lot. Oh Man.

1835
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,830
And uh,

1836
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:44,940
here we have Tom Brady in a, you know,
interview doing a lot. Oh No. Cool. Okay.

1837
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,793
Okay.

1838
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:49,000
She sounds just walked
in. Hi Cutie. Over there.

1839
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:54,670
How has being with her enhanced your life?

1840
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:59,920
Oh Man. Every possible way.
It really has. She's just,

1841
02:01:59,921 --> 02:02:04,630
um, I couldn't imagine a better partner
for me in my life, what I've gone through.

1842
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:08,290
Okay,
so you both grew up with siblings.

1843
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,970
She had five sisters and I had three
sisters, so it's a lot of women,

1844
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:19,510
you know, and it's, you know, she
comes from a different country,

1845
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:20,530
you know,

1846
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:24,910
Dan's to move to New York
when she was 17 and you know,

1847
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:29,970
we met each other under trying
circumstances, you know,
like every company work,

1848
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:32,020
you know,
we love each other,

1849
02:02:32,021 --> 02:02:36,880
we support each other and we also live
in our life and we're trying to find ways

1850
02:02:36,881 --> 02:02:40,330
to, you know, thing and she's
working on, I'm working,

1851
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:41,260
there's a lot of things happen on,

1852
02:02:41,261 --> 02:02:44,280
but how do we always reconnect with
one another? It's another one in there,

1853
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:48,080
but I believe, you know, like I
couldn't find a better woman to,

1854
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:51,490
to love me and support me the
way she does it all cut together.

1855
02:02:56,380 --> 02:02:59,810
Good motherfucker right there. You know
what I'm saying? Here's the, uh, here's,

1856
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:04,970
I'm mad. I'm mad about the setup question.
I know we're over. Just goes, oh,

1857
02:03:04,971 --> 02:03:08,150
has she enhanced your life?

1858
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,670
Like high blood,
everything.

1859
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:16,010
Here's the super care.
It's a lot of women.

1860
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:22,010
No, you know, you know, you know, you
know, like, you know, read, you know,

1861
02:03:22,011 --> 02:03:24,650
like you know it's a lot of your nose.

1862
02:03:25,390 --> 02:03:29,580
One answer. Yeah, that's
solid. I just hate those.

1863
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:32,340
Like when you're giving
an interview and they,

1864
02:03:32,341 --> 02:03:34,410
those softball questions of like worst.

1865
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:39,560
So is your wife the best woman in
the world or in the known universe?

1866
02:03:42,210 --> 02:03:45,900
We get a lot of, um, is it
just jokes all day with,

1867
02:03:48,450 --> 02:03:49,050
yes.

1868
02:03:49,050 --> 02:03:54,050
When the baby's shitting and on
our faces and we can't control it.

1869
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:00,600
She's, you guys run a lot of bits by each
other and like, yeah, all day. Every day.

1870
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,920
As I was pushing our second
child out and our first,

1871
02:04:04,921 --> 02:04:09,120
we had a nurse like this who was like
the jokester of the, the nurse Ward.

1872
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,040
She came out of nowhere and
she came over and were like,

1873
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:15,150
and at one point I want to be like,
can someone get fucking shaky out of here?

1874
02:04:15,151 --> 02:04:19,920
Because there's time to Joe and Tom and I,
we're not joking.

1875
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:24,570
No pushing out our child.
Like it's not a time do not at all.

1876
02:04:26,670 --> 02:04:31,400
The worst. The worst thing as a comedian
is when you like, cause we have uh,

1877
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,990
the post office by my house has,

1878
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:36,930
I went there to mail a package
and then they went, hey,

1879
02:04:37,010 --> 02:04:41,670
do I know you from somewhere?
And they go like,

1880
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:45,000
ah, you're a comedian, you're a
comedian, you're a funny guy. Like Hey,

1881
02:04:45,001 --> 02:04:48,030
I'm a comedian. Okay. Yeah. And
then they go rich or go over here.

1882
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:50,310
He's the funny guy in our office.
You guys are going to love,

1883
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:53,940
you guys can get along great. And
I'm like, this is not a play date.

1884
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:55,800
You don't set us up.

1885
02:04:56,640 --> 02:05:00,960
And like that's the worst when cause
then it's the worst for the other guy.

1886
02:05:00,961 --> 02:05:03,750
I feel bad for the other guy cause he's
like probably the funny guy around the

1887
02:05:03,751 --> 02:05:07,140
office and it's probably
good to be like and yeah.

1888
02:05:07,141 --> 02:05:11,580
And then I'm the professional funny guy
and now he's under pressured like Ah

1889
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:12,391
Shit.
I gotta be funny right now.

1890
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:15,960
Like we're professional comedians and
we don't like it when someone says be

1891
02:05:15,961 --> 02:05:19,660
funny right now. That's very nice of you
to even think like that. Yeah. Mm hmm.

1892
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:23,550
Yeah, it's like that. That's got to
suck for that dude. Do you have a,

1893
02:05:23,551 --> 02:05:27,030
can you weigh in on what you think
this means? This is just an image.

1894
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:32,190
What is gt? Rtd. All right. Well,
first of all, that is Steven Seagal.

1895
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:36,450
Yeah. Uh, with a tiny face and a fat head,
which is pretty much how it looks now.

1896
02:05:36,451 --> 02:05:39,900
And that is pretty much, that's pretty
much this. Just like pretending,

1897
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:44,640
pretending he's not in it. It doesn't
have anything to do with Stephen. Yeah.

1898
02:05:44,641 --> 02:05:47,250
It doesn't have anything
to do with upper right.

1899
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:50,770
And what do you think that means?
Yes.

1900
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:55,680
See it. Just go for it. This is,

1901
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:58,920
this is a word that I don't,
I don't think I'm allowed to say,

1902
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:01,470
but I think it's trying
to get me to say it. No.

1903
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,670
Like what's that a word for gay people?
That's kind of derogatory.

1904
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:10,380
Hmm. I don't see that at all.
Yeah, that's what you think.

1905
02:06:10,381 --> 02:06:14,580
This is the top part. What
about the bottom part? Uh,

1906
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,840
so it's like,
get rid of the words I've,

1907
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:21,780
oh yeah.
Does that,

1908
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:26,130
does that reveal a lot of hatred in my
person that I see? No, that's interesting.

1909
02:06:26,131 --> 02:06:29,370
It's like a Rorschach test for it is
because different people have different

1910
02:06:29,371 --> 02:06:34,140
reactions. What, what, what
are the reactions have you
gotten? Forget that. Tick.

1911
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:39,120
I mean, I know first good
tongue replaces that dick first.

1912
02:06:39,121 --> 02:06:43,350
Good tug replaces that. Yeah.
Okay. That was it. And then we had,

1913
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:48,270
that's a tea RTD was Ri. I'm an
idiot. Yeah, no, no, that's okay.

1914
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:51,100
Oh, I see what? Yes, I
could see that too. Okay.

1915
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:55,860
So there's no answer is literally just
for great times. Rubbed that Dick.

1916
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:59,120
That was one um,

1917
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:02,450
fat guy too.

1918
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,320
He was making these updated to die.
Um,

1919
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:10,170
let's see. We're good time, right?

1920
02:07:10,171 --> 02:07:14,200
To Dean Faculty to ride the
Dick decays and rape the death.

1921
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:20,170
And that's just the words to live by
fucking gays and then raped the Daphnis.

1922
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:24,870
It's pretty intense. Hold on, I just got
done. Fucking the gaze. What do I do now?

1923
02:07:25,610 --> 02:07:30,570
Okay. The death is Riley.
My interpretation of
gaze then raped to death.

1924
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,710
There is no right or wrong.
There's no right or wrong.

1925
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:35,860
You see and you said get rid of gays.
Yeah.

1926
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:40,060
Yeah. That's what I saw.
And this guy's legit.

1927
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:45,100
That might be [inaudible] message. I can
say that this was just submitted to us.

1928
02:07:45,101 --> 02:07:47,290
Sure.
So is that something that,

1929
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:51,110
is that like the new Obama hope
poster and that seems like it has

1930
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:57,240
cause isn't he the ambassador to
Russia? No, he's not the bathroom.

1931
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,500
No he is not.

1932
02:07:59,501 --> 02:08:04,501
He is a Russian citizen now
and the Kremlin has appointed
him special envoy like

1933
02:08:05,171 --> 02:08:06,004
he is.

1934
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:11,130
It's an unpaid position for to enhance
humanitarian relations between the US and

1935
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:16,180
Russia, that rights. But it is hilarious.
It's guess relationship to Taco.

1936
02:08:16,181 --> 02:08:21,040
It does super fan and his hair's so dark.
It's amazing.

1937
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:25,600
Yeah. He's, he's one of those guys
where I'm sure he uses like shoe Polish,

1938
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:30,770
unlike black, this woman had,

1939
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:35,470
we put jet, this woman has been played
on our show before. This lady here,

1940
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:42,130
it gives one a bag on the go as
well. Grab. You ain't never had that.

1941
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:46,480
Yeah. We played her before then
leading into a car. You remember?

1942
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,383
You remember that?

1943
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:56,050
I'll make you asshole whistle
dance all night. Wait.

1944
02:08:56,051 --> 02:08:58,690
But she, she wasn't sucking
a dick through wire fence.

1945
02:08:58,691 --> 02:09:03,100
She was saying she was leaning
into a car. Yeah, that's her. Yeah,

1946
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,600
that's her. That's her. Could
someone put a beat to that?

1947
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:11,750
Yes, they can. As a matter of fact.
Cause someone do that. Put it out there.

1948
02:09:11,751 --> 02:09:16,240
Is there, is there like a remix to that?
Cause she was Ryman. Yeah, it's coming.

1949
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:20,530
You could drop a sick beat. Yeah. It just
said the word sick beat. I'm over 30,

1950
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:21,850
uh,

1951
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:26,680
and make that one of those like viral
remixes or she's known to wrap. She's,

1952
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:30,070
she's dropped this Ryan.
Before that she was leaning into a car.

1953
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:33,260
So we've seen this woman do this.
Ryan, she's a second socket.

1954
02:09:33,261 --> 02:09:35,570
Tick off the gristle make you a whistle.
It's good.

1955
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,470
Look,
it's her

1956
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:43,540
chunk on the gag on the couch.

1957
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:49,060
No brainer that this woman has teeth.
The other woman,

1958
02:09:50,830 --> 02:09:52,070
I felt like the rhythm of it.

1959
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:55,900
How you doing? How you
most, she's got my tits.

1960
02:09:57,130 --> 02:10:02,100
Look the ass lick the balls with that the
way down my throat choke on a gig on a

1961
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,730
but for high 60.
How tight this one

1962
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:10,000
that's on the end there. How many
shorter street? It's two one.

1963
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:16,020
She does mention the asshole here too
similar when I'm licking that ass doesn't

1964
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:22,180
know. Awesome. That's uh, that's
what they call a go getter.

1965
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:27,340
Sure. Good for her. Is that definitely
not her? Maybe this woman has teeth.

1966
02:10:27,341 --> 02:10:32,090
The other woman didn't have teeth
and this

1967
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:38,780
all night long. Like you wish when
they both have a rhythm to this.

1968
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:43,850
Yeah, I see a name. Thank [inaudible].
Good. It's a good advertisement.

1969
02:10:43,851 --> 02:10:47,470
Yeah. Yeah. It pretty much puts it all
out there and moving along here. Okay.

1970
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,650
Another time lifting thing. We can
now add on something like that. Um,
