1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well, well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,383
Christina.

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,210
No ma'am.

00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,240
and he knew our website,

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,620
Baba
cause everything,

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,680
it's everything that's ever
thought of Alba. So Rachel's Otoc

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,080
start the show. It's so
major. Every go. Ah, we

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,390
oh nice. Thank you. Became, yes.

10
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:53,391
So I think men milk Monday's the best
day of the week in the sexiest also

11
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,720
because man, milk is really the
most powerful way to start your day.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,130
It's full of vitamins and proteins
that takes really strong into it.

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,780
Sort of very,
very happy.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,153
No.

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,020
Well go,
go to your mom's house.

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,830
We're talking circle.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,760
Christina pushes it.

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,743
Yes,

19
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,820
yes.
Yeah.

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,150
How's that Magma Manda Hey guys,

21
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:07,510
sneaky became yes.
So I think man,

22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,250
milk Monday's the best day of the week.
What's wrong with your mouth? Yeah,

23
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:16,240
what's wrong with her mouth?
What's happening? It's a,
she's doing it on purpose,

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,920
right?
It's like a sexy thing to do.

25
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,240
She's over over pronounciating
partner lunch, eating,

26
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,410
eating, eating the word.
Um, I see this a lot on, um,

27
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,510
Instagram stories and on general,
on the Internet.

28
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:36,650
A lot of girls like to talk even sexier
and they'd like to freeze their face.

29
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,310
Only talk with our mouth. I was
hot. I was watching, I won't,

30
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,310
I won't call out her, but, uh,

31
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,140
she was doing a video and her whole
face was frozen comedian or no.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,300
Yeah. And uh, but it just,
it's just the bottom jaw move.

33
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,780
It was very creepy. Oh, I already
know. I already know. Yeah,

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,370
because you're talking about
a guy that looks like her.

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,520
Here's a guy that looks like her and I,

36
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,250
and I'm sure there's reasons for it.
Oh,

37
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:09,310
there's reasons which I do too.

38
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,590
I'm not throwing stones cause I've done,

39
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,040
I've injected things into my face,
but,

40
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,410
but the whole thing,
I just so sexy,

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,790
honestly believe that if everybody
started their day with men milk,

42
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,770
we could potentially achieve world peace.
Because after you had it,

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,490
you're just so happy and
energetic triggers. What's up?

44
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,240
Dude was boring man. Milk
this. And he's funny because I,

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I do think a lot of women think
that if they act this way that out,

46
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,210
like they're going to win a lot
of male approval. But it's, but,

47
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,690
but she really winning your
heart and mind or is it yeah.

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,580
Is it working is what I'm saying.
This works.

49
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,570
We houses not working. What part
of you thinks this is not working?

50
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,490
I mean cause she married you based
on her man. North Mondays are my mom.

51
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,270
I'd marry her in a second.
What about your brother?

52
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,880
Would you marry your brother
if he was like this? Yeah,

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,490
I want to be non binding at the
top teeth and at the bottom teeth.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,230
Oh did she just bleach the tops?
Look Kinda looks like it in this frame.

55
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,310
I can't just for a dental.
I mean I'm, this isn't it,

56
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,170
this is not an official dental updates.
I'm not Gunna,

57
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,450
that's why I'm saying it's not official.
This is off the record.

58
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,120
You have a cleaning coming up Monday.

59
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,460
Oh you're doing and you're doing the
laser whitening the same day. Okay.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,950
How was this not an official
dental update? I'm sorry. I
mean, how is it not, sorry,

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,570
I just got excited and I, my
brain is working slowly today.
I'm, I'm so sorry. Okay.

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,110
I'm sorry. Do you want to search for
the, I don't have to search for it.

63
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,750
The Tanger, whatever it's
called Stinger. It's right here.

64
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:54,670
But I don't know why you
would ignore or agreements.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,630
Dental updates are dental
updates from dental time only.

66
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,340
I know what you're doing is wrong.
I'm sorry,

67
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,240
who was well, because that's really
your dental. I date not mine.

68
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,463
That's why I didn't want to,

69
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,173
I like this.

70
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,470
I'm going on a kind of feeling it today.
On Monday I'm doing a double whammy.

71
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,720
Teeth cleaning and whitening.

72
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,730
And I have cautioned you and I really
wish you would take my word of caution

73
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:34,000
that that's a lot of painful shit.
And one day, I'm not a woman.

74
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,890
I don't have bad days. That's my favorite
thing that he's ever said. Ooh, awesome.

75
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,080
Yeah. So I'm serious though. I should
whites, you're going to feel it.

76
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:47,760
You're gonna feel that laser whitening.
You know why I'm doing it though? Yes.

77
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,920
Cause you have yellow, buttery popcorn
team. They're nice. But they're not.

78
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,180
They're not.
I'm not going to make two trips.

79
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm doing it for my own because I know
myself. So it's like you have me there.

80
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm like, just sign, sign me up for it.

81
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,200
And I made the same exact mistake when I
had my crown put on and then I go, yeah,

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,970
well I'm already there.
Why not?

83
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,230
That's why I tapped out of the whitening
early because I was overwhelmed with

84
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,170
pain and why you were
overwhelmed with him though.

85
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,780
You haven't been having your mind to
understand that not everybody is in a

86
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:25,040
relationship, but get a boyfriend, get
a girlfriend, how fun life is short,

87
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,760
have sex, but of course
be safe. Don't get an STD.

88
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,390
I say protect yourself,

89
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,590
but definitely enjoy life,
man milk. It's so amazing.

90
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,300
It's so amazing.
Many of you have been saying,

91
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,250
but it's not vegan

92
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,380
because it is an animal
product as humans are mammals.

93
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,210
But if you look up,

94
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,020
the definition of Vegan is actually
about not taking advantage of the animals

95
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,950
and not using their products,

96
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,400
stealing away really their
products for your own benefits.

97
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,140
But if you don't a girl and you have a
boyfriend and he gives you his men milk,

98
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,940
you're not taking advantage of anybody.
If anything it is a win win situation.

99
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,640
So technically it's safe guys.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,080
I kind of feel like I would like
to start maybe that position,

101
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:20,060
maybe start that movement that man milk
is Vegan and it is harmful to the mammal

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,910
and that you're taking my
product, my mail. You know what,

103
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I can't help but think of our initial
business proposal of calm gum and didn't

104
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,760
we do on to like the pump station
where you could go and you could have

105
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:40,640
different races and they would come and
then you could choose your flavor like a

106
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:45,641
Latin guys just or black guy come gum or
one of your own fantasies come jump was

107
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,550
to have different flavors from
different men in the middle of the gum,

108
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,140
like a tight, like that title wave tools
have this new pump station fantasy that,

109
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:59,030
I don't know. We came
up with this ages ago.

110
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,620
I remembered the pump station, it's not
called the pump station, it's called.

111
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,910
It was like Jamba juice and it was like
different come smoothies and it was

112
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,850
different guys

113
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,130
come gum is all these different guys
have different races are dumping their

114
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,930
loads can come out of it.

115
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,960
And it's like mentos where you can
buy everybody's race right now or no.

116
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,640
And they're like,
what about these two for new Sitcom?

117
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,810
You'll check them out and then we're
talking about there's something not right,

118
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,070
there's something wrong. Um, yeah.

119
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,610
So I mean she's a really cool
check though. I like her.
I think she's cool. Yeah,

120
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,800
I think the veganism angle is very
important. I really, you know,

121
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:49,010
I never really thought of the fact that
you were totally taking advantage of me,

122
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:53,240
but I will say that she is
enlightening me in that regard.

123
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,570
So what are you saying that you want
back payment for all the free loads?

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,870
Will I just feel like,
you know,

125
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,430
that you're just using me as an animal
for this product and that that is a,

126
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,670
I mean it's the level of disrespect.

127
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:15,560
It's a level of manipulation
and I just deserve, um,

128
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,490
credit for and maybe,

129
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,790
maybe I would like you to stop taking
advantage of me, you know, I mean,

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,360
that's what I'm saying. What if we used
your product for, other than making,

131
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,550
uh, our son. I mean,

132
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:34,280
I don't really use your product for
my child using Mondays to feel good,

133
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,800
to feel powerful, feel strong, and nothing
makes you feel as strong as you said,

134
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,740
the best part of your week. I never
said that. You've said that before.

135
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,080
It's really the most powerful way to
start your day is full of proteins.

136
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,820
That makes you really strong. Tug
and loans all the time. I mean,

137
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,750
less so happy.
What is this accent she has?

138
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,870
She says vitamins.
So we know we're,

139
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,300
we're talking Australia, maybe
New Zealand, maybe England.

140
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,180
So maybe, uh, who else has vitamins?

141
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,900
It's like a British thing. Yeah, but she
doesn't have the accident anywhere else.

142
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,630
But she talks, she does talk
weird. It's not American history.

143
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,880
If you can detect something here and by
weird, I mean not American at man milk,

144
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,630
drink it, slurp, it's for Vegan.
Enjoy that man. Milk, drink it,

145
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,410
slurp it, suck it. Likud
did I say lick it already,

146
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,910
but definitely enjoy guys
and have a happy milk man.

147
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:39,750
Milk Monday.

148
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:43,440
Hopefully you guys all get a little bit
of milk out of your system and into your

149
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:48,400
girlfriends or boyfriends and vice
versa. Enjoy each other guys. My,

150
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,610
my theory is that she is European,

151
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,880
but she moved many years ago like Canada
or the u s and so she has a hint of an

152
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:59,780
accent. Maybe she moved when
she was like nine or 10 yes.

153
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,230
10 minutes. So maybe to the Canadiens
save the two men. No, I don't think so.

154
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,810
No. I say vitamin D. Yeah.
Wait a minute. I'm Canadian.

155
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,650
I should know this. You are Canadian
and Ontario. We didn't take vitamins.

156
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,590
No, no. And Windsor. That's where
I was born. SLURP it. Suck it.

157
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,030
We drink beer for vitamins in Windsor.

158
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,800
It's really the most powerful way to
start your day. That's a stupid dummy.

159
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,440
Cool. What are you talking about?
Dope. What a dope and disrespectful.

160
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,100
You're so jealous. I am. I'm so envious.

161
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,080
I cannot stop thinking and we haven't
been able to stop making fun of the Moose

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,340
Soup Lady.
Oh my God.

163
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,170
That was one of the most
amazing women people ever,

164
00:11:56,171 --> 00:12:00,620
ever to appear on the show ever.
Yeah.

165
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah. She's, Oh gee.

166
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,210
People have sent in there a photo
submissions of what they imagined that she

167
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:15,050
looks like and they're out of control.
I between you, the few of them. Amazing.

168
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,420
Amazing.
Have you seen what they've said?

169
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,830
Um, no. Fuck. Let me see
if I can pull it. No,

170
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,700
but it's really someone wrote
in and they're like, we, um,

171
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,530
in Canada we have these types of people,
they live on the river and they're like,

172
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,030
they claim to be broke, but
they can afford water toys
a lot, which I thought was,

173
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,860
that's like, it's so indicative,
right? Like I'm poor,

174
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:42,610
but I can afford like
a jet ski and a boat.

175
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,540
Okay. All right. Listen, I see.

176
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,190
That was great. Louie
Anderson from the, uh,

177
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,250
what's the shared goals or something?
Oh, Zach, but golf inaca show.

178
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,110
Yeah, that's Sofa in that
show is I like, and it like,

179
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:07,680
it's perfect you guys
coming down from this. So

180
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,220
I feel like,

181
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,543
man,

182
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,790
I feel like,
yeah,

183
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,660
I feel like she could probably
charge her the sex crimes. You know,

184
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,810
I can almost hear the the prosecutor.

185
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,710
Yeah.
I'm saying like a defendant,

186
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,950
your honor came over to my victim,

187
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,070
forced herself upon him and did horrific
things that frankly we do not want even

188
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:51,680
describe here in this courthouse.
Dirty Bitch. You know,

189
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:53,390
it's like there's,
you can,

190
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,830
you can feel that she is so many bottoms.

191
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,610
So many guys. They were like, I was
real fucked up. I was a, I was damn it.

192
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:06,200
I was having fucking moose suit back
then with this lady. Just, it was the,

193
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,480
what's her name? We haven't
given her Cheyenne. No rush.

194
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:13,290
She is kind of a Trish, you
know. Oh, she's at trash. Yeah.

195
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,710
Calm down. Yeah. And Karen
are a trend. Yeah. Seriously.

196
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,860
That's what I picture when I'm
waiting and that lady had it. Yeah.

197
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,960
Oh my God. That's what this is. We
found our treasure. You found tricks.

198
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:30,260
This totally hurt. That's what she's, Oh
my God, I don't even put that together.

199
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Yeah. And I looked up the recipe for moose
suit. Okay. Cause I'm like, is this real?

200
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,630
Yeah. Yes, that'd be real. It is.
Real people put chunks of Moose.

201
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,770
And now here's the thing. It's actually
very similar to Hungarian Goulash.

202
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,560
Lavish slash

203
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,393
that's what

204
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,320
Goulash lavash Goulash soup.

205
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,960
It's very similar except use moose meat
and there's Paprika in there. Onion,

206
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,760
garlic, Goulash, lie, lie. She's
like I just said Paprika, onion,

207
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,590
some kind of meat in there.
Smokey pepper flavor. Yeah,

208
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,780
yeah, yeah. That's what I'm
saying. It's, it's just a stew.

209
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,370
But I think they put poverty Kennan.
And that's what I read about Moose Soup.

210
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,430
So it's very similar,

211
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,750
Trish. Trish. God dammit that for sure.

212
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,640
She's so nasty.

213
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,330
She's not a nasty is you and your,
um,

214
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,810
acrobatic farts lately?
Acrobatic farts. Yeah.

215
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:36,410
I've been noticing and I don't know if
it's because it's a summer dad time.

216
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:40,760
And you're in your time. I got shorts on
right now. I've got summer shoes on. Yeah.

217
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:44,240
You're kind of like Velcro straps
on. Yeah. You feel it free.

218
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:49,250
I over those little shoes we put on
our kids. They're like ugly sandals,

219
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,050
but for kids you let it go, right? Yeah,
it's cute on he ripped them off probably.

220
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:58,250
I took him outside and then he was like,
ah fuck. He's like, he's a terrible,

221
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,080
come on. I ain't no Quia. So
I'd take them off our boy.

222
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:07,880
But you've been taking a
lot of license with your,

223
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,430
your acrobatic farts? I don't, I
don't, I mean I'm doing it the regular,

224
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,350
I do my hand gestures. I'll do like
a punch or like a gunshot thing.

225
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,080
Sometimes a leg kick, but don't think
it's any different than, you know,

226
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,890
another time we were even doing
a lot of the diaper me baby,

227
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,340
where you pull your legs up on a cup back,
but not a lot.

228
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,540
A couple more now I feel like it's been
a lot more frequent. Hold the legs up.

229
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,290
I'm like changed me and then I, yeah,
I did that one. I did that sitting up,

230
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,990
which was different because I was up late.

231
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,420
I did it sitting up and it got like
a real interesting pitch on it.

232
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,120
Oh my God.
The best one now.

233
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,920
We were in the living room and the nanny
was over and we were playing with Lj

234
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,240
and then the nanny and LJ go out of
their room and then you rip a horrendous

235
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,670
fart and then you're like,
oh, I gotta take a shit.

236
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,320
And then you leave me there with the fart.
And the whole time I'm thinking, oh no,

237
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:04,000
the nanny is going to come back in here
and she's going to smell this far and

238
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:07,310
she's going to blame it on me. And I kept
planning my story where I was going to,

239
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,910
I was just going to tell her like Tom Farr
did, you know she's raised three boys.

240
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,830
She knows what farts smell like.
She knows that those are man farts to you.

241
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,620
And she disgusting. You know, since
we're talking about this figure,

242
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,930
we should bring up this email.

243
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,010
I'm Mommy's after originally hearing
about your podcast or Tom when he was on

244
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:25,700
Joe Rogan,

245
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,640
I subsequently became addicted to the
listening to all the Shenanigans Youtube

246
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,381
provide for us.

247
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:33,950
All your segments are hilarious and the
way the sound board gets worked during

248
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,951
the episodes makes my nip hard enough
to cut glass or sorry enough to glass.

249
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,250
I am touching base to provide a small
jingle that I created for your brown talk

250
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:45,800
segments.
I love the locomotive theme that you use.

251
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:49,140
I wanted to provide another sound file
you can use in case you want to mix it up.

252
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,380
I took some of the clips you've mentioned
over the past month or so in the

253
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:55,460
podcast. Compose a small
arrangement to accompany at.

254
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,550
I'm a lifelong musician having
experienced in both instruction and live

255
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,930
performance. I'm a complete novice when
it comes to mixing audio clips on my Mac.

256
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,620
Oh good.
I'm glad we included this solution.

257
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,980
If the file for any reason doesn't
sound quite right, let me know.

258
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:14,140
I can edit and send it back to
you. Well here we go. This is um,

259
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,160
Levens a submission. He signed off
by saying Tom is a personality champ.

260
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:24,150
That bird is once again fat, um, Livan
submission of a new brown talk theme.

261
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,340
So you can see what you
think. Okay, here we go.

262
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,213
Time.

263
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,030
It's got a lot of elements. I ain't
no way it's got the Jane, Oh my God.

264
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,750
You there's, Oh, disgusting. I liked it.
I liked it too. That's good. Thank you.

265
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:01,350
Leave on. Thank you, Lee.

266
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,780
Yvonne, not live on, on leave on. Hmm.

267
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,270
So you name emails. Can we go into
some choice ones that I got? Yeah,

268
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,450
absolutely. Um, let's see.
Hold on. I wanted to see

269
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,820
there's a number of, um,
interesting ones that came in.

270
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,840
Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I want to
find the, we've been asking about, uh,

271
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,820
blind people, um, and
if they can, hold on,

272
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:31,370
let me make sure. Sorry, I'm sorry.
I thought I had this eerie go.

273
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,810
She's a blind guy on the blind wipes.

274
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:37,240
So we asked this question a
two or three weeks ago now,

275
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,880
how to blind people know
when they're done wiping.

276
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,010
And we've had a lot of different theories.

277
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:47,011
Tom's theory was that you go bare handed
and you smell your fingers to see if

278
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,400
the wipe is done. And to which I reply,
why would you use your bare hand? Yeah,

279
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,620
just try the toilet.

280
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,580
Well,
I think blind people are more,

281
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,590
have more in like in touch with
the real senses and they don't.

282
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,640
They like to use.

283
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,920
Okay, so hey mom, did you find out? Yeah,

284
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,390
I'm a blind guy and I believe I have
answers to some of your questions. Yeah.

285
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,930
First off, in response to your
guesses, I can't stress this enough.

286
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,160
You cannot smell the paper.
Paper is unruly.

287
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,580
You're more likely to give yourself
a dirty Sanchez and anything else.

288
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:24,414
How about that?

289
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,130
Smelling your fingers while safer
than paper still isn't viable.

290
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,470
The paper act as a barrier. Muddying
the results if you will. Second,

291
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,370
as you probably heard, when you lose
one sense, the others get better. Hey,

292
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,610
now a blind person's sense of touch,

293
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,080
much like Burt's current weight
is off the scale when wiping.

294
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,110
I can tell from the friction during the
wiping process if it needs more amazing

295
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,170
between the nerves and the brown eye,
the crack and my fingertips.

296
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,730
The speed and ease at which the
paper moves and years of experience.

297
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,440
You learn what glass and a
clean uncanny valley feels like.

298
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,540
Yeah. Isn't that interesting? He
had vision and then he lost it.

299
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,540
So He's had both, uh,
both sides of the fence,

300
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,090
just unbelievable. Yeah.
That's pretty interesting
stuff, Huh? Yeah, that's crazy.

301
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,220
I also got another Ge.
We are,

302
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,370
she's so good. God dammit, this guy,
he's blind, but he can just, you know,

303
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,570
he's got a great sense of touch.

304
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,610
O m g so also we asked,
uh,

305
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,920
Ken Blind people be
racist. Uh Huh. So, um,

306
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,520
this person writes in, hey, Hitler's,

307
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:44,890
I was just glass and then the
latest podcast when mommy,

308
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:48,520
Tina read the email wandering and
blind people can be racist. A subject.

309
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:52,360
I have some experience and I'm friends
with a girl who has been blind since

310
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:57,361
birth and me and my friends have made
her guests the races of people in a room

311
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,410
and she always gets it, right. Nope.

312
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,030
I'm not saying she's racist,

313
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,980
but blind people can definitely tell
what race people are just by the way they

314
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:13,240
speak high and tight. Fucking
Anthony. Yeah, that makes sense.

315
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,850
And the guy's name before that was ray.
Thank you,

316
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:20,020
ray for sending that email
and about wiping. Very
interesting. Very interesting.

317
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,340
Yeah.

318
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,290
So I'm guessing she's talking about
maybe diction, right? Like you can,

319
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,140
she hears a voice. She's
like, oh, that's a Asian guys.

320
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,190
Can I tell you that when I listen to the
radio, I can often tell black people.

321
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,150
Yeah, we can hear it. There's a
different quality like I, you know,

322
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,690
you can just big words.
No I don't.

323
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,590
I don't think that and I know that

324
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,020
big words now babe.
What? I don't, I don't,

325
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,180
that's not what I'm talking about.

326
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,140
Hi Personality observation and
water champ also. Hi Tom. Okay,

327
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,283
that's,
that's

328
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,883
it's a lot.

329
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,700
Oh also I thought he meant in addition
to all those things but he means,

330
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,220
and then, hi Tom. Yeah, I
like this email already.

331
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,590
Love the episode with our e shave her.

332
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,310
He is a very funny non Jewish Jewish men.

333
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,960
Near the end of the episode when
talking about the houses you've done the

334
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:22,640
podcast in, I couldn't help but inquire
where these homes were. You know,

335
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,140
on account of me being a complete
creep of poly by non binary.

336
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,180
I happened to notice on the googles map
that silver lake is right next to just

337
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:36,770
Glassell park. Have you ever lived there
and why don't you live there currently?

338
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,250
Thanks Jean. Rick and Canada. Um,

339
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,500
where did we live?
We live in

340
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,890
Glassell park. That, that totally

341
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,010
near, near near. No. Uh, but no,

342
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,230
we lived in silver lake
and he's right about that.

343
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,460
I mean you want to say what streets we
lived on? I don't know. I'm trying to,

344
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm trying to figure out where this
park is cause I forget where it is.

345
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,320
Glass Sell Park is the city,
I think next to it.

346
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,890
It's like a tiny little see

347
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,600
Washington,
that's where hipsters are now to Atwater.

348
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,080
And then silver lake before
our, yeah, Glendale Eagle Rock.

349
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,780
We didn't live in just Glassell
park. Silver Lake. We lived more,

350
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,610
we're over here, right over here
near the reservoir. Yeah. So yeah,

351
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,230
I lived here once on Silver Lake
Boulevard when I was dating you.

352
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,670
And then I lived, we lived over here.
Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. That was fun.

353
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,800
I enjoyed silver lake.
And the reason,

354
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:40,700
I mean there's a few reasons we don't
currently live there. I think it

355
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,280
very, you know, for us, we just
kind of got lame. We got it.

356
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,580
We had a kid and we wanted to
have more sprawl to a look.

357
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:52,190
I have a lot of cool
hipster friends is too many.

358
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,590
There's too many of that neighborhood.
It's just too much.

359
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,630
I remember being in my late thirties
and going to the trader's Joe there and

360
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,631
just seeing too many guys with ironic
hats and mustaches and I was like,

361
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm done. I was never that guy. I
could live around them for awhile.

362
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,630
I can't run them. Yeah, they they.

363
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,160
It's really kind of for some
racist against hipsters.

364
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:20,230
Are you hipster phobic or does
fucking, that's how I am. Disrespect.

365
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Respect their pronouns. I should have
been a little more respectful of it,

366
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:28,190
but I just went for it. You know? I
just went for it. Hey. Hi. How are you?

367
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,300
What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?

368
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,310
Someone wanted to tell you this deserves,

369
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,220
he deserves Christina counterfactual.

370
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Champion repeatedly claims in accordance
with her mother's ancient gypsy wisdom.

371
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,760
I'll turn it in fact, guys farts.
Push the shit out. They do.

372
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,710
This is fake news. Tom Has never once
challenges obviously false statement.

373
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Shame on both of you.
Think about it. Dummies.

374
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,890
You Shit then far to bunch.
No,

375
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,990
you fart a bunch then. Shit. As far
it's pushed the shit out. Listen.

376
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,100
Therefore,
obviously the shits pushed the farts out.

377
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,360
Scientifically speaking.
This is super fucking obvious.

378
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,790
The poop makes gas and the gas
escapes pushed along by the poop.

379
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,390
I mean come on love forever.
Double Pipe slot wife.

380
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,960
Yeah, so what you're saying is
farts. Don't push the shit out.

381
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,900
Just it's a total mind blower.
Wrong.

382
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,420
If we're going out for the horse ever.
We've got it.

383
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:38,060
We got it all wrong.
God dammit is right.

384
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,330
Shit cannot believe this.
Crazy.

385
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,890
Here we go. Hope we'll just change.
Do you want to say it to your mother?

386
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,010
If she were here, do you want to tell
her mom? This whole time we had it wrong.

387
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,790
You had a wrong mom.
It's not the far to push shit out.

388
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,310
This shit out.

389
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,350
But you know what we can do now that
we are armed with this knowledge. Yeah,

390
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,700
we can teach our son the right way.
Yeah,

391
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,820
we can break the chain in
the family knowledge tree.

392
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,830
Tell our son the right thing. Train
him, if you will. Oh, by the way,

393
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm so excited that our son has started
making fart noises with his mouth.

394
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,390
That's awesome. And he's really
started to take to the fart humor.

395
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,990
The fart bought books that I bought him.
It's all coming together. I'm sorry,

396
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:30,140
I just what? This is a super
brown episode. There's an

397
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,543
male here.

398
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,780
My horrible first to shower.

399
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,900
I just imagined him going so bad here.
Hear it. Maybe I can coach this person.

400
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,420
Hey Mommy's. I originally had my
first shit to shower experience,

401
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:48,040
but things didn't go so well.

402
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,090
I was having a day where even the softest
of sevens were being put out to Shane.

403
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,700
I'm talking straight up
pissing out of my ass.

404
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,460
So after I made Brown
and wipe to no avail,

405
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:05,050
I hopped in the shower to clean up
some more. In the middle of all this,

406
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:08,830
I realized I had to shit again.
Obviously I'm soaking wet,

407
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,330
can't get back on the toilet. So I
decided to go straight down the shower.

408
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,690
No, no, no, no.

409
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,270
The worst part is I had to bend
over and clean my fucking feet.

410
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,480
I couldn't help but feeling low
and loose for the rest of the day.

411
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,580
I was so ashamed of what I had done.

412
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,020
Any advice for this first time
shower shitter? What are your,

413
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,540
what is your experience with
shower Brown's? Thanks Stu. Stu

414
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,300
and listen to this man. There's so many
things you did wrong. Okay. Number one,

415
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,250
you never shut down your shower drain.

416
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,760
I feel like that's just a given and I
should have been more explicit when I

417
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,120
talked about my methods.
Never ever shit in the shower.

418
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,860
That's not the point of shit to shower.

419
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,330
The point of shit to shower is to just
clean up after you're done browning.

420
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:54,280
So well you need to do is be patient
with yourself, with your browns.

421
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,350
If you know you're having waves, a
painful sevens, give yourself some time.

422
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,950
Why are you hurrying to the shower?
You know it's going to be a longer time.

423
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,560
So take your time with your brown.
Yeah.

424
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,550
And then when you know you're
absolutely finished, then you go shower.

425
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,480
And if not just dry off and get back on
the toilet. I've done that before too.

426
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,700
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

427
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,020
Why not just wrap a towel around yourself
and sit down on the toilet and then go

428
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:22,620
back into the shower after
that? It's fine for it. Yeah.

429

So that's really good advice. I
think. I hope he, he listens to you.

No, but what does that draw is,

474
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,780
is that a southern in the
clue? Uh, I'm not sure.

475
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,630
I'm not sure where he's
a clue where he's from.

476
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:10,370
Let's look it up and just look it
up. I'm going to guess so. Yeah,

477
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:14,070
I think you're right, right? Yeah, you're
right. Got that southern draw. Atlanta.

478
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,540
Atlanta. Yeah. That's
funny. I like his tattoos.

479
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,870
So you think you're a cooling fan or no,
I'd have to hear it.

480
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,880
That's the thing I don't
really know. Might really play.
Yeah, I know. Um, you know,

481
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:29,940
they're all, you know, they're
all in the trap selling drugs.

482
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,620
Um, okay. Um,

483
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,680
that big China was,
she was she traveling,

484
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,980
you know, a, they

485
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,770
give credit to a three, six
mafia for doing it. He's credit,

486
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,550
they're credited with some of
that. Um, trap. Okay. I like them.

487
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,080
You like Gucci Mane? Yep. You
like Jeezy you took a picture
of him once. Yeah, I do.

488
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:57,440
I like it with them, but other than
that, coming back from Atlanta. Yeah.

489
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:02,030
See he's on the same flight. I mean that
is trap fucking Mecca, right? Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,370
I could see you. I could see you
starting like a your own group

491
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,940
man. Trap music. Trap Pussy music.
Yeah. Mom, trap pussy. Yeah. Mama,

492
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,550
Mama, Mama Z. It's all torn up.
What did you call your special that,

493
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,710
that's a really good idea. Do you think
my manager would like that? I Dunno.

494
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,080
Could you see his face? I'm like,
I'm going to call it mom pussy.

495
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,780
Like you get your offer and the like,
they want to do it and you're like, great.

496
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,530
It's called mom pussy.
Ah, I don't think so. Um,

497
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,190
you know what's funny?
The other day you were um,

498
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,250
you were talking like an old black guy.
I forget what you'd sell it to.

499
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,890
Are you talking about? I
think you were like, don't,

500
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:44,720
don't look at the TV because I
remember there was, I had no,

501
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:48,390
I had a, I had an old boss, um,

502
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,100
well he's like 20 years ago
I used to work for it, Nate,

503
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,330
and he would always be like,

504
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,450
kid got all the kids over here
looking at the TV all day.

505
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,020
And I've heard that before.
Like older black guys, they
always say, look at the TV.

506
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:01,890
Yeah.
It's such like a specific phrasing.

507
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,410
Yeah. Right. Uh, also it's um, where you
staying, right. Where are you staying?

508
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,810
Staying as opposed like a,

509
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:12,350
I'm staying over at staying in this
neighborhood. I'm staying at this.

510
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,390
Oh, okay. Not like I'm living there. Oh
wait. Right, correct. Yeah, that's right.

511
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,610
The specific difference in mind. That's
funny. That's interesting to stay,

512
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:25,320
I stay over on the east side. Correct. As
opposed to I live on, right, right. Yeah,

513
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:27,030
that's,
that's a very specific thing.

514
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,100
But I always loved the
idea of looking at TV,

515
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,250
look at the quit looking at a TV,

516
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:37,000
get over here and trying to look at the
TV and I'm trying to look at the TV,

517
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,280
which actually be, think
about it. It makes sense. You
are looking at the TV. Yeah,

518
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,880
that's, that's I think grammatically
and logic are staying on the east side.

519
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:50,910
Correct? Correct. It's
coherent. Yeah. I Dunno.

520
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,220
I always made me laugh looking at
the TV. Look at the TV man. Yeah.

521
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:57,700
My old boss used to say that. It's like
we were wasting time looking at the TV.

522
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,340
This is so fucking cool

523
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,120
about to show you.
Okay.

524
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,160
You think you're ready and
I know that you're not,

525
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,023
but okay.

526
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,660
The thing is this guy has given us
so much and he never stops giving us.

527
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,530
Oh,
best part

528
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,140
here is

529
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,680
the, yeah. G. Oh good.

530
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:31,180
Talking to people on the up in space.

531
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,223
They're literally,

532
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,220
oh, swap, slap,

533
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:39,180
slap up and they're on like a
station or something. Okay. Okay.

534
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,050
He'll let the conversation begin.
He's going to Dad Boehner out.

535
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,400
Oh goodness. The CSUN. Are
you ready for the event?

536
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,960
Right? Ready for the
event. These two sky nerds,

537
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,050
they're books.
Please call station for a voice

538
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,340
nodes station. This is Garth Brooks.
How do you hear me look at that.

539
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,950
That is so, there we go. Can you hear us?

540
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,520
Yes, I can't hear you.
You sound and look great.

541
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,100
Look at that smile.
Is that the,

542
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,810
is that a real genuine dad?
Look,

543
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,610
you think this is the look of a
psychopathic serial killer. It is both.

544
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,840
And I think this might be
the first authentic moment
I've ever seen from Garth.

545
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,450
Like he's truly in awe.
He's truly, I look,

546
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:26,170
this guy has so much money and
fame and popularity in everything.

547
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,240
Nothing dazzles him anymore. The fact
that he's looking at humans in space,

548
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,830
I think it genuinely is blowing his dad
mind right now. Yeah, that could be true.

549
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,210
Yeah, be true. Cause she can't do too
many interviews out nurse. When you're,

550
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,980
you know,
hanging on a wall,

551
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:48,210
do you guys get used to that position or
is there any time where the gravity is

552
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:52,660
at your feet at all? Is there a room in
there or do you have to wait to get back?

553
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,460
I'll go look it up. Oh, you missed
it. Sorry. I'll just fucking phone.

554
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,720
Tripoli's outside guys.
Kim,

555
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,410
that position or the weight,

556
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,440
is there any time where the
gravity is at your feet at all?

557
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:07,180
Is there a room in there or do
you have to wait to get back

558
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,390
such a dad?
Man,

559
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,940
he looks like he's dad jazz and
right now it's like man milk Monday.

560
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,510
And I do think they're trimming
his beard a little too short.

561
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,350
They're doing it wrong.
They're not doing like,

562
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,640
he needs to see Alan because this is
not okay. Got It. Good luck. All right,

563
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:28,300
let's go get the Great Sam. Sorry Sam.
He standing out. Sign as hot as balls.

564
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,560
Good rescue. But wait, let's, let's keep
exploring this because I don't want to,

565
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,990
this is really funny. I think it's really
genuine. Can I stop now? Yeah. Okay.

566
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm just excited. I like, but
stop talking. Alright, we,

567
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,010
we ran out and we, uh, we brought
in something we found on the street,

568
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,710
the Great Sam Aaa.

569
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,450
He's got six trashcan.
That's balling.

570
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,110
I'm like six trash trashcan
of all different colors, man.

571
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:59,680
You guys don't fuck around.
Did I wish we actually had six trash cans?

572
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,220
We have two trash cans. Oh,
to recycling cans. Yeah.

573
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,720
And to um, what is it
green? It's like green,

574
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:11,350
like poor people don't recycle and
they don't give a fuck about Greenberg.

575
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,630
That's fine. Baller status right
there. I've never been like green,

576
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,500
very green and recycling.

577
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,170
I wash plastic and paper towel. I
mean fucking plates man. No, it's a,

578
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:25,390
first of all, thank you for
coming. It's, it's, I don't know.

579
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,340
Did we ever have you on before?
Yeah,

580
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:31,600
I did the other room and we
played a sound body sound.

581
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,980
Now it's something a black guy or
Tom or back. Yeah, we played Tom or

582
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,850
black. Wow. And I did really well. Did
you that, yeah, it's on my Wikipedia.

583
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:40,684
We've had,

584
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,790
we've had two people almost win it all.

585
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,070
I didn't remember if you were, because
we had two people get one wrong, uh,

586
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,010
one or two wrong. That
was, um, what's her name?

587
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,670
Miss Pat and Rogan the
first time he was on.

588
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,220
And then one guy go,

589
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,920
oh for 10 and as a black
Guy Sydney Castillo,

590
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,450
he got zero out of 10 it
means something too. Right.

591
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,890
That should be just as amazing.
That's true. You're right.
Fuck up that bad. Yeah.

592
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,140
And to be black, not to
know your name. Amen.

593
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,730
I can remember when they tried to
use it in the Oj Simpson trial,

594
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,300
like it was a black voice and
they're like, that's kind of racist.

595
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,900
So it's got a black voice. It's
not, we were just talking about,

596
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,620
oh we're just talking about, I can
tell like when I listen to radio shows,

597
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:34,380
if the color is black, I know 100%
or my favorite thing is, is uh,

598
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,670
Jason Tebow always talks about this.

599
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,850
They should just do a podcast of Mexican
callers in the sports radio shows

600
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,450
because they're so bad.

601
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,980
And the radio guys have to kind of like
pat do patty cakes with them cause they

602
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:50,230
don't want to piss off their
entire audience for us.

603
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,130
Everything they should bring
back. Colby Bryant. I was like,

604
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:57,310
we're talking about the Dodgers here. I
don't know man. I think in, they're like,

605
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,040
hey guy, just talking him through. It

606
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,030
starts with a d there's a black guy or no,

607
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,050
I'm going to say black guy
or a guy wanting to be black.

608
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,130
That's true. Uh, the gentleman, we were
just listening to you, but the trap.

609
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,170
Oh, to see if he can guess. Yeah. Can
you just do the audio or you oh sure. No,

610
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,450
I can do the audio. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Hold on. Let me close this.

611
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:33,070
I got to close it so that he so
good. Yeah. So let's see. Can you

612
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,163
damn,
that

613
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,570
shit will be 1000 but ain't gonna be
able to bounce sheet and we'd go to the

614
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,710
screw glue. Cool. Oh, it was a mall there.

615
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,740
You back to pull up or an edge rock
talk more off of old fat Buddha Shit for

616
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,870
same way to the side.

617
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,220
Can you guess the race? Definitely
black. And I'm going to go,

618
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:55,800
he's going to the club and
he's throwing thousand dollars.

619
00:40:55,801 --> 00:41:00,210
Then everybody and his friend
comes up in some bullshit car.

620
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,770
Oh, it's not bad. It's an
interesting interpretation. Correct?

621
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,780
No, no, but that was, I mean, you hit,
you hit some of the important notes.

622
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,280
I think that's really all that matters.

623
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,940
I don't think that guy was looking for
you to ever see that video where the

624
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:19,680
amigos were almost kind of fight it. The
A bt or course. So good. First of all,

625
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,420
uh, a black award shows are the best
that she just lied, stirring backstage,

626
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,860
stabbings and shootings.

627
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,810
So it's like the two Basser obviously
the Avs and any black horse show,

628
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:34,520
whether it's someone's either going
to get shot or, oh dean. So you know,

629
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:35,690
something good's gonna happen there,

630
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,120
but they had them on the
morning show and these,

631
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,870
the literally the black people couldn't
understand what the black people were

632
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:46,500
saying. They see, hey,
what you're doing so good.

633
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,070
It was really amazing. And uh, yeah,
this, you know, funny Ali Wong last night,

634
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,050
she told me that she went to that and
I assume, well, I assume that like,

635
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,550
you know, she's a known
person that, that she,

636
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,040
she got tickets to it.
Like she's like,

637
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:07,730
I just want it to be there at the
bet awards. I thought she was like,

638
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,680
you know she's a performer. She went
as like a celebrity. She was like, Nah,

639
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:16,340
like I requested tickets and I got them
and I went to it like just for fun just

640
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:19,470
to be at that. That's great. Like that's
what it sounds like. You want it to die.

641
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,310
Totally. Look at these classes. Of
course. I want to go to anything hip hop.

642
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:28,070
This is how languages start. I mean at
one point there were a couple of people,

643
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:31,580
everyone's talking the same and then just
things get weirder and weirder and now

644
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:35,480
that you've got Chinese Spanish and all
that shit because everybody just starts

645
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:36,560
talking their own fucking way.

646
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,750
I don't know if Christina extra saw the
Migos Joe Button thing. Did you see?

647
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,270
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

648
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,090
It's like a running joke.
You'll be left off that and boots,

649
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,830
boots,
boots,

650
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,293
boots

651
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,740
because ever since when you
went to jail even though.

652
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,480
All right,
we got to wrap this up though.

653
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,470
Hey listen man, I wish I could
talk to him. He goes longer.

654
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:18,800
Man is one of my favorite groups. I've
been coming for so long. Glad to succeed.

655
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,850
Don't they look like the black agent
smiths from the like Black Matrix?

656
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,310
I mean I thought it was SWV. That's
what I thought. It looked like

657
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,570
we're those bad seventies
polyester shirts to Fred.

658
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,320
Like people could make
everything look good.

659
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,010
They have a license to make
everything cool. It's amazing.

660
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,970
Anything cool and she's pregnant
like still afraid of getting, yeah,

661
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,150
she's going to try it again.
God, they never pull out.

662
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,340
There was a, I'd be afraid. Did you
see, I'm trying to pull this up.

663
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,870
I can't get pregnant twice.
Wait, what? Oh No, no. I'm saying

664
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,820
I just got that a terrible mom now

665
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,280
the blacks do y nerdy. No,

666
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,320
the video edit where they,
they put up,

667
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:23,210
pulled all the moments from that
and pushed in on it. Like the,

668
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:28,570
there's an an a cut of everything at that
Migos thing and it was just like this,

669
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,150
the key, they zoomed in on everyone's
reactions. It's like it's masterful,

670
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,340
masterfully done and they were able to
like isolate everybody's own reactions to

671
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:46,230
what was going on. It was just amazing.
Men See if I can find it. All right,

672
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:49,750
keep going. Keep going. You're
talking. I just love it dude. I just,

673
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,800
I just love black people.
Yeah.

674
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,370
I'm going to get corn rows
and I know you've had issues.

675
00:44:54,371 --> 00:44:57,000
You've talked about white people.
Cornrows. I've talking about white people.

676
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,630
The corn rows. Yeah. I think I might
do. How much longer can I do corner?

677
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,980
I think this is the end of any corn rows
phase. I have. This is the last decade.

678
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,930
You can do it.
This is like last couple of years.

679
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,500
He can't go deep into your
forties with corn rows to do.

680
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:12,840
That's the question.

681
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,940
My big to the Mexican hairstyle
says just grow the tops, the tops.

682
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,950
How long? What does that mean?
Uh, like I have my hair right now.

683
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:26,850
Just let this thing growing. Yeah,
you can do that. Just go longer.

684
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:30,120
And that corn row it up and look
like Trey from grand theft auto.

685
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,730
That is such a specific look that would
really change your whole audience. Why?

686
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,210
It would make it even weird.

687
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,420
Like I used to have normal glasses when
I went up and I thought it looked like

688
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:43,270
Mark Marin and then I'm like, my act
is, and mark and Mark Marin's, Texas,

689
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,340
phenomenal, but we're just two totally
different dudes. These glasses,

690
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,410
Tom and I have discussed your glasses
like just laying in bed at night. Last,

691
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,000
Sam Tripoli's glasses are perfect,
perfect.

692
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,800
Talks about how perfect this look
is for people get weird by them.

693
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,920
They get really angry. First of
all, they all think they're fake

694
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,370
prescription.
Oh No,

695
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:09,960
they are though 100% I ended a
podcast because I went to a guy,

696
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,700
hey, are those, are those real glass? He
goes, no, I go, that's fucking stupid.

697
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:18,480
And we just had a huge blowup and we
never did a podcast. What do you mean?

698
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,120
I had a podcast called the
international bad boys.

699
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:26,121
Our me and my buddy were on it and
one day come in and I'm just like,

700
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:29,760
are those real glasses? He goes, no,
I go, that's fucking stupid. Why?

701
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:34,370
He wearing fake classes and we just,
it just kerosene on fire. Boom,

702
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,000
exploded and we just ended it.
What was his, um, his, I mean,

703
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:43,290
his thing was I just liked the way they
look or what I mean, nothing against him.

704
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:47,970
I didn't mean anything by it. Oh
yeah. And it just got really bad.

705
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,870
Who Was it? Easy Guy Works at the
store. He, we're way cool now,

706
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,260
but I'm happy it happened because now
I'm not in this new podcast called tin

707
00:46:55,261 --> 00:47:00,261
foil hat and I just do conspiracy theories
about lizard people and deep state

708
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:05,220
shit and creep. You end up 100%. Really?

709
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,340
I love it dude.
But do you really like,

710
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:09,900
do you really believe in
all the big ones then?

711
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:14,490
You're like 100% 100%.

712
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,250
Look at building six.
No one talks about building six.

713
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,700
It's imploded from the incident.
You believe though,

714
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:25,701
that the US government conspired to make
this happen to fuel a war like it was

715
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,800
at one of those? I believe that the, uh,

716
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,290
I think that there are,

717
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:37,380
we'll call them the deep state creates
problems in order to beg us to save us

718
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:41,260
from those problems to drug war.
Yeah. I mean, we find out that, uh,

719
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,040
you know that the CIA and one of
their assets was Pablo Escobar,

720
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,790
how all the cocaine get here. You
know, where it went into Arkansas,

721
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,440
who's governor? Bill Clinton went at the
time was smuggling all this cocaine and,

722
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,040
and that fueled the cocaine,
the crack wars, the crack,

723
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,250
a epidemic of all that stuff.
So then they beg us to say them,

724
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,890
the drug war against drugs,
blah, blah, blah. I think it's,

725
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:07,210
it's totally their moon landing.
I don't know about that one either.

726
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,300
We went to the moon.
We have two options.

727
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:13,390
Either we've never been passed the van
Allen Belt and it's all bullshit and it's

728
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:17,230
black ops to make the take money into
putting other stuff or we're on every

729
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:19,500
planet.
I don't think there's any inbetween.

730
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,170
I think Ron Moore planets I
think were everywhere. Yeah.

731
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,710
Why would we not say talk about it though?
Because I don't think,

732
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,960
I think in my opinion,

733
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,460
if you start saying that there are
aliens and there's stuff going out there,

734
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:37,120
I think one religion goes out the
door. Yeah. The thought of that.

735
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:40,080
We're the center of the universe and
that everything revolves around it.

736
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,330
Now there's like Japanese lizard
people running around, right?

737
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,230
Like straight up Asian looking mother
fuckers that that goes out the fucking

738
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:49,510
door.
I think it causes hysteria.

739
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,570
I think you're right because there's
so many hyper religious people in this

740
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:55,360
country they couldn't handle and
they control them through religion.

741
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,910
But here's my, my one reason that I don't
buy into a lot of conspiracy theories.

742
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,770
Have you ever done a military gig?

743
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,540
Like where they flown you from
country like the Middle East? Yes.

744
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,310
Have you ever been on the flights where
they schedule you like you're going to

745
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:13,490
go from Kyrgyzstan to Kandahar if
you've been on those military skills?

746
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,110
Are they ever a organized or,

747
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,250
I'm just saying that the military is
so fucking disorganized and you're

748
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:22,900
considered a VIP when you do those.

749
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,970
I just don't think that the government
has that much structure to be able to

750
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:30,490
pull off these things.
I just not that organized.

751
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,230
I understand that and I
totally agree with that.

752
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:35,440
But I think at the highest level, you
always hear this a lot like a, you know,

753
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:37,300
I've had discussion with Comedians,
they're like,

754
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,230
somebody would say something at some
point you're like, well people have,

755
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:43,990
and they kind of get discredited,
but the higher up you go,

756
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:47,770
there's less people involved. So
the numbers like a, this one comic,

757
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:52,540
I can't say her name did this, like
she did, uh, the super special forces.

758
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,260
Like we're the best of the
special forces all come into one.

759
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,120
And like every room she went to,

760
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:03,121
she had to sign a new doc saying that
she wouldn't tell anybody about it and

761
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:06,190
basically, uh, they'd kill
her if she said anything.

762
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:10,060
Like that's how top just told you on your
fucking Patt Air podcast to told me a

763
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,040
dog park.
But I,

764
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,610
but the point is it gets
deep and like we're in a,

765
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,600
we have special forces like 130 countries.

766
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:24,620
It's like I can name 130 countries, but I
always feel like one of the, I mean the,

767
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,160
the level of like for instance,
people that believe

768
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,440
that the moon landing is fake.

769
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,770
You would for it to be fake,

770
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,940
the level of the amount of people
that would be keeping a secret,

771
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,910
it would just, it would
be enormous. I mean,

772
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,960
you'd have to be fooling either
you're fooling everybody who's,

773
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:48,960
that's their work. Theirs,
they know that. No, it's, it's,

774
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:54,020
it's kind of difficult to believe or that
everybody involved for 50 years never

775
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,713
told a secret.

776
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:01,470
I understand that too. I'm just,
my whole p pain is, is the, the,

777
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,570
the farther up on the chain you get,
the harder and harder it gets there.

778
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:08,950
And they do a lot of,
a lot of analog analyzing you,

779
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,560
your habits, they spy on you, they get,

780
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,020
they get blackmail stuff and the
higher up you go, the more you're in,

781
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,920
the more you're in,
the more you have at stake.

782
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:20,140
So it's not like everybody at the bombs,

783
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:23,260
let's say like you're at the
comedy store. Yeah. Like there's a,

784
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:27,100
there's the open Mike. Hers.
Yeah, there's the regulars,

785
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,690
there's the headliners.

786
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:32,620
And then there's like the super duper
like theater dudes who are all doing all

787
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:35,910
that stuff. That's a very
concentrated group of people. Right.

788
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,020
And not everybody down here can go up
to here and hang out there. It's like,

789
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,250
it's very, it's hears of it. Yes.

790
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,600
And like the good and within a structured
environment to get up to that level is

791
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:48,010
harder and harder.
Yeah.

792
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,980
Now you post really great things on
Instagram. I love your Instagram.

793
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:55,670
What is it at, at Sam Triple Aaa,
and you have a great Facebook feed.

794
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,030
And I was at you who posted
the other day that the elite,

795
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,920
powerful men of the world are
all pedophiles. Oh yeah, no,

796
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:07,370
it's true. And here's old gay man.
Yeah, yeah. And here's the thing,

797
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,820
and now it's a right too.

798
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,890
[inaudible] was,
listen,

799
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:16,230
pizza gate was used to discredit
the pedo gate. So everyone's like,

800
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:20,250
oh, they're fucking kids and pizza
parlors. No, it's, it's much different.

801
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,230
And it goes,
this is deep state shit.

802
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,250
Hold on. Before we go ahead, go
ahead. Go ahead. The thing is,

803
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:29,650
I would not have believed that had I
not heard a woman on Paul Gilmartin's

804
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:34,660
mental illness happy hour podcast who was
a child victim of this exact pedophile

805
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:39,260
ring. And they would torture
her, keep her in a box,

806
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,940
put roaches on her and rape her and she
would tell she tells a story on Paul and

807
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:47,240
I'm serious and she's an actual person.
I don't think she made it up.

808
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:51,770
It sounds horrible. Whoa. That weird
weird shit does exist within the,

809
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:55,320
this is I, is this more darker than
I feel like I come into podcasts,

810
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,800
change everything he was saying,
well that was just terrible.

811
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:01,880
It

812
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,720
gets ugly and there's a reason for that
and it's like the higher up you go. Okay.

813
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:06,554
There's a couple of,

814
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,670
there's a big controversy going on right
now and read it and that there are a

815
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:15,050
couple of youtube channels and
Daniel Tosh did a big story on it.

816
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,200
The have over like 10 billion views that
are basically like corporate child porn

817
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,050
now. They're not like kids doing like, uh,

818
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,850
but it's insinuation, you
know, and it's like, looks
like, so if you free something,

819
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:33,330
it looks really creepy and there's
10 billion views on these legs,

820
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,600
right? So what they do is, my opinion is,

821
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,910
is this is how they start the
gather people like they're,

822
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,490
they're analyzing who are watching these
head, these videos, right? And okay,

823
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:46,110
that's great. And you're
like, okay, we know this guy.

824
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:50,550
But it's also other people with
darker things going, okay, who's,

825
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:55,670
who's maybe susceptible to this type
of stuff that's secretly what they are

826
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,860
into. Maybe this guy's
running for politics, right?

827
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,160
So now they fast track these guys and
they put them in these weird awkward

828
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:06,120
situations, film them, and then
they blackmail the fuck out of him.

829
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:09,630
There was a famous producer, they used
to throw cocaine and hookers shows,

830
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,310
I mean parties and he would
film everything. So if you
are up for negotiation,

831
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,310
they'd be, he'd be like, no dude, I'm not
going to sign for that. That's bullshit.

832
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:19,080
It's like, okay, let's watch this thing.

833
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,000
You doing coke out some trainee hookers
asshole. And then you're like, okay,

834
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:26,460
I'll sign for that. It's
like, I mean, as the money,

835
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,880
you got to think there's trillions
of dollars. Are we suggest,

836
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:34,130
I mean is the idea that people
in power are all pedophiles? No,

837
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:38,670
just no, but there's a lot.
There's a lot. Okay, dude, listen,

838
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,580
I feel like I'm, okay. So in my opinion,

839
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,040
within the conspiracy theory community,

840
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,610
there's a lot of antisemitism and I like
go in there and my girlfriend's Jewish

841
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:51,960
and I go in there and I go, I
go at it. Organized religions.

842
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,600
There's always this like, oh,
Jewish guys run the bank. It's like,

843
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:55,440
it's all bullshit.

844
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:00,470
It's all like organized religions are
to these very high up people are just

845
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:05,670
Halloween masks. They wear
them to move around us. And B,

846
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,540
because the truth of the matter is it's,
and this goes sound crazy as fuck.

847
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,500
It's Luciferian Shit. It's like
very, it's not like, Oh, hail Satan.

848
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:15,150
It's like very dark art shit.

849
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Now in the Vatican there is
a throne called the thrown
of Lucifer in the Vatican

850
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:26,340
in which the pope sits and behind him
is this big demon. Do just go, oh.

851
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:26,881
And it's like,

852
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:31,750
why is that in the fucking
Vatican world is weird.

853
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,230
It's really dark,

854
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:37,980
weird shit exists because
there's so many whack jobs.

855
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,230
I do feel like the older I get,

856
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,000
I you realize just how crazy everyone is.
And especially with the Internet,

857
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:49,890
you can see how crazy people
are all the time. Wait, are you,

858
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,330
please tell me, are you a believer
that sandy hook is a hoax?

859
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,570
I think there's interesting stuff to it.

860
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,760
There's us. What are you talking
about? If there's really,

861
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,720
I'm not saying it did or didn't happen.

862
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:09,770
Wait how I'm saying there's interesting
things that don't make a lot of sense

863
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:13,980
involved with it. Like what? Like first
of all, okay. Do you remember Columbine?

864
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:19,470
Okay. What do we see in Columbine? People
knocking out windows like Ha, like shut,

865
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,920
trying to crawl out to get away.
We see kids running all over the,

866
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,220
we see none of that.

867
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,680
We see one picture of one woman leading
a couple of kids out and it's a still

868
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,770
picture. There's nothing
out. The, uh, the,

869
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,510
the mom who's supposedly died lake
later on, she doesn't really exist.

870
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,640
She's, uh, she wasn't a teacher there,

871
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,150
then it turns out she was
like a substitute teacher
at another school somewhere

872
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:46,300
else. So there's just all these little
things that we start going, oh man,

873
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:47,800
that's kind of weird that,

874
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,330
I mean like if you go deep diving into
it and you got to go really deep because

875
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:56,050
if you're expecting that the,
the, the six of, excuse me,

876
00:56:56,051 --> 00:57:00,190
all the alphabet networks to tell you
everything. Well, back in the 90s,

877
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:05,220
the cleanse deregulate the media and
we went from a 88 different companies

878
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,530
owning 90% of the media to six
companies owning all the media.

879
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,660
So it's very,
and those companies,

880
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,460
they make more money off of other
shit than they do off of the media.

881
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:21,820
So the media is just used to fund
their other stuff. So anyways, there's,

882
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,890
there's a lot crazy.
Yeah.

883
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,250
Well what about the fake moon
landing? Garth Brooks, we saw him.

884
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,700
He, he's fake then. Well that's the thing.
Okay, so if the moon landing isn't real,

885
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,090
are they faking? Like all these
conversations with astronauts and shit.

886
00:57:36,091 --> 00:57:39,390
Like when we see them, you can't do too
many interviews out nurse. When you're,

887
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,810
you know, hanging on a wall,
there are thoughts about it

888
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,860
guys get used to that position or is there
any time where the gravity is at your

889
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:51,830
feet at all? Is there a room in there
or do you have to wait to get back?

890
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,810
Yeah, we uh, we have to
wait until we get back. Man,

891
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,040
I'm missing Nascar man. That's
why barbecue up here, you know,

892
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,870
saying he kind Kinda Husky for uh,
an astronaut. No, he's stocky there.

893
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,640
What's happening?

894
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,640
So thank you from the bottom of my heart
for being such an inspiration to so

895
00:58:12,741 --> 00:58:15,530
many and uh,
making those words count.

896
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,810
Wow. Thank you. Wow. See crying. Yup.

897
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,320
Thanks for hearing the music that says
that's a cool part of it and thanks for

898
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:24,440
letting me get to be a part of it.

899
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:31,040
So what's going on there? Do you
buy those tears? He's crying.

900
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:35,690
Just so those of you not watching Garth
Brooks, that brought him to tears. Yeah.

901
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,010
One of the two years that I guy was
like, I love you. I like your music

902
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,840
drawing that
has,

903
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,720
have you ever had someone compliment
you after a show and then you're like,

904
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:52,150
what's the greatest compliment?
It's really dirty and you
don't want to hear it.

905
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,473
Come on,
come on.

906
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,200
Wilfy you already ruined my opinion with
your Ms Pearcey so just tell me that

907
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,540
they said it this, it's
nasty. Somebody was just like,

908
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:04,930
I want to fucking eat.
You know this more.

909
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,910
The most gorgeous chicks I ever seen
in my life goes up and she goes,

910
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:11,000
your comedy, he makes me feel the same
way I get when I eat my own pussy.

911
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:15,290
I was like, Damn. And I was like,
that's pretty nice. That's very nice.

912
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:18,560
And that is a couple of kids in
wheelchairs that were very thankful to,

913
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:21,980
I did a special Olympic shell and
they were cool. Did Really? Yeah, I

914
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,520
did that. If that's a true, I'd
talk about it on stage and wait.

915
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,340
I remember years ago
I saw you have a will.

916
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,100
Do you do your wheelchair bit for them?
I always get asked to do it. It's a,

917
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,310
it's a young man's joke. I
can't do it. If I go down,

918
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:38,030
I can't come back. That's like, you know,

919
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:39,830
it's like you have your
memories of seeing stuff.

920
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:44,070
I remember Sam seeing Sam do
that in the main room, uh,

921
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,060
like a while ago, long time
ago. I remember you on the,

922
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:49,970
I actually remembered the same on the
same night. You know, you just have like,

923
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,440
you remember bits and pieces of things.

924
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:54,770
I remember seeing Aaron cater
the same night on the show.

925
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,790
We all got picked up the same time at
the world famous comedy store by Mitzi

926
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,130
Shore. She had picked us up
because she wanted an uh,

927
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,700
an Arab show and Dunkin was the,
this is so true.

928
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:09,110
Dunkin Dunkins like Tripoli. Are you a
Middle East? And I'm like, I'm Armenian.

929
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:10,370
He's like close enough.

930
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,670
And he taught me like there used to be
the secret to how to get picked up by

931
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:17,810
Mitzi and it was, you do a one
joke about you're a family member,

932
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:20,450
one joke about your ethnic group
and then do your favorite bit.

933
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,080
And so I had this bit that Joey
Diaz loved. Then I was like, okay,

934
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:27,440
I'm going to do that. Been at w I did
a joke about my mom power walking.

935
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,120
Then how me being furry,

936
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:33,590
going to the mall on going to the beach
and I just bit about Asians on ecstasy

937
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:36,890
that you used to do about how their
visuals are so much better because there's

938
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:37,970
so much smarter,
right?

939
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:41,930
Like dumb people's vigils or like eight
bit and their visuals are like Dolby,

940
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:45,960
Imax, digital sound. And
I get off stage and uh,

941
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,950
I saw Paul Mooney talking to
her and I'm like, aw man, he's,

942
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,380
cause back in the day when you
showcased the comedy store,

943
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,330
people would hijack your showcases
because, because they, they,

944
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,450
they weren't getting spots, so they had
to talk to Mitzi. So she remembered them.

945
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:04,130
Right. So, um, I looked down at Paul
Mooneys off and I'm like, fuck man.

946
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:07,140
And I'd had a weird running with
Moonee like two weeks earlier and,

947
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,190
which I was on stage at
this show it at the Hustler,

948
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,860
a hustler adult bookstore.

949
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:16,130
They had a comedy show there and it was
run by this guy named Johnny Montana,

950
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,480
who's like coked out of his skull and
he would just do jokes about his head

951
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:24,290
shots for like every week. And I was
due to joke about how, uh, how, uh,

952
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,820
how hard it is to be a white guy.

953
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:29,070
And I got off stage and Paul
Mooney ran up Migos, oh,

954
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,840
you ate white use Armenian user.

955
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,930
And he dropped the hard and
bomb Ami. Yeah. Wait, Whoa,

956
01:01:35,931 --> 01:01:40,430
we're not the word the m word.
Which one? He, okay. He goes, oh me,

957
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:45,320
you ain't white. Use a meaning.
Use a Nigga. And I was like, Damn.

958
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:50,120
The dude who coined the phrase basically
called me the ward. So I was like,

959
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:54,080
I don't know. Is this guy like me
or not? So I go, I go do the set,

960
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,860
I do the set. And I see him
talking to her and I'm like, fuck.

961
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:01,160
Mooney's talking to her. Well, it turns
out he really liked me and he goes, oh,

962
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:05,170
Mitzi, you got picked. This guy is
really fun, which is totally cool.

963
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:08,510
And I'm always thankful to Paul Mooney
for that. So I come out and I go,

964
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,160
and the whole thing is
after your showcase,

965
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,750
you walk up to Mitzi and you
kind of kiss the ring, right?

966
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:17,840
So I walk up and I'm like,
Hey Mitzi, thank you so much
for the showcase. She goes,

967
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:23,190
are you Syrian? And I didn't know what
the fuck's hearing was. And I'm like,

968
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:28,020
Yep, I'm totally fucking Syrian wa I love
Vienna, Syria and I love Syrian food.

969
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:31,170
She's like, okay, I want you
in the showcase tomorrow night.

970
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:34,470
So Jay Davidson had a huge show called
Dublin's and I don't know if you guys

971
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:38,250
were out here during that board.
Dublin's was huge. He said,

972
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:40,140
go watch that show.

973
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,920
And I remember giving
Jay Davis a VHS tape,

974
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,710
such a crazy time. I tried to do
a doc on that move on that show.

975
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:53,810
And of course it got completely
fucked up by crazy people. But um,

976
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:57,660
so he's doing a show the next night
in the main room, I did a showcase.

977
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:01,830
This is how cool Mazda Brown he is.
He gets me in. He's a great guy. Cool.

978
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:05,750
Stewed you offer me one of the guys is
stayed real no matter what's happened to

979
01:03:05,751 --> 01:03:09,540
them. One of the most real dude
you for me. So Ahmed, Ahmed,

980
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,280
Aaron cater myself are all showcasing
eh Mazda's already irregular.

981
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,850
So we go up when we do our set
and we all have really good sets.

982
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,620
Mas wants to give Brett Ernston
so Mazda disappears. Mazda's like,

983
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,500
oh they give it like we can't find Mazda.
Like can we put somebody else up?

984
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,160
They put him up, they put Bret Ernst
stop. Bret Ernst does a showcase.

985
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,730
All four of us get picked up that
day. So on the same day, same day,

986
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:37,350
what year was that? That
was 99 or 2000 wow. Yeah.

987
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:42,300
2000 seriously.
100% fuck man,

988
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,330
it was a year before nine
11 because she wants,

989
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,930
she thought that like Arabs are gonna need
a voice. Like that's how crazy it was.

990
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,400
Wow.
Because you picked this up,

991
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:55,360
but she made us be regulars and worked
a door like I had to work to door.

992
01:03:55,361 --> 01:03:56,250
And then,
you know,

993
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,660
four months after I moved
to La in 2002 I met Sam.

994
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,260
We did the Groundlings together
and he was so fast and like,

995
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,550
I used to be a real knucklehead and you
can leave it like a gun recognizes a gun.

996
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:11,010
You know what I'm saying? Like you're
like, okay, this guy's fucking good.

997
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,770
So you get to be like, either we're
going to be rivals or we can be friends.

998
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,820
Right. And I'm like, this guy's
so fast. Let's be friends.

999
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:22,470
So I did to you what was done to me in
that I joined an Improv troupe thinking

1000
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,170
it was a standup comedy show.
I didn't know what it was.

1001
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,440
And my friend Victor Isaac, who
lives out in la now, it's like,

1002
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:31,980
you're really funny. Come do standup.
I'm like, you know, and I go,

1003
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:35,370
do you do stand up? And you're like, no.
I'm like, you fucking should do stand up.

1004
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,370
You're really funny. So I took you around
for like a week. I could, it was, it was,

1005
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,530
you're responsible for encouraging
young. Of course, of course.

1006
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:48,930
It's awesome Sammy.
Like what was the other,

1007
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,610
what was like the Sushi restaurant
kind of across from Dublin?

1008
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:56,730
They had a show there,
a search without, um,

1009
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,040
shit. And I was just talking about
the other day with a Doug Stan hope.

1010
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,760
What was it? Miyagi's yeah, and
I was, uh, I basically was like,

1011
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,610
I don't know what to do. And he
goes, you just do spots. And I like,

1012
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:12,930
I didn't even understand how that, what
that meant. And I tagged along with Sammy,

1013
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:17,100
went to Miyagi's, we went to the comedy
store, we went in one other place.

1014
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:17,980
And so I just

1015
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,650
got to see like, oh, so like, and
then he's like, you know, like,

1016
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,900
I'll just do this here.
I'll try it here. And like,

1017
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,230
I'll watch them do like 15 minutes sets
and he's like, just do it. Just do it.

1018
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,093
Just do it.

1019
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:32,110
But then you did a couple
shows at that place above, um,

1020
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,550
the Improv school on libray. You
had a show there, right? Room five?

1021
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:40,600
I did. I did a bunch of like
those little, you know, like,

1022
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:44,390
and then we're off.
Uh,

1023
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:49,330
I remember doing like I was, I
started to know too, I got a,

1024
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:53,380
I started doing the
Improv's gave me mc working.

1025
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:56,830
Oh for you move quickly.
He did Europe,

1026
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,970
man, you were at Thompson Guerra.
I always tell people this,

1027
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:04,430
I ran a tiny room in Los
Filez called Tangier.

1028
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:08,930
We were all open makers when Tommy
started stand up when he was 23 years old.

1029
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:12,680
He was good. He immediately like,
you are one of those assholes.

1030
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,190
Oh I hate it was like,
are you kidding me? Yeah.

1031
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:18,620
He started and he was better
than all of us and I was like,

1032
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,060
you gotta be shitting me.

1033
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:25,670
I had two closing out my open
miker show essentially every week.

1034
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,820
Cause you were fun.
You were the funniest one.

1035
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,830
Okay. So, um, you were fast food.

1036
01:06:31,831 --> 01:06:36,110
You and nick were fast and nick, by
the way, Wagoner, we were also, yeah,

1037
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,910
it's also in Sam and my improv class.

1038
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:42,870
He's the one that introduced me
cause he was also had done stand up.

1039
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,060
He introduced me to a booker as a comic.
So he goes,

1040
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:51,120
you should put, he goes, you should
a Tom's grade should have them.

1041
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,960
And The lady goes, Oh, you're
a comic. And I just went, yeah.

1042
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:00,310
And then she goes, uh, all right. I'm
sure April 22nd you want to do that show?

1043
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:01,144
And I was like,
yeah.

1044
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,730
And that's how I did my first
spot I ride and just was always,

1045
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,750
that's how I lied to get in the copy.
So then there was cat, what's her name?

1046
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:11,910
Kat Wrightman.
Right man.

1047
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:16,911
And then there was the trucker from a
smokey and the bandit smoking hot daughter

1048
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:20,360
who's dating somebody from Lincoln Park.
Yeah,

1049
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:23,100
Lincoln Park that she was dating the
drummer from Lincoln Park. That's right.

1050
01:07:23,101 --> 01:07:27,330
So hot. Horrible at Improv horror.
Right. But she didn't care know.

1051
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,690
And everybody was like, you date the
guy from the apart. And she loved it.

1052
01:07:30,691 --> 01:07:35,520
She was like, yeah, I do. I'm so
into it. Then you just took off, man.

1053
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:38,700
I remember you're doing all these little
spots and then you were just gone.

1054
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,080
So you were just doing spot and then
you were just touring off of you, been,

1055
01:07:43,081 --> 01:07:47,920
you and Sebastian both were row
dogging right out the gate. Yeah. Yeah.

1056
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,750
Sebastian was. So, it's a
funny thing about Sebastian.

1057
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,900
Sebastian was Sebastian from the drop

1058
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:01,380
persona was there. I saw him
yeah. 10, eight plus years ago.

1059
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,010
Yeah. Doing an o our spot. I was just
at the club one. I did the belly rooms.

1060
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,650
I used to do a bunch of belly room
shows that weren't like official shows,

1061
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:12,300
you know, and popping. And that dude was
exactly the same. Exactly the same guy.

1062
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:16,370
He honed at anyone out with guys
for awhile. He did for dice.

1063
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,490
He opened for dice.

1064
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,200
Never would have ever expected that dice
lumped him cause he was like Italian

1065
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:24,750
dice is Kinda got the Italian
thing going on and uh,

1066
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,210
just went off and he was just

1067
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,083
so,
um,

1068
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:32,480
this shit like Sebastian's new stuff
feels like polished material is just a way

1069
01:08:33,271 --> 01:08:35,360
of delivering and like,
and,

1070
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:40,730
and like laying out with a bit is that
feels like a finished product on the

1071
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:45,270
first take. You know, it was like the
first time he says like, I was at the gym,

1072
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,850
he's talking about what happened
at the gym today. It feels like,

1073
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:50,640
I feel this is a bit,
it's like what happened today?

1074
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:55,660
He knows like that Doug Stanhope in terms
of that. And he would never say this,

1075
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:59,140
but a like he's been doing it so long,
he knows his voice.

1076
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,000
He can anything happen.

1077
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:06,100
Goes Ray through the voice box and comes
out and he's got a point of view. Yeah.

1078
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,660
Burrs that, burrs like that. Yeah.
I'm sure you guys are like that. Yeah.

1079
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:14,290
I mean it's like if you've done it long
enough, you know your take, you know,

1080
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,580
it's so inappropriate time.

1081
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:19,090
When I were sitting around talking about
our favorite comics and I was like,

1082
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:21,700
my favorite comics are
50 year old white guys.

1083
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,610
Like I just fucking love the Shemel's,

1084
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,540
the Louis C K obviously
like bill burr in that lane.

1085
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:34,450
All these white guys I've watched coming
up and you're like, that's, to me,

1086
01:09:34,451 --> 01:09:36,070
that's still the gold standard layer.

1087
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:39,960
Older white guys guys wrong with that.
Oh,

1088
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:43,900
I just love them while their masters.
Yeah.

1089
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:48,280
I think comedy's going through something
right now where it's like the actual

1090
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:52,420
humor is like the last thing
they care about in a weird way.

1091
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,750
I feel like there's so many people getting
pushed forward just because we need

1092
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:59,390
an APP. We need a biracial bisexual
person and you're like, you know,

1093
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,820
I'm thinking about sucking black dicks
in front of everybody just to get fucking

1094
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:04,960
something.
Go and you know,

1095
01:10:04,961 --> 01:10:09,400
just go on stage and just crushed Jamar
neighbors dick in front of everybody.

1096
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:13,980
Just so somebody will fucking sign me the
something. It just like so true. Right?

1097
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,320
There's a sissy.
That guy's Tripoli's suck.

1098
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:20,770
That guy's not great for
the new Gilmore girls.

1099
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,930
Why don't you sign on to that?
You got to pick your pronoun or

1100
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,580
wrote me them like your pronoun a Pronoun.

1101
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:37,510
You can be a Zimmer [inaudible]
you can be a man, a woman, a man.

1102
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:42,340
I don't know. What is your
pronoun? I'm Zim. Why?

1103
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,420
Because I don't want you to
assume that I'm a male. Okay.

1104
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:49,690
You're being really presumptuous and
you're, you're determining my gender.

1105
01:10:49,691 --> 01:10:53,200
Let me determine what my gender I respect.
There you go.

1106
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:56,830
I respect your non gender.
Gender. Thank you amgen.

1107
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,640
So I don't want you to say what's he
like? Okay, well when you say what Zim,

1108
01:11:00,641 --> 01:11:05,470
like are they your they,
yeah. What's Your Pronoun?

1109
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:08,350
That's interesting. Hey, by the way,

1110
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:10,730
I wanted to ask you this because
you do your conspiracy theory,

1111
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:14,190
conspiracy theory podcast,
which is called foil tin foil

1112
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,090
hat with Sam Triplet.
Do you ever address,

1113
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:21,090
there's this ridiculous conspiracy theory
about like Armenian genocide you ever

1114
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:25,770
hit than that?
Like they claim that like that,

1115
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:30,330
like the Turks wiped upon. There's a
couple things about that. Is that like,

1116
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:33,390
do you address that when we go
through that they told you like, oh,

1117
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:37,650
they put on this whole charade? Yeah,
it was really, it was really great.

1118
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:41,280
They didn't boo hoo, they got a couple
of tattoos, just made some shit up.

1119
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,700
So when did that supposedly like
when's the salary that they happened?

1120
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:48,360
Five or something like that? Ain't no, no,
no. It was way back. I went when though,

1121
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:52,680
what year? 2000. On the, excuse me, 1917.

1122
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,110
Oh Wow. And how many, uh,

1123
01:11:55,160 --> 01:12:00,160
purported to a million
to a million people.

1124
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:03,660
1 million people? Yeah,
but like come on a million.

1125
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,700
But do you really think that many
people died? Why? Because, because,

1126
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:12,440
because people told me because the
fucking let let her networks, ABC, CBS,

1127
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,930
Oh, I had, I had, I had an uncle
that was involved in all that.

1128
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:22,260
What did you do at kill by my mother's
uncle. Excuse me? Your mom's uncle.

1129
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:26,490
What was a in a camp? Uh, he was
uh, he had a fucking tattoo on him.

1130
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:29,430
Did the Turks do,
they came in and kicked our dates.

1131
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,670
They did last suck our dicks in a
lot of this. So like Dick's talk,

1132
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,710
what was the willow suck on

1133
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,930
the what? What led to this? Like what
was the event that led to this? I mean,

1134
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:49,220
what's so interesting about Armenians?
Man is I do ask about the law yet.

1135
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:52,860
They do smell good. We
shower in Cologne, I do it.

1136
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,040
I have the longest running show ever at
the comedy store is a 15 year charity

1137
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:02,730
event. Happens once a year called
the Armenian bone marrow registry.

1138
01:13:02,731 --> 01:13:07,350
And a cousin of mine had a bone
marrow cancer and she couldn't,

1139
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,550
they couldn't find a match.
She Still Willis, she is
still, she beat it naturally.

1140
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:16,170
But her mom, my cousin, my
mother's cousin, Yep. Ah,

1141
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,210
couldn't find a match her.

1142
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:23,211
And this doctor named Dr Frida Jordan
decided to start in an Armenian bone

1143
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:28,881
marrow registry where people would get
tested and see if they're a Merrill

1144
01:13:29,191 --> 01:13:29,731
matched.

1145
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:33,510
And it's like this event that's insane
because you actually see the results of

1146
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:36,390
your, your actions. Like sometimes
you do charity event, you're like,

1147
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:39,150
I hope somebody got that money. You
know what I'm saying? But this one,

1148
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:42,450
like they built a giant hospital
in Armenia and all that stuff.

1149
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,410
And the reason we have a unique
genetic makeup is that, uh,

1150
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:49,380
we're basically inbreds oh yeah.

1151
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:53,610
Cause we're the only Christian
country surrounded by most on all

1152
01:13:55,910 --> 01:14:00,360
of those tell people. So it's like a, so
we only hooked up with our own, you know,

1153
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:04,740
so it was like our hookup app was
like ancestry.com we genetically,

1154
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:07,320
you guys are a disaster.
Yes. Yeah. Basically,

1155
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:10,230
and that's why we have to have
this whole thing going on. So,

1156
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:12,010
but the Turks who when they were like,
suck our Dicks,

1157
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,660
did they not this most of this?
Yeah. They like suck my Dick.

1158
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,090
Fuck you guys. Is that, is that guns are,

1159
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:24,091
is that limp dicks just bouncing around
telling two people the second you go

1160
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:29,110
back Mcavoy job, I just
like, it's like a Turkey,

1161
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,460
Armenia,
let's go at it.

1162
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:34,150
And then they just had a weird thing
and there were war crimes committed.

1163
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,440
And it's so interesting that there's
actually something called the young Turks,

1164
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,960
which is,
and I love their political views,

1165
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,490
but you're literally named after like
that region's Nazis, you know, they like,

1166
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:47,200
they went and slider a bunch
of people and you're like,

1167
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:51,890
so this was like during world
war one or this was 1917 that be,

1168
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,780
so that was, I think, yeah, right around
that or a little before it. Right.

1169
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,100
I thought that'd be during that,

1170
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,230
is that wrong or right before
1945 was the items were war

1171
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:07,030
in 1914 to 1918 there then,

1172
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:12,610
okay. So let's see. Armenian. You
sound kind of upset about that.

1173
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:18,190
She seemed to be holding a grudge on
that one movie that didn't do well.

1174
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:23,020
Yeah. And you also had a great, you had
Christian, but yeah, we have one movie,

1175
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,850
Armenian genocide.
Are you stoked about,

1176
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,830
does that eve even Steven?
Well, yeah. I mean,

1177
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:32,400
they're like the most
famous people ever worse.

1178
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:37,440
Kim Kardashians or her two younger sisters
who just last life think a Pepsi can

1179
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:41,080
cues, you know, like hand people,
Pepsi, everyone's thoughts fighting.

1180
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,820
That was amazing. So now they put it on
a tee shirt. You see this unbelievable.

1181
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,530
The fucking Badass.

1182
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:52,210
These girls through their own images
up over like the doors, pink Floyd,

1183
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,420
big Biggie's Stupak.

1184
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,270
And how amazing the backlash
was so swift that there was,

1185
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:02,350
I mean 20 like they were testing
like maybe we can get away with this.

1186
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,280
Everyone was like, fuck no, you can't
do like, sorry. Anyway, and moved on.

1187
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:10,540
Like it was just, it's a blink of an eye.
They're like, we tried. People said no,

1188
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:14,070
but I don't know that they lost any
of anyone that liked him. You know,

1189
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:19,400
because the younger the tweeny
boppers who's baggy or who's whatever,

1190
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:24,820
they're ripping on basically what Djs do.
Literally Djs do that,

1191
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,790
like puffy combs. That's all
he did was he put like, yeah.

1192
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:32,170
At the club over like over like
everybody doing real singing a police,

1193
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,730
which is all they did.

1194
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:37,750
You were going to take you and I'm
gonna put you right here and now it's my

1195
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:40,600
finger. Right. I had never thought
of it like that. Right. They're like,

1196
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:45,520
well it looks familiar. Thick.
Yeah. Well I actually, it actually

1197
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:52,690
like when uh, Biggie's mom came out
and was like soap opera, so about it,

1198
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,490
they could have been like, did you guys
contact Stang you put out. That's true.

1199
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:02,140
It's so true man. Cause that the hip hop
dead, especially puffy who I, by the way,

1200
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:04,870
I love him. I loved that.
He, I think he's a genius.

1201
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,800
That guy is like a mogul and
brilliant in so many ways.

1202
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,750
But his era specifically was like,
that's a hot,

1203
01:17:11,751 --> 01:17:15,740
so I'm just going to go to it. And
take that, take that, take that,

1204
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,630
and then people were like,
that's an awesome song.

1205
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:19,640
And when did you come up with that?
If people were like,

1206
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:23,570
that's fucking in the stones.
Yeah. They may not get a,

1207
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:26,720
did he not get penalized when
they bought it? They license it.

1208
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:29,210
They end up paying a fortune to do
it. Yeah. That's the thing is it?

1209
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,180
I guess it is ultimately worth
it. You make enough money. Yeah.

1210
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:37,300
Vanilla ice baby ice ice
baby is just under pressure,
but he got screwed on that.

1211
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,280
He was trying to say there's that
great interview where he's like,

1212
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:44,860
that's [inaudible] Donna.
Donna.

1213
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:48,030
No, that's not going to hold up, dude.

1214
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:53,460
The take from like anything involving
Freddie Mercury is, I like blasphemy.

1215
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:58,230
I mean the song is amazing. Have you
ever seen Queen at Wembley Stadium? No.

1216
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,720
It is not just a music.

1217
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,230
The greatest performance
I've ever seen in my life.

1218
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:07,260
Like this guy owns this crowd.

1219
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:10,790
Like I've never seen anybody own a
crowd before. He's running around.

1220
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,610
He's got those bad British teeth
where they're just like the,

1221
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,130
it looks like a gateway to a
haunted fucking house. Right?

1222
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,270
It's just like the gays.

1223
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:21,230
Yeah. Wait, we didn't finish our, oh yeah,

1224
01:18:21,231 --> 01:18:23,120
we're still in the
international space by the way.

1225
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:28,110
It says that Armenian genocide
is a hoax. So, uh, moving along,

1226
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:38,860
um, I noticed, uh, we've been
watching you guys for a while.

1227
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:43,730
I notice a, the gentleman from
Russia pop back there and uh,

1228
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:47,740
what's it like up there where there's
nothing other than what you have in common

1229
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:50,440
is why you're together.
That's gotta be a great feeling.

1230
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:53,200
And I bet you guys probably just forget
that you're from different places.

1231
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,750
Oh Gee. There's one. Okay.

1232
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:02,290
At the highest levels of like business,
these CEOs,

1233
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:05,520
they love to go to like dominate tricks
and just get the shit kicked. Yeah.

1234
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,710
Yeah. Because they got to do this shit.
Yeah. Not Him. That right now. Like, man,

1235
01:19:10,711 --> 01:19:14,410
do you guys just sing about freedom?
See,

1236
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,710
that's what bothers us
so much. He says, Liar.

1237
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:19,650
I don't believe that this is authentic.
I don't think he,

1238
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,140
I think he wants to be like, you guys
take shits out in the space right now.

1239
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:27,840
Is that crazy horse? Yeah. Well the
first question was a normal question.

1240
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,410
Do you guys ever feel like
it's not gravity gravity? Yeah.

1241
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:36,000
It was the first question that that's
like dumb. We'd ask now. He's like,

1242
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:40,140
everybody loves me. I've got to have
some. Yeah. Yeah. Where he from?

1243
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,680
Everything's in. I'm just
boy from Oklahoma. Yeah.

1244
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:50,030
Shucks. Shut up. Fuck it.
Ask ask about the shits.

1245
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,070
That's really what I would ask
them to come all over my face.

1246
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:58,280
How do you guys a jerk off?
Why y'all eat yogurt?

1247
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:03,940
I want to know anytime
y'all have pornography up
there you'd have to beat off

1248
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:09,250
upside down. So shut up. Where's that?

1249
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:17,930
Where does the come gold was up in
space jacking my Dick Space Jack.

1250
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,440
There's so much of this in entertainment
though in general, like the,

1251
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:31,740
it's almost gotten like politics where
it's like you have to have this pristine

1252
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,400
image to get anything going.
That's not bullshit.

1253
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:37,320
That's why these podcasts are great,
right?

1254
01:20:37,321 --> 01:20:39,630
You can literally make it
so different too. Like,

1255
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:44,631
I just did an hour and a half of press
before this on the phone radio for

1256
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:47,550
upcoming dates. And it's like, you know,

1257
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,470
you could tell when they're
cool right away. It's like,

1258
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:51,750
it's like you just 30 seconds
and you're like, all right man.

1259
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,900
And then sometimes they're like,
Ma,

1260
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:58,440
you hear me married to a comedian and
what's that like? And I'm like, fuck.

1261
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,440
And I just start like, you know,
I'm like, like one of them was like,

1262
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,260
so are your wife coming on this joke?
I don't want to bring her with me.

1263
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,690
He was like, ah, I'm all right. I
didn't mean to upset you. I'm like,

1264
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:13,900
I'm fucking kidding. And
like it just, he was so,

1265
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:17,090
they all asked the automated questions,
you know, what can people expect it?

1266
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,590
The show? And it's just,
it's all corporate dude.

1267
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,700
Such a world out there that I think like,

1268
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:26,820
and you see happening in comedy right now.
It's like I'm starting to like,

1269
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:31,260
you know, like I couldn't, ups
weren't hiring me because I was crazy,

1270
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,440
but now it's like comedies
caught up to what I'm doing.

1271
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:38,490
Comedies in a good place right now in
a great place and like these clubs are

1272
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:40,410
still like, I need
clean comedy. It's like,

1273
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,060
that doesn't exist and your world is not
real. Did you ever do juniors and Erie?

1274
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,360
No. No, of course not.
They knew what was up.

1275
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:52,650
They had a no cursing,
no innuendo,

1276
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:55,710
no t bad top.
I did it twice.

1277
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:59,190
I did it as a feature and a headliner and
I got one time I got off. She was like,

1278
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:02,790
did you say penis when you're up there
now let me go. It's anatomically correct,

1279
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,260
and she was like,
all right,

1280
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:09,260
but just please exist in the
Mormon know ultra religious.

1281
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,740
That's the thing is the fear is that
somebody won't buy a ticket to your dumb

1282
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:16,880
show or some sponsors going to pull out,
you know,

1283
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,890
this guy sells out multiple arena,

1284
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,360
like 20 can we see more?
Is that

1285
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:27,410
what it says next?
Just forget your differences and learning

1286
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,200
those in yourself, or do you, is
there somewhere that has all them? No,

1287
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:37,660
I put it in myself.
Oh my God.

1288
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:42,680
There's only about 600 on this is 77 yeah,

1289
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,620
there's seven years of that. Money is
never done drugs happy. It's been awhile.

1290
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:48,973
Yeah.

1291
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:54,170
G I do think that I'm not fussing
with wet international culture.

1292
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:58,380
It's a one way or we're supportive
of each other as a team.

1293
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,180
Worrying about what nationality,
nationality.

1294
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,630
Just be defined on your knowledge of stuff
and then sharing that with each other.

1295
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:12,220
That's a, that's a great message
for these people is a great message.

1296
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,450
So wait,
what'd you rather give?

1297
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,400
The guy just said that lady with
the dairy queen driving. Fucking

1298
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:27,280
you want out of it to be a
large. That is, by the way,

1299
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:30,660
imagine her, her telling you
what you did wrong in the order.

1300
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:34,670
She would totally be your manager.
Oh, like he did so many things around.

1301
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:38,540
First of all, he didn't
welcome him. Right? Didn't say
your name and the greetings.

1302
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,810
Why didn't you ask him if he wanted
sprinkles on that? Wait, Tommy. Okay.

1303
01:23:42,811 --> 01:23:46,140
Would you rather have sex
with a moose soup lady?

1304
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:50,190
Loose soup lady or the female astronauts?
Oh,

1305
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,790
well I feel like Sammy doesn't know
what we're talking about and that's not

1306
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:58,110
really fair. So let's um, key
him in on the Moose Soup Lady.

1307
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,430
The uh,

1308
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:04,430
there was a speedboat race and I think
West Virginia and this lady was watching,

1309
01:24:05,221 --> 01:24:08,460
she watched the Guy Wa wipe out
and we don't get to see her,

1310
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:11,520
but she's the moose suit lady.
We imagined her and her.

1311
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,220
We have imagination of what she's
like cause you can hear her.

1312
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,640
Fuck you guys are doing good.

1313
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:26,330
Is that Charlie Carey?

1314
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:29,483
Calm down.

1315
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,920
I come down here after I
got those stupid everything.

1316
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,720
Alright,
you guys are doing good.

1317
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,010
Hey,
I got you on video

1318
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,163
dirty.

1319
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,890
Oh God.

1320
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,770
Don't you think that she has a
horrific sexual history from me?

1321
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,790
She was the town bike.
There's no way.

1322
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:20,420
Pretty bows dagger,
right? Tell right. Yeah.

1323
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,710
Just 30 seconds of video.

1324
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:28,090
He's a combination of like cafeteria lady
would bus drive her ride with fucking

1325
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:33,040
DMV worker at somebody smokes a day.
How many packs? All of them. All of them

1326
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:38,590
are helpful brand.
What do we think of Derek?

1327
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:42,090
I'm thinking generics now. I think
we're rolled their own. Yeah.

1328
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:44,940
Or some kind of native American ones.
We'll see.

1329
01:25:44,941 --> 01:25:47,130
I don't think two rolls around that
because that's just too much labor.

1330
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:51,030
I think it's lazy. Gets packs. She
buys the cartons at it. Oh yeah.

1331
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:55,330
If she was like CME, go get me a pack.
And you, you brought back a single pack.

1332
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:57,720
She's like a pack means 20 packs.
You fucking idiot.

1333
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:02,890
Like she would get on
you for only 100% yeah.

1334
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,813
Karen,

1335
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:12,290
there's no way that does not
involve a moment. Yeah. No.

1336
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:16,820
And like you're like both we all three
guys on that boat or fucking if she,

1337
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:19,550
if they come over from moose soup,
that is part of the equation.

1338
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:25,840
Do you choose the net that

1339
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:33,710
NASA astronaut take a look
at her up here on orbit.

1340
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:35,750
We have kind of an international culture.

1341
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:41,420
Either her or who we imagine
the moose soup lady to be.

1342
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:46,220
What are you, oh definitely this
one. This will be horrible sex.

1343
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:51,500
I still think she's less disgusting ass.

1344
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,310
Not Chick all day. Why is that
Sammy? What? I mean she's,

1345
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:57,523
she probably

1346
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,660
everything together. She probably
does Ph balance on her vagina.

1347
01:27:01,661 --> 01:27:05,500
Like she puts a little Ph thing,
make sure that the Cidex fucking right

1348
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,500
Bob, do you that she doesn't like
men are, that doesn't turn you off.

1349
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,460
I've looked up the lesbians before.
I'm built like once a fuck.

1350
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,730
Have you really hooked up with a lesbian

1351
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:18,480
dude? There was this
chicken Arizona and she was,

1352
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:23,010
my brother used to run strip bars and I
would always go do the gigs in Arizona.

1353
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,850
I want to hang out with
a triple e men sometime.

1354
01:27:24,851 --> 01:27:26,330
I feel that you guys just have stories

1355
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,940
more. Uh, my brother's awesome.

1356
01:27:29,941 --> 01:27:32,390
I would say he's a little more
conservative than I am. He's,

1357
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:35,460
we're for a guy who runs a strip bar.
He's, he's a little more concise.

1358
01:27:35,461 --> 01:27:39,860
He's one of those libertarian dudes, you
know? So, uh, so we're kind of the same.

1359
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:44,550
I'm just a little crazier. He's
more conservative and uh, you know,

1360
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:47,640
so he'd run these strip bars and I'd
show up and there's this one girl was a

1361
01:27:47,641 --> 01:27:50,730
stripper and she was just like,
you know,

1362
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:54,690
I've been a lesbian for the last like
five years or the first tick I've had

1363
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:57,030
instantly you feel like Jackie Robinson,
you know,

1364
01:27:57,031 --> 01:28:00,570
it's like you got to represent your
people. Have you fucked this up?

1365
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,820
They never get a shot again. Right. So I
just had to work my ass off. So yeah. Did,

1366
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:08,000
I've hooked up with it. It's not,
it's, it's interesting. It's shit.

1367
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:12,460
Well, wouldn't they be less
responsive to intuit at all?

1368
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,880
She was into it. I did. I ever,

1369
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,170
oh yeah.
I told us the last time I was having show,

1370
01:28:18,171 --> 01:28:21,860
but there was this like lesbian and Dana
Point, she was like a lipstick lesbian.

1371
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:24,700
She was gorgeous and she
probably got cheated on by right.

1372
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:28,850
Boyfriend ran to the lesbian for a little
while, you know, so it's like, yes,

1373
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:30,340
sometimes they're hot.
I've done that.

1374
01:28:30,341 --> 01:28:34,060
I've been like on gigs were
lesbian couples come out
and you know the ones that

1375
01:28:34,061 --> 01:28:38,260
do and the ones to check and the chick is
fucking hot and she wants to get weird,

1376
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:41,620
you know? So you're going
for the astronaut? Yes.

1377
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:43,510
Over the fucking large Marge

1378
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:50,950
term.

1379
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:54,790
I think I'm going to go with this.
The astronauts,

1380
01:28:55,830 --> 01:29:00,580
I mean the moose soup lady is horrifying.
Does she? She could take out her teeth,

1381
01:29:00,581 --> 01:29:04,100
gum it, she'd be gumming Ya.
But the thing is with the,

1382
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:07,290
with the NASA lady is
that she is a sexual,

1383
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,800
I mean there is not a hormone,
there's not an estrogen left.

1384
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:13,540
If she likes guys to begin with,
shorty,

1385
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,800
you know, she reminds me, officer. No.

1386
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:21,710
Do you guys remember the
old police academy movies?
Yeah, blond with a big rack.

1387
01:29:21,711 --> 01:29:25,630
He's like militant, but still love
it. She could be that. She'd be like,

1388
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,410
she could be like a mullet. You know
what I'm saying? Business up here. Once.

1389
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,380
Camera's off fucking party back there.
You know what I'm saying?

1390
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:36,220
She might like to get weird man,
but like, she's like, I'm a woman.

1391
01:29:36,221 --> 01:29:39,660
I have to work harder at, you'd be
more serious. And then offstage,

1392
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,300
she's just gobbling Russian dicks.
You know what I'm saying?

1393
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,230
Trying to bring people together.

1394
01:29:44,231 --> 01:29:47,080
It would be why did you guys have
Trump and just start sucking him off.

1395
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,000
Oh Man. Yeah. It could
be. It could be. I mean,

1396
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,570
I still think this is a far,

1397
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,610
far better option. Um, then calm down.

1398
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:04,810
I think so. I think
that's a bad one. Mg USC.

1399
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,950
What happens next with
Gartha? Yeah, here we go.

1400
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,610
Native by him going to introduce
you to my better 99.9%. Um,

1401
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:14,380
Michelle would actually make the trip.
I was here today,

1402
01:30:14,381 --> 01:30:18,880
so I want her to come to Trisha's
here. There's Trish. Hey Trish. Hi.

1403
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,400
How are you doing?

1404
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,700
How's that for a power couple
is fucking

1405
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:30,790
power.
Couple of this is,

1406
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:35,390
I feel like this nerd set it up
and then the space ladies like,

1407
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:37,160
who the fuck's this bitch? Like? Yeah,

1408
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:42,530
like this whole thing you set
up is all for you. Crystal.

1409
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,350
Leah mentions he might have a girlfriend
onstage. All the girls are like,

1410
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,050
oh, I know. She's like Garth Brooks. Oh,

1411
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,490
here's my wife.
Oh fuck.

1412
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:58,010
Oh Man. What's Trish again and
say, what's your high gas man?

1413
01:30:58,011 --> 01:31:01,960
I just love what you're doing for America.
Are there any bald eagles

1414
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,640
watching you guys and listening to both
of you and just a thank you both for

1415
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:07,470
your service and on growth
is probably said all that,

1416
01:31:07,471 --> 01:31:12,270
but just honored to be here and
uh, just I, I can't get over it.

1417
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:15,210
I'm just doing the spinning
a microphone and the socks.

1418
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:17,300
Do you guys have socks or ongoing?

1419
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:28,340
It's just a natural. How much money
do you got to make to do that?

1420
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:32,960
Like be like him dump money on you and
you're already making good money to start

1421
01:31:32,961 --> 01:31:35,300
bailing the bean. Like the
hat dude, he's probably,

1422
01:31:35,301 --> 01:31:38,270
he's probably making like a
right now with his touring,

1423
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,220
like 80 to 100 million a year.

1424
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:45,600
Would you do that for 180 million
talking like that? You're like, Oh man,

1425
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:50,420
you got good cookies up
there. What? I think so.

1426
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:56,180
I think so. How you got baseball,
you guys catch baseball like America.

1427
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:59,220
I would love to be in that tuition.

1428
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:03,910
You and the people that like listen
to this part yet. Hold me accountable.

1429
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:07,060
Like you like remember when you were like
this and they show old clip of me and

1430
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:11,660
I'd be like,
it was way back before cause shock.

1431
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,990
That was before.
Yeah.

1432
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,430
And I just go off and I just look
at someone like shut that shit off.

1433
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,400
I honestly don't think I
could even know what to say.

1434
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:28,360
Like to be normal to abnormal. Do
you know, how do you even do this?

1435
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:31,000
How do you learn the
script of what's normal?

1436
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,460
No matter how high you guys are,
you're not higher than GC.

1437
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:41,020
So can you see God,

1438
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:46,510
you know God's Hough Avenue Right now?
You feel like you're closer to cross.

1439
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,520
Can you see the angels?

1440
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:55,240
But you listen to like this.

1441
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,830
Like you ever heard that song
they use in all commercials?

1442
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:01,330
Like follow me.

1443
01:33:07,710 --> 01:33:12,670
So song that this rock band
and every fucking commercial.

1444
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,260
But then so one thought would be,

1445
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:17,080
might be good idea to play
it live at some of that.

1446
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:21,700
It is the most dog shit song you'll ever,
cause it's only meant for commercial,

1447
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:22,534
right?

1448
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:27,010
There's like huge downtime if you weren't
exposed to certain types of music.

1449
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:31,580
Like I never knew that that like
forward like a rock was a real song.

1450
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:36,460
That's a,
what is that secret?

1451
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:42,450
I didn't,
I thought that was just for

1452
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,310
like a song in a commercial.

1453
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:53,480
Then you hear in real life and
then you can't like it like

1454
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:58,300
blow you Turkish Bob Seger.

1455
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:06,510
Yeah, that's just a story. What was
the one they just had towards bi? Gene?

1456
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:11,110
A Budweiser commercial.
Disgusting.

1457
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:15,400
Gross. But then there are songs that
are real that I can't believe are real.

1458
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,520
Like the other day we were in the kitchen
and a shirt on their stand up next to

1459
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:26,590
you when new man here.
Toby Keith. That's real.

1460
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:28,310
That's a real love.
They love it.

1461
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,450
I like the equivalent of super
clean comics you ever meet.

1462
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:35,410
They're so angry and they're bitter and
they treat people like shit cause they

1463
01:34:35,411 --> 01:34:38,230
made business decisions.
You know? Gorgeous.

1464
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:41,740
Probably the nicest people to hang
out with. Those guys are fucking West.

1465
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,220
Most deviant comedians are
the ones that are like,

1466
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,230
to me the other day that Nick Dipaolo
is the nicest guy in the world. I go,

1467
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,990
I totally make sense to me because he
goes up and says everything he wants to

1468
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:57,650
say on stage. David tells like that Super
Nice. The People Tripoli's like that

1469
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,600
are, you should fear is like
the nicest guy, you know?

1470
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:04,100
But then you look at the monster
that Bill Cosby is, right?

1471
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:06,680
And he's up there talking
about bullshit for years.

1472
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,210
Nice guy. No you're not.
And then on top of that,

1473
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:12,620
it's like telling all their people,

1474
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,770
telling other people how to do comedy.

1475
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:22,760
Like that was really my biggest problem
with the whole lives of slessinger thing

1476
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:26,360
was that she was like, oh, you're working
dirty, blah blah blah. Low hanging fruits.

1477
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:29,450
Like you're not doing rocket
science up there. You know,

1478
01:35:29,451 --> 01:35:30,860
and I'd love you to death.
But it's like,

1479
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:35,690
I'm just tired of like people who make
business decision getting mad at people

1480
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,320
who go up there and just try to give
a piece of their soul for their art.

1481
01:35:39,321 --> 01:35:42,800
You know, I, you know, being
the Carl Sagan of Dick Jokes,

1482
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:44,830
which I've often called myself,
um,

1483
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:48,770
I just like to go up there and just
fucking have fun and like, you know,

1484
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:53,330
financially it's, it's led itself to
where it is, you know? And I just like,

1485
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:56,480
do you want, don't worry about what
I, if you want to be a businessperson,

1486
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,720
go do it. Just don't tell other people
how they should be doing comedy.

1487
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:04,370
That's my whole problem. Don't, don't tell
everyone else. Right. Yeah. It's like,

1488
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:08,560
you want to be a rapist who
does clean comedy. Yay for
you, Bill Cosby. Yeah. Right.

1489
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:13,040
Wow. Isn't that nuts? That's
funny. He gave so much,

1490
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:18,050
so many unsolicited lessons to
people caused me like how to live,

1491
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:22,850
how to dress, how to fucking remember that
Wanda Sykes moment where it's like, oh,

1492
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:26,930
she's like, how'd you guys do back in your
days? And he's like, we spoke English.

1493
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:31,610
And I'm like, everyone's like, oh
yeah. At that, at the award show.

1494
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:36,510
And then you find out he's probably
roofing everybody there. Oh man,

1495
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:41,600
there's a sterling sharp guy and
not stir something Deron sharp.

1496
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:45,460
He was sharper. He was a football player.
Don't give that to sterling Sharpe.

1497
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:49,790
Jesus Christ. Oh, he's great. Yeah. The
one guy who went to jail for like forever,

1498
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,620
he was like a hall of Famer.

1499
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:55,580
Good looking black athlete sharp is shit.
Yeah.

1500
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,000
And you would be roofing girls so crazy.

1501
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:02,450
He could just stack change
prison for a long time.

1502
01:37:02,451 --> 01:37:06,280
Now it's fucking terrible.
It was really crazy man that he um,

1503
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:10,940
but that dude, he was in the league for
a long time. He was like all decade.

1504
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:14,420
And then like all the charges
were like in, uh, the,

1505
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:17,420
the division town teams
that you'd be like, oh,

1506
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:22,690
like he had like four in New Orleans
and check the schedule and then the next

1507
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:27,440
day how many calls with Ecog,
whatever piece of shit.

1508
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:29,390
That guy who said this years ago,
they were like,

1509
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:32,220
the best serial killer would be
as a traveling comic. I mean,

1510
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:36,440
there was the guy who was a rapist,
the famous comic who would like ever,

1511
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,220
he'd go play campuses and there was
rapes on every campus where he performed,

1512
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,500
looked up his beard.
Right.

1513
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:48,610
His fucking signature still on the
wall at the comedy Magic Club. Yeah.

1514
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,620
It's up because everyone's signed
things for years and they're like,

1515
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:56,520
that dude's in prison. Darrin sharper
was on the hall. Fame ballot. Yeah.

1516
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,750
Oh yeah. Well, I mean we
remembered after Oj got accused,

1517
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:05,340
it took like NBC like a month to fire him.
The fuck go crazy.

1518
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:09,030
Let's hold off for a little bit.
Vince champ. That's his name.

1519
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:12,360
The comedian was raping people.

1520
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:17,340
Is there any comedy of him on Youtube?
I bet you hear a clean comic.

1521
01:38:17,341 --> 01:38:20,340
He was the,
he wants star search in 1900.

1522
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,320
Yeah. Proves our theory. Yeah.

1523
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:27,990
The biggest psychos are the ones
who are pretending not to be,

1524
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:31,150
who were just talking about things.
Everything.

1525
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,770
Like I don't think you have to
work dirty to be funny. Am I right?

1526
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:40,020
Oh my God. What's up
a Walmart? Am I right?

1527
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:43,890
Am I got cats and dogs are different.
They are totally different

1528
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:47,700
there. Is that, what's his
name has been on here before?

1529
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,840
Brido Bryden Stein and he told that great
story about Norm Mcdonald and Iowa 20

1530
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:57,240
years ago where he went, um, and it was,

1531
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:01,890
it was built as a family friendly show
and it was like three or 4,000 people and

1532
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:04,830
they bought and I'm
Darrell Hammond went up,

1533
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:09,390
then Jim brewer and then norm and norms.
First joke was about,

1534
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:11,070
he saw a video of a pig fucking

1535
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,940
woman.
Brido is at the show.

1536
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:17,660
He says as he's saying
it like you just like

1537
01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:20,710
stand up.
And then norm was like,

1538
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:23,050
what did you want to talk about
losing your luggage at the airport?

1539
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,690
I'm with you dude.
Of course.

1540
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,930
For that they like this.
I wish I do.

1541
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:35,270
There's part of me that wishes I could
like that stuff. Oh, in the room.

1542
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:40,140
And then I could just watch friends,
marathons and think they're fantastic.

1543
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:42,180
I want to love network television.

1544
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:47,180
Let me love this one of those couples,
they're going around the world.

1545
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:50,460
That's crazy. And I just
like, I go home, I like,

1546
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,530
my mother is like this,
she's like convince Islamic rapist.

1547
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:59,100
Jihadis are everywhere in upstate New
York. We live by cows. By the way,

1548
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:03,450
there's a cow crossing a block from where
I live that the conspiracy theory guy

1549
01:40:03,451 --> 01:40:07,530
can't believe his mom has a conspiracy
theory about the most watched too much

1550
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:11,410
CNN, right? Yeah. Too much of
that shit. So I like, she like,

1551
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,500
she wanted to come see me in Syracuse,

1552
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:16,780
has playing the funny bone and she
wanted to stay in my hotel room.

1553
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,390
Like I'm the only guy
that brings back chicks.

1554
01:40:18,391 --> 01:40:19,980
That's your mom after your fucking show.

1555
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:25,340
But she comes and she slept with her
purse in the bed next to her like this.

1556
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,520
And I'm like, mom, the only person
could steal that is me. That,

1557
01:40:29,521 --> 01:40:31,710
what are you trying to
say about me? But she, uh,

1558
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,760
all she watches his HGN and
it's just every shows a,

1559
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:40,050
a gay guy selling real estate in fucking
Manhattan. But she's pleased, right?

1560
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:43,160
She's had, she's contagious.
Loves it. Yeah. She just loves it.

1561
01:40:43,161 --> 01:40:46,320
But every show's a gay guy selling
fucking real estate. Go ahead.

1562
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,930
The one show that I don't understand
why anybody can watch are those like the

1563
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:54,130
Kelly and Regis in the morning that that

1564
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:59,130
Kelly rip on whoever now it's Ryan
Seacrest or they talk about nothing for an

1565
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,540
hour.
Like who's who's tuning in?

1566
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:05,300
What Weird Shit do you think Ryan
Seacrest is into? He's got a,

1567
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:09,250
he's big on that like Garth
persona, so he's like, hey guys,

1568
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:13,660
it's like all smiles and we got the
special kids from the Olympics here, Matt,

1569
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:16,870
and they really let us know we can
do anything. We dream about it.

1570
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:18,460
We'll be right back with special kits.

1571
01:41:18,461 --> 01:41:21,520
And then he turns and what do you think
that the thing that he says that next is

1572
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:27,030
get this fucking Juda stop looking at
him like he says he doesn't like to get

1573
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:28,361
pegged in the ass.

1574
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:32,440
There's no way he gets whatever weird
chick he's doing a reality show with.

1575
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:37,510
Put a big fucking angry red
deldot and just no lube.

1576
01:41:37,511 --> 01:41:42,490
Just Ram it. Don't tell him. Heard
him make him cry and that's how,

1577
01:41:42,491 --> 01:41:46,920
who gets on the show? For sure. Being
the weird shit. Allegedly. Yeah.

1578
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:50,450
So many of them do, especially with
these, these phony personas. Man,

1579
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:53,620
you know it was not funny at all.
The fucking president,

1580
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:57,700
and he actually gave me a shout out.

1581
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:01,180
I wanted to show you guys,
it's pretty nuts.

1582
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:05,950
Saw this video.
Thank you very much Mr. Trump for,

1583
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:07,360

1584
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:14,070
Don't want a champion. Yes, it
was a champion. He still needs to.

1585
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,110

01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:33,840
Oh Wow. Damn articulate man, president,

the White House La. Get ready.

1603
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:27,823

Wait for the prompt for Trump to come
out with these little Trump nineties bed.

1608
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:46,220
check them out by president. This guy's
definitely my president and my president.

1609
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:50,470
Sure. Man. Much better than
the old cousin. There's a
real question right here.

1610
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,790
He'll get shit done.
He's getting it done.

1611
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:56,130
Let me get that pm from a
Germany pregnant, right? Yeah.

1612
01:43:56,150 --> 01:44:00,320
I mean that guy would
totally hit Merkel's. That
her name Marie. Yeah, right.

1613
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:05,260
He totally lost dog shit. Totally raw
dog. You'd get a fucking trade back.

1614
01:44:05,261 --> 01:44:09,260
Go it. Get your pregnant now. You got
to work with me. You'll have my baby

1615
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:16,020
Merkel who would definitely drop a seed
and Merkel and be like so different.

1616
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:20,360
It's such an old picture.
We've got to update this picture.

1617
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:24,100
We took that at Sears years ago.
Great.

1618
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:28,070
It's so great. They looked at us
like, what the fuck are you guys?

1619
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:33,200
You're that one brother in that family
of the parents who had 90 kids and,

1620
01:44:33,201 --> 01:44:34,850
but you're the one that
molested all of them.

1621
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:41,710
You figure blasted all
your sister. Oh Man. Jeez.

1622
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:47,630
Okay. Too Much Jesus Cruz.
Now. It's never a man.

1623
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:52,580
Um, wait, so that people know. You
mentioned there's an album out.

1624
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,533
Is there an album out?

1625
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:57,390
I have a double album out.
It's called the diabolical.

1626
01:44:57,391 --> 01:44:59,430
The first album is a storytelling.

1627
01:44:59,431 --> 01:45:04,380
I got some great stories about how I got
away from a police helicopter chase a

1628
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:08,580
couple of gigs. I did it in the desert,
some crazy shit, special Olympics show.

1629
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:12,870
And then the second album was called
Friday night late show and it's basically

1630
01:45:12,871 --> 01:45:14,490
me bombing for an hour.

1631
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:19,180
I so admire the guys that do shit like
that though. I'm putting it out there.

1632
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:20,410
Where did you record that

1633
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:25,130
Sacramento punchline? And
they were just sloppy, sloppy.

1634
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:28,970
And I'm like, you know what, how many
times you be able to put a double album?

1635
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I'm like, fuck it. I'm going to put
it out and see how it goes. And uh,

1636
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:37,340
about five minutes and I realized this
crowd is not playing along and then just

1637
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:41,690
start ripping them a new asshole for
like 45 minutes. And I had the best time.

1638
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,690
Really? Yeah. So I put it out.
So it's like two hours of power

1639
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,750
and there's like, there's, is
there a major bombing moments?

1640
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:52,060
Oh yeah.
But even my bombing is entertaining.

1641
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,330
I go out in a blaze of glory. You
know what? I'm going for it. Oh yeah.

1642
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:59,200
I'm going to leave a mark. I'll grab
the fucking planes, fucking controllers,

1643
01:45:59,201 --> 01:46:02,410
flight rate into the building. I don't
give a fuck. You know what I'm saying?

1644
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:06,280
I like to have fun. I mean, that's
just, Oh, our late night comedy.

1645
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:09,550
You got to get blood from a stone
sometimes of that comedy show.

1646
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:14,030
I mean, on what, like explain to
people what late night. Oh our means,

1647
01:46:14,031 --> 01:46:15,540
even though they know,

1648
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:20,390
okay, the best way to describe it, you
are the hundredth man at a 99 gang bang.

1649
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:23,540
It is.
It is sloppy beat up,

1650
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:28,130
ready to go home and you got to
somehow get a reaction from this crowd.

1651
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,460
Everything's been talked
about a thousand times.

1652
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:35,480
They've seen every famous person they've
ever wanted to see and you just got to

1653
01:46:35,481 --> 01:46:39,380
somehow get them to not
only laugh but you can't.

1654
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:42,110
You've got to entertainment enough
that they stay for the next guy.

1655
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:45,720
So there's all this kind of pressure
on you to do it. So I love it. Yeah.

1656
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:50,070
On those late night spots to people
ever like, do you see guys go like if

1657
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,070
this sucks, they're just like,
just sabotage the spot and be like,

1658
01:46:53,071 --> 01:46:55,560
well fuck it and like not try.
Does that happen?

1659
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:59,010
I think occasionally that happens,

1660
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:03,120
but I think like all the people at
the end are kind of like friends with

1661
01:47:03,121 --> 01:47:05,850
everybody and we kind of all got her like,
we,

1662
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:08,520
I keep these people here for the
next person. Do you really do?

1663
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:13,020
I think everybody kind of works together
in this weird way and I have energy at

1664
01:47:13,021 --> 01:47:16,300
that hour. Right. And it's,
it's the comedy store. I mean,

1665
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,280
regardless of whether you're
doing a, uh, uh, you know, uh,

1666
01:47:20,281 --> 01:47:23,070
nine 45 or a 1:00 AM,

1667
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:28,100
it's still the comedy store and
no matter how how late you are,

1668
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:32,460
you've still blessed. I have to
be like one of what, 3000, 4,000,

1669
01:47:32,461 --> 01:47:37,140
5,000 comics in La to get a
spot in that room and that time.

1670
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:41,910
So it's had like 40 people working
that night, basically like,

1671
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:45,940
you know what I mean? Like crazy.
Like this, this size, it's good.

1672
01:47:45,941 --> 01:47:47,910
Attrition rate is so crazy for comedy.

1673
01:47:47,911 --> 01:47:49,890
Like when we all started
around the same time,

1674
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:52,140
when you think about who we started with,
it's crazier.

1675
01:47:52,141 --> 01:47:56,310
It's harder than Harvard law. Like
it's so hard. There's nobody left.

1676
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:00,630
It's basically comedy store versus
New York City comedy. Like that's all.

1677
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:04,710
If there was no comedy store,
I think La comedy be in Breely bad shape,

1678
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:08,940
but it's the one place, it's
kind of Mecca. Whereas you
go out to like New York,

1679
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:12,840
it's like such a different fun vibe out
there and you can explore by think the

1680
01:48:12,841 --> 01:48:16,670
comedy store is the one place where
you can take, well, I don't know.

1681
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,830
The lineups are so killer now,
but it's like it's Mecca.

1682
01:48:19,831 --> 01:48:23,220
So it's like even if you're doing
a one o'clock in the morning spot,

1683
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:25,360
you still want to do the
best that you can. Yeah.

1684
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,380
Because if you start tanking it,

1685
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,420
they'll take that away from you and
they'll put somebody else in there who,

1686
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:33,700
they will watch it
though. Okay. Keep an eye,

1687
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:36,390
keep tabs on and we'll get out if like,
you know,

1688
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:38,940
like this guy's just Sam snitches to man.

1689
01:48:38,941 --> 01:48:41,880
There's some snitches
crybaby bullshit going on,

1690
01:48:41,881 --> 01:48:46,881
which I've wouldn't ruled and never
talk bad about a comic tool booker.

1691
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:50,070
I think that's just the worst fucking
figure. The world. That's real shit.

1692
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:54,150
I think that's the low, I mean like
it's just below stealing jokes.

1693
01:48:54,151 --> 01:48:58,110
He goes stealing jokes and then shit
talking. Even if I don't like somebody,

1694
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,440
I would never talk shit to them
to a booker. But people do that.

1695
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,260
And so you get those late night spots.
I think they're the only,

1696
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:08,670
they're the only spots and work on
shit store. Those early spots, man,

1697
01:49:08,671 --> 01:49:13,140
you got to fucking sling heat
because it's just murder's row.

1698
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,680
When you get like past 1130,
it's like it starts to thin out,

1699
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,180
you can take a couple more chances.

1700
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,930
And that's kind of what I do miss that
part of the comedy store where it was

1701
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:25,480
like a workout room. But I
also understand that, you know,

1702
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:30,300
Adam and Eric and all those guys have
to have that place sold out or else

1703
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:33,720
they'll knock it down and turn it into
like a fucking condominium or some shit

1704
01:49:33,721 --> 01:49:37,140
like that. And by the way, that
uh, as far as workout rooms,

1705
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,690
I feel like there's really
nothing like the belly room.

1706
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,950
That belly room is like fucking amazing.
I'm starting a new new room.

1707
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:47,620
It's called the Dojo and a,
I'm going to doing it.

1708
01:49:47,621 --> 01:49:50,380
We're doing it Thursdays and the
goal is to kind of get it going.

1709
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:53,920
So it's like you can actually go
work on shit. That'd be great.

1710
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:58,120
It's right down the street from the comedy
store. The show would start at eight.

1711
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:01,230
You guys could do your spots and
then run down to your store set and,

1712
01:50:01,231 --> 01:50:04,420
but you can do 1520 of
just working on shit.

1713
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:06,430
See, I like when it's,
I like when the show,

1714
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:09,370
like people say work on
shit at all kinds of shows,

1715
01:50:09,371 --> 01:50:12,700
but I like when it's designated as such,
like when it's advertised as such.

1716
01:50:12,701 --> 01:50:13,840
So the audience goes,

1717
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:18,670
this is an actual gym right now that
changes the dynamic of the show.

1718
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:21,190
You really feel like you
can take real chances.

1719
01:50:21,191 --> 01:50:24,670
It's not like you're doing a regular
Saturday night show somewhere and they're

1720
01:50:24,671 --> 01:50:27,810
like, work shit out. And
you're like, okay. But it's
like when the show was like,

1721
01:50:27,811 --> 01:50:31,960
that's why I liked that, that stand
up on this spot. And I love that show.

1722
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:37,870
And uh, use of new materials show. It's
like, this is, this is not proven stuff.

1723
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:38,831
This is,
you know what I mean?

1724
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:42,400
You really feel like you can
really jump into half the

1725
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:45,150
be able to fail.
Yeah.

1726
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:48,300
And sometimes in la it's very hard.

1727
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:53,280
Like the Improv is like Pablo Francisco
long time ago told me never work on new

1728
01:50:53,281 --> 01:50:56,840
shit. The improv, like that's the office,
that's where the industry goes. Hangouts.

1729
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,510
Now the comedy store is kind of that,
but it's like,

1730
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:02,640
and then he used to be at the comedy store
cause there was like 20 people in the

1731
01:51:02,641 --> 01:51:07,000
crowd and everybody's doing coke in
the back and fuck and having weird fuck

1732
01:51:07,001 --> 01:51:11,060
weirdness. You could work on shit. But
it's not like that anymore. So I uh,

1733
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:15,030
I'm working on this place every night.
You sit fucking 50 people in there.

1734
01:51:15,031 --> 01:51:18,090
It's packed out. It's a great
idea. Let us know when you,

1735
01:51:18,091 --> 01:51:19,240
when it's up and running Russia,

1736
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:23,460
my goal is to get gone Wednesday
through Saturday and have this guy,

1737
01:51:23,461 --> 01:51:25,260
my buddy TK him and I run it.

1738
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:29,340
And then you could show up every day
and whenever you want to work on shit.

1739
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:33,330
Oh wait, is it t? K? Um, what's
his name? I forget tks last name,

1740
01:51:33,331 --> 01:51:36,090
but he's like a calm around
forever. Yeah. But he, yeah,

1741
01:51:36,091 --> 01:51:40,530
he's a friend of mine and I cause it set
this bar that I saw on like the use of

1742
01:51:40,531 --> 01:51:42,960
an upstairs. I'm like disappeared.
Great Place for Comedy Club.

1743
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:46,950
And I go there and Teekay's run room.
We'd been friends for a long time.

1744
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:50,850
Like I want to do a new room here, so
a new night. He's like, let's do it.

1745
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:53,460
So we've done it.
It's been packed out the last two times.

1746
01:51:53,461 --> 01:51:56,160
I want to start getting every week
I want to get it so starts running.

1747
01:51:56,370 --> 01:51:57,660
That's cool.
By the way,

1748
01:51:57,661 --> 01:52:01,410
I think it's so funny that they had like
the old cheat code to getting past for

1749
01:52:01,411 --> 01:52:05,940
Mitzi was. I love that. That it was
like ethnic thing, family thing,

1750
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:10,590
your favorite bit. I wish I had known
that I fucking did not get passed for her.

1751
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:15,180
And I remember I was on
stage and I look and she was,

1752
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:20,050
you know, straight back like we're
Adam basically sits and um, I,

1753
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:25,230
I could in the middle of like first bit
or like second bit and I can see her

1754
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:30,540
talking to somebody and I'm like, ah,
getting hijacked. And like, yeah. Yeah.

1755
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:33,510
And I'm just like trying to like say
what I'm saying and then, uh, you know,

1756
01:52:33,511 --> 01:52:35,670
I'm turning here and I
would look back and she was,

1757
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:39,330
I could see her still being like, no, no,
no, like just, just having a conversation.

1758
01:52:39,331 --> 01:52:42,890
I was like, fuck. And then I, you know,
I'm like, what happened? They're like, no,

1759
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:47,750
I should know. Ah, man.
But a comic the same night,

1760
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:51,830
I remember this opened with like,
I know what you're thinking.

1761
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:54,650
Like I look like this past,

1762
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:59,300
yeah, well she was old school, you
know, and she's little, but she,

1763
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:01,110
she had a vision to,

1764
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:05,960
there's all these famous stories
of like famous people coming up,

1765
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:09,350
calling her up going, hey, I'm blah
blah blah mom, blah blah, blah.

1766
01:53:09,351 --> 01:53:13,780
I'd love to play your club.
And she's like, I'm gonna
fuck, hang up. You know? So I,

1767
01:53:13,781 --> 01:53:16,940
I, I get, she treated me well.
I don't know what it was.

1768
01:53:16,941 --> 01:53:20,120
I was getting tons of spots in
there and it, I, it was a blessing.

1769
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:21,740
It was also kinda
encouraged cause you'd like,

1770
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:24,650
you're getting like five spots
a week at the comedy store.

1771
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:27,560
I don't want to go on the road.
I'm make money here.

1772
01:53:27,561 --> 01:53:31,460
I'm doing all these live
shows, selling all the sad
stuff, you know, I mean it's a,

1773
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:35,270
I'm making all these a sponsorship money
so I don't want to go on the road as

1774
01:53:35,271 --> 01:53:38,060
much as I did it and then it's like
becomes this kind of false victory.

1775
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,070
So I think the key is to
do a little bit there,

1776
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:42,080
then go out and practice
your Kung Fu out there.

1777
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:45,230
It's like now you're getting a
lot of spots there and it's like,

1778
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:46,730
it's such an interesting thing.

1779
01:53:46,731 --> 01:53:51,140
And the reason I think it's one of the
hardest rooms to do is because there's no

1780
01:53:51,141 --> 01:53:55,460
host you have to go up.
It can be like five o'clock fire,

1781
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:58,940
like Rogan just flame
throwed that fucking room.

1782
01:53:58,941 --> 01:54:03,320
And guess who has to go up right after
that. You're right. And you know,

1783
01:54:03,321 --> 01:54:04,370
it's so interesting,
isn't it?

1784
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,071
To up your game.

1785
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:09,060
You gotta you know you can't really
fuck around and makes you focus on what

1786
01:54:09,061 --> 01:54:09,470
you're,

1787
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:13,580
I think I'm going to ask the file Joey
Dsl the time just to see if I could crack

1788
01:54:13,581 --> 01:54:17,600
that code. Cause it's just, I mean
it's a combination of like funny,

1789
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:20,760
well-written, super energy. I,

1790
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:23,330
I followed him couple times
for the first five minutes.

1791
01:54:23,331 --> 01:54:25,720
I'm like Charlie Brown's mom,
no one's listened.

1792
01:54:25,721 --> 01:54:29,960
I'm like Mall Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah
Wah Wah Wah and everything show it is,

1793
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:31,850
it's uncle Joe.
And then after they settled,

1794
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:33,220
either way,
that dude,

1795
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:38,280
especially for 15 to 20
minutes is a nightmare.

1796
01:54:39,130 --> 01:54:43,270
Like you know, it's like that
amount of time for him is like,

1797
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:46,450
cause he can really like just
drop a grenade, you know,

1798
01:54:46,451 --> 01:54:47,830
it doesn't have to like it's,
it's

1799
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:50,940
Rogan used to bring me out with
them and I'd always have to,

1800
01:54:50,941 --> 01:54:55,530
I'd have to fall Diaz. Yeah. Yeah.
And one time in San Jose Dude,

1801
01:54:55,830 --> 01:55:00,830
he opened up and did like 12 minutes
of like next level as seating material,

1802
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,410
like next level.
And I just want to go,

1803
01:55:04,411 --> 01:55:07,170
what do I have that can
fall back and it's nothing.

1804
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:10,890
It's nothing and you go rogue. You're,
why are you making me follow this guy?

1805
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:15,900
I go following Joey Diaz at the Joe Rogan
show is like featuring or middling for

1806
01:55:15,901 --> 01:55:18,330
van Halen,
but the opening act is David Lee Roth.

1807
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,820
Yeah,
I had it.

1808
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:24,850
I had a number of Rogan tour dates where
I would follow him too and I'd be like,

1809
01:55:25,101 --> 01:55:29,060
this sucks man. I used to be, you
know what I do just settle in harder.

1810
01:55:29,061 --> 01:55:33,590
The material,
not tried to fight what he had done.

1811
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:39,140
Just try to like stay in the in the
material and see if like maybe a minute

1812
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:40,790
later they'll kind of gravitate to you.

1813
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:45,540
That's kind of what I've learned man over
like at some point at the comedy store,

1814
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:49,050
my material was carrying me
when I was like had Bambi legs,

1815
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:52,110
you know where I'm like, Oh yeah,
just let the material carry me.

1816
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:55,110
Right now it's kind of like I
can fall anybody. I've been fine.

1817
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:59,400
I mean like horse during my first two
years at the comedy store for at least the

1818
01:55:59,401 --> 01:56:03,390
first year I got bumped by dice
every night. He just come in,

1819
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:06,390
he would come and find me on the
lineup and be like, I want to go here.

1820
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:11,220
And he would just do an hour before me
and then rogue and I had the fall Rogan

1821
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:11,970
all the time.

1822
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:16,970
So any week I was either following Rogan
dice or Eddie Griffin doing literally

1823
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:18,660
two and a half,
three hours.

1824
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:21,670
I just remember, I remember seeing
him do, um, by the way, way,

1825
01:56:21,671 --> 01:56:23,850
but you know a work there
just hanging out there.

1826
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:27,700
And he was like standing on
room on tables in the Oh,

1827
01:56:27,701 --> 01:56:32,701
are like walking from table to table
smoking and talking about a Jewish

1828
01:56:33,391 --> 01:56:38,391
conspiracy theories about how
the highways or the roads in DC,

1829
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,940
how they design them. And I was like, what
is going? And I wasn't a regular there,

1830
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,940
so I was just like stepping in. I'm like,
this is what happens here. Have this guy,

1831
01:56:44,941 --> 01:56:47,970
he's talks about these crazy theories and,

1832
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:52,020
and smokes and nobody says anything
like it was bananas to watch, you know,

1833
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:56,580
like it, I was really, I was so floored
by what I saw and not in a good way.

1834
01:56:56,581 --> 01:56:59,370
I was just like, I need to stay
away from this place. They get nuts.

1835
01:56:59,450 --> 01:56:59,661
Well,

1836
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:03,350
I was born and bred in that shit and
then I will go on the road and thinking

1837
01:57:03,351 --> 01:57:07,510
everything's the comedy store and just
go nuts. And it was just like, Eh,

1838
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:11,990
it was like wrong thing.
So I had to readjust myself.

1839
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:15,620
It's interesting to go out going,
okay, not everything's a comedy source.

1840
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:19,720
So my style of comedy, I call a gator
roll. It's where it's like, you know,

1841
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:21,340
alligators kill things.
They,

1842
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:26,060
they grab it at the top and then they
slowly drag it down and then they drowned

1843
01:57:26,061 --> 01:57:30,500
in spin around. I started really simple
with maybe some shit, my pants material,

1844
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:33,890
right. Bring them in. Yeah. Relatability.
And then next thing you know,

1845
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:37,310
I'm doing a bit about smoking crack
with his fucking black robot guy.

1846
01:57:37,311 --> 01:57:41,970
That happened to me one
time. There you go. Perfect.

1847
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:46,250
Oh good dude. Gimme gimme the plugs.
Where can people find everything?

1848
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:51,080
Uh, you guys check out my double
album. The diabolical, it's on iTunes.

1849
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:55,490
It's two hours of superpower. That
Sam Tripoli's album. It's great.

1850
01:57:55,491 --> 01:57:56,750
I'm going to shoot a special,

1851
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:59,900
I'm going to shoot my own special
and I'm just going to put it out.

1852
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,600
I'm not even gonna try to
sell it anywhere. Where you
going to shoot it? You know,

1853
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,370
I'm trying to find the right place.

1854
01:58:04,371 --> 01:58:07,210
I want to do the viper room
cause I just love doing standup.

1855
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:10,880
They're perfect for you and it's got
kind of like a name cache and it's just

1856
01:58:10,881 --> 01:58:13,940
really small and simple. I just
want to shoot a name, your price.

1857
01:58:13,941 --> 01:58:15,730
I'm going to probably shoot
that in the next month or two.

1858
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:17,850
You gonna wear your Mister
Magoo glasses or no?

1859
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:22,230
I don't know man. I don't
know. Hip Hop rap video.

1860
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:27,510
I might have corn rows by then and
then check out my podcast. Tinfoil hat.

1861
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,180
I just did a swap cast with a Duncan
Trussell and now you just did woman Doug

1862
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:34,230
Stanhope just go to Tin
Tinfoil hat with Sam Tripoli.

1863
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:38,190
And a check on my youtube page.
I upload something every day.

1864
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:40,440
youtube.com backslash Sam Tripoli.

1865
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,820
I'll put something I call
opiate for the acids,

1866
01:58:42,821 --> 01:58:46,900
which is just a 30 minutes of
just Crowdwork me ripping people.

1867
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:51,280
And then I do something called twerking
in politics where I take twerk videos

1868
01:58:51,281 --> 01:58:52,260
from, uh, uh,

1869
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:56,710
Instagram and I put political messages
over them and I tried to spell you're a

1870
01:58:56,810 --> 01:59:00,220
madman. I love your Instagram and wait,
do you still do punchdrunk right? Yeah,

1871
01:59:00,221 --> 01:59:03,700
I do punch drunk with Ari. Shaffir I
want to show you guys the bleaching,

1872
01:59:03,701 --> 01:59:08,090
but we're out of time. But, uh, I did it
with Ari Shaffir and Jason Tebow and uh,

1873
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:12,370
you know, we're about to
launch our own network. We,
I'm talking to you a year ago,

01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:24,100
I love you.
You're the first,

1877
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:27,010
you're the power couple of comedy.

1878
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:30,370
You're by far the funniest
and the fact that you guys,

1879
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:31,950
you guys are huge in the [inaudible].

1880
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:33,760
You guys should be on
everything all the time.

1881
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:36,820
But I think you guys have your
own wonderful things going on.

1882
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:40,660
You don't fucking need that. You're
the fucking two funniest people I know.

1883
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:44,980
And you're the nice people. I know.
We love you. Thanks for coming.

1884
01:59:44,981 --> 01:59:49,510
Did I hijack your show? No. Okay. Not at
all. It got weird with the pedophilia.

1885
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:53,400
We weirded him.
This thing about marrying your mom

1886
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:56,970
stuff like it's a very common theme.
Yeah, no, no, it's all, it's all good man.

1887
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:01,870
It gets weird enough here.
I jerked out to a cousin wants to go.

1888
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:10,160
It's um, it's fine cause these to
marry cousins and royal family,

1889
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:13,630
just like the gays, just
like the gays case. So, um,

1890
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:15,920

out all of Sam's stuff.

1891
02:00:15,921 --> 02:00:17,570
Thank you again for listening to the show.

1892

1896
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,310
I'm seeing my dad's balls.

1897
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:42,150
I've seen my dad's balls.
I've seen my dad

1898
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:43,023

1899
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:49,050
His balls were enormous.

1900
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:50,143
Yeah.

1901
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:53,250
I'm seeing my dad's balls.

1902
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:57,490

Enormous.

02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:15,260
Gigantic.
Okay,

awesome.

1907
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:07,000
You can
look like animal

1908
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:12,380
testicles,
animal testicles.

1909
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:14,360
That sounds awful.
