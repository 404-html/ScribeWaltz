125
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:04,650
decided to do their own club and they
work their balls and tits off. Yeah.

sang that song on the show yet? Um,

147
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,390
no, not a wine. That's just, uh, that's

148
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:34,060
personal song. Yeah. We haven't
shared that with the world.

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,320
Let's go.
Do you feel like you eat?

150
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,190
Thanks a lot, Rachel. Oh, loved
Frank's to you, Matt charging.

151
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,640
Not charging on my iPad because it's
got youth to your iPad instead of mine.

152
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,250
It's not charging my pad and it's all job.
Oh,

153
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,300
I hope y'all happy because I've told mom

154
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,940
no,
bring it

155
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,460
to your mom's house,

156
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,543
Christina.

157
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,193
Okay.

158
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,900
This is my second of the day. Actually.
I know you just interviewed your parents.

159
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,740
Yes. Big News. Topdog
and Charo right in here.

160
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,600
We did an hour. Where did she sit here?
No, she sat there. Td got this one.

161
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,710
Oh boy.
There was some ridiculous stuff.

162
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,390
So what are we going to
get to hear that one?

163
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,280
Um, I dunno cause everything
right now, the yard, you know.

164
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,230
Right. And I had Maria in here. Yeah.
So I got, I got a bunch of stuff.

165
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,320
We have Maria at the house,
I should say.

166
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,340
I got some quality time with my sister in
law. And while you were gone, oh my God,

167
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:28,880
seriously. It was Omg, Maria,

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,890
her baby and me and our baby.
And it was a whirling dervish.

169
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,950
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously.
Seriously. Seriously, seriously.

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
I mean your sister was
up at 5:00 AM with a kid

171
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,680
first day. So people know, you know,

172
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,400
Los Angeles does have a lot of hills. You
know, there's like there's hills. Yeah.

173
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,460
In different regions of the city.

174
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,760
We live in a neighborhood that built on
a hillside and it is almost entirely at

175
00:12:57,181 --> 00:12:59,970
an incline, like you pull in the
neighborhood and you know, it's just,

176
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,410
it's all uphill. Yeah. Day One. She,

177
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,360
I get up and she's been up there.
She's like, hi. Yeah. Hi. Yeah.

178
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,630
Actually I can tell she's been outside.
You know, she's wearing it. Yeah.

179
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:19,230
And then she's like, like, she's got sun
and she's sweating. I go, what'd you do?

180
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,380
I was going, I went on the
run. I go, where'd you run?

181
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,670
Just through the neighborhood. And I
go, how far do you run? And she goes,

182
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:30,840
five miles, five miles.
How did you know? She goes,

183
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,780
I download an APP and it tells
you where to go. And I go,

184
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:37,860
this neighborhood's like all uphill.
And she goes, yeah, me and my daughter,

185
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,990
she did a stroller run
up hill for five miles.

186
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,390
No, I know. And then she's ready for the
day. And then that's when they start.

187
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,720
Now she's like, I'm ready. I'm
ready for the day. She jacked.

188
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,150
So at one point I'll just tell you this,

189
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:55,980
I don't know even know if I told
you the whole story. I won't.

190
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,790
What I want it to hang some
lights in the backyard.

191
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,400
I bought some wides on Amazon, I wanted
a bed, we had big plans for these lights.

192
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,680
You and I went to the hardware store,

193
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,080
we bought like bamboo rods
and try to hang, you know,

194
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,850
like those years in restaurant lines.

195
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,070
So I figured to keep your sister occupied
because I don't like doing stuff.

196
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,010
Right. Okay. And I can say I s I
knew it already when we were a low,

197
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:22,230
what are we gonna do today? Know it was
kind of wondering, we're not happen.

198
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,100
So I think I figure I'm going to keep
Maria occupied and I'm going to make it

199
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,560
her project to hang up the lights.
Yeah.

200
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,850
And I'll just kind of chill out with Ellis
and you know, watch the chaos unfold.

201
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,790
Well the chaos and folded your sister is
like, okay, where can we plug these in?

202
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,680
And then she found one outlet and
then, you know, outcomes, the wiring.

203
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,750
And then I go, I listen, we,

204
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:52,160
we need to dig holes to put
the bamboo in the grass.

205
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,470
I go, we don't want, we don't
have a shovel. I don't know
how we're gonna do this.

206
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:58,160
That's okay. I'll just, I'll go get
a spoon. She goes into our kitchen,

207
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,520
she's the one that thought of that.
She thought of that of course,

208
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,120
got a spoon and then one of
our knives cooking knives,

209
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,960
she pulls it out of the thing and I,
before I know it,

210
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,880
she's already digging with a nice kitchen
knife and a spoon. And I go, Maria,

211
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,440
I think we got to abort this mission.

212
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,490
I have something tells me this is
not the right way to do lists. I go,

213
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:22,220
let's just a board, are you sure?
Cause I think I can figure this out.

214
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,400
We're going to do this. I'm like,
no, you can't do that. Then she goes,

215
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,220
why don't I just climb up these trees
and climb the trees and I'll put them in

216
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:31,610
the trees. I'll just climb up the
trees and I go, what? And she goes,

217
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:34,400
I climb trees every day. It's fine.
It's fine. I was like, I don't think so.

218
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,120
Maybe not this time. Do you have
a ladder? I go, forget it. No,

219
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,950
it's crazy.

220
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,360
Your sister wanted to dig holes with
spoons and knives and then climb arteries.

221
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,250
She's crazy. Total crazy. That's her.

222
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:53,840
That's been her since we were kids. Yeah,
quite an imagination and always going.

223
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:56,630
Never stops. Never stops.
It's never seen her retired.

224
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,860
Just goes so much.

225
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,220
A couple of things. First of all, how
adorable is this, Bro? I'm telling mom.

226
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,990
It's also interesting that she told this.
I presume this is her sister,

227
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,260
but she told her via video message.

228
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,030
That's maybe just what kids do now.
Right? We don't leave notes now.

229
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,500
This is the no opposed to note a
video note. I hope. God, thanks a lot.

230
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,160
Thanks it auction Ethiopia. Thanks
a lot Mitchell. Thanks a lot.

231
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,150
Thanks to you. Matt is not
charging on my iPod because he's

232
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,040
not trying to.

233
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,900
It's all on them because
I've told mom happy.

234
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,780
I hope y'all happy.
I've told mom

235
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,080
is great. She so mad yet. Yeah, look at
that. That's such a stern talking to you.

236
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,110
I hope y'all had backs. So cute. Oh Mom,

237
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,210
what did she mean?
The iPad gets used to someone's charged.

238
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,790
There is a weird thing with chargers
sometimes when you plugged them into

239
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:12,470
certain devices like the same,
I don't know that it's a thing,

240
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:15,800
you know that's been proven, but you
put it in yours, you're like, oh,

241
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,410
it doesn't work. Somebody else puts
it in there as, and it charges.

242
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,330
Is that true to ban? Yeah. Oh,
that's a new one. Thank you.

243
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,310
I got that from the
Internet. Oh really? Yeah.

244
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:29,990
I was going to tell you someone called
Dj man. Make that up. That's fine.

245
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,530
I'll take it.
Excellent.

246
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,650
Is that true? I have seen it
happen before. I'll be like, oh,

247
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,330
this device doesn't recognize this wire.
I've seen weird stuff. Oh yeah, yeah,

248
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,890
I've seen that.
Legit.

249
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,920
She's fired up,
man.

250
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,090
I did one of those things.

251
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:54,840
You remember how forever we didn't realize
we could just put an extension cord

252
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:59,000
so you can plug things on your
side of the bed. So dumb. Yeah,

253
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,300
and I was so many things for
so long. I know. I'm like,

254
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,190
we can just plug it in and an extension
cord and you're like, oh my God.

255
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,250
And then the other one
was we just had one,

256
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,440
a charger for our devices,

257
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,050
like for r three two iPads.
Two iPhones.

258
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,530
Yeah. And then I was at a mall
like a month ago and I go,

259
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm going to buy more chargers so that
now we could charge more stuff at once.

260
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,590
It was like a breakthrough thought for me.
What's wrong with us?

261
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,730
I think you and I are like Frat boys.
Like whatever's happening is fine.

262
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,670
We'll just make,

263
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,380
just make it do we just get used to
this because we were broke for so long.

264
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,200
That's why I don't think we
realized we can spend $12 now on it.

265
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:50,010
She actually, and they
fucking rob you. Seriously.

266
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,120
How much is first of all,
they conveniently, they go,

267
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,820
we were selling just the chart.

268
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,530
Like the plug in the charger has one
now they sell the part that goes in the

269
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:05,910
wall. No. Or that goes on
your device separately. Both.

270
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,410
And I think one's 29
and one's mother fucker.

271
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,270
You buy like a $50 no. Yeah.
Yeah. It's expensive. Very
get your entire life. Yeah.

272
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:18,420
It's expensive. What about that one
we have downstairs and the kitchen.

273
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,060
That's just a one piece.
It looks kind of old school.

274
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,360
[inaudible] that one's a
gray charger by yeah. Yeah.

275
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,060
That one is made by an
outside. That's good. Yeah.

276
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,360
We got to get more of that for cheaper.
I mean they all those people,

277
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,280
those was the way to go. There's that
much cheaper, such scumbags. Crazy.

278
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,630
But they make such good shape. By the way,
do you want to hear somebody made a, um,

279
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,690
a version of your mom's house?
Yeah.

280
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,590
This is Dj wet nut sack.
Okay.

281
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,820
It's his version of the associates.

282
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,420
The as big Tam who is Randy,
don't bring anyone loving to this.

283
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,260
Your Mama and the funk is style.

284
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,600
Well, the hair, your mom's house

285
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,613
said

286
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,110
your mom's house

287
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,110
sounds like the uh,
the South Park.

288
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,340
A teacher. You what I'm talking
about? Yeah. Mister Mister.

289
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:23,420
Hey Mr. Garrison. Yeah. It's
like Mr. Garrison has doing this.

290
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,730
You know this guy?
No.

291
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,270
But he did submit something like a week
or two ago and he was so stoked to your

292
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,820
stuff that you submitted us like a whole
book. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Well I,

293
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,820
this is very interesting.

294
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,290
You got that part right

295
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,733
there.

296
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,910
Purposely said those things.

297
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,903
Oh,
okay.

298
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,260
Good job. Good job, Dj wet notes at
your mom was in the fucking stage.

299
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,100
There's a cutting that and stains and
he'll tell you how this is supposed to go.

300
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:21,850
Okay.
This shit is big time.

301
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,660
Come on now. Who is Randy?
That's good job. Oh,

302
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,310
bring anyone loving there.
Don't bring any was mother into this.

303
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,910
Your Mama and the funk is stay or what?

304
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,050
Your mom and the fucking
stands, man. Come on.

305
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,840
You got to listen to at Patrion
episode where we break down this intro.

306
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,890
We just spent like 30 minutes covering
this. Which episode is that? Blue Bat? Uh,

307
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,790
I think that might be episode three on
patriotic [inaudible] dot com slash mom.

308
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,240
There you go. Uh, yeah, we go into detail.

309
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,050
Do you want to hear the every of
how the intro was made? Um, yeah.

310
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,440
Patrion on.com/. Dot. Um,

311
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,830
put that shit down. So then you had,
you had Mario with you for a few days.

312
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,540
I'm exhausted. So your sister
left and I, I felt so tired.

313
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,050
Like I think that's what, why I'm still
so exhausted is just having any guests.

314
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,930
Yeah. And then having your sister
who's just having two babies, her baby,

315
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:29,660
our baby,
we had nonstop tears.

316
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,050
So many cries and then family was here
yesterday and that was exhausting and

317
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,230
really get together yesterday.
We dead. Yeah, we sure. Did

318
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,070
she talk about who wasn't
at the gathering? No.

319
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,870
Who? Oh yeah, go ahead. Can I
tell them what we did yesterday?

320
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,410
Are you okay with that? Sure, of
course. He baptized our son Ellis,

321
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,850
so now he's going to go to
heaven. Um, and uh, so I,

322
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,350
we invited the whole,
the clan,

323
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,320
the there was already was baptized
cause every time we see this blue band,

324
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,840
he cries on the right path.

325
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,410
That's good.
He knows he's not Christian.

326
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,120
Right. So we extended the invitation to
everybody and their families and my dad,

327
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,890
I told him like months ago,
this is happening. It's like,
oh, I can't go. I'm like,

328
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:27,750
why? Why? It's you're, you're
only grandsons baptism.

329
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,360
What can be more important
than, Oh, I'll go into Vietnam.

330
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,680
So my dad left on like Thursday.
The baptism was on Sunday.

331
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:41,780
Like you couldn't move that
ticket, Bro. A couple of days.

332
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,230
It's so crazy. Right. Could've
could've left today. I love now.

333
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,510
Still still be there in time for all the
art he's looking at and it doesn't have

334
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,780
work. All the art he's looking at it
probably it's a probably a cultural trait,

335
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm guessing why it's so important
for him to be there. Well,

336
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,740
for you to say something
like that, I mean, maybe go
over where his last few trips

337
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,060
while he goes to other countries
like the Philippines or Thailand,

338
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,320
Brazil,
Brazil,

339
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:17,321
places known for their
culture and their art work.

340
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

341
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,040
I'm not sure that tied
in. I bought it. Did

342
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,410
you watch toes? I don't know
how you think. I don't know.

343
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,660
And I know what the common denominator is
with all these countries. Yeah, I dunno.

344
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,430
He got a stiff

345
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:44,030
and going after her better. I
don't know. So we'll, you know,

346
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,810
we'll see how that shakes down when
Ellis is old enough to ask why is it

347
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,800
grandfather in any way,

348
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,430
these photos.
Yeah.

349
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,490
So he couldn't make it

350
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,660
how that'd people made it.
People made it just fine,

351
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,630
but other people didn't
have trips planned.

352
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,130
Horrible. Oh my gosh. I got, I talk
to my shrink tomorrow for sure.

353
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,320
It's normal for him though. It start off.
Yeah, of course. For him. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,510
What do you think the logic
w w what was happening? Um,

355
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,530
I just think that like in his case,
he doesn't,

356
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,360
he doesn't think like the
way that others at all. Oh,

357
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,070
sorry. It's just, it's so
outside of his mindset.

358
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,270
Yeah. To go like, just to think like
that. To think like a human, oh no,

359
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,430
not like a human, like a person with
feelings. Oh, your dad's got it.

360
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:47,170
Kind of a one track kind of
focus on him, I think. You know.

361
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,910
Uh, yeah. I think, I think
it doesn't occur to him.

362
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,080
And even if you were to tell him, you
know, all the reasons like, hey, you know,

363
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:59,160
you should be here for this. And
yeah, I wasn't going to do that. Yeah,

364
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,100
I totally get that. But I
think he would go like, okay,

365
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,390
like I'll do that that cause
you asked me to do that. Yeah.

366
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,280
He doesn't think like I should do that.

367
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,670
No, there's no, there's no should.

368
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,790
I think that's the whole thing
with him is that there was never,

369
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,420
I ought to do x instead of y or Z.
Yeah.

370
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,260
He just does what he wants. You
know? There's no, there's no art.

371
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,600
There's no control. It's just
I what I want. All right.

372
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,190
Yeah.
That's a really heavy stuff sometimes.

373
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,813
Mm.

374
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,110
Yeah, and we'll scale it was this place.
It's interesting. That was crazy. Wait,

375
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:45,180
what? Now let's, okay, what's
his house didn't give it almost,

376
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,550
well that was going to
be a whole ordeal though.

377
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:52,420
We had to find a place for him and all
that stuff. I know it didn't work out. No,

378
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:55,930
it didn't work out. It's just so
it's, but it's interesting because,

379
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,200
but now that I think about it, I'm
not even sure, you know what I mean?

380
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,990
Like when you have a parent that's
a little kooky shoes, do even,

381
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,920
is it that parent that you want at these
events or is it the idealized version?

382
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,260
It's a good point, right?
Like I'm not even sure

383
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,920
for a long, long, long time.

384
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,840
You keep requesting the thing you want
right from the, from said person. Right,

385
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,330
right. It doesn't have to be
parents. It can be a friend.

386
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:23,810
It can be a sibling spouse,
right. Yeah. In, in different, uh,

387
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,290
scenarios like this. Yeah. And then you
get to the point where you're like, oh,

388
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,580
it's okay that said person,
right. Is Not at anything.

389
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,060
Or I just have to change my
expectation of set of person.

390
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,160
Yeah. Cause then that part isn't, you're
not going to get what you want. Yeah.

391
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,990
Maturity, man. Yeah. That's the part,
that's the thing that takes a long time.

392
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,220
40 years. I'm with you. I'm
seeing a shrink at the same,

393
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,360
same, same thing too, is like,
it's always about your expectation.

394
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,570
You're right with your
social, your parents switching
when you become a parent.

395
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,823
Yeah.

396
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,920
No. Wow. Was that synergy
[inaudible] synergy. Yeah.

397
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,860
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

398
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,290
So anyway, that was our
weekend. The family came. It
was a great time yesterday.

399
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:17,240
Top Dog and Charo Maria and
her husband that Bri, Bri,

400
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,770
my, my cousins came from
Riverside. My aunt. It was great.

401
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,190
She's hilarious. She's so, she's
the most normal besides my cousins,

402
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:28,970
the most normal person who squeezed into
my family. She's a social worker. Yeah.

403
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,830
Sweet Lady. She's retired now, but
like the sweetest person. So you know,

404
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:36,470
we had, we had a great time. Yeah,
it was great. It was going to,

405
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:37,760
her son's going to heaven

406
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,500
and hopefully we'll have a
cool pictures from Vietnam too.

407
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,670
Maybe I'll have a new mom. I
don't know. And I got to check.

408
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:49,490
This is cause this is Shara or maybe
you'll have a new brother or sister,

409
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,860
half Vietnamese.

410
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,120
Who knows? What does she say? She asking
about dinner? This is what she said.

411
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,640
Holy Shit.

412
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,170
You want to press pause and read that and
know it's going to take everything. Um,

413
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,590
it's an awfully long tech so you sure
you don't want to pause and read that.

414
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,630
Is it okay?

415
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,390
Yeah, yeah. I kind of skimmed
it. It's fine. It's fine.

416
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,180
It's my mom basically saying,

417
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,360
sweet plus.
I want to be nice to have course.

418
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,250
Oh sorry. That was the
wrong button. No, so gross.

419
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,580
You better get your life.
Anyway.

420
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,950
I'm excited that we're back
together again and the mommy dome.

421
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:34,150
Me Too. I love doing the show. People
ask me all the time on the road,

422
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,580
you know about how much pussy you get.
Well like I'll fuck a girl, right?

423
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,960
Like in the green room. And then she'll
be like, I love this. I love your

424
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,280
thanks. Then she's like, uh, like do you
like doing stand up or the podcast more?

425
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,070
I love doing standup. I don't think I'll
ever stop loving stand up. It's like my,

426
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,950
my love.
Uh,

427
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,430
but there's nothing is fun as
coming back and doing this podcast.

428
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,290
I really enjoyed this isn't it?
Yes. Our home. We got our world.

429
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,470
This is our silly little worlds.
It's very fun. It was neat.

430
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:10,471
I asked you to put my phone on the
charger last night cause I was asleep and

431
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:13,750
then he didn't do it right and I got
mad at you and when I walked over and it

432
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:17,950
was like God punish me because you farted
and it was like a hot garbage fart.

433
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,570
It was hot trash.
It was really disgusting.

434
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,880
The made me so happy.

435
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,780
It made me so happy.
What did you,

436
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,750
now that wasn't just dinner because
my farts didn't smell like that.

437
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,490
What did you eat on the road prior?

438
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,280
Actually it was a pretty health healthy
road weekend. Yeah. San Diego, California.

439
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:43,550
You can find like vegetables
and shit. Now. How's your
IBS update? Do we have one?

440
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,170
There's not really much of one. Well there
is an update. Um, I did always, you know,

441
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,390
you don't want to have the doubts.

442
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,480
So I went and I cleared the whole
food allergy thing off the table.

443
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,430
Okay. I got tested across the board and
there's nothing, no food allergies. Great.

444
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,270
Yeah. So that's, that's a relief.

445
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:05,410
And then when are we going
to be home for a few weeks

446
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,610
and then lagging me a drink?
I have to clear my whole system out.

447
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,740
You mean you have to shit a lot? Yeah.
Yeah, I've heard that is intense.

448
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:21,640
Like I heard that you shit a lot.

449
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Like he ever drink that dieters t that
Asian dieters who by accident I one time

450
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:32,830
in college I did so like slimming tea.
You just Shit Shit Shit.

451
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:33,490
I think it's like a,

452
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,280
it's pretty intense and I think it
actually is over a day of doing that.

453
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,580
Just shedding. I think maybe
I'll weigh in against burden,

454
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,650
but when I do that you got
to clear your calendar.

455
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,410
You're gonna lose like 10 pounds.
You wanted me to everybody.

456
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,420
I'm so this is,
this is the original original.

457
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,820
This guy's back, but let's, let's,
which bathroom is use? My God,

458
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,950
I talked at length about
that topic with my parents.

459
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,080
I got really serious

460
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,720
trying to have fun with gender
pronouns and then I definitely about,

461
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,730
I'm saying there's a transgender and he's
in the women's room when he's there to

462
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,564
rape.

463
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,590
I don't think that happens.
Okay.

464
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,910
He said they're there to rape.
Oh No.

465
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,640
All right. All right. Did you
ask your dad what is Pronoun?

466
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,350
I played in the clips of the pronouns
guy explaining stuff and they were just

467
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:36,580
like,
okay

468
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,490
my mom just like so are you
eat a day or them there?

469
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:45,740
My Dad actually made a good
point. He goes, well what happens?

470
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:50,670
I'm like you guys speak Spanish and
that's a masculine feminine language. Yes.

471
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,510
And I was like that's a
good question. Yes. Um,

472
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,700
but then we kind of figured out that
you could like instead of saying like a

473
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,930
Giddy,

474
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,930
you could say like [inaudible]
which is a disaster.

475
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,051
Yeah.

476
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:10,370
Cause in German there's within the words
still not just the word right before it,

477
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:14,540
the words end up being, you have to
match it to the feminine and masculine.

478
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,250
That's very German. You have deed dare
or dos, masculine, feminine and Neuter.

479
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,230
So they accommodated as well.

480
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,770
Maybe the neutral force both get ace.
Oh God.

481
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,870
It managed anyways. He got
just manage all scared. Ace.

482
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,480
I love this guy.
So

483
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,390
hello guys. I know, I know.

484
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,870
I am still seeing go.

485
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,560
I am seeing go and I am
looking for a girlfriend.

486
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,970
Yes, I am looking for a girlfriend.
If you know a girl who is single,

487
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,240
please tag her right now because I want
to go in the relationship with that

488
00:33:56,521 --> 00:34:00,390
guilt. All right. I want to go in
the relationship with that guilt.

489
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,370
If you know a girl who was single,

490
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,860
tag her right now because
I am looking for guilty.

491
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,250
Go in the relationship. I want to go.
You can't go to the movies with me.

492
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,220
Hold hands with me,
have sex with me.

493
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,850
I am looking for low guilt.

494
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,160
You can go in the relationship with me.

495
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:25,390
So if you know a girl who's single plays,
tag her right.

496
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,510
There's so much wrong because I
am single and I want to date her.

497
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,600
We know number one, maybe not
film in front of the toilet. Yeah,

498
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,880
I mean pick any other spot
on campus. Yeah, it's not,

499
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:42,410
it's not ideal right now. One, it's too
desperate. Women don't want that. No,

500
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,840
that's too much, but he's back. I
can't wait. I think he learned. Okay.

501
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,240
Let's see.
Let me just definitely more serious.

502
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:55,100
That was kind of silly kind of goofy.
Fuck. Look at, look at that face now.

503
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,310
Oh, he's grown up. Oh he looks
like he's raped. If you girl,

504
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,460
oh my God, what am I? God I look,

505
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,490
I'm not saying he did.
I'm just saying that's an intense no,

506
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:10,730
he just knows what it is to get a nut now.
Like he knew he got his nut.

507
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,290
I think he's actually been in there a
few times, so now it's more serious.

508
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,670
You know he was going for, what
happens is when you're a young,

509
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,670
young man, you're like Hee Hee Hee. Right.

510
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:26,350
And you think that can get
girls, it doesn't get girls. No,

511
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:29,660
it doesn't go good girls that want, when
you want to close the deal. What's a,

512
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,800
what do you mean you gotta be like a jerk,
not a jerk. I think. I think that like,

513
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,100
that silliness is not
how you get when you're,

514
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,580
especially when you're young, you know,
cause it's not label energy. Right.

515
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,600
It's goofy energy and girls, I want to leg
cause we energy lets you, the thing is,

516
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,500
unless you hang out with girls. Yeah,
but it's a nonthreatening type of thing.

517
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,760
It's a buddy buddy. At our g and right
here he learned. He learned that,

518
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:57,360
that's friend energy. This
is Dick Energy, right? Yeah.

519
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,940

energy. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that.

business. He's like, I've found a girl.

521

now emails. Let's see if he knows.

523
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,620
I think he knows now.
Okay.

524
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,900

525

531
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400

00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,590

535
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:05,090
chest and a six pack and
I am looking for guilty

536
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,090
know, oh my God, I think maybe
he didn't fully learn the lesson,

537
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,150
the correct. It sounds like a, a gay disco
in the background. Yep. And number two,

538
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,840
this only works this approach on other
data. You've said this before. Yeah.

539
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,940
This is, this is actually a great lesson.
Gee, this is not for women. He Won.

540
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,280
This is masculine towards men.

541
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,690
Guys that don't know that.
Yeah. It's usually younger.

542
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:30,524
Like he's a young guy.

543
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,970
He doesn't know they go because they're
so overwhelmed with their sexual

544
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,080
desires. Know how to get it. He doesn't
know what to do. Frustrated. Yeah. Yeah.

545
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:43,130
This isn't, he's, he's on the right path.
Booboo. You're almost there. Yeah. If,

546
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,360
if I were, I mean, good advice
would be what? Throw on a shirt. Um,

547
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,070
maybe talk,
there's gotta be some interest in no,

548
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,990
I think because the kind of girl he needs.
Yeah.

549
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,510
I don't think he's busted
that first night. Really.

550
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,490
He needs a girl who he needs a
gal who can, who's into the body,

551
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:06,110
the mind. Some girl who's
a real pig, who's his age,
who is like, I don't get it.

552
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,480
I'm a fan of that. About him.
That's the sky off. Like,

553
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,990
like your slut girl voices.
Yeah.

554
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,640
So he needs it to keep the shirt
off but not say what he wants.

555
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:20,460
He should talk about something else. Yeah.
And then girls will be all, oh my God,

556
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,880
we got a Hottie as like,
you know, Justin Bieber.

557
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,570
He used to do it where he'd
just be like, hey, you know,

558
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:29,360
and then you just don't talk
about wanting to fuck somebody.

559
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,930
I gotta look at that stare.
Oh my God, he's so into it.

560
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:36,830
He's got so much calm inside this raging
through his veins right now. Yeah.

561
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,630
You can smell it. It's too
much. Yeah. Poor guy. Yeah.

562
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,950
Can somebody please lay this guy?
Are you in New Zealand listening?

563
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:48,940
Can you find the guy that needs a
girlfriend if too much? What is his name?

564
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,860
At least say your fucking name.
And the video just says Chinese guy.

565
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,910
I know you might not even be
Chinese isn't racist Internet thing.

566
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,220
That's fucking Chinese guy.

567
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,590
I'm looking for a Gal. Um, I'm
looking for, he's really sweet.

568
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,520
Oh yeah. Well I dunno. I think
you've maybe got a little less sweet.

569
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,200
Yeah, he got, he got, he's just
angry. He's got testosterone nuts.

570
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,620
It was nuts. Need to get trained.
Somebody during that guy's nuts, please

571
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,840
guys. Let's do a Kickstarter
to drain this dude's a fly.

572
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:27,790
Someone there to drain his
nuts. That'd be great. Yeah. Um,

573
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,880
so many, so many fun things to talk
about. Oh, speaking of racist, um,

574
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,950
this lady, I as a white woman
and she has her own bed company.

575
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,630
Is that what it is?
She has a bed company.

576
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,470
I think that's just like her gimmick
or something. Right. And she is that,

577
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,740
it looks like, um, almost
like a company party of some
kind. Right. It's like, it's,

578
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,720
it seems like it's a
business related party.

579
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,200
Definitely a crowd full of her friends.
Yeah. And she sings a song yeah.

580
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,240
At this party.
Yeah.

581
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,680
About being a Ninja and goes
into a full Asian mockery of it.

582
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,280
And there's an Asian woman right next
to her who's face changes throughout the

583
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,250
performance. She's like,
oh, and then she's like,

584
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,960
you're being so racist right
now. Yeah. Oh, let's see.

585
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,720
Okay. Let's see. It's um,
it's pretty incredible.

586
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,370
Why is this not working?

587
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,160
Do a command.
Thank you.

588
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,060
[inaudible]

589
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,100
right boy. And this lady is
Jennifer Murphy beds. Um,

590
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,300
so here she is.
Okay.

591
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,590
[inaudible] yeah,

592
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,880
I shut my Murphy.
That's down to scratch my head.

593
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,690
What could this day brings right now?

594
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,610
Get the phone call.
I gotta go.

595
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,760
Go with there. But today,
tell him that scandal.

596
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,810
And at this point you're like,
all right,

597
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,650
she's singing the song and she's singing
it kind of in her what her voice would

598
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:22,530
be. Yeah. Then she
definitely shifts gears now.

599
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,270
And then curious lady,
it gets a little more curious.

600
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,840
Take me long to find the ticking bomb.

601
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,910
Chow is such a,
Craig,

602
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,260
I got to take downtown one day.

603
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,770
Not me.

604
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,890
Maybe.
Maybe I put could be Ninja.

605
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,960
I want to challenge,

606
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:08,060
I love it so much and I love it.
What is this song?

607
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,800
Is this a real song? Something
else? Do you know this song? No.

608
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,790
I don't know exactly how I'm mortified
this woman. Right? Yeah, I know.

609
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,103
Please keep playing.

610
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,613
Oh,

611
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,860
it's so embarrassing.
They started framing

612
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,170
thank God could go far.
I am a natural smile

613
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,060
with grantees,
cars,

614
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,630
even wealthy being done.
I used to all my knee just,

615
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,500
yeah. Soda. Yeah.

616
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,973
Solid rock.

617
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,340
I can't listen to it. It's hard. It's
so bad. It's like, oh my God. It's um,

618
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,540
it's embarrassing. Great. Yeah. And she
really offended that lady for sure. Yup.

619
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,470
Yeah. Good job. Yeah. So
that was really horrible.

620
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,260
No, yeah, it's really
bad. You reminds me of,

621
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:15,030
for some reason that summertime is great
people. Oh yeah. It's made shitty music.

622
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,200
Like it's almost a,
yeah.

623
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,270
This is almost too stupid to really
be offensive because you're like, oh,

624
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:22,310
she's just a dang dog.

625
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,940
It doesn't know what she's doing.
I would say that for sure. But, um,

626
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,460
word summertime, people should be fucking,
um, yeah. The worst. That was the worst.

627
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,780
There was the absolute worst.
Yeah. Um, you made a good song.

628
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,180
I just remember seeing that a second ago.
Yeah.

629
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,300
Wait a minute.
I think we should have a little contest.

630
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:48,030
This just reminded me.
Yeah. You know Nick Hog,

631
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,900
I think we've determined that his
worst song is breaking a sweat.

632
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,250
Did, did we read what he wrote or the
the, the email we got? Yeah, we did. Yeah,

633
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:57,690
yeah,
yeah,

634
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,630
yeah. You read it on the
show? Yes. Yes. Okay.

635
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,880
Now I'm saying apropos of this,

636
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,280
I nominate because I know how hard it is
to make music and I don't like to just

637
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,170
shit on people arbitrarily.

638
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,310
I'm going to put my song animal song up
against Nick Hawks breaking a sweat and

639
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:19,650
you tell me who song is better.

640
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,120
Christina put jetskis animal song
or nick hawks breaking a sweat.

641
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,700
I just to show that like I don't just
shit on people without putting my own hat

642
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:32,490
in the ring.
This is the first song I wrote.

643
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,480
I have a feeling breaking a
sweat as his first song and

644
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,560
this is garbage garbage

645
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,010
ring such correct. It's
embarrassing. Got a lot

646
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,360
so fucking bad. That's the fucking
worst song I've ever heard. God,

647
00:44:58,361 --> 00:44:59,400
you give it 18 seconds.

648
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:04,401
You just trashed it because I'm just
saying I don't think animal song is worse

649
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:07,660
than that. I've written one song in my
life. It is animal song. Okay, here it is.

650
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,850
Maybe two songs.
My life.

651
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,290
Here's my animal song and you guys
tell me who makes a worst song.

652
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:14,700
Me Or Nick Hawk.

653
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,190
Right. It's pretty good. I
still like it more for sure.

654
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,770
It's better than me.

655
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,033
It

656
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,450
was so hard to get these
seagulls to sing at the same time

657
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,813
or difficult.
Yeah.

658
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:14,610
Take off like a jet.
You watching TV,

659
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:16,500
you don't know who can bet on them again?

660
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,350
This dog shit. Yeah.
So we got a dog. Shit.

661
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,060
We have an email come in about,
you know, God, that's my angers me.

662
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:28,390
I'll fucking give me the
car. Tried to get us,

663
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:32,470
get that taken down for it because
we talked about them in an episode.

664
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,990
Um, but we just played a moment of it,
you know, just to talk about it. Yeah.

665
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,840
He has some comments on his
video. Uh, it says, hey mommy,

666
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,650
just checking in high and tight.
There

667
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,710
a one said low and Louis no common.
These balls. I think we might.

668
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,400
We may finally, no, I
Burke Chrysler. So fad.

669
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,100
It looks like he hasn't found the com
you should stick to fucking old white

670
00:46:57,101 --> 00:47:01,540
women. Your music career was over before
it started. Nick Hock is a calm dog.

671
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:05,860
Question Mark. Um, so we
heard his song. Your Song.

672
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,720
How about my song? Yeah. What's yours?

673
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:13,370
This is the reason it
sounds way better than all

674
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,820
this looks good plot holes.
Pot Holes.

675
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,530
Why did my ice cubes
smell like a butthole?

676
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,960
The smell. The smell. The smell.

677
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,270
Pretty good.

678
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,540
Yeah. It was like still better
than break is really powerful.

679
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,460
Waiver the break.

680
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,540
But hold my first song I ever made

681
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,800
by the time it's something that I actually
kept in the freezer. It's gone bad

682
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,930
but holds kids the original holes,

683
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,090
black holes,

684
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,270
but we don't eat anything
that smells like buttholes.

685
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,930
That's my favorite part. Dad did it.
Yeah. See, between the three of us,

686
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:10,090
that was your original song. Uh,
animal song was my original song.

687
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,160
I made it with nothing but my

688
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,220
pewter. Same with you. Still better
than what Nick hawked it in a studio.

689
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,900
It is. What he did was really bad.
What did he, it was really bad.

690
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,670
And he should I shoot her an apology song.

691
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,450
You should make an album of songs
that apologize for this whole album.

692
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:31,100
It's a good idea. Yeah. I'm
apologizing. Apologizing on the booth.

693
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:33,260
Apologize around for breaking a sweat.

694
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,190
Oh my God. Yeah. That whole
album is really terrible.
Yeah. Let me get the memories.

695
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,430
You got the country song too. Oh
boy. That was the only good ones.

696
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:47,930
These have no views. I mean like
the view counts on them are so,

697
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:50,430
so weird. Tiny. It's really weird. Yeah.

698
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,460
Like a dude farting has more accounts
in these. He has a video here.

699
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:58,010
It's been up for eight months. It's
one of his songs, has 42 views.

700
00:48:58,990 --> 00:48:59,530
How does it,

701
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:03,690
the house, it's almost impossible to
have that little views and eat anything.

702
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:07,780
Oh, he did make the, remember
he was, we watched as official
music video. Yeah, yeah,

703
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:12,250
yeah. That does have some views on it, so.
Okay. Well these people are checking in,

704
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,680
seeing what the Hawk is up to. Um, yeah.
It was really bad, man. You're really bad.

705
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:21,070
At that, but you're not bad
at Hoe and I've seen you Ho

706
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,650
guy works out.

707
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,840
He weren't, he lays. Yeah. You know,

708
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,050

linkedin is helpful then as helpful as I

711
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:45,650

I hear Joey Diaz going Lincoln then,

712
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,820
well no vulgar language or loses a link.
And then

713
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,820
he got so upset about that.
I don't fuck with Lincoln,

714
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,090
Lincoln and Lincoln. Then do I have, um,

715

what's his name stuff here. I used
to have his stuff. Mark in a sweat.

716
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,470
Breaking a sweat linked linkedin

717
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,950
is helpful.
It's not a joke.

718
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,790
I don't give a shit.
Don't say a fucking thing

719
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,900
to get it, asshole. He used to get so mad.

720
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,810
I know. That was the best part. I
know. I think guys such a crazy person.

721
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,000
God don't bring up your mom's house

722
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,813
so crazy.

723
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,180
Um, okay, so this, by the way,

724
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,300
um,
it's something we always,

725
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,080
we always want to pay credit
to the best of the best.

726
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,850
Uh, the people that really
do it right. And, um,

727
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,120
there's not, you know,
there's always an argument for

728
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,640
who is the champion,
who's the,

729
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:10,130
who's the best. Here we
go. No, we've got a 2001.

730
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,910
Yes, yes. Allen's great.
That's, that's so great.

731
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:20,570
Classic. There's so many
great ones. I'm saying

732
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,960
why K W I s

733
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,120
and this is, this is
right. This is it there.

734
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,320
The Diego Sanchez. Yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good.

735
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,750
And the majority of this sport is,

736
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,860
is really just all about the
mental aspect of it, you know? Um,

737
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,490
I believe it eats first and foremost.
It's the training that you put in,

738
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,450
in the gym and you know,
that's what's going to give you that base,

739
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:47,000
a mental strength because you can,
you know,

740
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:50,540
you're going to believe in
yourself because of the hard
work that you put in the

741
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,790
gym and you know, as far as it
goes for me, you know what I mean?

742
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:57,230
At once you stepped in that cage. Of
course, you know, it's, it's all mental,

743
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,260
you know what I mean? You have
to, you have to have 100%.

744
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,940
We have to be 100% at the time when
it's time, you know what I mean?

745
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,000
Not 100%. You know,
right before the fight.

746
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:11,990
It's 100% when it counts,
when it's all on the line.

747
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,850
Well mean. Interesting. First of all, I
think he has a lot of good things to say.

748
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:19,390
Yeah. Yeah. I liked it. He varies
between your nose and he says,

749
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,740
you know what I means? What
kind of, he really articulates
it. Yeah. Sometimes it's,

750
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:27,430
you know what I mean? You know what I
mean? But he goes, you know what I mean?

751
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,410
Right.
It's not that common,

752
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,040
but I agree. I, I do like that it varies.
The, you knows, you know what I mean?

753
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,100
But he's also clear with them.
Right. It's a different kind of,

754
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:38,420
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

755
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:43,000
I also feel bad for that change for you
after the second loss. Um, you know,

756
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,550
they just get their heads beaten
in so much. No, that's true.

757
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,760
Um, you know, you know, it wasn't
really much that changed. You know,

758
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,930
I lost two close decisions,
you know,

759
00:52:55,931 --> 00:53:00,040
that that could have had two more
rounds. You know what I mean by that? Um,

760
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:04,950
as far as that goes, you know, I just, it
was learning lessons for me and I had to,

761
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:09,700
I had to make changes and a was, you
know, those are fights where, um,

762
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,030
the game plan was wrong. You know what
I mean? I came down a game plan it,

763
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,920
I didn't get hurt and you know,

764
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:19,150
I didn't get close to being submitted are
knocked out. I had the wrong game plan.

765
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,730
I had the wrong, you know,
the wrong people behind me,

766
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:25,150
the wrong circle around me and,
and I had the wrong game finance

767
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,530
get under your nose or not. Well,
I like him for the, you know,

768
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:31,770
category that was eight, you
knows. And just that short clip,

769
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,650
let's check out the super cut. Yeah.
See what we got. Good. Okay. Yeah. So,

770
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,103
but what do you do?

771
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,130
You know, you know, you know what I
mean? You know it, you know what I mean?

772
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,660
You know what I mean? You
know, um, you know, you don't,
you know, I, you know that,

773
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:49,500
you know what I mean? You
know, um, you know, you know,

774
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,920
yeah. You know, you know what I
mean? You know what, you know what,

775
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,350
you know what I mean?
And you know, you know,

776
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,453
I dunno.

777
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:02,240
Good world died work Lubin new man.
Oh it was great.

778
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,550
And he's kind of like a mellow,
he's a mellow,

779
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:08,180
but I still think that's playing a
part in how we're receiving these,

780
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:10,120
you know what I mean?
Like you're like, oh,

781
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,440
it's not that much because he's so chill.

782
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:15,140
Cause a lot of times you
know what it means or really
hype, you know what I mean?

783
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:18,320
Yeah, yeah. This guy really is
a kind of a, I'm saying, yeah.

784
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,430
You don't even really hear it sometimes.
Right, right, right. You know, you know,

785
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:23,690
you know,
you know

786
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,270
I gave him the Greece.
Oh yeah.

787
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,800
I tell him it was fine though.

788
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,510
Sticking name is ace and you know what
I'm saying? Kind of like fuck you. Sale.

789
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,100
Yeah, I loosened itself well. Yeah. Okay.

790
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,220
So you know what I'm saying?

791
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,690
That clip has made people angry.

792
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,620
You know food is just prison rape.
Right.

793
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,490
So focus it. So fuck yourself. You know,

794
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,950
tie loosened up a little bit. God does
that. Is there anything worse than that?

795
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,870
I don't know if you have someone say
anything worse to you than that. Yeah,

796
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:13,440
I'd rather just die and it's really,
remember how man,

797
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,520
how well thought out.
That is where they go.

798
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,940
The reason I give that clip
clip clip keeps playing.

799
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:25,390
He tells you so that if he complained
to the guards that he was raped,

800
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,920
they can check that he's got grease
on his fingers. God. So it looks like,

801
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,880
like you know, he figured himself, Oh my
God, it was just like to cover themselves.

802
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:38,840
So evil. Yeah. It's like that's
pretty bad. Crazy. It's pretty bad.

803
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,603
Yeah.

804
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,660
That's my favorite.
Yeah.

805
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,350
I will save all the clips we've ever
played on your mom's house. The Gay,

806
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,400
the gay guy getting fucked by imaginary
gay ghost. Wait, what does that guy,

807
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,480
homeless guy,

808
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:57,510
man ray by home almost being
raped by gay guy and now and yeah,

809
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,190
but I think homeless guy
getting raped by gay goes.

810
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,470
Yeah
man.

811
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,840
Are you watching it? Yeah. Shit

812
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,730
man.
Wonderful.

813
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,640
Yeah.
Wow.

814
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,960
And I always am envious of the person
that recorded it cause there's one point

815
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,650
in the video where he's like shaking
from laughing so hard. I'm like, man,

816
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:16,870
I wish I got to cut the gay guy.
I mean the,

817
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:19,320
the homeless guy getting right
from the get go. So why don't,

818
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,450
why don't I get to see cool stuff?
Oh,

819
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:28,370
that's a good one. That's a classic
one too. Why can't I find the whole,

820
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,500
the whole reason I'm playing these,
cause I still am looking for, uh,

821
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,550
the ultimate, you know what I'm saying?
I can't find it. Is that the sugar night?

822
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,120
Oh, that's my favorite. I don't see it
anymore. I don't know where it went.

823
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,800
It's really, really upsetting to me
because I remember as an early on one,

824
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:49,240
you know, sometimes you, well that
was, yeah, it was one of the first, uh,

825
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,170
Y K W I s is, yeah. God Damn.

826
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,560
Pause and look. Yeah, I do actually.
Yeah. Good girl just tweeted.

827
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,730
Yeah. As I get left with most of my meal
on, my boyfriend goes to take a shit.

828
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,930
Oh yeah. Yeah. And she's got
like a half a cheeseburger.

829
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:12,310
All her fries and then she has a picture
of him walking to the toilet. Oh Man.

830
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:17,200
Girls earlier today. You did. I retweeted
it. I want to retweet that shit too, man.

831
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,920
Yeah. The fight is real. The flight,
the fight is real. The struggle,

832
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,750
the struggle for us women,

833
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,910
they got guys who've got to
shit halfway through the meal.

834
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,200
I should start a group for women who
are just stranded alone in restaurants.

835
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,920
You're not straight husbands and
boyfriends abandoned them to go, Shit.

836
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:37,690
That's the word story is the
story of our life together.

837
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,673
Please.

838
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,723
Yeah.

839
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,710
I tried to say this.
I'm one of those morning new shows

840
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,780
is the average total non sequitur.

841
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,030
Like they asked me like what can people
expect to see at your show? And I was,

842
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:59,140
I never had a job before in my life until
I started working for C in and out of

843
00:58:59,141 --> 00:59:02,800
jail. You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

844
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:09,560
Yes. The best it is the best. That was
the best. You know what I'm saying today?

845
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,010
Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't say shit and
he says, you know what I'm saying?

846
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,830
That's why it's amazing. It's
how you do. Yeah. I'm saying

847
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:22,710
that's the exemplary, you know what
I'm saying? Shit. I have a job there.

848
00:59:22,711 --> 00:59:26,300
My mom was help.

849
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,310
Happy, happy, happy. A master of accents.

850
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,580
What region is that? Oh, that is,

851
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,580
that's probably like Northwestern Uk.
Huh?

852
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:42,420
Northwestern UK. Interesting. Yeah,

853
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,250
he can you pinpoint a region?
Well,

854
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,620
I mean specifically pacifically.
It's,

855
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,170
that's probably six kilometers south.

856
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:58,840
South East of Wales. Oh,
it's Welsh. Yeah. Oh,

857
00:59:58,841 --> 01:00:03,440
I didn't say that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

858
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,430
You're really good. Yep. Anyways, hey,

859
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:11,360
so can we talk about how we got your
parents hooked on the day? They're really,

860
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,100
really hooked now.
First of all,

861
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:16,700
we came back from the baptism and I had
found out the top dog shit on our toilet

862
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,480
while we were away. Not on the in
it. Well, you know what I'm saying?

863
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:23,120
Like he used our toilet.
Yeah. And I didn't know that.

864
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:27,740
So let's back it up while it
happened. Oh, he was just like,

865
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,330
oh my God. Oh Buddy. He goes, it's
real neat. Uh, he goes to water,

866
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,890
just goes right up in the asshole and
he goes, I had to move a little bit.

867
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,640
You know what, to kind of hit it hit the
right spot. But he's like three wipes,

868
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,670
not nearly as bad.
It's real environmental to do that.

869
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,490
And we gave him the super deluxe.
Yeah.

870
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,520
There was a patriotic episode where a lot
of times we opened the Po box gifts on

871
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:53,750
patrion episodes.

872
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:59,170
Somebody sent this high grade
toilet paper from Japan.

873
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,930
Beautiful. Really Nice stuff. I mean, each
role is individually all that and like,

874
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:10,700
uh, Lacey, there's encroach
Whaley. Yeah. And I gave it to him.

875
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:14,990
He was like, all right. Yeah. So
excited. He was more excited than those.

876
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,060
I started to see his grandson.
That's what I'm saying.

877
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,350
I think there was Alice and then there
was toilet paper. I was really excited,

878
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:26,480
but the real kicker was
that Charo was like, oh man.

879
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,650
She goes, we have to get one of
these. That'd be day. Yeah. Yeah.

880
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:34,970
She's hooked actually. It's
called something else. Yeah.
I'm not sure what we have.

881
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,230
Uh, they have a name for it.
It's by toto. Yeah, the pain.

882
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,340
They come in and span, they sing a
song and then they put it in there.

883
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,880
It's called a washlet. Well, Ashland
and your toilet and you turned it.

884
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,950
It's going to take to get away from you.

885
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,660
How's it go?
Um,

886
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,760
there's nothing that a hundred,

887
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,080
I don't remember that being the
thing that they, him at Arbor Day.

888
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,173
So

889
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,980
he got a splash splash away.
The

890
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,360
Do, do, do, do, do, do Bram

891
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,740
due too high to go brown
in the middle of the night.

892
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:28,973
And it was terrible.

893
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,470
But I could of Weipa
where Eh, okay. Believe,

894
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:39,471
believer Brown Frigo is
what it is in Africa.

895
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,010
What about no, I know what it is.
That's another hard hitting brown.

896
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,760
No, it's my shot on the way to Africa.
Oh yeah. Hi Charlotte. And on the

897
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:59,670
plane, that's what it is. Okay.
Nick Hock, are you listening?

898
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:07,180
I think you found your Muse,
man.

899
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,023
You need

900
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,760
to ask him to kick her ass. Kick the
guy's ass. I can't even fucking seat.

901
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:22,200
Take himself that serious, Eh, um, we got,

902
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:24,360
I got to think of the song.
It's a song is going to happen.

903
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:29,010
It's going to have meeting. Do you
want to hear another masterful accent?

904
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,660
I'd love to.
Yeah.

905
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,760
Just tell the one demo again.

She is Shawn. I will write your
job. Awesome. Woobox song. Wow.

907
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:46,550

gun or a machete. Candy's the animal.

908
01:03:46,551 --> 01:03:47,384
Should we say funny

909
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:54,450
bridge the fit where you shit nobody.

910
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,920
I toured the school clubs blind.

911
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,860
I'll go back
in your past.

912
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:12,500
That's like, like the Irish bar
guys to a degree. Like, well,

913
01:04:12,501 --> 01:04:17,240
I can pick up words in there,
but that is really impressive.

914
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,920
That is quite an accent.

915
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:23,270
Quite his abattoir thick.
Very.

916
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:27,400
This is Jeff Jamaican. Yeah, because
my mother would pronounce it,

917
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,500
Hi Micah Jamaican.
She one time I went to Jamaica,

918
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,300
Jamaica like why did he keep saying it
like that? Why did she say it like that?

919
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,360
Jamaica. I don't know. She
pronounced everything wrong. Uh,

920
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:43,880
he's down. I heard him say it down
and then the restaurant, I don't know.

921
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:47,990
I had no go to the Balaclava shop.
There's a balaclava shop down the street.

922
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,330
Balaclava shop.
Nah Man.

923
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:54,500
Balaclava this shit that you put on
your face before you fucking pussy riot

924
01:04:54,501 --> 01:04:59,120

927
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:12,100
customer versus a bridge. We got the
bridge part down the bridge of Goto.

928
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:16,570
I want to take a shit in wine in the wine.

929
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,740
She had blonde

930
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:27,510
hair down.
I just wipe it up father.

931
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:31,900
I know that was crazy.

933
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:42,130
you think you want to be gone so you
don't to your body. Yeah. Right, right.

934
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,020
You got these guys were blown
away because they were bidding.

935
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,370
They're recording it. They're
like, this guy's accent is

936
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,920
take her insane. Yeah. They cannot,
they speak the same dialect.

937
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,510
Wow. That was intense. I'm Michelle.

938
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,930
I'm scared to try to and translate it.

939
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:04,100
I know that really gets code for
like and then Keel Tom Segura,

940
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,390

It's the machete and hand.

941
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,560
The machete hasn't been to me. It's
very common though in some parts of the,

942
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:12,600
of the world because yes.

943
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,380
You're actually using them to walk to
get around that stuff. Yeah, of course.

944
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,710
The jungle. So thick. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

945
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,550
Oh boy.
Um,

947
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,870
I guess the dog. She's another
accident. Yeah. Pretty good.

948
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,580
Oh Man.
Look at this fucking dude.

949
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,390
Holy Shit fucking thing.

that you're pulling in Ga.

951
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:48,220
Come on. That's a flounder.
Let's pull it in. Jay.

952
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:54,240
Come on. No, you know it is.
We are in the fucking news,

953
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:59,100

bill burr. Oh, right, right,

954
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:00,030

955
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,483
Okay.

956
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,260
Will you look at this shit?

957
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:10,740
Oh my God.
Jay Jay,

958
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:15,230
let's get it. Let's get it. I
wouldn't fuck with that thing.

959
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:21,580
Fucking things as a
total flow or something.

960
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,180
It's not a tuner on. How about
you leave it alone? Yeah.

961
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,940
Oh Man. Ga let you told me, didn't you?

962
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,263
What is that?

963
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,820
Oh my God, look at this thing. Oh my God.

964
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:44,050
Look at this fucking thing to
build a new hour. We share this.

965
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,370
It won't be Shit Jane. Oh
my God. It's a bit closer.

966
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:52,140
You can get a little fucking fishing.
What are you shitting me? That's the hook.

967
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,130
You can actually

968
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,980
bill did a video of him saying,

969
01:07:55,981 --> 01:07:59,400
oh my fucking God to fish for an hour
and I bought it. Yeah, I'd be like,

970
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:04,340
it was pretty funny. Of course. Like
there's a fucking size of this thing, Jay.

971
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,760
Pull the fucking thing.
I would definitely watch it.

972
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,680
Um,
man,

973
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,700
this is something we've been wanting to
talk about for a while here at this is

974
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,460
amaze,
amaze,

975
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,950
amaze your browns.
First.

976
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:23,390
I will read you a couple
of emails. Well, here's,

977
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,233
um,

978
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,100
wait, did you get diarrhea and
f an Africa when we were there?

979
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,440
I did from the salads.

980
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:34,820
Not until the very anticipating all
the tomato. Yeah, that's what I was,

981
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,050
I was eating tomato salads at midnight
and I finally got diarrhea and Africa and

982
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:40,550
I was expecting it much sooner.

983
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:46,210
This was on reddit about poop pile. Oh,
please. It says on a backpacking trip,

984
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:48,580
a couple of friends and I
all pooped in the same spot.

985
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:53,560
Then took turns shooting the pile with
a 38. Uh, it's from giant robot queue.

986
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:57,190
Uh, lately I've noticed in my
community could really use a poop pile.

987
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,110
Just hearing the main mom water champion,

988
01:08:59,111 --> 01:09:01,480
speak on how the pile brought people in.

989
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:05,350
His community closer together made me
realize we need to pull our genes up and

990
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:06,490
become a family community.

991
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:10,240
I could really use some tips and advise
them how to get the momentum going on

992
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:12,340
this. I mean, I don't want
to poop just anywhere.

993
01:09:12,341 --> 01:09:14,190
I want to make it somewhat discreet,

994
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,540
but at the same time accessible
to anyone in the neighborhood.

995
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,440
Any advice is appreciated. Thanks
to big bag and zigzags. Hey,

996
01:09:20,441 --> 01:09:24,850
real great question and I'd love to help.
I'll tell you how we did it. Um, well,

997
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:26,710
we were in a timber wood.

998
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:29,560
North Carolina's lies, lies, lies, right.

999
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,060
It was a community, a, an apartment
complex that was surrounded by woods,

1000
01:09:35,061 --> 01:09:36,230
you know, like, like brush.

1001
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:41,000
So it was real easy to
one of the backyards laid,

1002
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,870
basically bright upon where the,
the woods started.

1003
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:50,210
So we just went a few feet back into
there. And then on a tree we just built a,

1004
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,373
um,

1005
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,820
like a seating area and cut a hole in
it so that anybody could go up this kind

1006
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:57,740
of makeshift ladder that was on a tree.

1007
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,890
And then you just start telling
people about it. Word will spread and,

1008
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:05,250
and pretty soon you'll have
mothers and fathers and

1009
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,640
neighbor kids. You said last
week, neighbors, all of that.

1010
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:13,560
What's interesting is that the story has
changed since you first told me about

1011
01:10:13,561 --> 01:10:18,390
how the poop pile was constructed.
No, you didn't mention a tree before.

1012
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:23,610
Of course, it was never, this is the first
time I've heard of the tree and you go,

1013
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:27,290
yeah, we just put, we had a ladder.
I remember the ladder. Right.

1014
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,420
But you told me it was just a ladder
and then you would shit off the ladder.

1015
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,590
And then that's how the poo piles started.
So it's a ladder steps,

1016
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:38,550
but it's on a tree.

1017
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,060
How does that even make sense and how
would you shit off of something like that?

1018
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,470
Will you just sit there off the tree?
You're climbing a tree? Yeah, but,

1019
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,320
and how do you relax enough
to shit off of a tree ladder?

1020
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,400
Most people would go up
when they really had to go.

1021
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,990
So it wasn't like a far as relaxing
to go. You had to shit. I mean,

1022
01:10:55,991 --> 01:10:57,430
a lot of people just sprayed

1023
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:02,730
shit. Okay. Yeah. And,
and your toilet paper,

1024
01:11:02,731 --> 01:11:06,930
how did you carry that while climbing the
ladder while having to share? Go ahead.

1025
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:10,980
You're not climbing on a ladder. Oh,
now you're not climbing a ladder.

1026
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,670
Ladder ladder implies,

1027
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,550
you know, a metal
traditional ladder, right?

1028
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,420
These are stairs that
are nailed to a tree.

1029
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,210
It's different than the first time
I heard about it. Well, I just,

1030
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,470
we called it a ladder. Okay.
It's all lies. No, it's not. It.

1031
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,880
Is there anybody out there in the city
of Los Angeles that is a certified lie

1032
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:35,340
detector person stuck right into the show.

1033
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:39,780
Your mom's podcast@gmail.com and I would
like to set Mr [inaudible] grew up with

1034
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:42,570
a actual, the lie detector
test. I'm like, see it.

1035
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:46,740
This is what people call in the pooped
off of it because you tell your dumb

1036
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:49,800
friends this idiot story cause you've,
you've gotten your friend,

1037
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,360
you've already done
this where you're like,

1038
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:54,930
here are talking to Justin and then
he'll be like, yeah, boot Paul's real.

1039
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:57,320
Cause they didn't talk to Casey. Yeah, we,

1040
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:59,760
well it's because you've prepped
them before. I'm not a moron.

1041
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,470
Just like this Josh Potter. It was a
doc. Sorry. With the the cigarette burns.

1042
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,210
Pat House had house on, on your thumbs
last week. But he, he was there.

1043
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:10,230
He saw it happen.

1044
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,970
The vagrant who put cigarettes out on
your thumbs couldn't jump over that

1045
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:19,620
parking meter. They
burned my thumbs. Yeah,

1046
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:23,910
he was there the next day.
He saw him fresh. Okay. They
look like cigarette burns.

1047
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:27,050
Okay. So are you done bluebell? Sure.

1048
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,160
How dare you try to

1049
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:37,140
support this idiotic story. Got another
email. Cookie thief theory. Hey,

1050
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:41,870
Mommy's, uh, I have a theory in the
cookie. Think I'd like to explore. Yeah.

1051
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,610
We all been racking our brains
over the past several weeks.

1052
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,230
Wondering why Berta so fat.

1053
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:49,410
I'm pretty convinced he has been
breaking into people's homes. Oh,

1054
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:52,840
cramming all those sugary baked goods
down. His giant was filled belly. Yeah.

1055
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,080
Just like a blow to Santa Claus.
Only fatter. Yup, your honor. It,

1056
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:58,230
let's look at the facts.
Yana, Mr. Crusher,

1057
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:01,780
Aka big fat Burke was known
acquaintance of the cookie whole. Yes.

1058
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,520
He had first hand knowledge of the
layout of the home where the cookies were

1059
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:06,420
being held.
Trail.

1060
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:09,330
He's totally Yazzie was sneak in
and gobble down the fucking cookie.

1061
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,520
I submit that we enter the cookie wrapper.

1062
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:14,580
That was cares who left at the
scene for fingerprint analysis.

1063
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:18,480
I'm sure we'd be able to lift the
perfect, uh, print due to the defendant.

1064
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,510
Constantly has greasy fingers were on
the fried chicken and fatty Handley

1065
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:27,210
consumes each day. I feel
this is a calculated crime
perpetrated by a season. Fat,

1066
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:31,920
fat, fat, fat, fat pro. Let's
let the truth be told. Finally,

1067
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:35,460
get some insight as to why Berta. So
fat. Keeping your jeans nice and tight.

1068
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:39,510
Stay hydrated. Jinx chinks. Really
good point. Really great email.

1069
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:44,670
Um, I would have an update by the way on
the battle, but I think I have to, uh,

1070
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,540
at least, uh, regroup with
Bertrand first and, and,

1071
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,950
and kind of share with him what's going
on before we dive into the numbers and

1072
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:56,190
the tallies. Yeah, yeah. We
basically had a tally going,

1073
01:13:56,250 --> 01:14:01,250
a running tally on which team people are
on your either on team birder team Tom.

1074
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,560
And if you're in team Bert,
you're buying a time as fat shirt.

1075
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:09,000
And if you're on a team, Tom,
you're buying a bird is fat
shirt. And uh, it's been,

1076
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,190
it's been an intense week. You,
there's a lot of back and forth.

1077
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:16,420
We played a lot of promos, videos
up. Um, we really, you know,

1078
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,810
he actually,
I was surprised,

1079
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,870
but he actually did get a few
hardcore people on his side.

1080
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:26,430
They really tried to lay me up.
I know, but it was, he's, it's,

1081
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,500
it's pretty still feels pretty one sided
to a large degree because the truth,

1082
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,030
you know,
and I will say this,

1083
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:38,260
his most diehard like is most
devout fans are not funny.

1084
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,420
Right. Like they're,
they're the dumbest and then

1085
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,150
they are so dumb. And I'm like, I
know why you're a bird fan. You know?

1086
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,700
And then like our most devoted,

1087
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:56,050
devoted fans are so fucking funny or
smart and funny. Yeah. They're super,

1088
01:14:56,210 --> 01:15:01,100
they like comedy, right? Yeah.
But his real dot. You know,

1089
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,230
it's funny, I just thought about this as
like, his mouth is always open. It's all,

1090
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:07,060
he's always,
he's always been a mouth breather.

1091
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,600
Just aesthetically that's
not a good intelligent.

1092
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:17,970
You're also going to draw in types that
are like, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.

1093
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:20,970
Yeah. He's, they're very dumb. Um,

1094
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:25,390
why is it so fun to do
stuff to him and why?

1095
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,070
Why I don't, I think because I have
to say this, this needs to be said,

1096
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,150
this needs to be said.

1097
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,840
The reason that this got legs
is misinterpreted as being,

1098
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,310
because of me,

1099
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
where my report to the FBI would be that
the real driving force behind this was

1100
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:53,140
you. Oh, yes. I don't mean it. It's
not something to, to even defend.

1101
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:58,530
It's because it was like week two of
the Burdis fat stuff and I was like,

1102
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,020
eh. It's like, you know like we have
like inside jokes and you're like,

1103
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:02,890
I'm not really going to do it.

1104
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:08,170
And you started to go bird is still
fat and you started to tweak that and

1105
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:12,880
Hashtag it and you started to say it,
man. I'm trying to be the quiet driving

1106
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,890
because you took so much
joy in this. I know. I just,

1107
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,730
I don't think it's something to be ashamed
of. I think you deserve the credit.

1108
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,870
Thank you. I appreciate you giving
me credit. I feel like I did have,

1109
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,310
I feel like you're not given credit
on it and you deserve present on it.

1110
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:30,791
Thank you.

1111
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:35,791
I appreciate you acknowledging me in this
whole debate and I can't wait for Bert

1112
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:36,730
to a really rad.

1113
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:41,730
I want him to fully get at some point
that you're driving and I like to do.

1114
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,720
People don't realize that you're
also 10 you're friends with him,

1115
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,310
you know what I mean? You've known him
a long on their vacations with them.

1116
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,850
We've loved the crisis for many years,
but I like to,

1117
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:58,570
I'm always the kind of shit mixer
that does it from behind the scenes.

1118
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,850
I like to Shit Max behind and
then watch it on fault. Yeah,

1119
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,740
like an evil. But even on those
trips now I'm thinking about it.

1120
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:09,500
Even when we went to Hawaii with
them for that show, that whole trip,

1121
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,610
you and I and his wife were like, Hey
Bert, why don't you close your mouth?

1122
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,440
Yes.

1123
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,300
Yeah. Yeah. Why is it so much
fun to shit on Bert? Ah, Nice.

1124
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,630
Because you know there's something about,
you know,

1125
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:29,920
he can take it and you know he likes
basically any type of attention.

1126
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:34,810
That's true. So that's why it's not
like somebody who can't roll with it.

1127
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,670
Right. If you were really devastated,
we would never do this to him. No. No.

1128
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,430
And he'll be like, this really stinks.

1129
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,280
I like can he goes,

1130
01:17:48,281 --> 01:17:51,820
do you see the videos that a blue
band put together if you guys yeah.

1131
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:55,250
You haven't seen those yet? Oh my God.
It's so funny cause he's like, all right.

1132
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,980
Yeah,
me,

1133
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,910
it's so wordy.
I think maybe that's the joy of it too,

1134
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:12,980
is that he's like, yes. Yeah.

1135
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:14,061
Actually,

1136
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:17,930
cause I saw the video you guys did where
you're both shirtless and talking. Yeah.

1137
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:22,740
And he's holy looks a fat or is he
actually, in all honesty, I don't,

1138
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:27,410
I really wouldn't know outside
of those videos what the actual,

1139
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:30,500
yeah. You know, percentages
would come down to,

1140
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,310
but he looks horrible is
in his fat shaming video.

1141
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,510
He looks like he just got off a
bender and he's like, yeah. He's like,

1142
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:43,710
I'm so fat dude is really great that he
sent those in who's trying to do some

1143
01:18:44,181 --> 01:18:45,860
lighting tricks. Yeah. Yeah.

1144
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,280
Was he trying to like gas some
shadows on his shoulders and stuff?

1145
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:54,260
I picked up ah, to make them appear
thinner or more muscular. Oh,

1146
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:57,890
how funny. It was great. He didn't,
yeah, he was really a great,

1147
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,720
great sport through this whole
thing. Yeah. He's great I think.

1148
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:06,630
But I think the way he's
built, yeah, it, it, it, it,

1149
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:11,320
the fat stays on, we say this
like it sticks to him. Right.

1150
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:14,870
And it's super fat
the way that he's built.

1151
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:18,310
I'm saying it's more apparent if
he has weight gain as well. Yeah.

1152
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:22,460
How he gains weight. I think maybe
he looks, if he gains five pounds,

1153
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:26,120
it looks funky. Put on 20 pounds. Yes.
Because of where it hangs kind of thing.

1154
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,740
You actually is very fortunate though.

1155
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:32,480
He does have that such an animal or
you can just cut out booze for a week.

1156
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,130
He'll be losing 20 pounds.

1157
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,980
That's the whole key to this is
that Burt can stop being fat.

1158
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:40,070
If he stops drinking for a week.
It's, I know. That's all it is.

1159
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:42,210
Will he's going to do it. He got so, uh,

1160
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,300
psychologically damaged by this,
that watch.

1161
01:19:47,301 --> 01:19:49,580
The next time you see him you
were going to be like, oh my God.

1162
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:54,050
Did you lose 30 pounds? You'll be like,
kid, it's been four days. Drink four days.

1163
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:57,500
Right for you now or is it thinned
down? Yeah. You know, it's so funny.

1164
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:02,501
I just remember like Leanne stories
about what an animal live at.

1165
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,400
Like he's such an animal.

1166
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:08,190
Do you know that he works out and
then he just hoses himself off and

1167
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:09,493
back backyard

1168
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:15,190
behind his man cave. He has like an
outdoor, he calls it an outdoor shower,

1169
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:18,620
but I think he just hoses himself
down instead of showering.

1170
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:23,080
Is that really surprise
you? A little. A little.

1171
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:28,600
And then when he,
Leann said when he cuts his nails,

1172
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,620
remember this,

1173
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:34,620
he puts out scotch tape and then he puts
the nail clippings on the scotch tape

1174
01:20:35,171 --> 01:20:38,350
and then tapes it under the table.
He's a real animal.

1175
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,730
I wanted to read you this,
but for so grow how much free time,

1176
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,080
how does he have that much free time?

1177
01:20:44,081 --> 01:20:49,081
He's got two kids who's got that
kind of town was Bertrand or Leanne.

1178
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,680
There are a lot of pronouns
out there like and bird mount.

1179
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:58,740
And we're like, people were like
slowly and slowly adding more.

1180
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,080
So the two most common
ones are she and she,

1181
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,500
he has is traditionally
considered a male pronoun.

1182
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,850
You cannot see another
female. Um, so, um, now,

1183
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:13,020
so then they're also gender neutral
meanings attached to them at all,

1184
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,700
which is super cool. Um, and
there are so many of them.

1185
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,300
The most commonly used is they,
they is traditionally plural.

1186
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:24,450
Commonly used is they,
they answered a plural,

1187
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:27,960
but we already used in the singular
form to like maintain people's anonymity

1188
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:30,450
here. Like if you just don't know what
their gender is, you'll be like, oh,

1189
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:34,950
I was talking to a student and they told
me Blah, blah, blah. Totally normal. Next.

1190
01:21:34,951 --> 01:21:37,590
Most common.
I've seen a Z.

1191
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:40,350
Z can be spelled a bunch of
different ways and it can,

1192
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,790
okay,
you get it right.

1193
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,380
So can I say something before we go
into the c minor you're going to read is

1194
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,210
because, yeah, it is great.
And the thing is, is I,

1195
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,750
I was thinking about this
guy's video all week.

1196
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:54,300
I was thinking about
him and what if I did,

1197
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,350
because I do come across people
whose gender I'm not certain of,

1198
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:02,820
but I think it's more rude to be like, hey
man, what are you, what's your pronoun,

1199
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:04,380
Bro?
Are you a guy or girl?

1200
01:22:04,381 --> 01:22:09,381
Like that seems more insensitive than
just rolling with who the person is and

1201
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:12,180
being like, listen, when you're
ready to tell me, you'll tell me.

1202
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:17,700
I think it should be on the person who is,

1203
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,310
if they have a strong desire to have a
pronoun, a different of whatever. Cause I,

1204
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,890
there are people that I
come in contact with weekly.

1205
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:28,080
I would say the comedy clubs,

1206
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:32,430
I don't know exactly what they are and
I just shut the fuck up about and I'm

1207
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:37,040
nice to them. Of course. I, you know,
look, just be now just fucking, yeah,

1208
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:42,030
be by an email. We got it says Trans
Mommy on gender pronouns. Here we go.

1209
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,100
Okay. Okay, good. Hey, mommy's big fan.

1210
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:49,160
I'm a 27 year old transgender woman who
would like to help weigh in on the whole

1211
01:22:49,741 --> 01:22:53,940
pronoun issue. Thank God no, we've
been wanting to see Emily personally.

1212
01:22:53,941 --> 01:22:58,470
I think going beyond he or she
pronouns is a bit ridiculous. I mean,

1213
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,940
get your life.

1214
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:04,380
It's not hard to tell if someone would
like to be referred to as he or she.

1215
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,250
And it isn't hard to respect that.

1216
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,061
Of course.

1217
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:11,470
I'm a bit offended when I'm mis-gendered
because I'm obviously living life as a

1218
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:14,170
woman. That makes total sense. I mean,

1219
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:19,060
my jeans nowaday are the highest and Titus
probably the best plus for being both

1220
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,310
a trans and a full on mommy.

1221
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,060
So don't feel obligated to call
someone they because I mean, come on,

1222
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:27,280
it's a bit much.
Thank you.

1223
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:31,450
Although I respect it because who am
I to judge anyway? Just my thought.

1224
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,670
Ps, you're both real mommy's tummy.
But Tommy is clearly the water champ.

1225
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,050
Rude Hashtag [inaudible] so fat with
much love. I know what I'm saying,

1226
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,060
Ricky.
Thank you Ricky.

1227
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,080
But it's nice that a trans
person weighed in on gender.

1228
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:54,130
Now of course the, there's somebody who's
going to hear this and be like, yeah,

1229
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:58,170
but what if you're not male or female?

1230
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,190
But you can tell that that's
also part of the thing.

1231
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:05,540
Sometimes you can tell it's somebody
who is a male and he was presenting as a

1232
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:09,040
female. You can tell that sometimes
if they're wearing a dress,

1233
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:13,780
but maybe he looks you now it looks like
a masculine guy and address then you

1234
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:16,660
know, to call that person. Is
she because she was presenting,

1235
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,650
you know, feminine. Yeah. And you know,

1236
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:25,480
a couple of emails here about,
um, about the water battle.

1237
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,370
Um,

1238
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:29,580
I had a chance to see the main mommy and
San Diego Friday night aside from the

1239
01:24:29,581 --> 01:24:33,840
retarded person in the front row and he
killed it about halfway through the show.

1240
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,190
Good. Retarded. It's, I'm telling
you if your act finally doing it,

1241
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,870
I noticed something curious.

1242
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:43,550
So halfway through the show I
notice something, something curious.

1243
01:24:43,551 --> 01:24:48,510
Town's water was completely full. The cap
seal had clearly been broken. Okay. No.

1244
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,070
And um, and I know I saw him bring the
bottle up to his mouth at one point.

1245
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:56,750
Just led me to believe he was taking
a Yorkie sips and I was hurt. However,

1246
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,430
someone in the crowd yelled out, hydrate
and like the champ of drinking water,

1247
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:05,390
he is bullshit.
He managed to take two magnificent gulps,

1248
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,270
nearly emptying the
bottle. Sorry Mommy. Tina,

1249
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,140
you can't win against natural
talent like that. Great Show Tom.

1250
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:13,250
Thank you very much.

1251
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:18,370
And thank you to everybody that came out
to the American comedy company in San

1252
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:23,650
Diego, in the Gaslamp district. I had
a great time in manly. A whole, yeah.

1253
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:24,980
Yes.
Now,

1254
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,450
don't you think a water champ does it
need to be prompted by the audience?

1255
01:25:29,451 --> 01:25:33,390
Someone needed to scream,
hi Tracy.

1256
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:38,710
You know what I did for one show? I
walked out, I dawn Staley, she said,

1257
01:25:38,711 --> 01:25:43,510
I don't want him on my entrance.
Open the bottle and did it and the outlet,

1258
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:47,560
drink, drink, drink, drink and I know
that other people, they were like,

1259
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:52,390
why are they chug and so silly. And then
I threw the bottle and I was like, yeah.

1260
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:53,180
And then I had it

1261
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:57,460
full water belly for a whole show.
That's so gross.

1262
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:01,660
Can I tell you somebody left
a water bottle at our house.

1263
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:05,600
One of our relatives,
unreal and I have been using it all week.

1264
01:26:05,601 --> 01:26:08,930
It's a little car and it is fantastic.
I think it's for bicycling.

1265
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,920
It's like a sports bottle
with a nice nipple.

1266
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:16,670
It doesn't leak when you put the bottle
or two options for that of WHO's who?

1267
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,380
Mario or her husband.
Wow.

1268
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,820
It's my now who else drinks I done
stole your water bottle. I love it.

1269
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,590
I've heard it seen so far. It's
clear to me, Tom is the water champ

1270
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,680
lies.
Propaganda.

1271
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:35,540
Just said there's a clip here and Tina
takes microscopic sips of water. Bullshit.

1272
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:40,430
She doesn't hydrate enough.
She only throws out Yorkie says

1273
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:41,763
mmm.

1274
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:47,340
Is it a clip of just
set up?

1275
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:53,280
It's pretty. And by the way, where'd
you find that? The way you send me.

1276
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:56,500
How'd you get ahold of yet?
Yeah,

1277
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:02,160
there you go. You're coughing water.
Cause I drink so much so fast. No,

1278
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,230
it was a tiny little sip.
A tiny little sip.

1279
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,260
Both of you right now.

1280
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:09,803
Hmm.

1281
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,150
Yeah. Well there's a lot
of, there's a lot more.

1282
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,550
It just basically says
I'm the best or the worst.

1283
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:19,600
You know what I am the new champion of
you and I discussed this a couple of

1284
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,780
weeks back,
is that I am the alone champion.

1285
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:27,370
Meaning I can be alone much
longer and better than you.

1286
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:34,240
No, it's true. I'm really good at
being isolated and I love being alone.

1287
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:38,500
Even more abuse me of
being the lone champion.

1288
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:42,250
You acute, you're like, you can just
be a little, I want your company,

1289
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,610
I want you to be next to me. And
somebody who's lie. That's not true.

1290
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:48,850
Don't we have a joke?
Even when I want to be in a lone dog?

1291
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:53,920
What's our joke when I'm in a lone dog,
what do I do? I go up to the window and I,

1292
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:56,890
Babe,
you're always telling me,

1293
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:01,930
you're telling me that you feel like it
doesn't even matter to me if I'm with

1294
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:06,550
anybody ever and that you
want company antisocial,

1295
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:10,510
you're just anti so I'm just meaning
like your like top dog where it doesn't

1296
01:28:10,511 --> 01:28:12,700
matter if people talk to you
or not because you're just too,

1297
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:16,570
but I'm the lone champion. I'm the alone
champion. You guys know what to do.

1298
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:21,340
I'm way better at solid. I grew
up alone. I'm an only child.

1299
01:28:21,341 --> 01:28:25,180
I hid from my parents my whole life.
I would say it's not even close.

1300
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:26,980
I'm the lone champion.
You're not even in the top 10

1301
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,360
we'll see about that.

1302
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:35,820
Let's go on a meditation retreat and
see who can last longer. 25 years.

1303
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:40,200
You can't even meditate. You don't
meditate. Bullshit. Bullshit.

1304
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:44,280
When's the last time I did the fucking
last week I went to my class with all the

1305
01:28:44,281 --> 01:28:45,114
hippies.

1306
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:46,843
Fucking,

1307
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:54,060
here you are. You're making blue
man. Uncomfortable. What do you mean?

1308
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:57,390
He said he was uncomfortable just now.
Most emotionally uncomfortable.

1309
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,980
I don't know. Where are you? I sense
you were uncomfortable. Oh, okay.

1310
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:02,010
But they are getting of control.

1311
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:08,640
Corrina.
Sierra yells in this ICP clown,

1312
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:09,660
bullshit,
whatever.

1313
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:14,830
That's just like a little
clown gang are so insane.

1314
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,040
Clown posse is our favorite bands.

1315
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,290
All the juggle a family does is
sometimes they care around act.

1316
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:28,650
Y'All understand what they're saying
about murder? I've don't like cops.

1317
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,380
As a police officer get into my face,

1318
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:34,140
it probably be me yelling
right back into his face.

1319
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,390
I can a waiver Ellis never.
This is,

1320
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,690
this is called Bitch posey rules.
No,

1321
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:47,360
this is called shitty parenting. This
is the only way. Yeah. I mean, yeah,

1322
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,840
you left. This should happen.
This should just doesn't happen.

1323
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:53,690
This could have been me. You know what
I'm saying? This was my shitty parents.

1324
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:56,110
You got to fuck a lot.
All kinds of stuff on.

1325
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,600
You got to neglect the shit out of a
case of your kid that you think it's your

1326
01:29:59,601 --> 01:30:00,920
parents that made you go down that path.

1327
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,930
There's no reason the kid turns goth
unless there's a lot of other stuff

1328
01:30:05,931 --> 01:30:08,510
happening. You know what I mean?
You don't get golf in a vacuum.

1329
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,170
You were goth as a, as a means
of acting out, of course,

1330
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,680
because they're ignoring
me and whatever drama,

1331
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:17,540
and then you hang out with the wrong kids,

1332
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:21,770
drift into bad groups whose parents
aren't paying attention to them.

1333
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:25,670
And then next thing you know you're
paying your face and go into fucking dumb

1334
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:27,110
concerts.
I got fat.

1335
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,710
I used to be scared of everything.

1336
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:36,570
I usually chop their heads off.

1337
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:41,300
Wow.
Fucking Ted fundies trials.

1338
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:46,370
That's what snagged it. Same thing. The
college night. I'm look at those eyes.

1339
01:30:46,371 --> 01:30:49,760
You can tell it's always in the eyes.
She's going to have problems.

1340
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:53,810
Call me snake cause I unified
over chop their heads off.

1341
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,420
She's going to be in jail.

1342
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:11,560
I run away,
am disrespectful.

1343
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,340
I do not like being told what to do.

1344
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:19,680
I got into this one really serious by
and grabbed her by the neck and slander

1345
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:22,050
down on the ground. Well,
it felt pretty good.

1346
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:23,860
Yeah. Well, you're angry.

1347
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,760
This is my favorite by the way.
Like in the nineties too,

1348
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:33,761
when kids were bad and on Jerry Springer
and then they try to use tough love

1349
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:38,210
against the kid who's already like fucked
at home. Why are you so bad? It's like,

1350
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,690
well, because your parents suck.
Why do you think they're so bad?

1351
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:46,340
It's not their fault. Unreal.
Yikes. I'm sorry Kiddo.

1352
01:31:46,341 --> 01:31:51,200
I'd adopt you if I could. We've got to go.
Anything else new to throw in there? No,

1353
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:53,120
I love you and I'm the lone champion.

1354
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:56,630
I love you buy jeans.

1355
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:18,320
It's gross. It's gross.
Every time. Dead Body.

1356
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,780
He has the whole server,
a hot pot roast

1357
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:26,920
getting both 22 hospitals,
least both triglycerides,

1358
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:31,430
Lipids and glucose and I put the fork
down please. She took the sword your feet,

1359
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,450
Nicole,
you've over laddie.

1360
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:37,743
It's your life.

1361
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:41,500
It's going down to children's when you
can't even reach to shape those pills.

1362
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:46,501
You Boba Laddie Laddie such it
got four Chan's in big old gut.

1363
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,100
Should take a look at your diploma.
Laddie

1364
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:58,670
firstly is gross.
Gross.
