yeah, the cane, the cane get the
cane shirts is what I'm saying.

83
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,900
Cause it's very popular wearing
my sub came shirt today.

84
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,560
It is definitely too big.
The one that I have,

85
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,570
it's like it's hanging
down past my elbows. Um,

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,430
so you know,
order the right size.

87
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,160
I actually ordered the right size
and they sent me the wrong size.

88
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:35,960
Me The guy that
and um,

89
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,110
yeah,
so I have the wrong sized shirt but um,

90
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,050
and then some people have been
messaging me that the orders are shirt.

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,430
Where is it?
Well if you'll look,

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,820
the sub came shirt is a presale meaning
that it's going to ship later and it

93
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,370
says that on the order page,
but they are going to ship next week.

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,070
So we brought it back because we,

95
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,490
first time we did it we sold
out of everything super fast.

96
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,710
We brought it back and it's on sale
now and they will ship next week. Um,

97
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,390
it's a great Valentine's
gift for Valentine's Day.

98
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,680
That's this weekend.
I mean,

99
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,650
what better way to tell
someone you love them by then?

100
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:16,890
By going like that, you know, I love it.

101
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,790
You did that and it's like payback for
our stupid neighbor who yells, oh my God.

102
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,280
All the time. So loud. She's the
worse I should tell him that.

103
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:26,630
That the cane story is true.
When I see that guy. Yes.

104
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,840
Cause he asked me and I was like, I
was delirious. I'm like, wait, what?

105
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:33,820
Sunset Boulevard at the comedy
store is where it happened to.

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,980
Yeah. And I did limousine
and then he turned away.

107
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,280
Let's amazed. But then you've
also perfected your black yelling.

108
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,780
I'm working on it a lot, but
the very first time we did
it was like near Fairfax,

109
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:52,400
wasn't it? Oh, I did it with you and,
and you're like, what's that mean?

110
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,320
And the guy yelled back. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. That was fucking amazing.

111
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:00,080
I remember I was just the beginning of
all of this. That was the beginning. Yeah.

112
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,620
Like go check this out years ago and
I yelled at the guy and he was like,

113
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,580
y'all back and then you almost had
an aneurysm laughing. So great. Yeah,

114
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,650
we started doing that and that was the
same year we started like when we pull

115
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,080
into a stoplight and there was somebody,

116
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,110
a pedestrian standing there and you fart
in the car member and I was and I would

117
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:22,400
yell at my husband farmed it and then
they'd be like, what? That's a fun game.

118
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,270
One time I was called up to a guy with
you in the car. I pulled up to a couple,

119
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,290
which is kind of scary.

120
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,880
It was at night and I hit the brakes when
they were walking down the street and

121
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:34,910
I go, I farted and then I hit the gas and
they were totally, that was fun to do.

122
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,630
My favorite moment with you ever in my
life and the last 1547 years we've been

123
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:41,654
together.

124
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:47,170
Remember that time we were eating brunch
and you ask the bus boy in Spanish you

125
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,860
go, he just said, I have to shit,
where's the bathroom? Yes. It say it.

126
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,980
Say it in Mexican. I said,
a mic, go look at it.

127
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,580
Can just point it.
He didn't even blink.

128
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,910
Of course not because I was normal to him.
Says I got to shit.

129
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:10,650
Where's the battery? Mikaila.
I didn't even blank dude.

130
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,330
Like that guy was awesome.
I actually,

131
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,920
the time that we first yelled
my black Ya'll on Fairfax,

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
I actually was recording
the guy that responded back.

133
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,260
So I yelled and then he
went, yeah, that's from,

134
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,760
that's from Fairfax. I didn't remember
him. The phrase. Yeah, that was good.

135
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,680
Yeah. That was the funny, yeah, that
was seriously, that was so funny.

136
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,530
We were just in the car, right. And we
were rolling up on it and you're like,

137
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,383
it was,

138
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,493
why is years old

139
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,980
by the way? Um, why are you
wearing my shirt right now? Ah,

140
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,390
what you're wearing my sweatshirt.
I don't know.

141
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,140
It fits me perfectly like a glove. I think
it looks better on me. Let me tell you,

142
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:08,141
I wore that on the flight to Salt Lake
City and the flight back from Salt Lake

143
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,980
City. Let's get a look at what I'm
wearing. It is a real talking point. Um,

144
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,970
so I just want you to see what you
look like when you were that good.

145
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,350
Look at what you've been wearing.

146
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,250
That's why I put it on today so you
can feel the experience that I've been

147
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,990
having.
You know,

148
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:30,740
I just feel there's so many different
things that happened with that sweatshirt

149
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:32,630
on. First of all worse. Uh,

150
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:36,950
so Doug Mellard and I went to Salt
Lake City and he was like, wow.

151
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,970
And then I told him how you said your,
your take was that I looked like a,

152
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,100
the retarded guy that goes to the
library every day and everyone's like,

153
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,660
Hey Kevin, are you teach special ed?

154
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,720
So when I was on the plane, um, first
of all, people would board and I could,

155
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,450
I would see them go like,
yeah, of course. Crazy.

156
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,313
You know,

157
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,080
one of the flight attendants came over
and talked to me like I was super special

158
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,590
and I realized that I almost
sounded special back because
I was actually putting

159
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:18,980
together, I, I've almost confused
why I got it. You know what I mean?

160
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:22,820
So I was trying to tell her, she
goes, uh, she was, she was working,

161
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:27,680
walking through the cart, the aisle
with the cart, and she goes, so, um,

162
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,060
I, those jelly fish on your
sweatshirt. And I go, yeah.

163
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,800
She goes,
I've never seen that before.

164
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,670
Where'd you get that? And I go,
I had it made. And she goes, Oh,

165
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,130
well why'd you do that? Yeah.
And then I was confused.

166
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,310
I didn't realize, I didn't
remember that. It's actually,

167
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,090
it was made first and then I go,
oh, I want to get it in my mind.

168
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,880
I was thinking of like my,

169
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,880
my first special where I have
a joke where I said I can't,

170
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,000
he came through with jellyfish last week.
It was the first 48 bit.

171
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,200
So I didn't want to explain that
I do comedy. So I just said,

172
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,580
I talk about it. So then I
got one and I was like, oh no,

173
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,380
I actually sound retarded
because I'm going,

174
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,120
I talk about it and then I wanted it
and she goes, that's a really nice,

175
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,440
and she talked to me like I was really,
really special. Yeah. And then she goes,

176
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,000
I go, I have another one with a
raven on it. And then I pulled it up.

177
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm like, cause I like my phone was
out and she goes, I'm listening.

178
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,190
She was observing other people drinks
and then I was like paging through my

179
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,690
camera roll.
I was like,

180
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,220
this one is me raven on my sweatshirt.

181
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,000
You show. Did you show
her the other one too? No,

182
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:46,140
I didn't show her the Hannibal
one. Yeah, I showed her the raven.

183
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,800
Can't tell you why I like you wearing the
jellyfish and the rape. Yeah, go ahead.

184
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,760
Because I know you're not cheating on
me cause there's no woman in the world.

185
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:58,660
It's going to lay you wearing the
jellyfish. Why? Why do you say that?

186
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,200
That's so embarrassing.
So you see that you don't see it.

187
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:07,090
You don't have any sexual
feelings when you see negative.
Yeah. So bad. Really bad.

188
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,930
This is craziness. It's not
crazy. It looks really crazy.

189
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,310
Wait, you don't think any woman would
be like, Whoa, what's up with him?

190
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,470
I think a normal woman would be like
retarded stewardess had that reaction.

191
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,370
Here's how she talked to me.
I actually thought this later,

192
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,690
like as the flight was progressing,
it felt like somebody went,

193
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,500
I dare you to ask the guy that
retarded guy about his course.

194
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,850
And then of course,

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,800
and then she won like 20 bucks for
talking to me. She was like, oh my God.

196
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,980
He just said he talks about them.
She felt good about herself that day.

197
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,590
Like you know when like
confident, right. She was like, I,

198
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,220
I did a good deed by talking to that.

199
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:53,660
Real Nice for target boy
that's the economy. Yeah.

200
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,290
See she's like,
I'm a good person.

201
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,240
I talked to Ricardo people
like they're one of us.

202
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,850
It would have been so she was doing,
man,

203
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:04,360
I wish I was in first because then they
would have been like, I just the target.

204
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,850
Wow.
He has make a wish,

205
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,450
but they would have just thought that
you were like an eccentric millionaire.

206
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,330
If you're in first class, now you're just
the eccentric guy with the jellyfish.

207
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:20,080
Somebody posted when I, cause I posted
a picture of me in that sweatshirt.

208
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,310
They said, this is how I
imagine like the, the seat,

209
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,480
the guy that the startup CEO who runs
some tech company dresses like some guy

210
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:32,920
with money. He was like, fuck it. When
a jellyfish, I'm worried. Joy for sure.

211
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:35,920
And I laughed so hard because I could,
I could see that the guy,

212
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,390
the guy who was like, I have $1
billion, I'm going to wear a jellyfish.

213
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,430
They're retarded or fucking money,
right. Of which I'm neither,

214
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm not retarded and I don't have
fuck you and fuck getting pussy.

215
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,710
Yeah. So I'm super stoked
about that. Is this a of yours?

216
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,800
What? Are you worried about that?
No, not really. No, not really. No.

217
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,410
Oh my God. I said, fuck you man. Fuck you.

218
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,060
By the way,

219
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,320
can I just point out that you were hacking
coughing last week and you cough like

220
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:09,040
a old black guy?
No,

221
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,350
I don't use awfully good
old homeless black man.

222
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,600
So gross. Yeah. That's
who you cough. Like,

223
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,070
okay. No, no. You Go, you go, Huh?

224
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,150
What is black about that?
So gross. Nothing is black.
That's all black dudes cough.

225
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,720
And you were going to a
black guy in the bus cough.

226
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,210
Oh Man. So I closed it. And that's a
black guy. Yeah. Well I'm not a man.

227
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:41,570
So my what do it do your
coffee now do it for real.

228
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:45,380
That let the audience hear how
regular I cough. No cough. Like you go

229
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,750
do it now.
That's not how you kept at home.

230
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't know how to mimic how
I caught for real cough. No,

231
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,830
that's not what you were doing.
You're so gross.

232
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,510
Cause you do it in a two step process.

233
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:02,750
Like you bring up the phlegm
and then you work it out. Okay.

234
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:07,040
I don't know how you go and you're right.
You hear that you're like,

235
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,600
oh this black guy right there. Yeah, I'm
living, it's like living with Redd Fox.

236
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,360
We're living in the junk yard and Lamont,

237
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,820
c'mon, c'mon at Margate. Yeah.

238
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,900
There you go. Cough like that. That's
exactly what you sound like when you call.

239
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,610
You're ridiculous. You're
ridiculous. Yeah. Red Fox.

240
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,300
Yeah though is do you like the Ma?
It's sad circumstances,

241
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:35,750
but that,

242
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,460
that 11 year old girl sang country twice
on like the today show or good black

243
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:43,430
America, it's the bad. Then don't
ask her to say what, don't ask,

244
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:46,640
don't ask her to repeat it. I
love the power. She goes, Oh yeah,

245
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,380
we just got to be careful.
It's okay, Sweetie.

246
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,890
Which ones did you say?

247
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,770
Well, it's actually a horrible
story, right? It's about,

248
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,490
obviously it's another funny, funny
premise for a cloud. It's like, thanks.

249
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:58,860
Some bullying went on and
something horrible happened.

250
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:02,910
I don't know if someone kill themselves
or kill somebody else and they're asking

251
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:06,370
her like, what? Well, you know what
she saw? So she started saying, well,

252
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,490
I saw these tech.
Which text messages did you see?

253
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,480
She'll costs Mra best
and she calls him a pipe.

254
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,050
I mean, he calls her client. Okay. Okay.
Careful with our language or above it.

255
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,060
That's all right sweetheart.
Okay,

256
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,250
well that's okay then. Don't ask her
to, I can't say so. I can't say cut.

257
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,510
I was talking to said, oh, I
can't say, can't you dumb bitch.

258
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,080
Uh, um, um, um,

259
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,800
oh God never said that word. Oh
my God. Oh my God. What was it?

260
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,850
Literally like it. Good morning show.
Yeah, it was a morning show. Yeah.

261
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,610
One of them aware. Um, give him morning.

262
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,750
Who can watch those fucking dumb shows
anyways, but what the fuck is watching?

263
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,820
Good morning. Anything. Have you tried
watching those piece of shit morning show.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We do them for a living. Well,
they're just so here's a,

265
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,430
every everyone's emotions are side
phony on it. Yes. The phoniness.

266
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,810
Yeah.
You know that they're this painful.

267
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,420
I show up usually in a bad mood at those
things of course. And when they're like,

268
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,440
I thought went really funny.
It's going to be in town.

269
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,340
The same stupid energy.

270
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,650
Now let's switch gears. A very funny man
is in town is going to be at the mall,

271
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,610
at the club in the mall.
Uh,

272
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,790
it's always a football club that has the
relationship there. And then they go,

273
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,670
Tom, how's it going? And
then they wouldn't get it.

274
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,630
Or you can do your thing when
once we go to, uh, my thing,

275
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,350
what do you think I'm going to do? And
they're like, just turn it on. Yeah.

276
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,950
Watch any morning show
clip I'm on. Hi. Well,

277
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,490
my favorite is they're always
surprised that you're tired.
Yeah. You're like, Whoa,

278
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,340
what's up? Sleepy head. And you're like,
well first of all it's six, seven, eight,

279
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,240
but it's three in the morning, my time.
Right. You asshole. Yeah, you're not.

280
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,280
You're the one that's weird right now.
Why do they do that?

281
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:53,190
Why do they make the
morning shows extra upbeat?

282
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,160
Like don't you prefer to listen to
someone that's at your speed? Like what?

283
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,050
They should have more like us. Like,
hey guys, it's sucks. I'm awake.

284
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,620
Fucking hate it. I bet you hate it.
Being awake right now to uh, anyways,

285
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,600
here's the news like,

286
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,860
yeah, and they should be like, you know
what's better? Uh, today's already. Yes.

287
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,080
Bad Day. Yeah. I'm sure life
sucks. You're watching the show.

288
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:13,980
You're probably depressed.

289
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,290
I just want to tell you is a validating
your depression sucks out there. Exactly.

290
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,410
Let's go to the weather.
Don't bother getting out of bed today.

291
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,880
And then the guys like snowing.
Why this sucks too.

292
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,960
And they cut back what happened in sports.
Our teams loss.

293
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,540
All right.

294
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,640
That's a good morning show.
I could get into,

295
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,050
oh my goodness.
It's crazy.

296
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,350
Um, yesterday was the pooper bowl. Um,

297
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,363
crazy.

298
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,470
I gotta tell you, I know you don't
listen or care about football.

299
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,750
I'll just say this, uh, with
regard to football stuff. Yeah.

300
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,950
Oh, um, yeah. I was surprised
at what happened. Uh,

301
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,840
I tried to pick it just as a,
a fan of the game and uh,

302
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,240
try to be objective. Totally thought
it was going to go the other way.

303
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,570
Um, so I know you don't understand
what I'm saying and I'll,

304
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:18,770
I'll jump out of this,

305
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,350
but I just wanted to say congratulations
to the people of Denver. Um, and uh,

306
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,760
and really what an unbelievable

307
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,950
showing because there was incredible.

308
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,840
I think I just caught the very beginning
of it and I didn't realize that,

309
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,720
um,
it's so patriotic.

310
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:40,370
I had no idea that America goes the fuck
off. They go off. I mean, we had the,

311
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,850
we had lady Gaga singing the anthem.
She was crying, there was a tear going.

312
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:47,000
I swear to God. Really? The camera got
closer. There was a tear down her eyes.

313
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,650
And then the blue angels go
overhead and then they can't,

314
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:55,470
they cut to Afghanistan or there soldiers
standing in Afghanistan and the minute

315
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,710
Afghanistan soldiers are on screen and
everybody's cheer. I missed all that.

316
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,020
I was out.
Did they have the flag on the field?

317
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:06,700
Sometimes the horse a hundred foot flat.
I didn't, I've never watched the opening.

318
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,480
Yeah, it sounds like it's team America.
Oh Wow. Yeah. I was like, is this a joke?

319
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,480
Yeah. Or the puppet's going to come out
from fucking team. Yeah. Really crazy man.

320
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,740
Trey Parker. Gonna and that's done.
It's pretty crazy. It was a law.

321
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,240
I had no clue. America hinged
on the Super Bowl as much. Yeah.

322
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,940
It's our biggest commercial
product I think is wow. Yeah.

323
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,550
Oh Jeez.
Isn't that

324
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,220
John and I were up polo jeans.
Oh,

325
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,060
this time.
Isn't that crazy.

326
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,210
Um,

327
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,070
so we're all following the people that
organize the Superbowl thought what

328
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:52,760
better way to get things
started then bringing in seal.

329
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,150
You want me bringing up seal the other
day you did. It was kind of weird.

330
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,920
It's like he had a premonition. I mean,
we were in the, in the kitchen and I go,

331
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:04,840
yeah, we think seals up to, I know I
just started saying like, do you mean,

332
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,960
can you imagine?
Like I go,

333
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,570
I think you'd probably just still it
still towards Europe and like Eastern

334
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,600
Europe. Let's be clear. Not
Western central. First of all.

335
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:18,530
I mean he had like a few
really huge songs. Well, okay,

336
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:22,170
so he has the crazy song. Yeah.
Well what's his other from a rose.

337
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,320
Alright.
My,

338
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,830
my roses kissing new jeans.

339
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,440
That's the one right there. Kissing
jeans though with the road song. Um,

340
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,090
so it's so weird.

341
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,340
We're sitting and talking about them and
I was remembering that he was married

342
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:39,240
to Heidi Clunes hide the, um, high tech.

343
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,520
What do you think her asshole tastes like?
Oh Man.

344
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:46,240
There's without a doubt you
get in that ass and it's 100%.

345
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,530
It's a German asshole. So, uh,

346
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,020
so we're talking about, and actually
I was telling you that like, you know,

347
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,920
it's one of those things, hey, it's,

348
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,690
this is a tough entertainment
is a tough business, you know,

349
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,880
and the man can fucking sing like those
songs are, or were hits for a reason,

350
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:10,570
right? Like, yeah. So you'll have some,
he can build out some notes. Yeah.

351
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,680
So we were just talking about,
I go, I wonder what, you
know what, even if he does,

352
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,190
he just stole a tour Eastern Europe.
I'm sure actually any,

353
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,610
I'm sure western Europe too, that he,
if he goes, I am coming to Barcelona.

354
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,990
That shit sold out immediately.
Yeah. Barcelona. Yeah, for
sure. Paris. Sure. Yeah.

355
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,490
Rome. Yeah. Yeah. I think
it's still, I think he's still
is a draw. Okay. Okay. Okay.

356
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,300
Okay. So um, Iceland huge, big,

357
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,630
big in Iceland. Right. But anyways,

358
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,210
we're sitting there and then the
pregames on it, you know, you put the,

359
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,110
when it was on CBS, I forget what was done
and you go, I'm just going to, you know,

360
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:50,111
let it run up to the game and I turn
to the TV during the pregame show and

361
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:54,200
there's seal and I'm like,
and then there's the huge
audience outside. I'm like,

362
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,380
what a bizarre, just selection. Yeah.

363
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:00,110
Cause he kind of has it been in the
public at least I haven't heard from him

364
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:04,130
since the crazy song came out. What
was that in 1992? It's been awhile.

365
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,520
It's been a minute. Yeah. Um, and
it's just also weird. I Dunno,

366
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,510
you think of football,
it's such a huge commercial product.

367
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,540
I always think that the more appropriate
acts are basically whatever's the most

368
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:19,790
popular, you know, like
it makes sense and tits.

369
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,160
It makes sense that Beyonce
and her big tits are out. Yeah.

370
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:26,960
It makes sense that lady Gaga, good,
good guy. Is there, um, I don't know.

371
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,790
Whoever is they booked, like Kendrick
Lamar, if they book, you know, they,

372
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:36,430
if they had Drake, anybody who's
like really relevant in them.

373
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,160
Absolutely. In the moment.
Um, I mean even band wise,

374
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:44,000
like they had cold play this year.
It's great because I thought that was odd.

375
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,820
Aren't they like a Downer band like
Radiohead, but more ma, you know,

376
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,340
like they're more mainstream for sure.

377
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,020
So it's like a white bummers they're kind
of wipe bummers but I mean it's still,

378
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:57,830
I guess it makes sense, but I dunno,
it just, it's always interesting,

379
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,690
like you're always like, what, why did
they select these people to do so anyways,

380
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,250
but seal was just more than bizarre,

381
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,280
but was more bizarre than the choice was
the first half of him singing because I

382
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,130
dunno what the fuck was going on. I
don't know if he was just like, oh, what,

383
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:20,270
I'm doing one today? And
they go, no, you're singing
at the super bowl. Yeah. Um,

384
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,840
well, cause we were sitting on the couch
and looking at each other like, wait,

385
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:26,600
is this really fucking happening?
Is He,

386
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,900
does this sound bad to you too?
Yep.

387
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,490
The brothers were like in my
arm for my cause. I Dunno,

388
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:38,060
it's just audio cause this fantastic.
But I think it does in the beginning.

389
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,250
So it was like the first 30
seconds minute, he was just like,

390
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,770
isn't that crazy? And then all of a sudden
I was like, this is really horrific.

391
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,770
And then he decided to sing. It was
like at one moment he goes, all right,

392
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:55,040
I'll sing now. But even the singing
was off. It was a little, it was off,

393
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,290
but the first part.
But see I didn't get it

394
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,580
the very first. Sorry, this
is it. This is all the gowns.

395
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,690
No,

396
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,360
the first part at all. No, but it's
a little bit of it. You can hear it.

397
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,633
Okay.

398
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,280
Exactly. Singing now he's seen. Yeah,

399
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,860
now he's singing. Yeah. Yeah. You don't
get, you didn't get the other thing.

400
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,220
I couldn't find the,
sorry.

401
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,290
Well he was finally warming up.
You ramped up to that

402
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,260
shit. Sorry. Genes positive. We
pause it. Try to find it. Hold on.

403
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,380
All right, well we added,

404
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,590
okay. Um, anyway, I
interviewed him afterwards.

405
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,030
[inaudible]

406
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,280
it's so different to only in as much as
like you have the people that come are

407
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,730
necessarily there to see you. They're
not necessarily your fans, you know,

408
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:10,470
because they had to see a group of
entertain a little steam and CNN.

409
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,630
So, um, yeah, I guess that's
different. But you know, I,

410
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,270
I've always lived by that
philosophy, um, for not always,

411
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:21,270
but at least for the last 20 years
I've lived by the philosophy of like,

412
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,080
there are no bad oars audiences,
only mediocre performances.

413
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,760
Well that was a pretty
mediocre one yesterday, man.

414
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,030
Not true that the audience
was very mediocre for him too.

415
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,700
They pan to the crowd on there.
They were horrible living around,

416
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:37,010
but he was at dog shows.
Terrible. Yeah. For the first,
I wish I had the audio. Yeah.

417
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,760
Basically if you a, if you saw it,
you know, but if you didn't, we'll,

418
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:44,830
we'll try to find that over the next week
maybe. But he basically, for the first,

419
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,020
for the first minute of her son
goes, isn't that crazy? It's crazy.

420
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,890
And then I really felt like somebody goes,
you need to sing. And then he's saying,

421
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,890
yeah, but it was a minute
of, I'm not singing the song.

422
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,090
I feel like they've always said
crazy too much in that song.

423
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,740
But that really bothered me in a world
full of only some know how to fly.

424
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:09,900
Isn't that crazy? It's crazy.
Never going to on this.

425
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,530
We are a little crazy. Like all
right. Pick a different word is yeah,

426
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,670
there's a lot of other words. Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:21,180
There's a lot that's is a lot that,

428
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:25,560
that uh, that song was huge man. I know.

429
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,980
Super annoying after a while.
They do that everywhere. Yeah.

430
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:29,814
That was one of those songs.

431
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,390
That's a song where this guy couldn't
can tour what I'm saying for the rest of

432
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:35,310
his life, you know? Yeah. It's like,

433
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,710
it's never going to give by boy les.

434
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,480
Cause your dad would like the song.
My Dad loves this car.

435
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,890
My Dad was to the dad.
Is this a dad's on total debt?

436
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,220
Why is it a dad that's feel cool for
liking it? Right. Cause it's not a cool,

437
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,890
but it's kind of cool. This
part, this part, yeah. This
is like at Dad. Dj made. Yeah.

438
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,850
Alright. I've got my
white sneakers on. Right.

439
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,740
And uh, feels like approachable. Cool.
Yeah. You know, not, not like so cool.

440
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,460
Yeah. You feel like you could
be like, hey seal. Yeah.

441
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,440
I didn't realize he used to have hair.
He did. Yeah. I didn't know that.

442
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,070
It's a good song. Now. It
doesn't look approachable.
Cool. And this never mind. No,

443
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,170
no, it's way too. But I
mean, he's got like leather,

444
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,550
best time the chain.

445
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,970
Yeah. This is such a dad, you know,

446
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,010
my dad used to do is get songs he

447
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,030
likes like this,
but get the single and let it just play.

448
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:50,350
Repeat in was car man. That's annoying.
Over and over and over and over.

449
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:54,010
And he like, I like it. And then it's
all you would hear in the car with him.

450
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,750
And this is on of his jams. Oh yeah. Yeah.

451
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,560
I wish we can make an album of top dog
jams. Oh, I could, I could cry now.

452
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,350
I'm trying to think right now of the, of
one that I'm thinking of. It's another,

453
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,770
it's a dad song like this that was,
you know,

454
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,920
rhythmic like this.
I can't remember the name of it.

455
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,370
That was in his car for maybe like
a year and a half or two years.

456
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,510
And he had Beyonce as
great as I remember that.

457
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,700
That took me by surprise that he liked
Beyonce that much. I didn't know clue.

458
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,150
Well, the only thing
for the first, you know,

459
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,720
15 years of my life only had mo town.

460
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,410
So that's really good taste.
It's really good taste. Yes.

461
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,420
I think what happened is he tried to,

462
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,540
he tried to find what's modern
Motown and modern Motown is like,

463
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,260
you know, well yeah, it's R and B, you
know, so he just, but he has to find,

464
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,570
he had to find songs that probably
were at kind of simple chorus,

465
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:53,560
simple beats that, you know, like
the melody was catchy to him.

466
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,210
The more complicated songs, I think he
goes like, Oh, dad's don't like that.

467
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,690
You know, my dad got into in
the 90s she was really shocking.

468
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,080
Do you remember the band prodigy?
I'm not Firestar top.

469
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,720
My Dad loved that song and he would just
crank it in the house and my step mom

470
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,330
will be like,
like just hated it.

471
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,350
And he would just get ripped and
jam out to prodigy. He's like,

472
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:23,630
this is a good song. You know this
bum prodigy. Yeah, that's dad.

473
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,360
Everybody knows them. Your Dad jams out
to classic rock to he loves the stones.

474
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,310
The Beatles.
My Dad would not be grilling.

475
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,550
Not even a little bit.

476
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,880
That's like everybody likes to
stone is going to be not top dog.

477
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,330
And I mean not only doesn't like would
be adamant about how much she doesn't

478
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,610
like one of those things regionally.
Fuck what you like. Wow. Yeah.

479
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,880
Well those are counterculture.
And he was,

480
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,400
it was not counterculture and yeah,

481
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,940
he went to Vietnam voluntarily.
Yes.

482
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,890
Get that all the time. No, no.

483
00:31:56,891 --> 00:32:01,830
My Dad hates the Beatles hates
Elvis. That's, that's crazy.

484
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,330
Probably hates every band that
performed at Woodstock. Um,

485
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,420
without places like fun or free love.
No,

486
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,700
it does not do drugs and sex.
Like everybody. Like you like sex.

487
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,090
I think he like sex drugs. No,
no, no, no. The sex and drugs.

488
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:23,940
And rock and roll for top dog. And
I know it's just sex and Mcdonald's.

489
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,570
Yeah, yeah, yes. Sex and
Mcdonald's. Coffee, coffee,
the best coffee in the world.

490
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,870
The best coffee in the world.
Got

491
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Mcdonald's. I'm, I'm, it's,

492
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,360
it's pretty nuts. Never ordered
their coffee meeting once in my life.

493
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,460
Like in an airport.
It's pretty crazy.

494
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,660
So we may just know last week,
you know the movement is

495
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,000
growing and

496
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,900
don't say that phrase like that.
So alarming.

497
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,910
How much does this, this
is like when you know you,

498
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,310
you get what you asked for.
We were just like playing this drop,

499
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:12,910
but then people were like, all right,
we'll send you our thousand emails.

500
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,530
Yeah, I know. And then people
were, oh, this is good.

501
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:21,850
Best I did Conan last week.
We haven't been talking about that.

502
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,410
So

503
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:29,120
the team, Coco Youtube page puts
your appearance. It all says,

504
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:32,720
Hey Hitler. Like a thousand times it says,
Hey Hitler. And then people are going,

505
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,790
why do they reference Hitler with, what
is it about him and Hitler and his jeans?

506
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,860
Like it makes so little sense to
and outside or that they're like,

507
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,710
what's wrong with his jeans
and why is he liking to Hitler?

508
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,190
That's my favorite part of our show
is how exclusionary it is. Oh yeah,

509
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,080
no, it is the best why we're saying, Hey
Hitler or the jeans. Like I love that.

510
00:33:56,081 --> 00:34:00,820
It makes no sense to people outside
of the moms circle, but that's,

511
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:03,700
that's why I shows off. You have
to be, you have to fucking know.

512
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,040
You gotta know man. You got
to know software. Everybody,

513
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,300
I should say this. Um, I want to thank uh,

514
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,320
team Coco.
They were really cool to me.

515
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,190
And also our son was on the
show or was on the show.

516
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:22,440
Our son made his TV debut was seven
weeks old. Isn't that crazy? Um,

517
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,400
so here's what happened.
I,

518

We also have your mom's house has

524
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,570

526
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,860
Can't believe it's finally happening.

527
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,080
I know after how many
years of doing this show.

528
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,670
Well, you know, sometimes it just
takes a while to get things together.

529
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,610
So capsule of your coffee
mommy. Yeah, of course. Um,

I want to do this, your mom's

So we're making video of focus and we're
hoping that you'll enjoy that with your

544
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:07,340
dirty little jeans. Um, so wait,
Conan was a, was a lot of fun.

545
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,180
I was on with Josh
Brolin before I went on.

546
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,190
We were talking and you said
you think you'll talk to him?

547
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,670
I didn't get to talk to him.
We had dressing rooms next to each other,

548
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:21,650
but he had a team with him. He had like,
he had, you know, publicist and, and,

549
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:26,420
you know, assistance. And it was a lot of
people. It was, a lot of people are fancy.

550
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,950
And, um, he also didn't hang out from
my peer. He got up off the couch.

551
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,000
He's like, I got to go. He's like,
who? And then he got above, above.

552
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,880
I follow him on Instagram. I didn't
realize that before you daily hone in.

553
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:42,670
I forget. I, I must've been watching it.
It's normal. He's super normal. Really?

554
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,730
Yeah. It's like, here's me and my
kid. Here's me, Josh Brolin. Wow.

555
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,540
He seems pretty normal, dude. Wow.
I did not. I did not expect that.

556
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,370
You should say to him, Hey
Hitler, let's be friends.

557
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,590
Hey Hitler.
Um,

558
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:57,010
so here's what's something I want
to bring up about the Hay Hitler,

559
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,430
and that is that some people in a FedEx
sort of way are saying that they're

560
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:05,470
hearing something else. They're
like, they're saying, oh,

561
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:09,720
I don't think she's saying, Hey Hitler. I
think she's saying, hey ha hiller or hey,

562
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:14,610
no, and you know, it's
clearly Hitler to me.

563
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,870
Blogging Cure.

564
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,630
What I'm saying is that if that's
what you're hearing there and you're,

565
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:23,530
you're not hearing it. I asked, you
know what? What do you here, here,

566
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:27,160
this is another video of hers that
she put out. What are you here? Here.

567
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,123
Okay.

568
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,973
What?

569
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,740
I don't know. I, I could be
happy birthday to you. Nicholas.

570
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,040
Does it sound like Nicholas
to me? No, I hear Nicholas.

571
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,930
Huh?
Okay.

572
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,090
Nicholas? No, it sounds like
she saying and then lips.

573
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,353
Big words.

574
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,900
Yeah. Nick Nicholas. Nicholas.

575
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,250
Oh, it just sounds, it sounds

576
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,980
egg. A really like a
big word. What is going

577
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,910
on with this girl? A lot. There's
demons. Bells, there's demons.

578
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,720
There's a wizard, dork. Sighted people.

579
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,570
Okay. All right. I'm like,
when people sing like that,

580
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,340
I don't know, man. It sounds very
bizarre. Um, but she has a weird way of,

581
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,990
of communicating. Let's
say that. Let's say that.

582
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,410
Um,
yeah.

583
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:16,770
Why don't you let us know what you
hear because I hear Nicholas. Okay.

584
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,300
Well you hear that. I hear something else.
What do you hear? I hear big words like

585
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,220
lips,
big word.

586
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,580
I hear a big word.

587
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,993
Okay.

588
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,010
When is it big words.
No,

589
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:41,000
I want someone to make a remix of you
saying it now. Songs and the, Oh, really?

590
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,850
It's about, it's your turn. No,

591
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,493
no.

592
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,090
Colin is

593
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,810
Nick Nicholas.
Okay.

594
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,460
Yeah, it's, it's really,

595
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,090
it's really bizarre.
I mean,

596
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,200
so now we have two controversies for
what she was saying because there are

597
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:21,430
people who swear she was saying
Hiller Hillary. It's Hitler.

598
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,290
Yeah. She's, she's talking at all
pillar. She got blesses a Nigga. Casey,

599
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:30,610
this is what I'm talking. Why can't
you finally get some heat on that?

600
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,990
Okay, thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

601
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,680
I think she is, but she is asking
adults, Hitler for help. She is,

602
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,710
that guy in Nathaniel's jerk
helped me. Hitler blessing. Yeah.

603
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,350
God is real and God blesses a Nigga.

604
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,730
That was when you could not believe
what I'm half ounce was saying.

605
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,570
That's his name. It was really dumb. That
is crazy talk. It was crazy Todd. Yeah,

606
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,120
no god.
God is real.

607
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:13,210
God bless him.
God would never call you a nigger.

608
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,950
I'm repeating. It's you like
the news caster. You're like,

609
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:20,180
what did the text message say?

610
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:23,120
I'm telling you what the text
message and then you're like,

611
00:41:23,121 --> 00:41:26,180
don't say God blesses a Nigga.

612
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,920
You asked me what the text
message and I'm sure you are.

613
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,113
No,

614
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,280
that's
wrong with this girl.

615
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,220
That's a really loaded question cause
it would take a long time. The answer.

616
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,190
You know what for once I'm
not interested in the story,

617
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,130
like I don't want to kind of don't want
to know what's up Shane Lee's story.

618
00:42:02,131 --> 00:42:05,490
I feel like that's just let it go.
Her eyes.

619
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,590
There's a lot going on. Is it the 30
yard stare? Is that like, yeah, yeah,

620
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,970
yeah. Something, something's wrong. So

621
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,950
Nick, you're never going
to say it all right. Yeah.

622
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,020
Oh Man.
Christina put genes,

623
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,810
but genes keep a James King,
the Queen,

624
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,660
the queen of all
stupid.

625
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,930
So stupid. Yup. Hey, um, can
we give a jeep key update?

626
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,230
Who's got the keys to the jeep?
Uh,

627
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,490
man, I was, I was actually
in a full panic about this

628
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,630
lease is coming up and I go,
man,

629
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:08,010
we got to turn this key
and I don't want to no man,

630
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:16,320
you go, if you'll have one set of keys
date, they hit you up for like 600 bucks

631
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,870
for a set of keys. They can
hit you over that. Yes, God,

632
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,020
it's not going to cost them that much,
but they're going to hit you up for that.

633
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:27,780
And that was a way to get a little more
out of you. You know what I'm saying?

634
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,580
You know what I'm saying? I don't fucking
want to do that Shit, you know? No.

635
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,010
So I'm really kind of like, I
don't know where else to look.

636
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:41,430
I'm looking in all the pockets
and cause then we decided,

637
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:43,240
because that's where we found
them last time was pockets.

638
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:46,950
So now we are convinced that it's
in the park, be in the pocket shit.

639
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,960
And then I pulled a bunch of clothes,

640
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:53,130
decided to donate and now when I have to
go through the bag of donation pockets,

641
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,600
yeah. Not In there. Oh yeah. And then by
the way, when I dropped off that donation,

642
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,950
I opened the bag, the, and I went
and I had them take out each article,

643
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,850
check all the pockets a second time
like that, that nervous way of doing it,

644
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,400
you know,
and you go,

645
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,620
I look in there again and then couldn't
find them in the way that says,

646
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:15,180
Hey Hitler. Yeah. Then I'm, uh, I dunno,

647
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm looking under the car seat, you know
what I'm saying? I'm looking under a,

648
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,160
you know, a floor mat.
No, what I'm saying, I'm,

649
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,990
I'm looking under the Christmas
where the Christmas tree everywhere.

650
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,210
I can't find it.
So finally I call you.

651
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:35,120
I go, you go, I'm going to find it. I have
the dogs never in this house because I,

652
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,140
I will say one of my great gifts is
my ability to find anything. I agree.

653
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,580
I can sniff it out. Yeah. Um, so,

654
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,610
so you left the house and he
put the heat on me. You're like,

655
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:50,910
you have to find these, you have to find
these. Yeah. So I look, I tore apart.

656
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:54,540
I went through your backpack. You
did. Oh, I want to throw everything.

657
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,330
I went through everything and I
just put my hand in there. Nope.

658
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,800
I put my hand through everything.

659
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:04,070
And then finally I look in the kitchen
by the oven on the floor and it's there

660
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,040
just on the fucking floor.
It's on the floor underneath.

661
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,710
What were the keys usually
hang when we hang them.

662
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:15,830
And we never even looked at it and look
like a couple of fucking rape ties.

663
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,580
He didn't look where the keys actually.
Hey cause we have a little hook.

664
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,670
We're supposed to put them on with a dog
leashes and we, and we didn't even look.

665
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,760
So you know, someone tried to put them
up, they fell down. Probably me. Yeah.

666
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,750
And then I just ignore it like I
always do. Yeah. So there you go.

667
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,650
We got the jeep keys. So the saga
is over guys. We have the keys.

668
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:38,730
Thank the Lord that we have the keys.
I'm really am thankful about that. Um,

669
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,230
I have a dentist appointment next
week. Wow. Wait, no dude, this week,

670
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,180
tomorrow I go to the dentist.
Uh,

671
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,190
do you know what I think what?
I think my mom mouth is beginning and I'm,

672
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:55,520
I'm really nervous about it. I haven't
been brushing or flossing as much.

673
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,750
Yeah,
yeah,

674
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,253
yeah.

675
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,130
So tomorrow I go in for my cleaning.
Hey Hitler and we'll see.

676
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,313
I'm nervous.

677
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,580
I have not been flossing
as much or brushing nearly
as much because of the baby

678
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,900
does change. True. Matt
was right. I know. Fuck.

679
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,540
I know I'm going to, I'm preparing
myself, but I'm going to wear, well,

680
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,590
I'll get you the, it's during the
cleaning. I'm going to listen to podcasts,

681
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,120
do it. It's a definitely a change where
it, you should always do that at uh,

682
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,470
at the dentist's office. Listen to,
uh, you know, today was, it wasn't,

683
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,980
here's an example.
I got up.

684
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,170
You are already in the nursery and I
have morning mouth. I just woke up. Yeah.

685
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,880
And you go, oh, well you hold the baby.
Sure. Because you go to do something.

686
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,200
I hold the baby and I realized
I was sitting there with
morning mouth. Yeah. No,

687
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,560
I ended up afterwards going
to brush my teeth. Right.

688
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,220
But I can see how you know,
you get distracted enough.

689
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,560
Maybe you just send thrown up brushing
or till like the afternoon. Yeah.

690
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,230
You wait awhile. Oh, and that's
how dad mouth and my mouth. Really?

691
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh yeah. Cause hours fly
by with that kid. Yeah.

692
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,250
Just keeping it alive before you know it.
You haven't showered.

693
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,130
You haven't shipped yet. Yeah.
You haven't brushed your teeth.

694
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,770
Uh, we have a dental, dental, a
update from a listener from Joe. Um,

695
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:27,620
he titles is subject line is dental truth.
Hmm.

696
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,980
He says hello mommies.
I normally agree with most of your

697
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,600
opinions on the genes of life,

698
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,950
but I got to say you ain't keeping it
high and tight when it comes to your

699
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:37,990
obsession with dental cleanings,
flossing,

700
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,250
etc. What brushing am
and pm is key of course.

701
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,720
But I fear that my mommy's
had been brainwashed by the
dental industrial complex.

702
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,150
Perhaps I myself have been just been
blessed with extraordinary teeth.

703
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,510
I have not been to the dentist
in 15 years. Oh my God.

704
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:59,020
Am I chompers are doing great white,
straight and no pain.

705
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,070
Waste of money. Ps, Christina,

706
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,160
wipe your filthy ass before getting
in the south and the shower.

707
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,170
What's wrong with you? Now?
I have to agree with his ps,

708
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,010
but disagree with the subject as a whole.
I mean,

709
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,240
you're actually recommending to people
to go a decade or more without visiting a

710
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,460
dentist. He doesn't know. He
hasn't been to the dentist.

711
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,930
He could have all kinds of problems.
Well, he could have, you know,

712
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,430
there's sometimes there's certain things
with people that they're genetically

713
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:31,360
just gifted with, you know? Yeah. I mean
it could have blesses God bless people.

714
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,750
Absolutely. So I blesses a
Nicholas, you never know.

715
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,030
That's true. That's true. And it could
be that. That's his blessing. His,

716
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:42,980
he's got perfect teeth.
Maybe,

717
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,220
but he doesn't know. He
doesn't know how to go, Bro.

718
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,080
There is the anomaly. He's right.
But it's few and far between.

719
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,830
Don't go see your tennis, Bro. C'Mon.
Yeah. I don't think that's good advice

720
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,230
to just go, oh, you never need
to do that. I mean, no, most,

721
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,940
most people's teeth will
disintegrate, fall apart. Things will,

722
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,350
things will stop working the way they
should because you're not entertaining.

723
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,030
Need to get that cleaning.

724
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:13,740
This guy might be one of those
people that just doesn't need it,

725
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,000
but for the most part, I dunno
man. But it gets your life.

726
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,900
Get your entire fucking life,
get your live, get your ticket,

727
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,880
your life.

728
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:30,260
Uh, speaking of pastor meeting, that's
who that is. This is pastor man, right

729
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,070
frying a job.
He said

730
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,410
in church and that was about
people that were going to,

731
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:44,270
they said they were voting for Obama.
He's telling him, Hey John, so weird.

732
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,940
So He's been in the news
lately because the will,

733
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:49,640
the APP,

734
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,640
what does it at church in Harlem
that he is the lead pastor of.

735
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,460
It's um,
it's apparently going to be auctioned off.

736
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,470
Okay. Um, there's something
going on with his,

737
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,580
uh, you know, bills he's not paying up.

738
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:15,410
So here's a little bit of him
discussing this here. Okay,

739
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:17,983
let's see.

740
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:22,220
To our enemies. I'd like
to say enemies that, um,

741
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,080
right now there are several groups,
uh,

742
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,410
and we've got an office at a controversial
church in Harlem may go up for public

743
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:34,430
auction. All right. Uh, the infamous, uh,

744
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,090
the anti gay anti Obama passed the,
uh,

745
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,120
hadn't paid his bills.
Uh, pastor man Niggas, oh,

746
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,870
says his flock is being
fleets where we are. Uh,

747
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,210
all these Audis painting those,

748
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:53,300
I'll beat all these news organizations
are running up and down and talking about

749
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,910
it. They're going to raise money
to purchase our church at auction,

750
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:00,940
and they're just having a field day out
there and all kinds of stuff and being

751
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,890
spread around and they're going to
turn this church into a bath houses.

752
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:08,460
They're going to turn into a, a homeless
building for, uh, before the sodomites.

753
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,900
It's mainly the sodomites. So sober
minded people aren't doing it if they,

754
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,400
so the sodomites are,
the sodomites are out to get him.

755
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,540
Um, you know, they're, they're everywhere.

756
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,250
It's mainly the sodomites, the salt.
More minded people aren't doing anything.

757
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,260
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

758
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,340
The site, the sodomites,
I was sick as hell.

759
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,980
So he's got a little, um,
guest. They, he's got a hype
hype woman next. Right, right.

760
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,460
Uh Huh. So this part
though is, is particularly,

761
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,930
I'm entertaining. I think you really
got to understand what he's saying here.

762
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,240
So if you don't know the
controversy behind this guy,

763
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,880
now this is the guy that said that,
um,

764
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,190
that Starbucks has a semen in it,
right?

765
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,010
Remember that pregnant if you drink
Starbucks lattes, really anti Obama, um,

766
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,230
really anti Starbucks, which really
bothered me because I'm a, you know,

767
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,680
I'm a big Starbucks fan.
I mean I'm,

768
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,670
I'm drinking semen right
now and it's delicious. And
they fooled me. They got me.

769
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:11,740
Um, cause I go and I pay
for it regularly. Uh,

770
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:16,750
he's really anti gay. I mean like to
the, I dunno, whatever degree possible.

771
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,560
Suspicious how anti gay he is.
You know what I mean? A little,

772
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,080
I really hate sucking cock.
Yeah.

773
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,400
And if you're drinking Starbucks,
watch out. If you're a woman,

774
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:32,580
you might just get pregnant by drinking
Starbucks because they've got some

775
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:36,400
pretty potent.
How Sleeman in that drink?

776
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,730
The fuck is he talking about? You can't
get pregnant from drinking seamen.

777
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,033
That's the only,

778
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:47,310
that's the only flaw in your assessment
of Starbucks semen is that it's hard to

779
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:51,120
get pregnant from drinking
it. Right. I had a,

780
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,170
that's not what I heard
you heard differently.

781
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,970
I don't know if the earth is round and
I don't know if that's the truth about

782
00:52:57,971 --> 00:53:01,750
all Starbucks. Well, um,
so obviously, you know,

783
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:07,240
some pretty controversial guy. And so
since the House that the, the church,

784
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:10,990
the building is up for auction, at least
that's what the news is saying. Um,

785
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,400
and he's so anti, you know,
gay. Yeah. Time. Yeah. Uh,

786
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,690
they're saying that some,

787
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:21,810
that maybe some gay organizations are
trying to raise the money to turn it into

788
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,130
either like an l g B t you, uh, center

789
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,230
community, Cerner. Somebody even said
like a bath house. So that would be,

790
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:36,480
yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Um,
but anyways, he, um, you know,

791
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,190
you, he's always good for a sound
byte and this is from his latest, uh,

792
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,680
I guess video posts here.
Um,

793
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,263
let me tell you something

794
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:51,570
before we can ever own the Lord's House.
Cause that's what this is,

795
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:56,340
that this is the Lord's House. This ain't
no damn bath house. They know fag house.

796
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,250
Oh Man,
this is the Lord.

797
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,950
And before you can ever own this property

798
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,180
to own this property,

799
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,340
you will be men who are fags.

800
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,830
Testicles will be carrying babies,
testicles,

801
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,950
and given birth to them.
Throw their anus.

802
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:26,520
That's how impossible it is
for you to get this house.

803
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,380
When you start carrying a baby and
your bags and brought to that baby,

804
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:35,110
throw yo ass.
You can own this out.

805
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:39,290
I see you pull a baby out yo ass.
You ain't gonna pull this church out.

806
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,910
Mother needs to us and boom,
Shaka Laka go right there.

807
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,490
James, David madding,
everybody. He's calm the server.

808
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,320
Okay, there you go. I think
he wants to suck a big one.

809
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,420
Yeah. I think when people hate on a
group, there's something going on.

810
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,520
He's fighting delicious testicles and
succulent penis. You know what I mean?

811
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,740
It's a lot. It's a lot. And his hatred for
the gaze, a little suspect. It's alive.

812
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,970
It's another pastor that a pastor is
when anyone to think I was offending a

813
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:21,804
midget.

814
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,800
Hi Mommy. We've started saying that in
our house now. We have three times now.

815
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,450
Hi Mommy. Mommy. That's really nice.

816
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,210
I wish you hadn't told me
the story behind that clip,

817
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:53,030
but I still like so depressing.
Oh, the homeless thing.

818
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:55,443
Kind of a bummer.

819
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,700
You said you got some emails
people telling you you
were crazy for laughing at.

820
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,730
Some people were such bitches about it.
You know,

821
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,500
there's nothing funny about that.
No, it is funny how he says that.

822
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:12,990
That's how I do like that. It's
funny. Hey, can you play the,

823
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:16,050
I'm the old lady toasting

824
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,950
Jesus. Speaking of, Hey Hitler, now
that we're on the whole theme. I mean,

825
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,990
okay, so good. We want that in our show.
Huh? Here we go. Okay. Do, it's funny. Um,

826
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,190
let's see. Can you find her? Yeah.

827
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,420
Well the problem is, yeah, that every
video we get now starts with, hey,

828
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:39,670
Hillary didn't, sorry. Um,

829
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,520
it's the old lady at, Oh, I mean,

830
00:56:49,521 --> 00:56:53,290
she looks old as feels 110. Yeah,
she was around when Hitler was, yeah,

831
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:57,560
she was his girlfriend and she's
toasting, she's in the Netherlands. No,

832
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:02,540
it sounds German. She's
goes, she goes post. Oh, and
then, and then she says what?

833
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:07,340
She says, oh man. Um, and then she says,

834
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,700
uh, how Hitler and they all laugh,
but then they're all like, um,

835
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:13,850
and it looks like somebody whispers
to were like, don't do that. You know?

836
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:18,770
It's like, I dunno, she's a Hyundai
grandma. Yeah. Grandma stopped doing that.

837
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,990
Uh, but yeah, she does it for real
too. I don't know. Oh, you can see,

838
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,660
but she doesn't, she looks like she's,
she's a little out of it. She's seen.

839
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,320
I'll do it again. All right. Now you
can tell that the way that she looks,

840
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,680
she looks around the room like, what
did I do wrong? What did I do wrong?

841
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:41,520
They don't, she doesn't, she doesn't know
why is there, is there popping? Yeah.

842
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,050
What's going on? What's out? It's good.
No, no, no. This is what's, what's up.

843
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,830
Why it's doing it man. Cause my arm. No,

844
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,050
you no sorry dude.
Come on man.

845
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,600
That's what's doing it.
How's an accident?

846
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,500
No,
ma'am.

847
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,540
No reaction. She's, she doesn't know
what's going on and she's like, what?

848
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:08,050
And they're all like, um, you know,
they know that it's not appropriate.

849
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:12,310
I've known my, no, I don't know what
they're telling her. And then she's,

850
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,910
she said that again. She's, she
raises her drink again. Like, oh,

851
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:16,744
maybe they didn't hear me.

852
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,243
Hi

853
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,910
it again. And this time they're like,
there's less of a laugh. I kind of like,

854
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:27,950
okay.

855
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:31,930
She doesn't know then that looks like
a grand side. Something is next to her.

856
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,460
He's leaning into her ear.
He's telling her you say it again?

857
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,270
Yeah.
You like you're saying it again.

858
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,733
Okay.

859
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,913
Oh my God.

860
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,300
The funny thing is I probably have a
relative just like this. Absolutely.

861
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:57,290
Just out of it. Hi. Lately she was
alive when Hillary was around. Oh,

862
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,940
she might've been 50 when he was around.
Yeah.

863
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,330
She looks literally 150 years old.
He doesn't know what's up.

864
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,980
It's hilarious.
No,

865
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:10,970
we got you saying that you
can't wait for that song.

866
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,030
Don't encourage that.
Uh,

867
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:18,320
give anybody that is your
chances in Hollywood are higher.

868
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:23,450
There you go. There's another, another,

869
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,350
another soundbite from Christine's a,
don't forget she's,

870
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,050
she's solutes her,
her king

871
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,000
shit, not my fear. Um,

872
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:45,500
uh, so this, you really
got a kick out of this.

873
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,810
This is, um, from a talk show. Oh my God,

874
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,470
I love this. Um, this made me laugh.

875
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:59,150
These or this is the, in the
UK, obviously Lancashire,

876
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,830
Johnny Davidson, Johnny Davidson
jeopardize his pubes ginger.

877
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,160
So apparently this is a guy
calls in. Well, I can just play,

878
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:10,400
you look at morning challenge and you're
looking for someone to cheer him up.

879
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:15,370
Yeah.
Rob from South Park didn't get to

880
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,050
terrible boarding shell like we're talking
about. Yeah. He's just like a POW pow.

881
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,250
Pow. Thank you. Do. Oh,

882
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,900
oh well I don't watch because I know that,

883
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,450
I know you're very good with
people who were a bit down.

884
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:36,490
I don't like spend too long on if,
cause I know it goes on.

885
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,210
That's right where people are going. A
bit up though. I'm sure you are. Well,

886
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,270
I'm from south. All nine last
probably was during the depression.

887
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,660
I know. What is the cost of going
on the beach? There's Donnie,

888
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,530
I see.
I'm depressed.

889
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,600
I was going to the beach for
a all the two to quit office.

890
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:03,600
I don't understand the joke,
but

891
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,010
he's saying I go to the beach.

892
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,040
The joke is how expensive
it is to go on the bus.

893
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,690
On the boat to the beach. To the beach
to quit. Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. Okay.

894
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,870
Uh, their English. This is English. Yeah.

895
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:30,990
Yes. But it's like, it's not the
queen. The Queen Talks Lancashire.

896
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,480
Okay, so here we go. So He's, so he
dropped out. He really, he did though.

897
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,290
He might've hung out in comedy clubs
here because he's big on laughing at his

898
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:43,230
own jokes. Certain comics
like really like to do that.

899
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:48,020
Fucking really can't make it.
Oh my God.

900
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,200
Your pet peeve with comics.

901
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:54,150
I think really because they laugh at
their own shit during their set. I mean,

902
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,270
only when it's like repetitive,

903
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:01,320
when it's continuous or
sometimes it happens genuinely.

904
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,630
Oh my God. You're remembering why you
thought it was funny in the first place.

905
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,830
But you mean like the person who
says it in the moment that you go,

906
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:11,180
I said this and then you find what
you said really funny. Yeah, that's,

907
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,960
that happens that happens in real life,

908
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,790
but you're talking
about the dude who like,

909
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:17,130
it's a set up and he does it every
time. It was like, oh my God.

910
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,230
And he does it that way.
Every single or, yeah.

911
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,960
Everything he says makes himself laugh.
Right.

912
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,330
That's really everything that
you say makes you laugh. Yeah.

913
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,390
It's kind of, it's just like
Sinbad, you know, like, like,

914
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:34,770
because he that doesn't he like
I, I, I dunno does he, it's just,

915
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:37,290
I feel like he's one of those,
uh, you know what I'm saying?

916
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:41,220
You got to like that kind of thing.
He got to the gym.

917
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,680
I'm laughing at you right now.

918
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,100
I don't know if we should blame Sinbad,
but I'm definitely last

919
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:55,620
time went to the gym.
I don't know that that happens.

920
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,470
Or is the Steve Harvey laugh at his
own stuff? I don't, I don't know.

921
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:04,740
I'm trying to think of who does it.
The one I'm thinking less famous people.

922
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:06,440
I'm thinking of comics we now,
yeah.

923
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:10,200
And the people that I see just on stage
all the time, I'm saying, you know, like,

924
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,530
you know what I'm saying?
Them onstage,

925
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,560
locally and see them cracking
up so hard at their own thought.

926
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:22,980
I'm like, okay. I mean it just seems,
it just seems it reads false to me.

927
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:26,610
Yeah. We would laugh that hard at
what you're saying all the time. Yeah.

928
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,013
It's a lot.

929
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,130
I thought and I'm depressed.
You say,

930
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:34,400
why is he calls up
bloody prices and large.

931
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,420
Those are the prices at Lord Street,
right?

932
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:43,863
Huh?

933
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,530
I'm depressed.
You say why was

934
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,960
let's say the bloody
one way he says to him,

935
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,973
Huh?

936
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:06,760
Can never get where you're going on the
same side of the road. So I took off.

937
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,870
I had to go to Burp.
Deal to get pot.

938
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,113
Okay.

939
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:22,880
Absolutely fucking with him.
And that guy has no clue. Yeah.

940
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,710
He has no clue.
The guy went from laughing hard to go on

941
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:32,060
at
the other dude's a lame as fuck joke.

942
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,180
How do they go to South Park?
I did the two quid anyway.

943
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:41,160
What are the prices
are longer shot. He, I,

944
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:45,270
you're not a master of accents. No. Cute
bluff. Okay. Playing this. I love this.

945
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,340
Yeah.

946
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,041
They will say,
Hey,

947
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:52,210
I'll are these houses here to quit
and move in another brand you and say,

948
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:54,730
well as view is you'll get round here.
1890.

949
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:02,863
Hello.

950
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,690
The premise is that the guy
called in depressed. Yeah.

951
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:13,230
These jokes are taking him
out of fashion that he can't,

952
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:18,620
he can't laugh any fucking harder
than how bad the areas that he's from.

953
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,643
Yeah.

954
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,210
Oh,
okay.

955
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:23,943
Okay.

956
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:32,370
Says,

Oh, lovely. I'll tell Ya.

958
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,090
Standup comedy. No, one of,
I was asked to sit down.

959
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,410
Yeah.
This little fake lab is my favorite.

960
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:07,540
Oh Man. I wish I could understand
these jokes though. I don't,

961
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:08,780
I don't understand what he's saying.

962
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:14,040
Okay.
It's like

963
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,500
multiple,

964
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,460
It's like top dot. Called it. Yeah. It's a
dad. These are all dad jokes. I could, ah,

965
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,280
I love that. And I'm saying
I'm offering this as a favor.

966
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,490
I wouldn't normally do this to most
people. It's just cause you're my wife.

967
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:34,220
I can break down any of these
jokes for you. Really? Oh yeah.

968
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,670
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tom Segura,

969
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:44,310
master of vaccines.

970
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:51,720
Okay. Uh, what would you like to hear the
joke again? Which region are we in again?

971
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:55,830
Lancaster. Lancaster. Okay. And could
you, I mean, could you explain the jokes?

972
01:06:55,831 --> 01:06:58,170
I just don't,
should I go back to the last joke?

973
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:02,000
I understand the standup comedy one.
Okay. I understand what you said. Yeah.

974
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:05,850
Like it sounds like they're
kind of regional references.
Totally get them. Okay.

975
01:07:05,851 --> 01:07:10,230
So go ahead. Sure. Yeah. Let
me just set it up for you.

976
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:12,410
Yeah.

977
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,470
They will say, Hey, I are these hives.
He's here to quit and move in another,

978
01:07:15,471 --> 01:07:18,780
but on you and say, well, as news,

1004
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,590
I was asked to sit down.

1005
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:11,743

1007
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:36,110
We'll have to throw the McCleary off.

As a master of accidents.
Yeah. Well, I can just, it
doesn't matter what someone's,

1010
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,650

not only can I mimic it, I also,

1011
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:54,370
I never have trouble understanding.
How's it? Amazing. Yeah. It's just,

1012
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:56,500
it's like the guy that
wrote in about his teeth,

1013
01:09:56,501 --> 01:10:00,040
he doesn't go to the dentist for 15
years. Right. His gift is genetically,

1014
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:01,240
he's gifted with his mouth.

1015
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:05,540
Yours is all through the
ear and then over. Yep.

1016
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,640
Right around here and then, yeah, and
then it comes out however I want it too.

1017
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,930
That was really good.

1018
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:18,770
Oh God. I side with that long. Oh,

1019
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,910
that was one frog.
I'm not trying again.

1020
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,070
Well, a cigarette. Oh, there's
one fag on that. Try it again.

1021
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:31,380
He's British right back, right?
He's a cigarette. Oh, right.

1022
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:34,050
Oh yeah. You looked like you
sound like Michael Caine. Yeah.

1023
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,380
I can just dip in and out of a region.
That was really,

1024
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:41,040
can you do Michael Caine for us a
little bit when I love, I like a fag.

1025
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,610
Wow.
Rupert

the movie. Yeah, jury runs.

1027

Jonah was root root Brecht rubric rubric.

1028
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,110

1029
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:58,190
Excuse me.
She put her out

1030
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:01,340
this a

1031
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,060
bit.
Are they doing a bit now?

1032
01:11:03,061 --> 01:11:07,070
I think what it is is this guy's just a
shitty hacky morning guy. Is he aware?

1033
01:11:07,071 --> 01:11:11,790
Is that his bit? He's, does he know
what he's doing now? It's like,

1034
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,970
okay. Yeah, it's so good. I'm saying is
he playing a part of a shitty radio? Oh,

1035
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,370
I see what you're saying too. Perfect.
I don't know. I think he doesn't know.

1036
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:24,150
I think this guy really thinks he's Rad
and funny and then the collar being a

1037
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:29,040
shit. Yeah. It's really, really
fun. It's really good. Good Lord.

1038
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,770
Yeah. Oh man, that's so funny.

1039
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:37,740
I wish that people would do
that to American radio people.

1040
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,700
I think he might be trolling.
I think it might be a troll.

1041
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,860
Both of them.
You mean the guy?

1042
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:48,240
Because the guy has posted the guy that
who's name is in the video. I mean,

1043
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:49,380
unless you didn't put this up,

1044
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,370
he keeps saying he's a worldclass
broadcasts or communicator. Um,

1045
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,450
you know what I mean? So it's almost like
he's, he's selling, he's in. How good.

1046
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:00,330
He is so hard that I
believe that he might be

1047
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,080
out over us.

1100
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:24,780
he put a
cue.

1101
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:29,450
He's been suspended my account,

1102
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,370
the time overlay jail

1103

weekly,
and

1104
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,200
then he doesn't know if any,

1105
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,753
could you

1106
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,260
harassing me?

1107
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,513
Oh,

1108
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,310
I finally get it. What's brilliant
about this? Is it what she's asking?

1109
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:17,420
She's asking it live for a health and
then he's going to get a response that's

1110
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:18,440
really fucking

1111
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:27,410

really dark, very dark, and
he made a dance our way out.

1113
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,590
Pretty soon people were like, Hey,

We're not doing
