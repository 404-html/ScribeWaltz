Okay.

100
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,120
Watching an 80 year old,
I hear Linkedin is helpful.

101
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,370

102
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,370

106
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,690
I told me everyday I'm gonna tell you who
harasses me that I could press charges.

107
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:10,940
No Lincoln Lincoln then
harasses me every fucking day.

108
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,380
The social network,

109
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,750
it's a bunch of bums and I'm working
so stop hitting me up on linkedin.

110
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm not even opening up that account.
I don't fuck with Lincoln

111
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,590
professionals. You're a fucking moron.
You ain't no fucking professional.

112
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,653
Don't bring it

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,280

114
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,683

14

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,080

funny. Linkedin is helpful.

117
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,850
Lincoln Lincoln, Lincoln

118
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,380

Joey and I overlap. We don't
like text messages either.

119
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,110
Oh my God. Set. Right.
He told me one time,

120
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm going to break your fingers
if you send me another text.

121
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
Dunkin is,

122
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,910
link.
Get in like then that and didn't,

123
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,180
didn't he say he couldn't say Kainoa quit.

124
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,060
He said to me on a flight,
we got like first class bullshit meal.

125
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,590
Give you fucking quit now.

126
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,340
Now Joey came on our show
back when your mom's house.

127
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:21,560
We were filming in our house in
Silver Lake, all old schools.

128
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,950
Before I really knew him.
I just,

129
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,010
I just met the guy and he was telling the
story about taking a shit on a tree in

130
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:29,410
his backyard. Do you remember that?
Oh my God. His own house. He said,

131
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,020
think things on that episode.
We can make songs.

132
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,610
I told me every day

133
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,960
I could press charges. Lincoln, Lincoln,

134
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,040
harasses me every fuck Lincoln.
Did

135
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,700
you press charges against
the social network?

136
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:58,600
It's a bunch of bums, so stop hitting
me up on linkedin. I'm not even opening

137
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,570
professionals.
You're a fucking moron.

138
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,850
Bunch of bumps as the best man.
Uncle Joey.

139
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,340
That is just too much.
I laugh.

140
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,000
I was had a fucking aneurism when I
saw that the other day. I love that.

141
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,820
None of them correct them either.
No, you don't crack Joey Diaz.

142
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,410
I'm the best part is a joy. He asked me
to do his podcast when I was pregnant.

143
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,840
Yeah.
And I was like,

144
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,470
I don't want to inhale all that
second hand weed smoke. You know,

145
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,420
I had to be, I couldn't tell
him why, but I was like,

146
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,020
I don't think I should do your show. Oh
really? Oh, I want a contact high. Right,

147
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,160
right, right. And I was pregnant.

148

156
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,640
And Gray whisker. I'm so, I know I
got so many grand whiskers. Yeah.

157
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,970
And in your hair to this morning,

158
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,460
I noticed you got a lot more a fashion
combing my hair. Salt and common Mary.

159
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,920
Yeah. A lot of combing your
hair. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Hey.

160
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:27,220
So do you like my jacket? I
do. Like you're dragging today.

161
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,850
It's funny cause when I bought
this jacket, yeah, you were like,

162
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,900
you look like macgyver.
It's, it's, you know,

163
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,300
it's interesting is
that now that I go back,

164
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,880
does this is the third jacket
that you've mocked me for? Well,

165
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,730
no one jacket you put on. I
go, I hate that. Hate it. Yeah,

166
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,560
I remember that jacket. Right. I hated
that track. Yeah, I know. Thank you.

167
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,200
I and I threw it away promptly cause I
don't want you to have to hate what I'm

168
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,930
wearing. Right. But I also use,

169
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,830
you told me that you really appreciated
me saying how I felt about it.

170
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,250
Right. Because you said that I always am
like, hey, cool. Here's the thing though.

171
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:06,550
This macgyver jacket. Yeah. Actually
I think looks really good on,

172
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,130
I really think is cool on
the video. Yeah. I like,

173
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:12,280
it covers up my fatness and
everything and it's a nice color.

174
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,080
What do I liked the jacket.
Okay,

175
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,370
well you didn't before you told me
never to wear this. You're like stupid.

176
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,860
Are May. You did. You're so fucking
crazy. What are you talking?

177
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:27,050
I didn't say don't wear that.
You look stupid like that,

178
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,070
but you were like at the a, you were
like, you just want, you went plan. Uh,

179
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,090
it looks like macgyver and then I just
stopped wearing it for like a year.

180
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:38,350
I don't remember that at all. I don't
remember that at all. What happened? Okay.

181
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,500
I mean your version of Shit. I think
it happens in your head and you see it.

182
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,850
You and what are you talking about?

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,200
You talked to it just because you
don't remember it. I'm crazy. Well,

184
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,210
I remember fighting conversation we had
the other day that you just completely

185
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,420
spun around which conversation.
Yeah. Okay. Which conversation?

186
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:56,050
I'll tell you what's conversation.
This fucking conversation right here.

187
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,850
Yes sir.
I'm going to start this shit off.

188
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,990
Straight telling all this land
with my name is going on there.

189
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:06,500
Let's go stop playing with my fucking
name. That's good. We'll do it on camera.

190
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,170
That plan with my name and I go right.

191
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,720
Let me go with my name. Come up respected.
Go not playing with my fucking name. Oh,

192
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,280
drill. Y'All stop playing
with my name. Angle said no.

193
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,813
So

194
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,250
that was intense. And when I
told you about that, right?

195
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,640
Yes sir. I'm going to start this shit. I'm
here. What's happening? I'm all good, but

196
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,440
I want to see,

197
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,820
so this is a,
for people listening,

198
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:45,150
obviously we haven't done a good job
of introducing what they're listening.

199
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,460
By the way,
if you're just listening to the show,

200
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:52,070
you're really missing out because we're
on youtube now, full episodes and you can

201
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,870
see the clips that you're hearing. Talk
about a huge improvement in your life.

202
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,230
So subscribe to us on Youtube.
Okay.

203
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,770
Slash your mom's house podcast,
right?

204
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:08,771
youtube.com/podcast subscribe because
all we also have behind the scenes.

205
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,610
Yeah,
no that was it.

206
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,170
I got a good idea. So tell, tell
everybody what they're listening to.

207
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,830
So this is the bird man.
No,

208
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:38,060
I saw this on Instagram cause I think
Merlin Wayne's had posted it and I just

209
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:42,200
saw some guy getting all pissed and
I saw it and I like filed it away.

210
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,300
And then you brought it up and I was like,
who?

211
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,760
Because I didn't know that guy's name was
bird man. And then you're like Birdman.

212
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:49,400
And I'm like,
oh I don't know who that is.

213
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,410
And then I later her put the
two things together in my head.

214
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,250
But you're accusing me of lying and
you're calling me crazy. Cause I,

215
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,740
we had a phone call over the weekend,

216
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,640
I was in sperm can and I'm
talking to you and I explained,

217
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,190
explained to you in detail about this.

218
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,260
And then when we sat down here and you go,
do you have the Birdman clip? And I go,

219
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:13,550
yeah, of course. And you go, oh yeah, like
I told you about that. And I was like,

220
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,140
what are you talking
about? He goes, I told you.

221
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:21,580
They say I told you about that. I
did. Oh, I was joking. I know, I know.

222
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,910
I knew I didn't break the news to you.
I just had seen it as what I said.

223
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,260
That's what I meant. Rather, I was
familiar with the bird man's work. Okay.

224
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,850
Pick on my name. But
he's, he's crazy, ugly cry

225
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,370
dude. He's so mad at them. So
let's go over for what's going on.

226
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,980
So Birdman,
for those of you that don't know,

227
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,070
he is a hip hop mogul.

228
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Like one of the ogs from the 90s
he started cash money records.

229
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,050
He had that,
you know,

230
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,350
that whole wave of guys
Mannie fresh was as producer,

231
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,130
juvenile, little wheezy,
Lil Wayne, that whole crew,

232
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,620
they sold millions and
millions of records.

233
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,630
He has a net worth well over a hundred
million dollars cheaper. And you know,

234
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:10,870
he's just like the rest of the moguls
and hip hop. He has a fashion line,

235
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,870
he has liquor line,
he's very savvy,

236
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,050
very savvy business guy.

237
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,350
But in recent years he's gotten a lot of
flack for some of his record contracts.

238
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:26,890
The fact that he has little Wayne tied
up and won't let them out of a deal.

239
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:31,480
And so people have kind of
really shit on him for that,

240
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,800
especially within hip hop.

241
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,150
And so what's happening is
that this guy right here,

242
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,880
Charlemagne the God,

243
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,910
he had talked about bird man's business
practices with a couple other guests who

244
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,740
were hip hop artists,
trick daddy

245
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,490
and Rick Ross. I like Rick Ross
the boss. That's right. Chelsea.

246
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,850
Lately when I was there you and
you stole his hassle of that. Um,

247
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,150
well birdman comes in and
he has all this in his head.

248
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,610
Like you guys have been talking
shit. You will, you had Rick Ross,

249
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:03,450
me a trick daddy.

250
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,010
So he comes in right away and is like you
to put some fucking respect on my name.

251
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,690
I saw that. Yeah. Um, and then this
whole thing, this was supposed to be a,

252
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,990
an interview obviously last,
you know,

253
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,380
like less than two minutes. Oh, so he
didn't stick around and they didn't,

254
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,160
this is the whole thing. Now I already
got gave you a little bit of it.

255
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,600
So here's how it starts.

256
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,290
He said that before they were rolling and
then this guy is like, well let's roll.

257
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,250
Let's go, let's go. You know,

258
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,030
especially guests in the building.
You don't cross those out.

259
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,410
Tell them don't get it off your chest.

260
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,690
And I thought you were joking because
I don't want to stay in the angle.

261
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,490
Like what? So I come in, I did it
already. I'm hill. So was that,

262
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,730
I'm in, it's all good. But I'm saying why,
why, why and I'm here. What's happening?

263
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,130
I'm all good, but I'm saying,
yeah man, man, I want to see you.

264
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,550
I want to just talk to you. And
your man and your faith. Absolutely.

265
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,570
You understand me? I knew a few places
you wish that I could've pulled up,

266
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,890
but I don't think that was gangster.

267
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,100
I wanted to come look in your face like a
man and tell you how I feel. Okay? Yeah,

268
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,441

287
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,410
You ready or you want to go, hey,
he's got a lot of tests. Yeah.

288
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,710
What'd you piss that guy off?
Teardrop stars.

289
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,400
He's got a fucking oil field tattooed
on the other side of his head. Really?

290
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,200
Oil coming out of, yeah. Boy.
Yeah. No. My question is though,

291
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:37,890
if you're just going to come in and
be angry, why go? Why go in at all?

292
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,580
I think for him that was him
making his point. His point was,

293
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,940
I am going to show up. Like he
misled them and said, ah, yeah,

294
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,050
I want to do an interview and talk,

295
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,900
but he really wanted to do was show
up and go put some respect on my name,

296
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,650
put some respect, don't talk
shit about me, you know? Wow,

297
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,480
that's a crazy move dude. Or You could
just say, I don't want to do your show,

298
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,220
but that's not, I mean then they don't
really understand how serious you are.

299
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,210
Yeah, I think on some level a lot of
people made a lot of jokes about this.

300
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,670
Like we've been making jokes about it too,

301
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,920
but on some level those guys in
that studio feel how serious he is.

302
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,050
I felt it. I got scared for a minute
there. I was like, Oh shit. Sure.

303
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,420
They're much more scared in the actual,

304
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:26,730
I don't know if it's in this
pre roll before they, um,

305
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,840
but when he comes in here and he's
like stop fucking doing this shit.

306
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:35,620
You can see the girl who's
part of the show and she,

307
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,700
her eyes darted around like was yeah,

308
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,440
cause he's bringing in all those dudes
like you don't know what's it going to

309
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,080
happen.
She knows that this is,

310
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,490
you can tell look like fights. She's, yes,

311
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:52,300
she's around some shit.
She's working the station long enough.

312
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,810
She's seen some fights.
Where the fuck is that?

313
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,910
God Damn it fucking sucks.

314
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,990
Pass Pi's mommy. No, I'll read user.

315
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,820
I want to start this shit
off straight telling Obria

316
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,820
so late in the day where they're all like,

317
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,090
Nah,
grand opening.

318
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,520
All right, well there
you have it. Are we good?

319
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:34,250
We good.
Let me go.

320
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,190
You know it's funny though as like all
the black people I follow on Instagram,

321
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,500
they're all lining up
this guy. Yeah, of course.

322
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,960
Posted some funny shit like some
remain buddy did clowning on it.

323
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,240
I mean I guess he's just had
he had his feelings hurt. Huh?

324
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,170
But he can't go in there and be
like, guys, my feelings are hurt. No,

325
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,930
no you can't.
Well he kind of said that.

326
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,350
I'm telling you how I'm feeling right now.
You know, just the respect on my name.

327
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,730
He said, he's telling me he's going to
pick on my name is Wes clever. My night.

328
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,830
He also took off and then put back
on his sunglasses like four times.

329
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,820
He's really upset.

330
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,550
Reminds me of PLP all day. All
right. We can hear her voice.

331
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:20,590
She's about to cry. He's been
inscribed. Yeah, put some
respect on my name. You can.

332
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,030
You can hear the quiver in the area or
a guy. Why he really got fired up? Huh?

333
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,290
He really did, man. Damn.

334
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,430
Poor guy. Poor Birdman.
Yeah. And then I like tennis.

335
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,840
I like to know his feelings or her like
that and I want to give him a hug. I bet.

336
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,380
I bet little Wayne had a
good laugh about that. Oh,

337
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:45,380
as Lil Wayne on his label or whatever.
I remember I just told you all about that.

338
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,423
Hmm.

339
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,570
I forget all the names you rattled off.
I mean, I heard finished. Are Y'all done?

340
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,440
Y'All finished? Is it, are you
shirts or all you all done?
Yeah. Yeah. Y'all finish.

341
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:03,370
Or is it often, is y'all done
finished? Are Y'all done?

342
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,190
He says or respect on my name.
SPEC on my name.

343
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,590
All of the day.
Respect their SPEC.

344
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,200
That's awesome. That is a good one. So
glad I brought that to your attention.

345
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,870
Go ahead. I missed you. You weren't
sperm can or how was it? Good.

346
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,500
It was really great. I had,
um, thankfully my buddy, uh,

347
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,610
the full charge of me and we had
really fun shows. The crowds were,

348
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:35,340
were excellent. It's a brand new club,
you know, it's only been open six weeks.

349
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,600
No Shit.
Yeah,

350
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,040
it's the same family that owns the Tacoma
Comedy Club to come on Ya to come on.

351
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:44,430
You also own sperm can cause they have
like the whole come locked down there

352
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,250
in Washington, but they
killed, they killed it.

353
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:54,390
They did a great job with the [inaudible].
Did you eat anything good? Yeah,

354
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,190
I went to uh, uh, Churchill's first night.
What's that chicken? It's a steak house.

355
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,730
Oh, Winston Churchill. Yeah, I've heard
of that guy. Not Churches. Chicken.

356
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,660
That's what I got churches,
Dude.

357
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,100
It's all show some respect on my name.
Churchill's um,

358
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,900
so yeah, I went there and then, yeah,
we had a couple of other, you know,

359
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,170
I DJ a little bit. I don't know if you
saw my Instagram, but a I hit up, uh,

360
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,760
I hit up a club and you know what I'm
saying? They was shut down already,

361
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:33,300
but they're like, we heard about your dad
mouth if you want to spend. I was like,

362
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,110
yeah,
I'll give you a little flare.

363
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,230
And then what you told me about
this and then you were like,

364
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,680
but what happened with it? What
do you mean? He like I showed up.

365
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:44,730
At what time did you start deejaying? It
was after they closed. So like two. Yeah.

366
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,220
And then you were like,
how many songs did you

367
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,210
not that many because I hit the weed.
Hmm.

368
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,950
Cause you're like, ah, I'm tired. But
that's because I hit the weed though.

369
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,570
And then Dj Dan mouth had to go.

370
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,430
So I had already had a drink or two
and then somebody was like, hey,

371
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,260
it's Washington smoke this. And it was
literally, I was with Matt and I go, Dude.

372
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,850
And then he does. And then I was like,
Ooh, I got to go back. And he's like,

373
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:12,684
I'm with you.

374
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,510
Whoo. Whoo. Whoo. Yeah, it was,

375
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,390
it was pretty quick.
Once you have the drinks in you.

376
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,030
Nah Man, that we both were
like, it's time to go.

377
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,270
I don't even think we said
bye to the people that brought
us there. We were like,

378
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,110
we're out. And we just kind of, I can't
even be high in public for that reason.

379
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:35,870
I can't talk to people when I'm
gone. You know, it's so funny.

380
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:38,150
I did a Jay Hawks podcast,
a football player,

381
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,950
and he was talking about how some wives
get resentful when their husbands are on

382
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:48,720
the road having fun. And I
was like, Oh yeah, I hate his
guts. Oh, you, you're the,

383
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,790
you're the like the wrote
the book on this. Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,610
I'm glad he didn't tell me you
were getting high and drinking.

385
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,000
It's not that I'd really hate your guts
a lot more. Saved it. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

386
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,690
Yeah. Now I hate you right when I'm
home with the kids trying to sleep,

387
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:04,680
train the babies, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's cool.

388
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,890
But I don't tell you that while it's
going on. So you don't want yes. Smart.

389
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,510
That's a smart move on your
part. Yeah, definitely. Sorry,
I'll get you back later.

390
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,920
Okay. What does this, does Luke
Wilson teach tennis? I like to learn,

391
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:24,900
but you keep mentioning Luke
Wilson. Oh yeah. I just like him.

392
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,110
Hey. Um, do you want to
tell them what happened? I,

393
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,420
before I left last week when we took
that a romantic dinner together.

394
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,310
So Tommy and I,

395
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,200
we've been together a million years
and there was one house I lived in.

396
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,040
My first shower was great. It was
like a fire, a fire hose dumping.

397
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,670
And it was a big shower. And you and I
used to shower together in the mornings.

398
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:51,030
Very romantic. It's going to be our work.
We had day jobs and we'd get up. Sure.

399
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:55,950
Yeah. 2005 genes and genes
showering together every
morning. It was really sweet.

400
00:27:55,951 --> 00:28:00,750
I would put a shampoo on your head and
you had suds my bag and we make kissy

401
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,900
faces and then go to work.
Yeah. Now this next two houses,

402
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:08,370
we always had small shower so he
showers were out. Yup. Until now.

403
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,061
Yeah.

404
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:14,061
And we've got this wonderful shower
and a with two heads on it or whatever.

405
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,650
And it's really, it's a miracle. It's a
miracle. And so we know, we get the like,

406
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:20,940
hey,
let's go take a shower together.

407
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:25,500
It's been a good few years since we've
done that and it starts off okay.

408
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,490
And then all of a sudden,
um,

409
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:33,060
little things like you're
lathering your head but extra hard.

410
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,510
And then now the suds are
like hitting my eyes. You,

411
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,020
you like it freezing cold.
I like it warm like a person,

412
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:44,070
but you know like it warm.
You like burn third degree burns hot.

413
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,040
It's so hot. Yeah, that's a shower.
It's killing the bacteria. It's done.

414
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,730
And then my after,
so I'm like okay,

415
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,500
but I'll let that slide
don't say anything to you.

416
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,530
And then you spread your ass cheeks,

417
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,650
you spread them and you're not doing this
as a Joe spreading your ass hole open

418
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,630
and then the water's hitting your
ass hole and I'm right next to you.

419
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,650
Like really bro, you're going to do that.
All right, well it's a clean it out,

420
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,790
right?
Yeah.

421
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,620
You don't think you can be a little more
discreet or kind a bar soap and I put

422
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:17,870
it in there and then you go,
what are you doing? Yeah,

423
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,930
so cleaning my asshole.

424
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,710
But you're not supposed to take the
bar and mash it against the dirty part.

425
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,130
Yeah you are. No, that's what's savages
do. I've always done that. Yeah,

426
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,070
because you're a bear. You're not
a person. That's how you do it.

427
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,090
And that's how you do it.
But then you can Tammy. No,

428
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,350
you contaminate the ball.

429
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,023
Okay.

430
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,190
Oh that's what it was like.
Oh.

431
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,470
And then I made notes cause
I didn't want to forget.

432
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,040
And then you farted in the shower

433
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,790
cause you spread your asshole and
then you farted. And then my favorite,

434
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,910
unbelievable. This is, it gets wilder,

435
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,720
the hording, hording. Look,

436
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,330
he's next to me in the shower. I'm trying
to cuddle with you, kiss your face,

437
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,164
Kicks Your Beard,

438
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,990
You pee on me all the time in the shower.

439
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,020
You piss on me in the shower and all
that I can even tolerate until you blew

440
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:24,310
snot.
That was the deal breaker for me.

441
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,620
You were and then the snack came out
all over your beard and it gets stuck in

442
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:34,180
your beard and I almost vomited in the
shower. That's when I was like, all right,

443
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,010
I'm done. I got to go. I
almost threw out. I'm like,

444
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,470
it's like showering with a Hobo,

445
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,880
like a vagrant who's never been in an
indoor shower before. You were like,

446
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,480
it's a homeless person but you've
never been in a shower before I shower,

447
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,570
I forgot the horrors. Like you got
to clean all the pipes out, you know,

448
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:59,090
and got to get rid of all
of it. Apparently farted,
you spread your ass hole,

449
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:04,030
you hordes loogies snotting you pissed
on me. I didn't jerk off. That's the one,

450
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,310
the one boundary left in our marriage
or maybe we still haven't had that and I

451
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:11,830
have a white then on New Jersey and
I've been waiting for that to happen for

452
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:12,220
years.

453
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm at the point now where I'm kind of
excited about sometimes now like it,

454
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,300
cause I used to be like really like Ooh,
be real careful.

455
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,410
But now I'm like just let it happen.
Let it happen.

456
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,000
Well I just expect it now. I'm like,
come on, she's going to walk in there.

457
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,310
What would you do? Finish and you'll just
look at me. Would you make eye contact?

458
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:37,690
Probably maintain it or what'd you
just get Outta here and then finish?

459
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,400
I think I would just be like, watch,
watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.

460
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,100
It's pretty long time since
what that we've been, you know,

461
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,110
together though that that hasn't
happened yet. It's kind of crazy.

462
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,520
Especially considering I do it pretty
often, you know? Yeah. When, when the,

463
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:58,240
when the baby's crying cause I
turned you on. You have a shower.

464
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,830
There's no bathroom door cause it's one
of those bedrooms where it just goes in

465
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:03,850
bathroom. Yeah. I know.

466
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,970
I've been waiting to catch you in there
when I've done it in the shower a few

467
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:10,180
times. So when I've been home. Yes.

468
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,290
Grote gross. That's probably when I'd
been with the kid though. Right? Yeah.

469
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:17,320
I hope you're smart enough to do it when
I'm with the baby as opposed to winter

470
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,460
when when I'm walking free
and maybe I'd come in and,

471
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,250
well why would I have to worry about that?
You're my wife.

472
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,110
I don't want to watch you jerking off.

473
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,200
I don't want to catch you and
have that horrible awkward moment.

474
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,773
I didn't know that.

475
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,540
Why would I want to catch you
masturbating? It's not part of my life.

476
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,590
I don't want to know it and I'll,
why don't to know.

477
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,920
I would think a lot of
people would want to see.

478
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,840
Nobody wants to see you masturbate.
Really? You look like a homeless person.

479
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,890
Do you know? You keep saying, Hey, blow
you blow your nose too, and as I jerk off,

480
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:53,310
art and whore can everything as I
jerk off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

481
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,120
I have to get myself worked up.
I'm going to throw up.

482
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,930
Oh my God.

483
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,210
They tell you about the wife. I already
talked about this on the show about,

484
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:09,044
I'll talk about it again.

485
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,950
The wife that walked in on the husband
jerking off onto his shit. Yes. God.

486
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,510
Did you have to take it there?
Yeah. Julie, that one. Yes.

487
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,590
Some wild man. That's what I'm
afraid. Of course the come like,

488
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:26,110
I need to fucking know that. Okay,
listen, can I read this email? Yeah.

489
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,080
Subjects at double pipe. Classic
question. Very important. Very important.

490
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,300
Okay.
Hi Mommy's.

491
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:37,260
I was taking my regular dump this morning
when I let out the usual pre-brown.

492
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:41,610
Fuck you writes. I
burped at the same time.

493
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,330
I was absolutely shocked and
couldn't believe what happened.

494
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,880
It was a very exciting moment.
However,

495
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,230
does this count as an authentic pure
double pipe classic or would it be

496
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:56,040
considered a double pipe classic
with special circumstances?

497
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,980
Uh, I will point out that I
was sitting down on the toilet,

498
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:06,210
but the double pipe classic happened at
least 30 seconds before any brown exited

499
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,044
my anus.

500
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,720
Hmm. It's a really good question.
How do you feel about it?

501
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,430
You know, I think putting, um,

502
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,930
circumstances around a double pipe
classic isn't fair because look,

503
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,230
they're like Haley's comet, they
come around so rarely. Yeah.

504
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,610
It doesn't really matter how one has a
double pipe or just that one has a double

505
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:29,210
pipe.
Even

506
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,190
during a murder, if it's still a
double pack classic. No, like murder.

507
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,650
Yeah. Like if you were to be thrown out
of a building and as you hit the ground,

508
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,310
you fired in, birthed, you get
to take that to the credit. Yeah.

509
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,970
You get credit for that.
Yeah, I think so too. So, um,

510
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,630
I don't believe in the special
circumstance either. I would say, sir, you

511
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,220
devil biohazard over five classic and
it's, uh, it's something to be celebrated.

512
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:58,220
I would tell people about would make
Facebook posts. I would, yeah. Yeah.

513
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,700
That would share that. That's really
cool. Who invented that? That term?

514
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:06,050
Is that a top dog term? Mm.
Oh, it's generations old,

515
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,740
right? Yeah. Yeah. Has It in the
Bible? I think it's the old might be,

516
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,490
it might be in the Bible. It's certainly
in like Shakespeare and stuff. Yeah.

517
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,140
Oh definitely. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Dot.

518
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,930
Half made a double level five class.
I think it's in Romeo and Juliet actually.

519
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,490
Yeah.
Cause she kind of uh,

520
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,600
gets after him for having one or
something. Like she's on the balcony,

521
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,200
I remember that.
Oh Juliet.

522
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:34,570
And then he starts and burps
and she's like Romeo, what?
Double Pipe. Classic. Yeah,

523
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,350
that's right.
And that's what gets her,

524
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,810
and then they get married and then
you're here sitting here. Give me a, me,

525
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,250
me a hard time about it. But you know,
it's actually, it's, it's 11 lecture lab.

526
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:44,701
You know,

527
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:49,140
your sister just got married and I was
looking through those wedding photos this

528
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,400
morning and I was like, wow, look at what
a happy time. Just that wedding. Yeah.

529
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,760
Romantic. And then flash
forward nine, eight years. Yeah.

530
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,130
Taking a shower with your husband,

531
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:03,180
blowing snot rockets and spreading his
ass hole in the shower. It's pretty cool.

532
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,160
It is pretty cool.
I agree.

533
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,720
It's pretty little weddings.
A little misleading. No.

534
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,910
Yeah.

535
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,630
Are you saying you want me to dial it
back? No, there's nothing I can do.

536
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,370
Train's already left the station,
you know?

537
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,080
Hm.
Hm.

538
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,670
Which is the one you want
me to cut out though. Oh Ma,

539
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,240
I the snot rockets that
rocket. Yeah. In the shower.

540
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,080
I don't even mind getting
pissed on anymore. Like I
just expect it now. I'm like,

541
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,050
Nah, what's that warm?
Um, it's Tom Peeing on me.

542
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,340
The ass spreading even that I
can tolerate. I think the horror,

543
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,050
the horror king and snot
rocketing. I can't, I can't,

544
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:49,030
I'm working a loogie is the way it makes
one of vomit. Oh, speaking of that,

545
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,210
um, this guy, big fan. Uh,

546
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,330
let's see if I can fake fan.
Yeah. He's a big fan of the show.

547
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,610
He's a big fan of what you
were just saying. Yeah.

548
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,730
Was it her or the other woman that was
offensive? Both were again, ballpark huts.

549
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:17,240
They had a smell,
they just smell that was displayed.

550
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,193
Discharge.

551
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,790
So this guy was trying to describe the
smell of a woman somewhere and he uh,

552
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,410
he keeps just gagging. He has a, a
dry heaving. Yeah. I don't like it.

553
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:36,860
Yeah, no way. You were
just describing it, so

554
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,270
I just can't
listen to drive.

555
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,153
No.

556
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,863
Why

557
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
farms smell?

558
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,240
He, he really, oh man. That's so
good. She's really tickled by that.

559
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:16,650
And she is, she is, uh, let's see if we
got this set up. Here. He is doing it.

560
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,280
Um, I can't watch dry
healing, uh, multiple times.

561
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,930
Oh my God. Well right.
Okay. I took it down.

562
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,180
He had the worst.

563
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,350
I got something else for you.
You're like this. No, come on.

564
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,863
That's bullshit.

565
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,250
I'm back. I'm bareback.
Dennis Rodman and back.

566
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,970
Wow.
Watch this bullshit.

567
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,720
Or our favorite family. Um, we are though,

568
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,830
is that our favorite family? That's
my bear valley. That's exactly right.

569
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,280
We have a clip of them.
Tony [inaudible]

570
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,370
teach you up.

571
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,310
Bam. Bell. You.

572
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,590
Ooh.

573
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:42,650
[inaudible]

574
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,840
here they are. Well, I'll just
have them. We have so much.

575
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,720
Oh,
I've seen this episode.

576
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,950
This lady was having orgasmic,
which, which, which nick,

577
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,620
for three hours,

578
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,140
she didn't voluntary.

579
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:21,100
It doesn't stop for several hours.
Even the woman, she was like,

580
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,563
I love them.
So

581
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,030
there's a twitch twitch or
something taking over your body.

582
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,010
So if a man has an erection
longer than he's supposed to,

583
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,810
direction goes, no baby.
That's that blue pill.

584
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,880
If you have an orgasm for three
hours and make you feel that good,

585
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,130
and if it, dude, keep it
away from me. I'm good,

586
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,990
Chad. That we're, yeah, that weird
affectation. That's Trina, right?

587
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,200
I'm the house.

588
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,470
She has that pronunciation that the
reason that it's so fucking bizarre, oops,

589
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,200
is that she grew up with them. Yeah.
She's the only one that talks like that.

590
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:22,630
They'll talk more. More. Trina
is who picks up the effect.

591
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,550
I don't really use the only weird part.
I mean if, if they all did that, ah,

592
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,250
this fleet,
where's the fee?

593
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:33,050
If he'll kill it feels so good at killing
flies and nobody's get a blue man.

594
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,010
Oh Shit.

595
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,920
It's about to go down.
Oh, close to working.

596
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,040
This is one.
Tamar was a little bit more normal there,

597
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,440
having their vagina steam that I remember
in this episode you have vaginas or

598
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:48,770
steamed. Yeah, they're, they're
getting their badge esteemed
right now. It's like so

599
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,100
weird. Yeah. It's on a stupid,
uh, but anyway, I think they
just did it for the show.

600
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,650
Like not real. Right? Like
a lot of things. Yeah.

601
00:41:57,651 --> 00:41:59,630
Like we're going to get spray tanned.

602
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,140
They've got to end up giving those
people something to do, you know? Yeah.

603
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:04,370
They can't just sit around and talk.

604
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,890
They have to sit around and talk
and get their vaginas steamed silly.

605
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,490
Would you want to have a three
hour orgasmic Twix? Oh Wow.

606
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,530
Oh God.

607
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,900
We read your funeral.
Yeah.

608
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,400
And you just keep coming all
over him. All over. Your Dad

609
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,870
hold over your dad's dead body.
Gosh,

610
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,620
he doesn't come though every time,
right? Yes. Got stuff coming out.

611
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:34,190
But he's feeling like he's coming. Right.
But could you imagine anything in that?

612
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:36,890
If he just filled his pants all
the time too, then you'd have like,

613
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:40,640
his pants were all wet. That's right,
Babe. Can't pick up the kids at the,

614
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,490
you said that all or nothing,
you know, like you just
figured that out. I did that.

615
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,330
I didn't put that together more. Yeah.
Like his shorts would be all wet. Yeah.

616
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,420
You don't want to have nasty three
and four hour nasty directions either.

617
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:57,140
You know, you don't want that. No.
By Agra might be helpful. Yeah.

618
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,540
Be Bad. Yeah. Very bad.

619
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,810
Isn't that with Viagara does though? Yes,
exactly. A car for three hours. Yeah.

620
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,220
It's silly. Yeah. Can I
speak in of Dick hard? I got,

621
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:14,950
I'm a random text message by
Agra might be helpful. Yeah.

622
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,840
You know, this is the, the
new phone number, not even
new anymore. Maybe a year.

623
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,490
And I keep getting random
text and random voicemails.

624
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,030
I just got this one,
a Saturday,

625
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:33,380
10:35 PM and all it
says is sticks on deck.

626
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,500
Okay.

627
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,890
The fuck does that mean sticks on deck?
It sounds like I'm ready to fuck.

628
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,340
That's what I thought. Like maybe it's
a sexting thing. You're getting sex,

629
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:46,650
it sticks on deck. Maybe
it's a sticks on deck, bitch.

630
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,600
Maybe it's one of your comedy
club contacts. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

631
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,440
And then I, I texted my
millennial friends and she said,

632
00:43:55,441 --> 00:44:00,270
it sounds like hold on. Sounds like can
you go to thousands? Like it sounds like

633
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,400
no, no, no. She goes, uh,

634
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:10,220
never heard that one. I'm going to stick
like blunt wraps. Maybe the blonde,

635
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,840
maybe the blends are on deck. Wow.
Your millennials. Very savvy. I know.

636
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,930
This is my one contact
with the young people,

637
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:23,010
the cloud deck six odd duck lunch or ready
for roll sticks on marijuana cigar if

638
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,430
you will. Yeah, yeah, sure. So fucking,
well not only did you get sticks on deck,

639
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,130
yeah.
You also got after

640
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,870
a long hiatus, new corrosion
voicemail. That's neat.

641
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,630
Right?
The same lady St Lady.

642
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:42,240
And it's weird cause it's been going
on for months and months and I have a

643
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:45,420
theory on this. I
understand. Okay. This lady,

644
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,150
like people that are from the millennial
generation that are from the generation,

645
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:52,320
even before us,

646
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,850
she perhaps is dialing from memory.

647
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,460
So she is dialing every time,
not doing a saves number.

648
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:07,750
I'm calling my friends and tiles and
is like a digit off every time or,

649
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:11,310
okay. That's one excellent
theory. Brown lock,

650
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,170
or she's got like maybe that the old
number saved in her phone and there's two

651
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,500
numbers for one person. You ever
have that in new one and an old one?

652
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,720
There could be. Yep.
That's another option.

653
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
The reason that I thought that she was
dialing from memory is that there are,

654
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,240
there's clearly,

655
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,710
there's probably some interaction in
between these things because he doesn't go

656
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,940
like you never called me back.

657
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,680
It means that they probably speak at
some point and maybe she's dialing

658
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:39,700
correctly, sometimes
incorrectly, incorrectly.

659
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,050
Other times she clearly hasn't figured
out that this number doesn't get a

660
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:47,010
response. So you're right. The
interaction kind of comes and goes,

661
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,260
which leads me to believe it could
be an alternate phone number.

662
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,590
Like with my dad, I have his old
number and is new, but then you, well,

663
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,050
here's what came in this weekend.
First.

664
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,770

669
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:21,140

00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,660
And then you think that's it and
then she calls you again. Again,

674
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,680
come on Rod.
But didn't you take the notice for the

675
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,720

676
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,380
So wait, it's Salamay I thought I'd solemn

677
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:52,830
just dialing, dialing and
leaving messages for everybody.

678
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,290
No discretion now discretion. No
discretion to her dialing. Yeah.

679
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,250
Oh Man. That's the trick.
Styling together lady. Anyway,

680
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,190
I'm still getting those nice voicemails.
Yeah,

681
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:08,520
I suppose this is rob.
Come on, come on back.

682
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,270
I still get nursing gigs
for Shanaze synopsis.

683
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:19,190
This is Brad calling from them. The
newest Shit Nas would know. You know,

684
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:20,024
because she's

685
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:23,110
just missing out on all kinds
of business opportunities.

686
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,113
What are you doing?

687
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,620
No, I don't want it. She doesn't
vomit, but I don't like the dry heat.

688
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,400
That's when I'm like working.
I don't like it,

689
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,740
I'm closing it because you're
just torturing me. Torture you.

690
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,030
You're my wife.

691
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:50,310
So really sad news is
that we lost another icon.

692
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:53,910
Goddammit.

693
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,980
The day after last week's episode
aired on my flight up to a sperm.

694
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:05,680
Can I get a message?
Prince died. Oh my God,

695
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,170
it's devastating dude's we thought it
was because I dropped charges to the game

696
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:12,560
that my new football podcast and then
he listened to it and drop dead cause he

697
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,280
didn't like football. But that's not
what happened. It's not happened though.

698
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:20,770
First Whitney, then Michael, now prince.

699
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,010
That's the Holy Trinity.
I know.

700
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,070
There's only Madonna's the only
one left and she's the Holy Spirit

701
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,400
of the childhood stars.
Cindy Lopper I would say is another great.

702
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,540
He's 57. He was, he was
level. Yeah, I know.

703

We're going to get the autopsy
reports back. They sending
them to you? Well, yeah.

704
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,850
Well the guy, the coroner there said,
Tom, I'll try to get to you first. Um,

705
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,840
so that's like in another week or so.
I mean,

706
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,800
I'll probably get it tomorrow
for everybody, but, um, no,

707
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,080
I mean I'm curious as to see
what killed him. You know,

708
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,900
he's so that's too young to die.
Well,

709
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:59,290
they're saying it's quite that pneumonia
and then someone brought up a point

710
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:03,460
that he's a Jehovah's Witness and maybe
he refused medical treatment. Well,

711
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:08,461
he had an emergency plane landing the
week before he was flying back from a Gig.

712
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,820
Uh, they landed his plane in Illinois.
It was only like, I think it's Illinois,

713
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,060
right? It was only about 30
minutes or so from Minneapolis,

714
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:19,690
but they deemed it that important.
Landed, took him to a local hospital.

715
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,110
They wanted him to stay
in the hospital and he,

716
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:28,240
they didn't secure a private room
for him. Oh nope. It's Prince,

717
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,340
you should secure a private hospital.

718
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,150
So he took off the next day there
was a dance party at Paisley Park,

719
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:38,050
cause compound and oh wow.
Outside of Minneapolis.

720
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,610
And supposedly everything was fine.
And then obviously this is, you know,

721
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:45,830
then there was footage of him riding
his bike around his neighborhood and the

722
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,710
stopping in a record store. So all
that they said was fine. It does lead,

723
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,270
you know,

724
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,170
a lot of like the medical people to think
that you don't realize how many people

725
00:49:56,171 --> 00:50:01,120
die of the flu and pneumonia every year.
It's thousands. That's for old people.

726
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,420
No it's not. It's not always got old and
young are more common than die with it.

727
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:07,480
But what the point being
that if your body is weak,

728
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:11,470
so he's already been hospitalized,
should have, say your,

729
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:13,210
your immune system is a little bit weaker.

730
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:16,810
You're already sick and then you get
that and you're not taking care of it.

731
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,840
You know, your, your lungs
fill up with fluid and you die.

732
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,040
Maybe HIV or something and nobody
knew. Who knows? We'll find out.

733
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,040
He so town he wrote songs for so
many people too, which is a crazy

734
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,660
part shit that you don't even know that
guy was responsible for. I just remember,

735
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,070
uh, purple rain came out. I bought
the album when I was a little girl.

736
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,410
Really seven or eight years old.
I had it on,

737
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:44,411
I had a 33 of when doves cry and on the
back was 17 days was another song and I

738
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:48,290
didn't know what that stuff,
I didn't know what masturbation was.

739
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:51,710
I learned about it from Darling Nikki.
I learned about sex through purple rain.

740
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,760
That was like one of the seminal,
if you will,

741
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,600
albums of my childhood and
Apollonia seeing her tits.

742
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,450
I remember she jumped in the lake,
Lake Titicaca or whatever.

743
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,800
I remember seeing Apollonius tents
for the first time. You're like, Whoa,

744
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,030
there's tits and a movie.

745
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,380
Prince was interesting. He
was kind of like, as a kid I
was like, what is this guy?

746
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:17,400
Cause he was so, you know, so
different but so singular, so unique.

747
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,190
Know I would watch see
prince and I was like,

748
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,600
this dude is unlike any dude
that I've seen or known.

749
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:27,000
Cause he had that kind of non binary

750
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,480
nonbinary quality to him.
Right.

751
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,590
He kind of morphed between the
two genders. He was a femme,

752
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,370
a femme at man, feminine, Heterosexual.

753
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,820
Like David Bowie.
David Bowie may have been bisexual.

754
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:44,600
There was rumors that he was sleeping
when era. Dude, he was, yeah. But yeah,

755
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,290
he was a fem guy and he was,
he loved it and he was short.

756
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:51,200
And you know what's so interesting about
friends and I have to tiny and he wore

757
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:54,560
those little heels is that prince was,

758
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:58,550
what was magic about him is
that he believed he was sexy.

759
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,180
He really believed that he was,
when you look at him objectively,

760
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,550
look at a picture, a photograph
of prints, and you'd be like,

761
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:08,490
this guy's fucking five feet tall.
He's a shrimp and he's tired.

762
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,130
But he exuded this
presence of like a sex God.

763
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:17,660
And everybody took him to be that
way, which is amazing. Crazy. Aw,

764
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:20,960
come on. That's a jam.
That's the jam. 1999.

765
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,960
Jim Purple Rain Is, I think a perfect
outcome. I still listen to it.

766
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,060
Um, the uh, I mean also, you know,

767
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:33,920
even even the early days, I was
staying a little later on, you know,

768
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,000
you get to some of the,

769
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,960
the songs that were just amazing
to listen to as well. And you know,

770
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:43,650
in honor of him, we have a little
bit of it. Cause we were, we were

771
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,690
big fans,
you know,

772
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,820
Shane,

773
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,440
late Tom and Christina
from your moms house,

774
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:57,770
podcasts
you need to teach.

775
00:52:57,771 --> 00:53:02,390
You haven't seen diamonds
and pearls. I love girls.
Everyone loves this song. Yeah.

776
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,533
So good.

777
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,850
I liked his earlier stuff too.
Paisley Park and uh,

778
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,270
this, is this paused or no, no, that's,
that's just the intro to this. Oh,

779
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,280
you know that song?

780
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:25,110
Pay Sleep easy girl on know season.

781
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,250
That's a good song.

782
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,020
Yeah. Dude. He's got so many heads
dealer library it, it's, it's crazy.

783
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:32,800
Library. Yeah. The library yet.

784
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,400
Damn man.
Damn

785
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,170
such a good song. Yeah, yeah,

786
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,930
yeah.
Okay.

787
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,920
Damn man.
Damn.

788
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,790
Okay. So we're just doing a little
sample. Well, you know, we get the,

789
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,250
they might flag it for
being a duplicate copy

790
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:01,930
of the audio matches up perfectly with
the original and then you do you want to

791
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,060
flag it? Breaks it down. So we
just gave you a low sample. Yeah.

792
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:09,490
You gave you diamonds amp
or it's not as diamond.

793
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,780
Yeah,
especially [inaudible].

794
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,290
I mean, Shane exuded everything
that I think Princeton in this, um,

795
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,280
even aesthetically similar, very
similar guys. It's a tribute.

796
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:26,240
It's really a tribute.

797
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:30,900
Um, obviously Shane, um, you know,
he wasn't doing his best there.

798
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,970
He makes that clear and a lot
of his clubs, he was like,
I'm not doing my best. Um,

799
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:35,210
you know,

800
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:40,080
it was interesting to point out
as I go through these pages here,

801
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,560
I'm looking for, I have more of
Shane, which I know you want to hear.

802
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,110
Everybody is on bated breath
waiting for more Shane Shane

803
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,460
episodes,
uh,

804
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,840
that we featured him
back to back a while ago.

805
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,280
Um, yeah, let me see.

806
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,770
I already had some technical
problems with that computer.

807
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,410
Um, perfectly, perfectly. Uh Huh.

808
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,420
Oh, that, I'll get that. I'll
get flagged for sure. Nice.

809
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,853
Yay.

810
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,740
Yeah, yeah, Yup. There you go.

811
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:35,600
But I really, I loved prince as a little
girl. I thought he was just amazed.

812
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,080
I still is, was, yeah. What a bummer. Um,

813
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:43,010
when we dedicated the
entire segments to Shane,

814
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:46,820
this is just trivia from our, your mom's
house turn is going to go on Wikipedia,

815
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:50,320
but this will go on the Wikipedia
page when we dedicated, um,

816
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,380
20 minutes to him on an episode,
I don't know, a year ago,

817
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,450
the following week,

818
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,760
our listenership went
down by over 30% easily.

819
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:06,260
And it took a while to regain
that. Yep. Nope, nope. Yep.

820
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,240
People were aggressively upset with the
emails. We got. Stop playing this guy.

821
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:14,890
He's the worst. He's the worst. So
yeah, we don't want to Overdo it with,

822
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,840
ah,
this was

823
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,550
a little bit half off
form or there is a feed.

824
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,010
Sounded like when he had a kennel cough,
it's exactly what he sounded like.

825
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Um,
it's gone.

826
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:40,780
So rest in peace prints such a bomber
and you know, and then the shit suck.

827
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,460
Artists are still alive.

828
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,410
We know why not Justin Bieber take him
gun instead of taking the good ones,

829
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,210
you know? And there really isn't a climate
to nurture artists as weird as prince.

830
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:56,260
Now if you look at it, it's gone. You
get bloated. People like Patty Smith,

831
00:56:56,261 --> 00:57:00,940
like these weird androgynous
people prance even Bowie,

832
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:05,710
right? These gender non
binary people if you will.

833
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,270
It's, it's gone. Gone is this
time? Well, you know, I, um,

834
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,230
a lot of people don't know this,

835
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:16,231
but I'm Polly and I buy and I'm also a
nonbinary come out as polyamorous and I'm

836
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,490
excited to share it that I'm bisexual.

837
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,480
I'm non binary to the non binary for
those of you don't know what the term

838
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:31,780
means. I'm surprised if you don't, I mean
who, who hasn't nonbinary these days,

839
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,860
right. President Obama went to
London and it was uh, taking,

840
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:41,940
taking questions from the audience and
a Pakistani person came out as nonbinary

841
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:47,700
to President Obama and that was on Twitter
and we were like, what's non-binary?

842
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,790
Yeah. It means neither gender.
Correct. It means you're,

843
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:57,440
you don't identify fully
with, yeah. Male or female.

844
00:57:57,441 --> 00:58:01,180
I'm totally non-binary. Yeah.
Or you feel like that. Totally.

845
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,950
I'm like,
I'm Demi Demi gendered,

846
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,310
you know? Interesting. Yeah.
Interesting. I don't know.

847
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,470
I Dunno. There's so much, there's so
many different genders. There are a lot.

848
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,420
I'm going to see what my
dad thinks I'm going to,

849
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,370
if we can get them on the phone.

850
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:26,380
But I'll see that's the best part about
this stuff is asking our dads what they

851
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,710
think about these gender nude,
new gender norms.

852
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:35,570
I hope he answers.
So it was really

853
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,060
the first time
mom,

854
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:46,200
Bonnie, I've been doing recording
on the other line. Of course.

855
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:52,100
What I was trying to call the
debt and I here at your phone?

856
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,330
Yeah. Uh, yeah. I was calling from my
other phone. I have to a few phones here.

857
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,880
Ah, I felt to one city and I said it has
to be a salesman. I can by trying to me,

858
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:07,080
hey, I'm, I wanted to tell you
something I'm really excited about. Um,

859
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:11,040
I'm poly and I'm Bi and I'm non binary.

860
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,170
No,
what?

861
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,950
I'm Pauley and I'm Bi and I'm non binary.

862
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,720
Here's what I understand. I'm falling
and I'm by an unknown by knowing.

863
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,440
So I, I guess if I put it together,
he doesn't make any sense.

864
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:34,830
I'm polyamorous,
I'm bisexual and I'm non binary.

865
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,940
Yeah, you're bisexual. Yeah, but I'm also,

866
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:44,290
I don't do agenda then why don't you
become through a unit and you complete the

867
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:47,260
whole picture now? No, but
I'm not buying it can be seen.

868
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,120
It doesn't mean you're not wine.
I'm non binary.

869
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,550
Gender binaries. You again. Bye.

870
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,600
No, no. I don't identify as
either male or female. I'm just,

871
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,000
I don't, I don't identify
as either gender. So I,

872
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,730
whereby you cannot go to the bathroom.

873
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:06,900
They should be sure to
go by before the war.

874
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:15,990
Either one. I'm nervous. I'm nervous

875
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,530
unless we get Trump. Yeah.
Drums. The base a chance.

876
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,390
She's wanting to respect your
what? Nothing. Are you a Trump fan?

877
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,720
I am. Nobody. Nobody. I mean, this
is awful. This is embarrassing.

878
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,210
Yeah, absolutely. The idea,
but I'm gonna Watch you.

879
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:40,720
They talking isn't most fake
teaching after everything. Hi,

880
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,490
miss my London is a typical politician
is telling you everything you want them

881
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,470
to hear the way you want to be.

882
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,480
I don't feel [inaudible] so that
time it's a not great six boy,

883
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,490
but I think I have to do
husband run the country.

884
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:58,780
I will love to see a worksheet
then. Casick yeah. Yeah.

885
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:04,590
Is the only guide from
Eaton on it's completely
knowledgeable and [inaudible] is

886
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:09,810
mark. I neither. Yeah. Cool.

887
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,770
Do you like when I do you want Hillary?

888
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,670
Um, I want, I just,

889
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:19,450
I'd rather have just another non binary
person leaving the country, you know.

890
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,140
Well why don't you run?
Well that's the thing. Um,

891
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:26,200
that's the other announcement I wanted
to tell you that I'm probably going to

892
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:27,034
run for president.

893
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,960
Mom is not a joke. Okay. I take it though.

894
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,080
[inaudible] oh,

895
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,430
oh Christina or anything
this important for the apart.

896
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,320
Christina wanted to tell you
wanted me to while she's here,

897
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:44,620
but she wanted to tell you about the
shower we took the other day. Um,

898
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:45,670
cause she's been like,

899
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:48,730
I'm going to tell your mother because
we took a shower together here at tell.

900
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,320
Tell her baby

901
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,360
can she hear me? Yeah. Hi.
Yeah, I can hear. Yeah.

902
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,720
So your son and I, yeah. You're
going to love this, your son.

903
01:01:57,721 --> 01:02:01,800
And I thought it would be romantic
and loving to take a shower together.

904
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:07,250
Okay. I can almost, I can almost guess
what she did. What do you think happened?

905
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,400
I think he started falling and

906
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:14,190
close. No, right.

907
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,680
He spread his butt cheeks
to get the water on it.

908
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:22,170
He used the bar of soap and he
put the bar in his butt hole.

909
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,110
I'd have to take it.

910
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:29,070
Yeah.
Tell me the stories he told.

911
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:33,060
Don't somebody telling me
is both because I think,

912
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:35,970
I think my husband will
enjoy it and be proud of him.

913
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:40,590
Wait, it gets better and then gimme
it gets worse. You know it can go.

914
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,240
It gets worse.

915
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:47,170
So then he starts Horkey
Tyler like hawking a loogie.

916
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,410
Okay.

917
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,770
Ah God.

918
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,900
Oh
No.

919
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:57,050
And then he blows,
not he,

920
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,160
he puts one finger on one nostril
and pushes the snot out of the,

921
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,830
do you think that's enough? I can.
I can even do that maybe if I can.

922
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,730
Yeah. And then this one, I
love to hear it anymore. No,

923
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:14,670
I'm promise you. And then the smell
wasn't his beard and then he peed.

924
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,520
He peed on me in the shot.

925
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,860
I can imagine any relevant with
that imagination. Nevertheless,

926
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:28,990
she did something horrible thing for
like 70 years of life I ever heard.

927
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,300
And you think this is Tony?

928
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,370
I don't think it's funny. I think it's
horrible. I think we were trying to have,

929
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,090
I wasn't

930
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,370
think well that for driving me.
He just told me that he's not by me,

931
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:45,520
but he's nothing.
He's Bi sexual but doesn't qualify.

932
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,750
And you don't mind that
he's bisexual by the way.

933
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,240
Oh, I see. Yeah, he's, well,
he's Paulie. He's polyamorous,

934
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,830
bisexual buddies, non-binary. So
he's not attracted to either sex.

935
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,800
Oh, I thought you, I was
like tension. So he's,

936
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:04,120
he's wanting kids by fit you to,
right.

937
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,960
But he's also nonbinding
cancers that both sexes,

938
01:04:07,961 --> 01:04:12,680
but I'm neither sex. Right.
He's asexual. It's very,

939
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,590
very hurtful that Christina did
well after we took that shower,

940
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,570
she told me that I, that I
was a homeless person. That I,

941
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,190
that it was like showering with a
homeless person. Isn't that rude?

942
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,670
We didn't come this Thursday.
Yeah.

943
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,610
She said that showering with me is like
showering with a homeless person because

944
01:04:39,611 --> 01:04:40,450
I'm sweating.

945
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,610
Why I do if you have not been great
in the homeless people and why? Why?

946
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,740
I don't know what you mean.
Ask her about,

947
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:51,090
they call me first time we screened them.
She's taking the cello.

948
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:51,924
So what is wrong?

949
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:55,000
Ask her about the comfort or if she
noticed that he was washing the comfort

950
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,090
those right. That's true.
That's a good point, mom.

951
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:03,300
Hey Dad told me the other day that he
farted on the bed and that there was shit

952
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,770
on the bedspread.
It did its job.

953
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:10,930
And what did you think
when you heard this?

954
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:16,240
I walk in the house and I see
you in the washing machine has,

955
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:18,400
I guess,
should we say that?

956
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:23,000
But I guess what you said what it was.

957
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,850
It wasn't naturally I didn't,
but I,

958
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:29,340
I had to meet them farm and again it
was one of the for the noise. Yes.

959
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,120
Modified for,
yeah.

960
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,510
Do you know that those aren't mine?
Do you know that those are called a shore?

961
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,800
Do you know those are called the shark.

962
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,460
I have. Knowing that. Interesting.

963
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,660
Knowing the name of God because if I
have one of those, I have been doubt.

964
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,513
I go to the bathroom.

965
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,420
No, no. It's called a shark.

966
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:49,510
It's called a sharp sharp s. H. A. R. T.

967
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,820
It's sharp.
Oj can be sharp thing.

968
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:57,380
Right? Because when you go to the
forest but you shit, so it's a sharp,

969
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:01,000
well, usually you have one
or both is and I'm like,

970
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,540
it's [inaudible]. [inaudible]

971
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,700
[inaudible] [inaudible] pounds under the
bed. Then you pooping a bunch of them.

972
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:14,420
That's a good point actually.
That's a good point. Yeah.

973
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,890
Having to go through so much. It's that.
Now, do you that distinction, did you,

974
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,060
it's a very important distinction.

975
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:23,860
Did it bother you that he didn't remove
the poop stains from the bedspread?

976
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:27,380
He just put with the chunks
of poop into the Washer.

977
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:28,830
All right.

978
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:32,880
Would you mind to change the topic of
conversation because it's so disgusting,

979
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,490
but I know I was in good
call. I was having a cup of
coffee with the coffee cake.

980
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,980
Yeah.
I never scoring the set for my dog.

981
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:44,730
I hung up with the bed to say who is this
person was calling me to both numbers.

982
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,950
It has to be somebody
important by parents.

983
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,790
I so somebody who wants to go first
today it goes damn that inconvenient.

984
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:54,690
Inconvenient. They call you and
your the one to tell you bullshit.

985
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,640
I knew before I buy it.
Right.

986
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,270
But it tends to be you to talk about
poop which is getting worse or or we're

987
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:02,100
talking but we're worried about you.

988
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,580
I'm worried about and even then you
haven't even been, how is the baby?

989
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:10,500
We don't own my baby. He's in the
cray right now. He's in his, yes,

990
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,970
he's locked up.
Yeah.

991
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:16,970
Give it to me because you're so busy
now and but [inaudible] [inaudible]

992
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,450
no I'm poly and I'm Bi but
I'm also nine button nonbinary

993
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,960
yeah and buy and buy and non binaries.

994
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,680
I'm going by noon.

995
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,420
Nonbinary long by name
and what is non binary?

996
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,340
I don't identify as either gender.

997
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,420
That's pretty sad.
If you know him mind.

998
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,730
Here's the thing, when you referred to
me, you don't say he like you don't go.

999
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:53,740
He would like to do that. You say
they, so if somebody says, okay,

1000
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,660
right, right. Yeah,

1001
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:01,740
so I say you had nothing actually you
don't know the date when you clarify this

1002
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,380
again. You guys are okay.
They are not in vain.

1003
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:09,920
It nothing.
I'll do it.

1004
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,590
My point is don't identify like this
and you don't mind if you buy like that.

1005
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:19,010
That's a little but okay. Through
my kitchen. Say what I'm doing.

1006
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:23,720
Neither one. Nothing. Well, I don't
know if I'm a your kitchen table.

1007
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,070
I'm telling you I
and you have no feeling.

1008
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,540
You're not attracted to either one.
You are not by sexual.

1009
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,000
We are not boarding are not
[inaudible] you. I guess

1010
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:43,060
that's not the day. You are not two
people. The opposite. Losing yourself.

1011
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,950
We prefer they what? I'm sorry.

1012
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,430
Tell her they are not the people in there.
Tell her we're making yeah name

1013
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:58,950
and you're not. You want to be both
and she doesn't mind and do it. Oh God.

1014
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:05,020
Chara we're making sure to raise Ellison
and non-gender conformist environment

1015
01:09:05,461 --> 01:09:09,960
too. We're going to dress him
up and paint that right now.

1016
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:13,760
You just told me they're joking.
What do you mean what? No,

1017
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:18,200
I don't want him to grow
up confused. Yeah. Okay.

1018
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,580
Can I pick up the baby?
And I said, good guys.

1019
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,200
They can make up a lot of years and we
didn't buy well when he's done playing

1020
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:29,250
with those dolls. Yeah,
maybe. I'm sorry I seen him.

1021
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,820
I think she deserves to be
in the normal environment.

1022
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,810
I would carry what she is and what God,

1023
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:39,320
maybe we have a different
definition of normal. Yeah.

1024
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:44,330
But I that I know what's on
my list because I'm only 8
million years old living.

1025
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,730
Do I know Norman? Okay.
Whatever. All right.

1026
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,580
Changing the topic of direct
conversation by the way. Yeah. Yeah.

1027
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:56,390
We went to the movies yesterday.
I don't even know if the movie recruiting.

1028
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,150
I do a lot of it. What is it?
What? My name is [inaudible].

1029
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:06,090
My name is Dolly or Paul
[inaudible] name is Dolly and Pie.

1030
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,720
My name is Paul by, no, my name is Doris.

1031
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:16,210
Doris. Doris. Okay. I know what's what,

1032
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:21,190
what is it about? Yeah. What's it about?
Uh, when did you have on the woman?

1033
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:24,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

1034
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:30,480
Younger guy. And once you go through
and I mean he hit add thing is super.

1035
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:34,700
I mean, they don't give false gods
for the title, but you will be for it.

1036
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,290
Well, that's cool. All right.

1037
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,770
[inaudible] yeah,
no,

1038
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:48,190
it's a movie that it's a good thing
he made you laugh in different. Good,

1039
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:52,580
cool. We'll check it out when they
make a poly by version, but mom,

1040
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:57,890
can I call you back on the other line?
I went to talking about a bitch. Yeah,

1041
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,500
no, no. We'll talk baby stuff and
everything. I got to go take a shit.

1042
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,830
I'll call you when I'm done with this.

1043
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,990
I don't think they teach it because he
never chewed him up in the bathroom. Yeah,

1044
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:10,870
I know. Excuse me. Excuse me. No heat.
No heat. They should the [inaudible].

1045
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,070
There you go. Hey. Yeah, you're
getting there. I'm finally.

1046
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,450
Yep. All right you.
Bye. Bye. Love you. Bye.

1047
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,250
You know we should do when they come
visit next week then it's dangerous,

1048
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,540
but I'll take your neck,
brother and my mom.

1049
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:32,100
We should buy dolls for Ellis
when she comes over next time.

1050
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,140
[inaudible] like barbies
and put them around. Ellis.

1051
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:39,090
It's true and put them in address.
See if they like it. Yeah,

1052
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:43,380
it's a good idea. Yeah. Well that
wasn't well, that was great. Yeah.

1053
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,220
She's not as supportive as I was
hoping for, but you know. Nah,

1054
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,510
I hate when people aren't as supportive
as they should be. This stuff, you know,

1055
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,370
I know progress.
People are trying to make

1056
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,860
Pauley and I'm buy it.
Let's get some progress.

1057
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,200
Um, yeah. Here's the time. I told my
dad, hey, you got to tell you something.

1058
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,460
I'm Pauley and I'm bi.

1059
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,240
I'm poly and a buy.

1060
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:17,820
How was the best day of my life when we
told me dad, you were going. He goes,

1061
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:22,230
all right buddy. Well ACDC,
Huh? Oh, switch hitter.

1062
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:26,930
Right. That's so funny. I love explaining
this stuff to the older generation.

1063
01:12:26,931 --> 01:12:31,690
It's really fun. I can't wait to tell my
dad about non binary. I don't, I dunno.

1064
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:35,820
They make their heads explode when
you try to explain this stuff to that.

1065
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,020
I was talking about the bathroom thing.

1066
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:42,720
If North Carolina with my dad and he
was like, we've stumbled, he has a dick,

1067
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:46,470
then they can piece next to me.
But if they don't have a dick,

1068
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,460
they can't come into the bathroom with
me. I'm like, that makes sense. He's like,

1069
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:54,240
I don't know why people aren't worried
about children pissing next two grown men.

1070
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,830
That's more worrisome.

1071
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:58,620
I mean you actually have a point
like what's he worried about?

1072
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:02,580
Like you know how in men's bathroom
stalls guys just fucking pee next to each

1073
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:06,030
other and if you're lucky there's some
kind of a divider and sometimes there's

1074
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:09,450
not. Yeah. He's like, I think we should
be more concerned about like little boys.

1075
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,650
That is the bigger issue.
You don't know what the,

1076
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,460
what the grown men are doing. It's
terrifying because you're a little kid,

1077
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,640
a little boy.
Public restrooms are kind of terrifying.

1078
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:24,510
I mean the fact that you
should be expected to whip
your genitals out in front

1079
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:29,150
of strangers is really crazy.
People piss on the floor and like,

1080
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:33,090
oh yeah. There's just like, it
is intimidating to be, you know,

1081
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,890
as you're the height of the
other people's dicks. Oh Geez.

1082
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:40,400
I mean your face is that their
cognitive level? Yeah. Pull out.

1083
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:44,540
You got to go with Ellis whenever you're
out with him, make sure that, okay,

1084
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,690
thanks. Don't just let them go
alone. Pissing everywhere. You know,

1085
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,920
I'm just thinking about the
future right now. Of course,

1086
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:54,770
my terrified sign of these monster Cox
all over him, all over him, you know,

1087
01:13:54,771 --> 01:13:58,870
and around him I kissed him on the
head with it and stuff. Yeah, yeah,

1088
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,570
yeah. It's a bigger, it is a bigger issue.

1089
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,580
Let's keep our son's protected
from these monster public dicks.

1090
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,930
It's really the jumbo as he liked to call
yours. Jumbos he's something else, man.

1091
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:14,680
He is something else. That was really
funny. Your mom really didn't like the,

1092
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,670
the shower that we took together.
Got To really know.

1093
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:23,260
What I noticed is that she will
talk longer about gross things.

1094
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,600
She doesn't like if it's coming from me.
Right.

1095
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:30,010
Like we get a little longer of a rope.
Yup. But when it's just you, she like,

1096
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,730
we'll hang up on you. Yeah. So in the
future, this is a great tag team. Sure.

1097
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,030
Give it to me. Let me tell her
the details. Yeah. Cause she'll,

1098
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:38,260
she'll stay on the line longer.

1099
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:42,950
Yup. Uh, and for those of
you watching on Youtube? Um,

1100
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:46,810
the reason that I handed the laptop
over is because we were using,

1101
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:49,810
you hear us through the
recorded microphone,

1102
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,020
but she hears us through the
microphone in the laptop.

1103
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:56,860
So if you're wondering like why the fuck
are they doing that? It's that, oh yeah.

1104
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,740
I didn't feel like at a certain point
in that call though, she was like,

1105
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:04,950
y'all are y'all finished? Are
Y'all done? You know, some respect.

1106
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,810
Yeah, she was definitely like put
some respect on my name. Awesome.

1107
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:11,770
By all of those.
Well hold on a day.

1108
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:17,950
It was definitely what was going on
Ma. I love you. Bye. I love you. Yeah,

1109
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:19,003
she was definitely,

1110
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:23,180
I know you guys are dying to know
what's up with Betsy and her diarrhea.

1111
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,340
[inaudible] took her to the vet and they
tested her poopies to see if there's

1112
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:30,320
some kind of viral whatever.

1113
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:35,180
And it's not that she is just stupid and
she's eating stuff in the backyard and

1114
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:38,390
they basically said that yeah,
the vet was like, you know what?

1115
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:40,520
Some dogs are dumb and
just eat everything.

1116
01:15:40,521 --> 01:15:45,260
So you have had to get a special dog food
to offset the fact that she will just

1117
01:15:45,261 --> 01:15:47,930
eat horrible things and give herself Dyer.

1118
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:53,870
Ooh. Ooh, Mama. I love you

1119
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,320
mama alone practically in tears.
My name here.

1120
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:02,000
You got two of them together. You all
are we all finished? Are Y'all done?

1121
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:08,200
Yeah, it's great. Yeah.
Um, linkedin is helpful.

1122
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,870
Linkedin is helpful.
Fuck. Lincoln Lincoln,

1123
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:17,210
Lincoln Den. Um, also I,

1124
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:19,880
uh, I watched a Hitler movie. Oh,

1125
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:22,280
on Netflix called look who's back.

1126
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:26,420
It's a German film and it was
actually pretty good. Really? Yeah.

1127
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,160
It took a neat twist.

1128
01:16:28,161 --> 01:16:31,910
I didn't think it would go
where it's interesting. Yeah.

1129
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:36,470
They made a movie that Hitler wakes up
in the year 2015 or 2014 I forget. Yeah.

1130
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,380
What's it called? Look who's back. Look
who's back. It's in German. It's subtitle.

1131
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:42,290
It's so fun. I loved it. It was
really funny. And you love it.

1132
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,190
The m really interesting social
commentary and all that crap. Yeah. Yeah.

1133
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:50,860
Oh, do we have a couple of other things?
Oh, first we made this announcement.

1134
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:55,861
I should probably get to a that
we haven't gotten to yet or no,

1135
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:58,773
your mom.

1136
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,260
It's

1137
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,520
news.
Um,

1138
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,640
so at summit or something I wanted to
make sure we had our ducks in a row for,

1139
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,460
for awhile.
Um,

1140
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,680
and so I was talking to blue band and
had to make sure everything was lined up

1141
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,370
and then uh,
he flew

1142
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,120
a couple of places for me and
made sure we were set to go.

1143
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,433
Um,

1144
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:42,850
and he did this for me and that is that
we are now ready to bring out the new,

1145
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:52,580
the all new bikes shirt.
Oh my God.

1146
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:56,610
Oh my gosh.
This is something that um,

1147
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,670
was originally on our uh,

1148
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,390
on our mommy jams on this show.
And then I,

1149
01:18:05,391 --> 01:18:08,930
I made a bit about it on um,

1150
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,240
on the uh, Netflix special. Yes.

1151
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:16,970
And then now it is ready to go.
We have a bunch of them.

1152
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,300
They are absolutely fire.

1153
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,290
We even have a bye

1154
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,113
bye.

1155
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:34,480
Bye Bye.
Bye Bye.

1156
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:35,660
Bye Bye.

1157
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:41,770
Yeah, that is great. A blue band did a
good job. Blue Ban. That's really neat.

1158
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,660
Really good work.
Ban Harris is that,

1159
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:46,570
is that promo up anywhere
that people can see it?

1160
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:49,720
It's going to be just showing
it here for the first time.

1161
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,870
That's a really neat design.
Elisa. Yes, the new bike shirt.

1162
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,850
And we had one for a while.

1163
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:58,750
This one is on a much
higher quality tee shirt.

1164
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:00,100
It's an all new design.

1165
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:04,450
It has a few bikes on it and of course
it has the word bikes in big black

1166
01:19:04,451 --> 01:19:08,910
letters. Um, the store is now up. Uh,

1167
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:13,180
if you go to Tom cigarette.com, uh,
and your mom's house, podcast.com,

1168
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,710
you can check it out and uh, we're very
excited and we have them fully stocked.

1169
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,370
So there is, it's not a
presale, there won't be the, um,

1170
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:25,480
the issue that we had before with a lot
of you waiting on your sub cane shirts.

1171
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:30,340
I profusely apologize for that and uh,
it won't happen with these.

1172
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:35,580
And the sub cane shirts that you do see
on my site are only ones that we have in

1173
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:37,331
stock.

1174
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:42,331
So we have a new system that counts the
inventory and eliminates shirts that are

1175
01:19:42,551 --> 01:19:47,020
no longer there. You will not have to
wait again. So a thousand apologies.

1176
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,950
Please get the bikes shirt.
It supports us.

1177
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:54,940
It supports the show and
it supports, um, you know,

1178
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:59,290
it supports our, our guy here,
our uh, our producer blue man,

1179
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:03,860
mother fucker. Yo. So
please get them cheese.

1180
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:08,130
It's really, um, anyways,
I'm really about by extreme

1181
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,630
good. That's exciting guys.
Yeah. Pick up your shirts.

1182
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:16,440
Do your shopping on Amazon,
get on Linkedin, then his help

1183
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:20,840
fall. Uh, is there anything else? Mm,

1184
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:25,680
I don't think so. I think we
covered a lot of topics. Yeah.

1185
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,320
Take detectives. Yeah.
Do you want to do that?

1186
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,180
The Donald Trump Dick
detectives real quick. Okay.

1187
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:34,420
Okay. Um, sure. One second.
Let me pull this up.

1188
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,810
Yeah ma'am.
Yeah.

1189
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:54,030
You have a, um, a number of where these
jpegs are supposed to bring up. Yes.

1190
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,270
Okay. Um, so here is a

1191
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:04,050
image of him and to get you get your
mind in the right place. How about Shara?

1192
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,640
With,
there's political commentary.

1193
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,800
He's such a terrific picture. Looks.
It does look like he just finished.

1194
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:14,070
She's like, ah, I guess. Feels good.

1195
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,910
Feels good that you just put
a finger on it. Feels good.

1196
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:20,010
You have a finger in the
booty hole right there.

1197
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:24,360
Isn't that kind of looked like a pleasure
face. Yeah. Um, yeah, there's Turkey back.

1198
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,560
So you want to go first?

1199
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,150
I mean everybody knows the answer to this.
I feel like it's kind of a no brainer.

1200
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:33,020
Yeah, it's obviously orange. It's orange,

1201
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:35,540
orange with fluffy white.
Pubes.

1202
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,320
What about size wise? There's been
a lot of talk about his hand size.

1203
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:45,490
He was accused of having small hands and
then he made a very clear message that

1204
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,460
my hands, first of all, he
doesn't think they're that small.

1205
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:54,500
And also no one's ever complained about
my manhood. So he was basically saying,

1206
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:58,550
I at least don't have a small Dick.
He didn't say, I have a big Dick,

1207
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:03,380
but he didn't say I have, you know,
he said no one's ever complained.

1208
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:08,710
I'm going to go for short
and thick like a coke can.

1209
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,890
But it's short. It's not, oh, can,
but it's thick cocaine is. Yeah,

1210
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:17,910
but it's not, it's not great because
it's too short. How short or is it,

1211
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,890
I don't know. You know, I don't
know. It's a short, short,

1212
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,410
it's orange.
Hmm.

1213
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:28,290
Well the white cubes
and his beans are tiny.

1214
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:32,040
I think he's got small little.
Okay. What do you think?

1215
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:37,340
I think it's actually like a little,
like a cute little button. Like,

1216
01:22:37,341 --> 01:22:40,340
um, there's actually, I
saw, yeah, this is it here.

1217
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,360
There's this sketch that um,
that I've,

1218
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:49,510
that I saw of that. Uh, what's her name?
Elma. Is that her name or did it Elma.

1219
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:54,170
Gore. Yeah. Elma Gore did
a sketch of him. Let's see.

1220
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:58,190
And um, I'll try to print,
bring it up here. It's, it's,

1221
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,660
it's become very popular and I
think in my mind it's very accurate.

1222
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:05,980
Um,
as far as here it is here.

1223
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:13,680
Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh
Huh. Yeah, this totally,

1224
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:14,771
that makes sense.

1225
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:18,910
When you look at the in proportion to
the body type where it's like the real

1226
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,670
small placid. Yeah. He's got a nice,

1227
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:25,740
cause he's got some weight on him and
he's got a nice fat pad here and a,

1228
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:30,750
and it basically you just see the head
kind of poking out when it's flacid and

1229
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:34,930
then it probably grows I think probably
around four inches, you know? Yeah.

1230
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:39,030
I don't, I don't think he's got anything
extraordinary going on down there. Yeah.

1231
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:43,900
Yeah. Uh, I would give him a little
more length on that. You think so? Yeah.

1232
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:47,990
But the shape of it and the color and
everything looks about accurate, I think.

1233
01:23:47,991 --> 01:23:52,660
Uh, yeah, I think that's about it. I'm
going to go with illness. Uh, depression.

1234
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,950
Wow. I think it's really accurate
and you know, I'm not going to lie.

1235
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,820
It looks a lot like
mine. Um, so that's, uh,

1236
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:03,130
it's kind of what I've been
saying and I don't think so.

1237
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:06,760
He doesn't have any balls in that picture.
I definitely have all their tiny,

1238
01:24:06,761 --> 01:24:09,600
has walls are tiny. I
definitely a balls. Yeah.

1239
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,850
Bigger balls longer hanging here.
Guns, how full they are. Yeah,

1240
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,300
they get full sometimes. It's
like your dad's, they're bigger.

1241
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,370
So gross. Um, so, but the,

1242
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,890
the problem with this episode
of Dick Detectives is a,

1243
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:25,690
we don't get to ask Donald,
so which is it?

1244
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:29,050
Cause that's how we usually like to play.
I mean blue band.

1245
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:31,390
Do you want to decide
who is more accurate?

1246
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:36,690
Is it a coke can and girth and
short or is it what I saw there,

1247
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:40,420
that little head,
the Elma drew and about four inches long.

1248
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:44,470
A Blue Band just gave me
the point and the thumbs up,

1249
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:47,710
meaning I win this
round. Wow. Of dicta tech

1250
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:48,663
did.

1251
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,490
Yeah. What kind of Dick, I mean,

1252
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:07,580
what would be your ideal
Dick to have ideal,

1253
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:13,130
not one of these fantasy
digs that you see, you know,

1254
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,260
in sex stores or on a few porn
stars that are chest Garcon.

1255
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:20,240
I think that's too crazy.
I think everybody would want,

1256
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,820
the ideal one would be like a little
above average in everything go longer than

1257
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:30,650
average low girth here than
average. Um, so I don't know,

1258
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:35,810
maybe like eight. It's like long, but
not like what the fuck is that right?

1259
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:37,190
So eight inches long.

1260
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:40,850
And then maybe like where your finger,

1261
01:25:40,851 --> 01:25:44,090
like your fingers don't quite touch
when you hold it. You know, like mine,

1262
01:25:44,091 --> 01:25:46,760
I can go like this and
like I'm looking type,

1263
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,620
put fingers around it like
four times. And then, you know,

1264
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,430
if somebody were to like walking on me
I could just put like three fingers down

1265
01:25:55,431 --> 01:25:56,570
and cover it.
You know,

1266
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,340
what color would be an ideal penis color?

1267
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,840
I think like a deep purple would
probably be the ideal color you see it

1268
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:08,270
sometimes depending your blood situation.

1269
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,750
But I think if it was like just deep,

1270
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:15,740
deep purple from from base to head all
the time, that'd be an ideal color.

1271
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,840
What, how does that happen? Is
that one, it's just follow blood

1272
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,890
I think. Yeah. I mean, and then what's
going on with your veins and yeah. Yeah.

1273
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:25,530
And then what about balls? Balls? I mean,

1274
01:26:25,531 --> 01:26:29,730
ideally you want probably pound
and a half, two pounds each.

1275
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:34,680
Um, you know, cause nice, big
balls are exciting to women.

1276
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,660
And what about hair? Oh, heroin. So
of course, careless naturally. Yeah,

1277
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,160
I'm sure even that thing up all the time.

1278
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:47,240
And I know it's such a hassle to shave
pubic hair. I hate it. I'm so over it.

1279
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,420
I really wouldn't, I wouldn't mind
removing it all. Yeah, I know. Me Too.

1280
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,820
That'll be kind of neat.
Yeah.

1281
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:59,480
Huh. Interesting. Why don't you guys
come at you? What's your ideal one?

1282
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:04,400
Yours is my ideal. Where we go.
That's the loving answer course.

1283
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:08,840
Of course. Of course. No, no, yours
is perfect. I really don't. I think,

1284
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,990
oh my God, it's not an
objective thing. It's the person

1285
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:16,890
this made me laugh so hard is
the, yeah, it's here. So, um,

1286
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,420
we had this, you know, with the
last few weeks we played the,

1287
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:24,910
the woman lifting weights and screaming.
Yeah.

1288
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:29,430
And then we had the woman
getting the Tattoo and
screaming. Yeah. And now we have,

1289
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,353
um,

1290
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:35,380
armrest,
these,

1291
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,680
an armrest sometimes

1292
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,440
guys laughing.

1293
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:06,170
Wow. Dude, I can't even
wrap it. You hear him?

1294
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,380
He was like, Hey, you're
a rapper. She's so weird.

1295
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,083
Put your hands here.

1296
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:18,100
Wow. What a weird Baird. Yeah.

1297
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,250
Do you think she does that to psych out
the opponent or, I'm sure it's natural.

1298
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:25,710
It's her thing, you know? Yeah, it works

1299
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:26,540
okay.

1300
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,700
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It definitely works.

1301
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:46,700
So,

1302
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,410
so good. That's the thing I'm looking
for. Labeled everything again.

1303
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,480
Another one called everything.
Okay. So this is a man.

1304
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:57,770
This made me so happy. Um,
blue band put together.

1305
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,490
Wait, is this it? This is it.

1306
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:04,973
I hope so.

1307
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
[inaudible]

1308
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:32,660
what? Masterful work. So
good to arm wrestlers,

1309
01:29:32,661 --> 01:29:35,990
the weight lifter and lady getting the
Tattoo screaming all at the same time.

1310
01:29:35,991 --> 01:29:37,070
It's good shit.
Yeah.

1311
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:50,450
Which one's your favorite? Um,
ah, it's so hard. This is Libby.

1312
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:54,380
I hate and love at the same
thing. The taxi waiting. Uh,

1313
01:29:55,480 --> 01:30:00,200
she's like, yeah, I know. Allen's
great. Her face is so ridiculous.

1314
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:04,460
I liked the old lady in the corner. Yeah,
the weightlifting. Now it's all good, man.

1315
01:30:04,461 --> 01:30:07,490
You can't, you can't really go
wrong with this one. Um, look,

1316
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:10,100
