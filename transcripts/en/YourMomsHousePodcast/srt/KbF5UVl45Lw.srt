00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,560
Each other in the shower.

19
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,360
Don't bring in one. Loving to this rope.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,050

22
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,150
Lot of people,

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,720
a lot,

24
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,510
lot of people weigh in on the
personality of Apple. It's not,

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,350
it's not really a battle when we know
that if there's one clear winner,

26
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,940
obviously, oh my God, I bet
you overwhelmingly people
voted for me. Uh, yeah,

27
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:35,990
that's not how it went,
but my mom comes up,

28
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,160
thumbs up. Good. That's
what my mother used to say.

29
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,960
That comes out good for
you. Made no sense. Uh,

30
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,270
that'd be embarrassing. Right. It was
always embarrassing. So embarrassing.

31
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,010
You know, I was realizing I
was out. I took the dogs out.
Yeah. I realize, you know,

32
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:57,690
I'm your mom and the fucking
stands that plays. Yeah.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,110
I realized that I have
entire speech memorized in my
head. Do you know that word?

34
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,150
Personal verbatim. Why? Why did you just
think, what? Did you rehearse it? No,

35
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,570
when you were laying the dogs out,
they do think about the, the speech.

36
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,630
It just in my a moment off the glasses.

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,890
I can't even look at you serious
personality, but stop it. Uh,

38
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,971
for a moment.

39
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,270
I was just was thinking about it because
if you have the playoffs are going on

40
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,800
right now. Yeah. I was thinking
about football and I was like, um,

41
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,280
his speech. Yeah. I used
to be so obsessed with it.

42
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,720
Did I have it memorized? Coach ice?
Yeah, I see e you want to hear it?

43
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,540
Not e y e s is Dom Zap.
Good.

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,250
40 here's a, this is, I think
this is a verbatim. Okay,

45
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,050
let's do it as personal. Personal
right here, man. You and my house,

46
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,040
my face disrespecting me.
I got no,

47
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,900
not doing it with feeling. Oh No.
I'm telling you I have it memorized,

48
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,980
but do it with feeling. I don't
want to now you're ruining the fun,

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,990
but that, but that's because you're not
having fun because you're not averse.

50
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,230
Now any champion a personality champ
would do it with feeling. Now I don't,

51
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,500
I don't want to perform it and saying,
okay, well then do it from memory.

52
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,940
You're in my house.

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,070
It got the remote control
and your personality ruins
moments of of a good time.

54
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,270
I was actually like really wanting to
do something and then your personality

55
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,830
entered.
You still can do it,

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,950
but like you see how you put
like the brakes on the phone,

57
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,600
but I tried to make it more funner. It's
good grammar. Just do it. I'm sorry.

58
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do it

66
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:56,840

same shit you got on and said fuck you.

69
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,460
Wow. That's the whole speech. Wow. I
mean that's from like seven years ago.

70
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,620
Oh Wow. I don't listen to it
regularly. No. In my head.

71
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,650
Do you think that you have a photogenic
memory? I think so. Thank you.

72
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,930
Saying your ag. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's
a healthy thing. It's a good thing.

73
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:27,931
And when you memorize important stuff
like the coach I speech versus like Martin

74
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,990
Luther King's speech, I know I could
have memorized that. Yeah, you are.

75

Anything else or this chick speech

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,660
I hate when you get mad at me.
Are you over it now? I'm not even.

77
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,930
There's nothing to be over. It just
makes me so upset when you get mad at me.

78
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,040
Not Mad at you. You're so angry. Cause
your personality so sour all the time.

79
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,410
Okay. Hold on. If I, if I nail
this. You did. I feel it down.

80
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,433
Correct

81
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,930
based my house this than me.
I've got to do something about it.

82
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,050
My family right there. Whoa.
I got to protect my mom.

83
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,180
My mom was sitting in the
stands. Man, your person wait.

84
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,583
There it is.

85
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,760
Remote control have exactly what they did.

86
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,390
The remote control
the TV.

87
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,280
Fuck
you.

88
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,980
That's pretty close. You know, I never
ever missed a fuck or an extra here.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,110
I think it was very good.

90
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,590
I think you got it very either
have the beginning of it. Yeah,

91
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,110
they, that it was edited where they
didn't have the beginning of it.

92
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,140
That's why it's so,

93
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,160
no,
I don't understand.

94
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,820
When he says wearing the same
shit you got on and said Fuck you,

95
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,410
what does that have to do with anything?

96
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,040
He's implying that they put on
pads in a uniform like you did.

97
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,260
Oh,
you know,

98
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:04,280
this whole time I just thought it meant
like that guy shops at the same place

99
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,580
you do fuck him. Like it just
like he was style psyching me.

100
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,770
Like you went to the Grammy's
or whatever in the same outfit,

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,130
put on what you put on shoulder, show up,
all that stuff. Yeah. And then they said,

102
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:17,520
fuck you. What are you going
to do about it? Interesting.

103
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,230
It's probably the greatest pregame speech
I've ever heard in my life. Yeah. Yeah.

104
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,060
My coach never said Shit like that.

105
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,920
One time my coach told us a story
about these neighborhood boys. Yeah.

106
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,830
That were fucking with his,
one of his brothers.

107
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,710
And that his dad told my coach at
the time, who was a, a young man,

108
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,701
that they,

109
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,250
that him and his brother should go
over there and kicked the kid's ass.

110
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,880
That was his pregame speech.
He got real emotion. And then,

111
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,850
so that was to motivate you to go
kick their ass, the other teams? Yeah,

112
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,380
it was, um, but I'd never seen them get so
emotional. It was interesting. I really,

113
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,010
really liked it, but I would
have liked this much more.
Yeah. Yeah. I would have to,

114
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,530
I prefer Cochise is my coach.
I mean,

115
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,800
if I was 15 or 16 and
I heard that speech a,

116
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:09,801
I'm either hysterically
laughing and biting my own
tongue to not get murdered by

117
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:14,280
him. Yeah. Or I'm so scared
shitless of him that, you know,

118
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,533
we're ready to go out there.

119
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,040
See, I think you and I grew up a vastly
different in that I heard inappropriate

120
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,980
things yelled constantly so that,
that was my norm.

121
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,300
Yeah.
Um,

122
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,540
I don't know. I don't, I remember
one time Diante the, I had the,

123
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,300
the driving instructor, Mr
Cou, I shouldn't say his name.

124
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,450
He was actually the PE teacher and he
taught his driver's Ed and he would tell

125
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:39,920
us about the bikers and the
street. Yeah. These, uh,

126
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,570
faggots on their bicycles were
in their faggy bike shorts.

127
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,720
You don't want to fucking hit
these guys cause then you get sued.

128
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,530
Mr [inaudible] laugh or
no, no, cause back. No,

129
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,210
my friend Shauna and I did cause we were
like that's a rad and this guy when we

130
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,100
laugh or like, yeah, no Sean,

131
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,130
I are both like this guy's the best.
I'm going to come every weekend.

132
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:03,070
Cause it was like the funniest thing
here. A Guy Freak, Alec that you know, um,

133
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,330
no one else. No, I think there's a,
it was all girls school you went to.

134
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,090
So it was all girls in the class
and there weren't like fun.

135
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,560
They don't have the personalities that
I have the personality and I have this

136
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:17,800
girl's got personnel. It's
something she's got neat, uh,

137
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,380
tats till. Yeah. So she
did this on Facebook.

138
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,900
Um, that's, this is what it comes.
She calls it a come run, which is uh,

139
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,603
you know,

140
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,350
basically running to the bathroom after
sex after I got Jesus in you. Yeah,

141
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,270
I've done that before.
Did you always call it a come run?

142
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,350
Never had had a name for it.
Well the common wrong,

143
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,440
unless you used a condom and let's face it

144
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,980
then you get to experience the km run
past to be the biggest sexual struggle.

145
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,260
Wow. What is it? No one talks about it.

146
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,530
Like this is the big dilemma of,

147
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,850
of our era of this age of living and
come run and no one talks about it cause

148
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:10,100
it's not that big of a deal. I Dunno. I
Dunno also who the fuck? Where's condoms?

149
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,210
Oh No, I think it's more
the alias queers. Um,

150
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:19,980
a few people where he talks about
the camera and is your sister Maria?

151
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,280
Yeah,

152
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,280
I remember one time just like Jeff and
od come pouring out of me for like days.

153
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,330
She always has talked like that and
has always been so descriptive and it's

154
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,420
always upsetting.

155
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,030
Cause like I know when I got pregnant
because like Jeff and I had sex like four

156
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,330
days before I've deleted and then like
the Campbell's dripping out. Oh my God,

157
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,230
you guys are so disgusting.

158
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,930
It's really foul and I wish you
didn't talk like that. I mean, yeah,

159
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:53,820
the camera is not fun, but it's
not the biggest sexual, oh my God.

160
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:58,620
Seriously. I honestly, and I don't have
it so I don't know, but I feel like,

161
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:03,621
but sex would be the the most
embarrassing slash well let's,

162
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:07,470
why don't we dive a little deeper into
this topic that's being ignored by the

163
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,304
masses,

164
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,510
I suppose. That fucking tissue. Yeah.

165
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,600
What the fuck is that going to to
a tissue and fucking stick tonight.

166
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,400
It's going to help me for my shy pepper.
Masha Masha,

167
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,120
she sold down there. I mean they're
Downton Abbey cast wipe up their come.

168
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,690
They never, they never did, but she's
right. They never explored that.

169
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:40,290
It's like this big elephant in the
room that no one's talking about.

170
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,650
We come run down now.
Be have been a perfect series.

171
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,830
There's calm all over my legs right now.

172
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,720
Which sort of limit lady.

173
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,890
My lady allow me to lap it up.

174
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,260
Carson was a com lapper cheers.
Run right into my mouth.

175
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,380
Carson would do that for the
family. Yeah. He loved lady.

176
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,180
Is that come dripping from Carson?

177
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,830
Uh Oh. Where did that go? Why did that,

178
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,060
anyway,
I have mastered the comradery,

179
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,080
but this is what I
personally do is coming over.

180
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:27,060
So you need to prep the room for two
towels next to easy access. One for you.

181
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,570
One for the bed. Yeah. Designing.
No fucking white patch.

182
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,020
Smart. So far so good. I'm also
a big tower fan. Yeah, I know.

183
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,510
I like towels. You don't like him?
No, you're the first gentleman.

184
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,400
Well let's be real. I so many
guys talk about, no, let's,

185
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,120
let's be real.
It wasn't always a towel with you.

186
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,580
It was shirts for awhile.
Socks.

187
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,780
He got a stiff Dick.
You'd like handmade.

188
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,970
You hand me like wet,
like not wet white tee shirts and stuff.

189
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:05,500
And I'm like David towl Tom. Yeah.
And then I think I got into towels.

190
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,880
Oh man, I got towels. I like
towels. I liked how it was too.

191
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,650
But then you're saying I evolved into
towels. It didn't start at towels.

192
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,513
That's fair.

193
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,700
Between the legs, legs crossed. Oh,

194
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,190
never got sort of hot and
wobble to the bathroom.

195
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,940
[inaudible]

196
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,460
do you set on that toilet for

197
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,563
interesting.

198
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,040
This chick's asking all the important
question she saying how long do you wait

199
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,980
for that just spill out?
Well,

200
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,450
I mean as long as it takes well
but, but no, but think about it.

201
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,830
When do you say that's it?
You give a good push,

202
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,340
you know, push and then after
that, you know, so that it's
a legit question though.

203
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,090
Yeah.

204
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,090
Cause you could sit there and then maybe
a few minutes later a little more falls

205
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:08,910
out. Yeah, I get that ges out. Yeah.

206
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm so glad she shared this on Facebook
and on the internets and a lot of family

207
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,360
members of hers probably up Facebook too.
This is a good thing to have

208
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,430
you fucking hear. So would you sat by
you scraped? What? You can wait, wait,

209
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,140
come still coming out. Oh my God. Master
vaccines. What the fuck did she just say?

210
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,880
Nine Times out of 10,
nine times

211
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,980
five scraped what you can out.
I'm still coming out. Yeah,

212
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,250
we scraped, but you can stand up. Come
still coming out of you. Sure, sure.

213
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,450
It's nice. Maybe. Maybe granny saw this
video. That'd be nice for her to see too.

214
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:47,820
Right?

215
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,860
How far are you scraped? What
you can out? I'm still out. Yeah,

216
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,830
come so come here.
Yeah, I, she's scraping.

217
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,120
I wouldn't scrape my badge for that.
Geeze,

218
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,030
you're little that come stay up
there though. You know, I don't know.

219
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,780
Oh,

220
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,470
dude's sound like they're shitting,

221
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,990
uh,

222
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,980
of then go get in the shower because
there is no lie. I'm with him.

223
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,730
Come inside and they call me [inaudible].
Yeah. What, what's she talking about?

224
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:27,450
Going to the bathrooms.

225
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,700
Look at the next thing I'm
doing is getting in the
shower cause I'm not going to

226
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:33,000
get back in bed with calm. All
these come inside of me. Yeah. Okay.

227
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,560
So she was a nice shower fan.

228
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,130
Yeah. Back in the bedroom that
coming in, get your likes open.

229
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,330
Don't really want to fuck you and
you father. He's not let that bad.

230
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,640
You ain't going to
change yourself yet mate.

231
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,000
And I'm know I'll come
multiple times over that penis.

232
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,800
Hm.
Interesting point.

233
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,450
So what she's saying is she gets out of
the bathroom back into bed with some of

234
00:15:56,451 --> 00:16:00,470
these dudes. They're like, listen, let's
give it another go. And she's like,

235
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:04,280
you're still, you're still
nasty. You have a clean up. I've,

236
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,640
I've come on you. Why don't you clean up?
I'm cleaning up. Why don't you clean up?

237
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,460
Sure. You know, equal
rights, equal rights.

238
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,420
I respect the lady for
making that very valid point.

239
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,900
And I also know you're a batter.
Dip Your fucking Dick back inside me.

240
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,890
Am I still got remains?

241
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,700
If you're calm and then expect
me to fucking suck it off my,

242
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,450
so I'll just finish up. Let me do
to come run. Let me have a shower.

243
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,950
You jump in the shower. Fuck me in the
shower. Cleaning each other in the shower.

244
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,043
Done.

245
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,010
Wow. This chick's got it all figured
out. Yeah, I really, I really like her.

246
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,110
I admire her too. I like the, uh,

247
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,420
amount of energy and the
thought she's put into this,

248
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,170
the time it takes to make a video.
Also the,

249
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I realize that within this video she
brought up an issue and it came to a

250
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:53,280
resolution. Interesting. She solved
the dilemma. She offered a solution,

251
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:57,600
a constructive solution. Just guts. Go to
the shower then we can do it all there.

252
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,010
When I met around when you saw him,
did you do to come on.

253
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,810
It never seems to get any less.

254
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,880
It is a sense of fucking embarrassment.

255
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Comey fuck him a about with a fucking
towel would turn your legs in fucking Paul

256
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:14,790
move. You started. Where did I put it?

257
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,630
The fucking copy up there
should definitely just fucking
swallow the con instead.

258
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,050
Another good.
Oh,

259
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:26,370
there's an interesting resolution to the
problem and see how she said to her it

260
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:31,110
would be a practical solution to
swallow the km. The km run. Yeah.

261
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,020
Just put it in there. Yeah. And then, uh,

262
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,610
wouldn't that be a treat
for, you know, I don't,

263
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,020
I think I'd rather, and she's not doing
it to the cloud run leisure. Yeah.

264
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,290
That's the best part is it?
She's like, look, the easiest
thing is just right here.

265
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,170
I just swallow it. Yeah. Then one of
to clean up, then guys were like, oh,

266
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,130
this makes a lot of sense.

267
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,020
Yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't think about that.

268
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,880
She really hates to come run that
much. Well, I'm sure the camera,

269
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:00,660
I don't know about. I mean personally,
not that big of a deal to me,

270
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,280
but to some people that's a big deal.
How often are you getting comed in?

271
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,850
Maybe that's her. That's a big thing
for her. What if she's, I mean,

272
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,250
she doesn't seem like she doesn't
do it a lot. Right. Right.

273
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,640
And how many different dudes? We don't
know. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. No condoms too.

274
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,700
She's in that no condom life. She's
like, who does that? A condom.

275
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,430
In other words,
one big fucking bowl like that.

276
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:27,660
We all have to go and don't fucking
wanted a bowling ball. A curve ball.

277
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,190
One big fucking boat. Egg.
Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,240
Wow. Classy girl. I liked her.
I really like her. Um, yeah,

279
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,290
she's called a Chav. Right?
Is that a Chav? I don't know.

280
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,890
I'm not sure in England.
Um,

281
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,700
speaking of British slang,

282
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,800
there's a guy,

283
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,360
a Brit who teaches you how to speak
like a roadman is the video up?

284
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,290
We got it sent.
That's a roadman heroes.

285
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,290
Gonna go check in on those with Amanda.
That was bad.

286
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,280
Jokes bled Aircrafts are say farm.
The Bay farm.

287
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,430
You're ate my chicken nuggets in it.
You so bait fab.

288
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,503
You might might say

289
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,000
hello everyone does this belly today
I'm going to talk about roadman.

290
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,380
Dallet was in London.

291
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,270
They're going to talk about London
street slang words or so called roadman

292
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:27,930
darling. It was, I liked London
street slang. Yeah. And he has,

293
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,920
he's English as a second language even
though he speaks fluent English. Right.

294
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,460
Cause there's a, you can tell that his
accent is there, but he's also, you know,

295
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,040
he's trying to become a master
of accidents, which is rad. Yeah.

296
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,430
So he's teaching people, um, Road Rodman.

297
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,200
Is that like cab drivers roadmap? I
don't know. The knowledge, knowledge,

298
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,670
knowledge isn't that way.
What's, what's the the car,

299
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,140
what does it Cockney what is it? The Co,
yeah, that's when they're real low class.

300
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,300
He taught? Is that what
Roadman is now? He said,

301
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,030
well it's London street
and that's called roadmap.

302
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I'm assuming the road man being like
a Cabbie or something made me just,

303
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,630
all right. English people. Collar Guy,
right in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

304
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,250
Learned his reasoning is the first one
is mandarin man's London means mate my

305
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,000
and it usually means male friend.

306
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,710
Manda Mandarin sometimes means I
grew up off friends as well. Jesus.

307
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:24,010
Well then this is, it reminds me of
that girl who was like a Coca Cola.

308
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,900
Remember that? The you don't
remember that are cocky kind of,

309
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,600
I remember that. Yeah, I did. Yeah,

310
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,100
like a gimme.
I want a cock.

311
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,240
It was a Korean lady I think,
and she was teaching people,

312
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,270
uh, friends, English. Mike. Mike,

313
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,370
yeah. That was the, we played it long

314
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,270
time ago.
But it's so crazy.

315
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,140
This is the same language.
Skim it.

316
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,200
Yes. We do have car and
this guy, so Amanda,

317
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,530
I'd never knew this shit.
Here I am, you know,

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,630
teaching people how to learn
different dialects. People hire me.

319
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,730
They hear that.
I do that.

320
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:32,300
When they reach out and they say
consultant for accents and you know,

321
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,070
a lot of CEOS have been contacting
all kinds of people, athletes,

322
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,100
actors, um, artists, all kinds of

323
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,790
people in government,
senators, congressmen, yeah.

324
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,730
You know that the incoming
administration reached out. They said,

325
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:51,310
well how are we supposed to do this
without your help? I'm already no

326
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,900
man data. When someone says like, oh,
Munda this person is calling a friend.

327
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,470
Or Amanda can also use the
word pled or farm boy blood.

328
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,990
We know that we know blood
and Fam. Fun, fun, fun,

329
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,580
awesome. On my blood. What
happened in that much black?

330
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,020
Jeez, that took so long because
these chairs are not conducive.

331
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:26,480
Why don't you treat me like that?
Really?

332
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,130
So you're going to say that
you're the one blood thumb.

333
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,230
You've been treating me like
I'm a 10 year old boy, but

334
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,300
you treat me like I'm a 10
year old boy the other day.

335
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,970
The other day you don't treat
me like a wife is what I mean?

336
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:47,270
Like what would a woman who
you're sexually attracted
to you treat me like a 10

337
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:49,490
year old boy the other
day. You Go, let me,

338
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,480
let me check your di Di is it brown in
there and then you pulled my underwear

339
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:56,460
and then you went to sniff my,
but like we do with Ellis. Yeah.

340
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,660
You fart in front of me.
Constant. That was affectionate.

341
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,140
You don't think of me like as a woman,
you think of me,

342
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:07,140
you treat me like a 10 year old boy.
You call me my boobies.

343
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:11,610
Mushy purples and saugers and sloppers.
Hold on,

344
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:15,150
I made a list of things that
you do that um, indicate that.

345
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,610
Oh you go, you go, oh you have
chocolate down there. Cause I saw your,

346
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,030
I saw your bare butt cheeks and I thought
you had some chocolate that you smear

347
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:28,950
it on there. Yeah. But most husbands
don't treat their wives like boys.

348
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,520
They certainly don't ask to sniff their
diaper and they don't tell them they

349
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:36,360
have chocolate on their butt holes and
stuff. Well I sniffed your diaper. Yeah.

350
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:40,020
As a form of affection.
But also if it was full,

351
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:43,440
I was going to help you change
your diaper. Oh my God. Oh my God.

352
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,510
And there's a lot of demeaning
staff were like side meet Mommy.

353
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:52,250
Remember when he said that? I'll see
how you laugh already at that one.

354
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,220
Remember side meet Mommy. I was laying,
I was laying in bed with you. Yeah.

355
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,260
And I put my arm around. We were
spooning. I was the little spoon. Oh,

356
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,650
here you are. And then I pretended I was
you. And I went, I'm side meet Mommy.

357
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,360
And I left. It was just so not
all you did. You grabbed my,

358
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,060
my stomach meet as you said it.
You squish it and then you go,

359
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:18,560
I'm citing me mommy. That's the
real game. That was years ago.

360
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,810
I know. That's the first to know.
What's funny is that, you know,

361
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,050
cause we called them hangers and sloppers
and bushy purples and everything.

362
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,850
One of my buddies goes, uh, he goes,
oh I was, he was with his girlfriend,

363
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,200
his girlfriend for years. And he goes,
you know, I liked this big sloppers.

364
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,270
And she goes, what did you just
say? I liked those lockers.

365
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,410
And she goes, what does that, he goes,
oh, it's just something that, um,

366
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,310
that I heard on a podcast.
And she goes,

367
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't like that and I don't want you to
say that to me ever again. And he goes,

368
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:57,260
okay,
let's see.

369
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,900
That's the appropriate response
for something like that.

370
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:03,860
And that's what I should have said to
you 10 years ago when you started on this

371
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:07,550
kick with side me,
mommy and sniffing my diaper.

372
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,590
The thing is I didn't have the self
respect or the self confidence to do that

373
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
and you know,
really.

374
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:17,450
So you think it was a matter of self
confidence and that I was raised by a

375
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:21,830
single father who had treated a lack
of respect. Really? Yeah. If I, if I,

376
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:25,620
if I were more of a woman,
like a womanly woman,

377
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,880
the fact is I was raised by my single
father and half by my mom and my dad

378
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,640
treated me like a 10 year old boy.

379
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,300
So I think in some ways it's
familiar and it's funny to me.

380
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,390
What are you saying you
really want it to change? No,

381
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm just pointing out the obvious.
I mean I love you.

382
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,220
I've been with you for 12 years
for a reason cause it fits. It's a,

383
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,040
it's like a hand in glove at this point,
you know?

384
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,580
No I just noticed it cause cause you
told me that story and I was like yeah

385
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,810
there's no woman, not a lot of women
which always every other week now you go,

386
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,600
you realize no other woman can be
with you. And I'm like wait what?

387
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,590
And you're like no woman would tolerate,
tolerate you pulling their underwear,

388
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,260
sniff your diaper or led on
your butt hall and stuff.

389
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,690
Maybe your farts and
you know you fart a lot

390
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,230
cause I was raised like a 10
year old boy. All right, look,

391
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,720
let's take a look out on
example sentence example.

392
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,530
I'm going to get some those
chicken with my friend. Loved man.

393
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,400
Wait a minute. Yeah. Cheeky man.

394
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,170
Why is Nando's cheeky going to go to
chicken out of your mind them God get a

395
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:34,520
cheeky Nando's.
What the

396
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,780
fuck? Ah Man. Usually me snot
cupboard, right, right. Bunching.

397
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,830
Roadman dialect.

398
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,390
Bad Means Berry or a lot didn't
know that bear means very or a lot

399
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,723
there.

400
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,230
You have bear mushy saugers
paint a lot of them.

401
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,720
You've got 10 times the amount
of tickets most people have.

402
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,020
See if I were a woman, if I acted
like a girl, but how it bothered me.

403
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,860
Didn't those numbers handy
lately? Yeah. Actually,

404
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,210
thank you for bringing that up
because I went to get a Mammogram,

405
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,620
which you should obviously at 40. They
tell you to go to it saying we should, uh,

406
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,070
highly recommend go do it. It's
not that big of a deal, man.

407
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,110
Get your prostate exam.
Yeah. It's not a big deal,

408
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,220
but I was thankful for my mushy,

409
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,990
mushy purples because they
squish them in like a vice,

410
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:35,410
like a glass of ice to, you know,
Lou, whatever, x ray them and my,

411
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,420
my tits before I had a kid. It would
have been very sensitive and painful,

412
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,350
but the blessing in the skies is that
they're all deflated. A mushy. Yeah.

413
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,370
It didn't even hurt. I didn't even
feel it really. It was great. Yeah.

414
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,750
So it's a good thing that I had these
big mushy purples now. Yeah. Yeah. Mushy,

415
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,390
mushy, mushy. He says
mushy. I say mushy. Mushy.

416
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,993
Mushy.

417
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,310
Mushy. Purple Bear. Also
when something is very funny,

418
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,200
people sometimes say bad jokes for
example. And that was very funny mate.

419
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,400
That was bad jokes that,
oh my gosh, I like his, um,

420
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,330
when he changes to a roadman. Yeah,
I like that. He wears Adidas gear.

421
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:26,280
I'm a huge fan of this jacket. Like
he froze his, that was bad jokes.

422
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:29,930
Blood. That was bad jokes. I oh,

423
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,150
fucking jokes.
But the led Kreps means trainers,

424
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,600
her interested in cold trainers.
So you would need a person here,

425
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,500
this blood from rosemand. Yeah, we
don't say trainers here now. Trainers.

426
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,910
Totally English. English show. If you said
like, I'm trying to get some trainers.

427
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:52,720
Everyone talking about, you
mean running shoes? Homo? Yeah.

428
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,160
Fucking silly. Willy. Did we
even say sneakers? That's real.

429
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:04,730
Like that's real middle America.
Say sneakers. Yeah. Sneak sneaks.

430
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,450
Kicks. Kicks. Yeah. I say running
shoes. That feels real foreign.

431
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:13,320
Cause my parents called them
running shoes. What do I say? Yeah,

432
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,690
you say kicks. Yeah, I do. I'll
say sneakers, sometimes. Sneaks.

433
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,020
Yeah. Or I'll just say,
I'll say brand name.

434
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,520
You know your Puma's. Yeah, I do this.

435
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,680
Yeah. Euros, Love Adidas and
Puma. I do too. I love that shit.

436
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,900
I love it.
Did you see those pumas more?

437
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:38,901
A lot of the Latinos were them upscale
Latin people like when you see like,

438
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:42,010
uh,
if they're over here visiting,

439
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,920
but there of money the
Latinos will all have on Pew.

440
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,450
Like when we used to skin tight,
so snug

441
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,980
key at all.
They,

442
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,840
they're built to just like hug your
foot and not and be nonexistent.

443
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,490
Yes. My mom, by the way, a
few years ago for 'em, I go,

444
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,690
I need some running shoes.
Yeah. Uh, just for working out.

445
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,680
And she got me track shoes,
cleats,

446
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,490
like one for actual tracking,
too foreign. I was like, mom,

447
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,020
I don't train for the Olympics. He's
attract. She's a, you said it on anxiety.

448
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,940
Got To these.
All right.

449
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,750
Do you know what shoes I loved growing
up that I don't even think they make any

450
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:30,720
more. I don't know if they
do. Are Kangaroos? Yeah. They
still make those. Yeah, sure.

451
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,070
Blood thump,
thump does chose off bat.

452
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,190
Yeah. You can get those trainers at
uh, like save on back in the day dude.

453
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:42,990
They were like Kangaroos and the
I like a pocket or they called.

454
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,940
Well anyway I found a pair when I was
visiting Germany like 10 years ago and

455
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,720
they are rad and people hide drugs and
I'm apparently and that cause I had that

456
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:56,150
pocket with the velcro. I was fit for
drugs going around you too much now. Yeah.

457
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,500
11 and Rad slipped and you made
so much fun of me for saying

458
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,280
yeah but that's,
you know,

459
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,200
that's the nature of self studying
with people around it for so long.

460
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,340
I said it the other day and this guy goes
did you just fucking say this is Rad?

461
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,583
Yeah.

462
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,060
And you've been saying
gnarly, which is rad. So you,

463
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:21,480
it's I love gnarly.
Yeah.

464
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,850
Cause you used to make fun of Kat von
d when she would say rad cause she's a

465
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,684
total la girl

466
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,180
and she's like, dude, it's
so rad. And He'd be like, oh

467
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,600
she said that's her

468
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,550
new crops.
This person needs new trainers.

469
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,780
This guy is really helping his native
people though. It was like, this is,

470
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,460
this is how people talk
when they talk like that.

471
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,680
Oh Man. Damn. Craps craps Reps.

472
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,270
Kreps or trainers, Huh? Crabs are,
I don't get the shit all dude.

473
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,620
We know. It's crazy that this is the same
language that we speak, but not really.

474
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:14,490
It's the queen's English.
Fucking

475
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:19,070
a man. I got to open this glass.

476
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,520
Yes.
Just

477
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,100
so go to Moose. That
always means, as you know,

478
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,490
uh, that, uh,

479
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
it's time to go over some live stuff,
but this is real important.

480
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:39,370
I don't want to forget.
Um,

481
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,590
the live podcast, February 12th, uh,

482
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,050
at the Irvine Improv sold out.
Thank you everybody that got his tickets.

483
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,370
It's real exciting.
We decided that it's a month away.

484
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,180
We figured that some people, you
know, just didn't get to it in time.

485
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,610
So we decided to add a second
live podcasts. Yo, 9:00 PM,

a month to get tickets to that one?

488
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,920
Um, it's gonna be a lot of

handle the denim load?

492
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,800
Everyone's going to be shaped because
they're all going to be sitting next to

493
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:30,820
each other and their genes you're
going to rub. It's going to be so fun.

494
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,210

this next door app that you signed

522
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,540

528
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:11,690
Address your mom's
podcasts@gmail.com genes.

529
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,600
Uh, we put it out there last week. Um,

530
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,110
obviously there's a big dispute
between the two of us up who's the real

531
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:19,980
personality change

532
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,160
and people wrote in and uh,
here's what they're saying. Oh,

533
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,573
okay.

534
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,970
Now what people are thinking about this.
Mommy,

535
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:40,230
Tina thinks she is the personality champ.
Just like how she thinks.

536
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,320
She went to a dentist at one time and
the Dolans told her to Dennis lawyer.

537
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:47,460
She had 67 of cavities. Tom Is
the main mommy, the water champ,

538
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:52,020
the weight loss champ. And know that
personality. Champs. Sorry. Tina Dylan.

539
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,760
Thanks Dylan. Next email.
As a professional. Mommy,

540
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:01,620
this is no fucking contest. Hands down
the personality champ is mommy. Tina,

541
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,420
why?
Well,

542
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:08,340
having been to every live podcast and
hanging up before and after the shows with

543
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:13,020
the two mommy, Tina is always excited
and truly happy to see my bear and I,

544
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,250
she goes out of her way to ask us
how we are and gives massive hugs,

545
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,900
which I know she hates what she does it.
Anyway, that's called a warm personality.

546
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,320
Uh,
meanwhile buns gives a head nod,

547
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,210
Woo Hoo and side hugs with a look that
reads. He'd rather be anywhere. But there

548
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,230
now I have more. We have seen the
mommy's separate. Stand up so many times.

549
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:41,580
I can't count mommy. Tina without fail
acknowledges us. Wow. And honestly,

550
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,110
heres how we are. The hugs, oh,
the hugs, pure warmth and love.

551
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,460
Tommy on the hand has never
once recognized us or put him in

552
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,670
any sort of conversation. When we
have talked forced, I might add,

553
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,060
his vibe is one of coldness and boredom.

554
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,250
We almost feel embarrassed for
having put him through the torture.

555
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,300
Now maybe we've caught buns on off days.
Every single time we've seen him.

556
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,163
Who knows?

557
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,880
But there has never been a time when we
didn't feel real love from Mommy, Tina.

558
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,470
That's how you become a personality champ.
People.

559
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,430
Let's see if bonds can change our
minds at the Irvine live podcasts.

560
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,350
My hopes are high,

561
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,190
but only because I know the
true personality channel
delightfully shine like

562
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:33,780
always real mommy forever at Jean's
higher than my eyeballs. Leah, Leah,

563
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,290
I know Leah. Leah d'oeuvres. I have
no last name. Derbs on Instagram.

564
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,730
I like her photos. I like to be
intimate with our fans. Thank you.

565
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,910
Hey Hitler. Let me start by saying
I'm a Puerto Rican male and yes,

566
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:54,400
big Moshi purples and blond hair
definitely do not make my dick soft.

567
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,890
Oh, thanks. But with that
bias being addressed,

568
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:01,850
I must say that Jean has
a way better personality.

569
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,700
You can tell that Tom will be
unbearable for long periods of time.

570
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,160
Time Tom, maybe better at first glance
that it was only because he is around.

571
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:17,080
He is fake around people. Right.
I am also a fake person in public,

572
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,480
so I say this as someone
who can relate to Tom.

573
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,070
Gene on the other hand seems to always
act like herself, no matter where she is.

574
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,540
The difference between the two can be
seen on many podcasts that they have been

575
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,950
on.
So with this being said,

576
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,100
I can only imagine the real times
to grow up being way worser.

577
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,030
Gene has the better personality
and I will bet my life on it.

578
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:41,530
Psi had been a fan of the show since
episode 50. Thank you for all the laughs.

579
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,130
Uh, they always remind me to pull
my jeans high and tight. Tyson,

580
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,650
he does a very thorough assessment.
Yeah,

581
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,780
that guy really put a lot of thought it
up here. I'm sure you're going to read.

582
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:57,310
You don't worries now. Uh, that's, I
don't know where I was coming in from.

583
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,360
Um, gene, the real truth is, Tom is care.

584
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,390
Charismatic and compassionate has never
been a more clearly composed dialogue

585
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:09,580
from an individual, was such
talent. He has friends everywhere.

586
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,510
Every individual I talked to you about
it agrees men want to be him and women

587
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,540
went to be with him. Oh Wow.
Christina has a personality dud.

588
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,030
A really sweet person,

589
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,500
but not someone you'd want to start a
conversation with that I think people

590
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:24,334
would definitely want.

591
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,650
I think people would definitely want to
interact with her if it had the chance

592
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,990
to see Tom probably from a distance.

593
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,900
Tom is obviously the
personality and water champion.

594
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,720
Christopher so funny about these.
Um,

595
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,980
these emails is that they're serious.
That's the part.

596
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,550
They're really actually,

597
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,900
because you know how other things are
like toms water champ because of the,

598
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,590
you know, the arcade. It's nonsensical,

599
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:58,090
but people are really taking
this to heart. This debate,
this nonsensical to me.

600
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:01,750
So great. Hey, a was one more
here. Hey genes. Clearly,

601
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,810
purple genes gets overwhelmed
by your water champion status.

602
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,770
She feels the need to challenge the fact
you are also the personality champion.

603
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,200
Her voice cracks face gets red and
her mannerisms present. Clear anxiety.

604
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,110
I mean, come on. When
you drink so much water,

605
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:20,800
you feel so much better and therefore
ra better person to be around that many

606
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:25,210
factors as to why the the undisputed
personality champ. It's okay though.

607
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,960
Let Purple Jeans. No, she's
married to a great role model.

608
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,960
Half the battle is knowing
the path to take. Thank God,

609
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:35,630
after your efforts to lose so much weight
and become the weight loss champion,

610
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,440
she has no choice to be filled with
motivation and become a better person all

611
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:43,430
around. Thank you. Stay
safe. Mom is best. A sincere,

612
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,350
my face does not turn red.
This is my face. Turn red.

613
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,310
I think when you're faced with
the reality of your personality,

614
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,060
this is my face. Turn red. I
wouldn't know. I don't see myself.

615
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,050
You see me all the time.
I don't see color.

616
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,010
I don't even know when a black person
walks in there. Well that's true.

617
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:07,450
You don't see colors. You're colorblind
in. Yeah. It's a personality flaw. Yeah.

618
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,280
It's total personality flaw.
Um, how people are really
weighing in on this. Yeah.

619
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,200
I mean,
I don't know if serious debate.

620
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,100
It seems like it's settled that I am
the winter, but you know, we'll see.

621
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,520
We'll see. Time will tell. So Ali, uh,

622
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,060
who used to use his real life, I
don't even remember, starts with an m,

623
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:31,390
then became all these hymns are right
and now he's all the z's or Zinzer and

624
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,850
he's producing some really great, great
songs for us. Um, you know, if you,

625
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:40,520
if you're familiar with the show,
you go back through the catalog,

626
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:43,970
especially in within the last,
I would say 50 episodes.

627
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:48,620
He's really hit some home runs.
He created a mix,

628
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,850
a song that's a,

629
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:54,440
a remix where he used king ass
rappers farts to make a song.

630
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,640
I have always a big fan of
these farts actually made to,

631
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,850
that is the bread and gosh, the bread
and butter over. Yeah. So let's see here.

632
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,560
I haven't really had a chance to hear it,
so let's hear. Let's hear it for sure.

633
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,670
Thank you Ali. [inaudible]
for the fart master. Um,

634
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,220
let's see how he titled it.
Fart sounds only the mommy mix.

635
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,550
Here we go.
He always has a nice build up to this.

636
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,480
Yeah.
Was exciting.

637
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,733
Quiet

638
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,993
parts too.

639
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,243
Wow.

640
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,983
Very talented.

641
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,970
I mean,
I feel like two of the

642
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:49,210
wow to come from the show.
Thank you. Obviously King
asked Trevor, discovering him,

643
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,010
but then Ali together, that's
magic right there. It is.

644
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,400
And what I just imagine
putting it together and studios
and to all those farmers

645
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,280
are farming.

646
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,220
You have to think of the
Fart as an instrument at that
point and be like, where?

647
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,300
What pitch is that hitting could make?

648
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,790
And his girlfriend walking in and
being like, what are you working on?

649
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,010
And he's like, ah, I
gotta finish this song.

650
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,670
So
I was doing this one.

651
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:26,530
So let's say that dogs are getting hungry.
Oh he wrote an email and he did.

652
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:29,320
I think I did. I did myself
with this one. Agreed.

653
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,700
I made an entire song only using
fart sounds. All of that was far too.

654
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,910
Everything from the drums to
the melody is 100% sports.

655
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:41,350
Then I think you guys will be proud.

656
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:43,750
I've came a long way in
the first couple of beats.

657
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,160
I think I might have changed the
game forever. I think you'd love you.

658
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:51,350
Mommy's all these e's are
Zim Zur. Yeah. You really,

659
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,150
I didn't realize that was all either.
That's what I was asking.

660
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:59,610
Like the beats and all farts.
Talent.

661
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,910
What a talent. Yeah, time.
Well spent. Thank you.

662
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:09,490
That's a really impressive
man. Really, really something.

663
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,720
It's like that is that ob one
who pieced together Theo's jam.

664
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,400
Hundreds bought and he pieced together
all the time. Steel was on the show.

665
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,290
That's right and made a rap
out of it. That was just
wild. You remember last week,

666
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,740
right? Do I remember it? Yeah.

667
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,450
I've only been thinking about it all week.

668
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,790
Somebody wrote in a McAfee related story.
Paige jeans.

669
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,250
When I was a 30 year old student in Nyc,

670
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,120
I knew a generous older guy that
had a fancy version of this chair.

671
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:47,350
It had a glass window that could slide
in and out about four inches below the

672
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:48,150
seat.

673
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,300
He used to lay on his back and watch me
push out steaming turds onto the glass

674
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,210
for 250 bucks a session. Hold
on. Hey Man, who come around,

675
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,360
sit down and dump. Once the
dump was done, I would get up,

676
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,390
dress and leave and he
would play with the deposit.

677
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,633
Now I know.

678
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,420
Now I know a story of somebody on a
reality show that I was friends with

679
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:17,470
acquaintances with.

680
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,160
I remember you told me this story that
he would go to this man's house and the

681
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:25,600
man would leave a plot,
a brown paper sack on the counter,

682
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,620
and this person would have to shit into
the sack and then leave it and there was

683
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:32,310
money on the counter.
Wow. That's really, yeah.

684
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,740
$250 is not nothing to sneeze at.
Well,

685
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,600
especially if you're a grad student
or an Undergrad. I would say that's,

686
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:44,290
that's a really good price
for that. I mean, you start
talking about the costs of,

687
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,940
you know, your tuition, your books, your
housing. Imagine if that guy's like,

688
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:51,940
just do it once a week or twice a week.
It'd be 500 bucks a week.

689
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,010
And for some you do for free twice a day.

690
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

691
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,690
Could you imagine a money?

692
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,790
There was a couple that came to a show
that works in the adult entertainment

693
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:07,950
business. Yeah. And, uh,

694
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,370
the girls told me that a guy
made that request one time,

695
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,430
a fan did of her. They do, like
they're, they're a married couple,

696
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:19,270
but they do like online videos and
they sell. So one of the fans was like,

697
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,370
I want you to mail me like a dump, you
know? And she was like, yeah, she's like,

698
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:29,130
I'm not doing that. And he's like, ah, it
would, he, he offered two or $3,000. Wow.

699
00:48:29,131 --> 00:48:32,950
So she said yes, but he, he was
like, but I want you to eat this,

700
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:37,420
this and this specifically. And I go, did
you stick to the Diet? She goes, yeah,

701
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:39,490
absolutely. Because you
know, he seemed to really,

702
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,850
and he's going to know because obviously
he's thought this out enough that he

703
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,610
has requests. So she ate what
he wanted him or what was it?

704
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,970
What was it that she ate? Oh.
Oh, wow. But he, she was like,

705
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:52,660
I ate it for like two days.
She nailed it, send it off.

706
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,350
And how do you mail a dump
though? Uh, I didn't get into it,

707
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,650
but I would imagine pretty, pretty well
sealed. A couple layers of ceiling,

708
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,140
old FedEx. We'll FedEx. You
can't tell them what's in it.

709
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,790
I don't think they'd be happy about
it. I don't think so. Yeah, send it.

710
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:08,650
I guess you'd have to do
regular old fashioned,

711
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,910
I mean you could watch Siki just
you put it in several packages.

712
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,600
Think about it. He put it in
Tupperware. Let's think about this.

713
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,340
He's dumped in your Tupperware tub or the
kind that I have, right? The labs over.

714
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,240
Yeah. Okay. You put that into a,

715
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,020
maybe you put a wrap around that too.
Like Saran wrap or gallon bag.

716
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:32,660
Like a Ziploc gallon bag and you
put that Tupperware wrapped. Yep.

717
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:33,740
Okay.

718
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,670
Uh, in, in a box and you,
you see all that box up,

719
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,840
sit in right in the box,
and then you put that box in a second box.

720
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:45,260
So that will prevent the smell
because it's going to smell very bad.

721
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,350
It's going to smell like someone took a
shit. Yeah. It's not going to be good.

722
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,050
Especially if it's hot.
If it's a summertime mailing,

723
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:57,070
realize that that box
gets to this guy's house.

724
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,440
He opens it and right away.

725
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:02,423
Yeah.

726
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,850
This is fantasy. It's Christmas
for him. Yeah, that's it.
That's all he's ever done.

727
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:15,360
It. It's so crazy. Now,

728
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,490
did you have time this week?
I know you're very busy. Yeah.

729
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,880
Did you have time this week to run
your finger on your crack? Yeah.

730
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:27,783
Yeah.

731
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,540
That was like a question.
I know

732
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,790
that wasn't even a fight. I couldn't tell
him that was what I was bad. It's like

733
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,480
your first always smiling. God
No, you didn't answer my question.

734
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:45,830
I know you had a busy week.
Yeah.

735
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,360
Did you have a moment and your busy day
to run your finger along your crack?

736
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:55,040
Don't put it in your asshole, but just
along the crack to smell your own.

737
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:59,630
Smell your fingers. Yeah. Yeah. I um,

738
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,980
I did and I uh, I feel,
feel much better about it.

739
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,780
Have you learned your own smell?

740
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,210
You know that guy is
so God damn ridiculous.

741
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,760
Stupid.
He's just

742
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,430
smell what? You're not smell like
a different times of the day.

743
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,633
Yeah.

744
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,260
Run your finger along the crack of your
ass. You don't need to finger your whole,

745
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,130
you don't want to come back
with shit on your finger.

746
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,740
Thank you. Yeah, but you want to
snip. You want to sniff it, you know?

747
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,430
Oh burn. What's your ass smells like?
What's your cock and balls smell like?

748
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,370
You got to learn that stuff because people
don't know. We got an email this week.

749
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,120
No,
it's funny because the person is,

750
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,080
is right on board with what we're
talking about. Deer, Mommy's,

751
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:50,081
I believe it was in episode three 67
where both pairs of jeans question whether

752
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:55,811
people got into pup play to relieve
sexual desires or just burn off some steam

753
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:57,261
and a fun,

754
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:01,910
harmless and nonsexual way that that is
something that we highlighted last week.

755
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:06,440
We showed you the TV documentaries.
Like we're just having fun.

756
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:10,650
Just a couple of lads and
the latex. Exactly. Make sure
you give yourself a phone.

757
00:52:10,651 --> 00:52:13,820
Don't have a phone.
Um,

758
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,910
so I have a phone photo.
If you have a moment in the day as well.

759
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,270
If you have a break, go to
a cubicle. All the bathroom

760
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:28,430
if you're not too busy.
I love that.

761
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:31,170
It's like you can fit this into
your schedule. Like a workout. Yeah.

762
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:36,050
Take the stairs instead of the
elevator please. Well he wrote, yeah.

763
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:39,050
What you both a question that
whether it's fun, harmless.

764
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,370
It has to come to my attention.
That pup play is almost 100% sexual.

765
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,360
I've done some digging and boy,
I sure did find a bone.

766
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,290
You will see in exhibit a
filled

767
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,940
and sealed. Um, and then,

768
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:04,040
and then with what is referred to as a
tail in the pop world and the pop world

769
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:09,080
or what sane people call it, butt
plugs. Uh, Andrew, let's see.

770
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:14,560
So
he's 100% right.

771
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,690
Andrew is right. And
uh, this pup play. Oh,

772
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,600
so here is a pop getting
a tail at the vet.

773
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:33,060
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh, vets. The
vets like a normal bed. No,

774
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:36,570
this doesn't look like our vet.
She's, yeah, she's very different.

775
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,513
Oh boy.

776
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,610
So right now the vet who's in a full
laid text, uh, outfit and a mask,

777
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,430
a just put the human pop
on all fours on the table.

778
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:52,400
I also,
for this dog,

779
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:56,020
his examination there appears
to be handcuffs, Lube,

780
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,460
and a butt plug on the table and
a phone and the iPhone. Yeah,

781
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,320
no take taking, pick, steal.

782
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,170
Someone's people know he's
here. It's updates. You don't
want me to use those two?

783
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,930
No, no. We don't need those two
weeks. Yeah. So the pump is a that

784
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:20,170
now that the vet is doing the right thing,
keeping the pup relaxed, right? Yeah.

785
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,830
Okay. Yeah. He doesn't
like the vet either.

786
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,640
You got to keep petting him and be
like, sorry buddy. It's all right. So,

787
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,830
so far it does seem like a
very thorough medical exam

788
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,550
and it's just, it's not sexual
if you start like this, uh,

789
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,810
thing to do. Oh. Oh, oh,

790
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,840
oh, oh, oh,

791
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:46,140
oh.

792
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:51,140
So the vet just opened what appears to
be a zipper on the back of this dogs

793
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,150
late. The human dogs lay texts,
um, uniform. The poop shit.

794
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:57,871
Yeah.

795
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:02,370
And he said he's going to give that
little little area an exam as they do to

796
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:04,260
dogs. They do that to
dogs, you know, they do.

797
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,440
They put a thermometer in there and
they express the anal glands. Yeah.

798
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:10,620
Fifth doesn't like it at all.
You don't have a title?

799
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,500
Good puppy. Oh good. Yeah.

800
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:22,270
You push down on that if you
think it's feels okay. Yeah. Good.

801
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,480
You can push down on that if you think
it feels it's not sexual though. God.

802
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:31,080
I wish people would stop stigmatizing us.
Poor guy,

803
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,650
or just people that look just like to
wear latex and we'd just like to act like

804
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:35,484
dogs.
Yeah.

805
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,623
Oh

806
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:39,683
yeah.

807
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,500
Now you and I had this debate in the car
because we couldn't stop thinking about

808
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,890
pup play in the Hammock is a which one is,

809
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:55,930
is definitely sicker. Like
what's what's, Oh yeah. What's,

810
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:01,030
what's Weirder, I guess. You know
what I mean? Yeah. I mean definitely.

811
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:05,920
It's not good to be in the hammock world.
Well, my argument is the hammock world,

812
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,340
it's, it's one and done. It's like it's
a short thing. The pup play. It's a,

813
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:16,080
it's like you're taking a semester, you're
taking classes, plays a lifestyle. Yeah.

814
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,570
It's a whole thing. It's really, really
good at dive in, but if somebody goes,

815
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,370
I mean, here's the thing, what
side of the Hammock are you on?

816
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,160
That's all the difference in the world.
Why I'm the one depositing? Yeah.

817
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,060
That's your only $50 I need to make.
Yeah. That, that's not that big of a deal,

818
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:34,870
I guess. Yeah. It's still just like a
gross thing to be doing. That's horrible.

819
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,900
Yeah.
It's hard.

820
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,650
It's hard and I don't even know if I
could shit in front of another person.

821
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:42,400
That's really the truth that
way. No, no, no. Not in front
of them. Into their mouth.

822
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,400
They're not watching you take a dump.

823
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,140
They're under you receiving your time
and the thing that that might make the

824
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:54,430
pressure, but the pup play lifestyle
that's just so involved, like that's just,

825
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,280
that's a real, and you've got
to buy the latex and I tell you,

826
00:56:57,281 --> 00:57:00,520
I don't think latex outfits are cheap.
That's what you're concerned with.

827
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,870
The lifestyle is so much the expenses.
He's got time for that stuff, you know?

828
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,200
Yeah. I'm just saying that it's a real
investment to be into the pup play.

829
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,130
I've only seen two that this one pig just
benefit from the whole pup play thing.

830
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,550
One Guy, one guy, he's like
the, who's your owner guy?

831
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,310
He's the only guy that actually
gets off on this thing. Right?

832
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,570
And he has all these pups. He's like,
I'm training. Smell your cock and balls.

833
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,370
That's, he's just, it's just him. It's
him in the five dudes that are into it.

834
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,950
They're like, where are your dog? Where
you, when the best time just loving life.

835
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,300
Why don't I see more of this medical exam?

836
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,500
Oh, I don't, I think I know
you don't have a title. Oh,

837
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,560
he'd go have a title puppy.

838
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,340
Now. Do you see the way he said he
goes, oh, you don't have a tail.

839
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:45,340
Like we can fix that though.
Right?

840
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,300
What's creepy?
I don't feel it's okay.

841
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,080
You know what I don't like
now that they're doing actual,

842
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:57,420
it's like it mixes the animal stuff.
Yeah. Now it's like, okay, is this,

843
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,220
it's kind of weird to think of a,
uh, a dog. How do you get hard?

844
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,960
Of course, that's the whole thing.
You got to mix those two worlds. Yes.

845
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,960
Now I'm confused.

846
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:10,830
Now are these guys into fucking dogs and
this is sublimating that need to fuck

847
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,050
dog.
Our dog's,

848
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:18,390
now you've come because you need
a title. Yup. Yeah. There you go.

849
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:23,270
Oh Shit. Oh No. That's so big. And you'd
like us. We'll give you, oh my God.

850
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:26,620
It's so long too.
So now does it normally?

851
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,083
No.

852
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:30,870
So now the idea,

853
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:35,890
and he's human pup doesn't have a tail
poor guy and they're going to give him

854
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:41,760
the tail in the form of a very long
but plug so that he'll have a tail.

855
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,640
Yeah. But by the way, it's
just a fun just oh, that's

856
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,110
where you hang out and this Guy
Watch football is the fun thing.

857
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:55,110
Stop making it sexual.
This is like the girl scouts.

858
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:58,380
The boy scouts were just
all community people.

859
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,740
Could you put that nine inch Dildo and
did my asshole for a second though.

860
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,110
It's just for the dog thing
is nothing to do with sex.

861
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,810
Oh, oh, oh,

862
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,360
oh, oh, oh, oh,

863
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,550
oh this guy loves it. 11
months right now, boy.

864
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,260
Oh

865
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:23,903
yeah.

866
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,083
Oh.

867
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,223
Reminds me of that.

868
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,980
Oh,
come on.

869
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:37,230
So hey was very tight down there
aren't, you know shit. It's my asshole.

870
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,990
You Derek. That's your, but

871
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,680
let's have a quick close. Um, no,
you'd get down. That's going to help.

872
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,850
Well thank you sir. Yes sir. Oh boy.

873
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,510
How much to do this one?
Okay. Now would you rather,

874
00:59:56,511 --> 01:00:01,190
would you rather do pup play or, or the
Hammock, but as a guy, what role am I in?

875
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:02,990
Either one. You're the fucking pot, bro.

876
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:06,740
I'm the pup or what your the pub here and
you're the shitter and the other snow.

877
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,460
Yeah. Taking a shit. Yeah, of
course. Easy, right? Yeah. It's easy.

878
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:14,030
But last week you were, I think into pup
play. You weren't needing to pooping.

879
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,140
Well No, I'm, I'm never going to
receive a poop. No, neither. Okay.

880
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:21,770
If it's between receiving the poop or
getting the butt plug, get a butt plug.

881
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:25,280
Easy. Yeah, right. Of
course. Get 10 butt plugs,

882
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,930
but butt plugs in my mouth and put them
everywhere. Shoved Butt plugs in my ears.

883
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:31,460
You can't even really eat brown.

884
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,960
I mean it's like not a good
thing to eat brown ever.

885
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,360
There's gotta be a brown
eater that listens to this
show too. I please write in.

886
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:41,830
How do you, how do you eat brown?
Cause doesn't it make you subs?

887
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,910
How do you do it? I mean physically,
you just get ill. If you eat brown,

888
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,820
it Kenny Brown,
you can drink,

889
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,550
you can drink yellow if it's separated.

890
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:56,660
I read that in a survival handbook cause
it'll separate into layers and you can

891
01:00:56,661 --> 01:01:01,400
drink the top layer of urine, but
you can't, you can't eat brown. Yeah.

892
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:06,320
It's just a no, no, man. Everybody
knows that. Yeah. Crazy. Stop eating.

893
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,620
There's, um, do you,
do they bite the Turd?

894
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,310
Like do you think they really
eat it or they just play with it?

895
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,240
The people who like it,
you bite into it.

896
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:21,800
I didn't want to be
fucking sick. Why? Guide?

897
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:26,050
You're such a square. Why don't
you open your mind? I know.

898
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,780
I'm such a fucking square it.
Yeah.

899
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:33,590
Why don't you be a little more open minded
about other people's sexuality? Tom,

Must read Wikipedia.

Going up to the atmosphere. Oh, look

955
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:50,560
ultimate then just glass,

956
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,300
Lakota moves so many fucking bet.

957
01:05:56,650 --> 01:06:00,640
I get tagged and a hundred things a day
that could just glass in here. Dude.

958
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:01,490
Did you see um,

959
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:07,100
was it USA today and had Aaron
Rodgers and then it's one of those,

960
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,810
uh, you know, it has the
caption of the photo,

961
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:14,380
like Aaron Rodgers against the New
York giants, but they also like,

962
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:18,880
we'll give a little title to the,
to the side photo essay today. Yeah.

963
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:23,560
And it said just glass and just glassing
but they said glassing with a G.

964
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,810
Yeah. Glassine. Yeah. But I know,

965
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:30,370
but it was us and the glassing is not
a word we invented. Just glassing.

966
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,870
If you hadn't, if we hadn't played
that and, and I saw that caption title,

967
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:37,930
I'd be like, what the fuck does that
supposed to mean? Right? Yeah. No,

968
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:42,620
we invented just glassine. Yeah,
it's pretty nuts. It's nuts. Um,

969
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,980
that in double pipe closed, we didn't
invent it because it was a, it was a term,

970
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,720
but just glassine is, is now definitely
why I'm h yeah, yeah, for sure.

971
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,590
That's legit. I found out that, that
remember that Rockwell automation

972
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,910
guy that can then relate to most boring.
Yeah.

973
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:06,250
Apparently that is like an aristocrat
scope for engineers. What number?

974
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:08,740
The aristocrats. Oh, right.

975
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:12,940
So apparently that video
with all those terms,

976
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:17,440
that's like an aristocrats joke.
Uh, engineers. Oh my God. Okay.

977
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:18,490
So it's all the big words.

978
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:22,960
And then basic joke is you create a video
about the turbo and cab and calculator

979
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,480
and you fill it with nonsensical,
hilarious.

980
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:29,320
And other companies have done it like, um,
it looks like we have another one here.

981
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,000
Okay.
So it was a jibberish.

982
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,320
It's a Jibberish joke for the engineer's
laugh at all. This is hilarious.

983
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:36,154
It's funny.
Yeah.

984
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,530
Even if you're not an engineer and pretty
good. Okay. It's funny. This is like a,

985
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:47,550
an ongoing thing here at Chrysler Motors
automotive operations research has been

986
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:52,520
proceeding to develop a line of heavy
duty transmissions that establishes new

987
01:07:52,521 --> 01:07:55,130
standards for reliability,
durability,

988
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,590
and quality with customer needs.

989
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,740
As our primary focus work is proceeding
on the crudely conceived idea of an

990
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:07,010
instrument that would not only supply
in verse reactive current for use in

991
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,120
unilateral phase,

992
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:13,121
detractors would also be
capable of automatically
synchronizing Cardinal Graham

993
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,013
eaters.

994
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:19,080
An instrument is the turbo and calculate
your original machine had a base plate

995
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:24,281
of prefab emulated emulate by a malleable
log rhythmic casing in such a way that

996
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:29,600
the two sperming bearings or in a
bourbon blind with a parametric fam

997
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,670
separations,
and then these guys just hilarious,

998
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:39,490
so fit into the amputation.
Lunar Lunar Winter,

999
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,370
I believe presented.

1000
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,580
How did this, this guy learned all
this stuff. He's not reading off cards.

1001
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,920
It looks like he has be. Yeah. Wow.

1002
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:52,550
The main winding was of the normal Lotus
Oh delta type placed in pen and make

1003
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,870
some bull Lloyd slots of the stater.

1004
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,940
So that's what they do. That's
amazing. That's so funny.

1005
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:05,750
All right to know that engineers have
a sense of humor. I know that is. Um,

1006
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,410
I don't know if I should
keep you waiting any longer.

many times by the way,

1010
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,450

when you guys have been sending these in

1011
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,030
and we've been playing them
that I then get messages.

1012
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:33,031

car cause people are laughing at what

1013

you're doing with these high marks.
People are really enjoying these.

1014
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:41,850

1020
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:04,900

Okay,

Thank you. Hey, look,

1078
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:19,510
can I get just to plan double
cheeseburgers and ketchup and cheese only?

1079
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,660
Yeah. And then I see the, you,

1080
01:14:22,661 --> 01:14:25,840
I'm just glancing at the menu here and
I see that you have a 10 piece nugget.

1081
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,220
Can I get two of those?

1082
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:32,650
And then a large fry
with a large Dr Pepper.

01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,650
But can you do just a little bit of ice?
And I'm talking about filming, I mean,

level of talent of our audience. I know.

1094
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,740

1114
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:53,060
One did order two cheeseburgers, but then
he might be ordered for somebody else,

1115
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:56,840
but he's like two cheeseburgers
and pizza in the car. Not this guy.

The guy before. Oh, who
knows? Yeah. Oh my gosh.

on people's faces as they feel good about

1126
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:43,370
it? Yeah, of course. You
feel so much pride when you
get away with it. It's like,

1127
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:47,460
it's just, it's a, it's a victimless
crime. Yes. That's so fun though.

1128
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,950
Just feels right. It does. God,
it's so much fun. Yeah, it is fun.

1129
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:52,784
It is fun to do.

1130
01:17:55,690 --> 01:18:00,290
Daniel says awesome shit in the mouth.
That's right.

1131
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:05,060
Another person on CD shit. Not only
in your mouth, but on not around

1132
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:12,020
inside your man. So, ah,

1133
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:16,530
yes. I'm laughing this episode. This has
been a really jam packed episode. Yeah.

1134
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,070
God Damn it. She was funny. She
knits all needs to go out. Okay.

1135
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:23,190
She's got to go pee. Gee, she's
laying by the door. Hold on. Yeah,

1136
01:18:23,191 --> 01:18:24,180
she's a little girl.

1137
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:29,050
Go ahead. And we're done. Yeah. The uh,
oh, so funny. Good place here that the,

1138
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,580
there's dogs around every wall.
Like behind every fence or whatever yard.

1139
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:38,200
The yard split. Yeah. So all the dogs
go crazy. That's in the evening. I know.

1140
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,370
Super Nice. So this, uh,

1141
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:46,450
I thought this is something
you'd like to give a shot to. Um,

1142
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,363
a lady,

1143
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,960
let me get the correct thing here.

1144
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,160
You know exactly what it is.

1145
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:59,370
A lady has decided to live
without money for a year.

1146
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,590
Oh, cool. To reduce her
environmental impact.

1147
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:07,840
And the narrator has on
believable vocal fry.

1148
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,280
Oh No.
Yeah.

1149
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:14,810
Joe Nemeth leaves off the
fruits of her own labor.

1150
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:20,740
It's been one year since she has earned
or spent a cent choosing to live without

1151
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:24,260
money to lower her impact
on the environment.

1152
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,920
Um, that's a cool
documentary. I'd like that

1153
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,030
swatch.
And she grows all of her own food,

1154
01:19:33,031 --> 01:19:35,040
cooks it on a fire powered stove,

1155
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:40,041
relies on rainwater and hitchhikes or
transport odds of soy keeping stove yet

1156
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,770
become toilet.

1157
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,770
Uh, don't know about that
one. Serviettes no thanks.

1158
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,140
Would you want to use your, your dinner
Napkin to wipe your ass later? Yes.

1159
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,420
Did he get food on your butthole?

1160
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,800
They're the ones,
you know when you go to a cafe,

1161
01:19:57,801 --> 01:20:00,990
people have like a serviette at
the bottom, underneath your car.

1162
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,780
You might spill over to coffee on it,

1163
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:05,000
but actually then it gets thrown
in the bin. But it's okay.

1164
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,410
It's not dirty as such.

1165
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,530
Kind of collect those secondhand
Soviets to recycle them.

1166
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:15,170
I love this sweet lady. I could see you
being best friends with, I love this car.

1167
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:18,520
Yes. Yeah. Cause I love Lou.
I love lunacy like this.

1168
01:20:18,521 --> 01:20:20,440
I love people that stick it to the man.

1169
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:25,470
I love these people that are off the
grid or like growing their own food and

1170
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:28,780
dumpster diving. I love, I could do this.

1171
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,590
You could not do this in
100 million. Yeah, yeah. No,

1172
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,670
I would say a lack of personality.
I lack of, of tenacity.

1173
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:43,670
See, sometimes it feels a
bit isolating because to me,

1174
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,010
because I'm just a little bit
odd, you know, I don't, yeah.

1175
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:51,120
Fit what everybody else is doing. I like
it. And most of the time that's okay.

1176
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55,840
You know, I can hang out with my friends
and it's just like normal, but it,

1177
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,590
you know,
to live low impact like I am,

1178
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:01,590
I really would like to share that with
other people who want to do the same

1179
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:04,590
thing as me. He wanted to leave as
radically lower. I love it as I am.

1180
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:09,160
You go there for awhile,
you know Australian. Yeah.

1181
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:15,220
I feel like I did this. This is called
living your 20s as a comic. Yeah, no shit.

1182
01:21:15,221 --> 01:21:17,830
We kind of already did this.
I think we've done this lifestyle.

1183
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,190
Maybe we had more of an environment in
environmental impact, but not much more.

1184
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,570
Not much been broke down that

1185
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:28,490
some friends, his name is Lance
Nimbin in northern New South Wales.

1186
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:32,620
New South Wales is Australia's shack in
exchange for working on their orchards

1187
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:33,030
back.

1188
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:37,170
Oh yeah. Oh, it's bad. It's bad. Yeah.

1189
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,990
Uh,

1190
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:45,290
uh, yeah. So there you go.
It's just like the gays.

1191
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:50,180
So would you, how bad do you
think her box smells though?

1192
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:55,430
I don't think regularly. I mean she,
she bay, she's hygenic I think. Yes.

1193
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,380
Okay. But I don't, I mean, I don't think
it smells particularly good, but I don't,

1194
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,280
I don't think it's,
it's wretched or anything like that.

1195
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,740
How annoying do you think she is to
have over? Oh my God. She's like,

1196
01:22:06,741 --> 01:22:10,100
you guys use paper towels? I, Oh
yeah. We love everything. Everything.

1197
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:12,860
Every time you turn on the sink, she'd
be like all that water and going away.

1198
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,590
They flushed the toilet. Did
you brown in there? Uh, no.

1199
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,050
Why are you flushing like
everything you do? She criticize.

1200
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:23,090
How are you going to use those serviettes
throwing them in the trash. You Go,

1201
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,650
what is that?
Pipe up blood.

1202
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:29,300
She's collecting all the
fucking dirty napkins.

1203
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:35,640
Yeah, it would be annoying. Nightmare.
She's super annoying. Le Quoc had,

1204
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:40,280
would be used. Do you recycle?
Yeah, I know. We'd be like,
yeah, when it's convenient.

1205
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,970
When you do it. Come on man. We're
American. We don't want to do recycling.

1206
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,740
I recycle boxes. Look in European
shit. Come on. All right.

1207
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,140
I gotta get ready to go actually.
Oh yeah.

1208
01:22:51,141 --> 01:22:55,580

farm. Go Away. Can trainers.

1209
