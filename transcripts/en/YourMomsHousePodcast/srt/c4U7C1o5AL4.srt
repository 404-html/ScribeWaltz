Okay. You got it. You got it.
Jean, what's your driver's license?

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,210
I don't have to give that to you.
Let me see your driver's license.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,390
You're out of police officer.
You just hit my vehicle, ma'am.

51
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,940
Your driver's license.
He pulled right out in front of me.

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,600
Poles in front of you
because there's an emergency

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,590
and your staff.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,113
Okay.

55
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,970
Don't bring anyone loving to live

56
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,790
well. Well, well go to your mom's house.

57
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,950
There it is. Gene, do you think, um,

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,350
there was a day where she
woke up and was like, ah,

59
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,370
I don't want to be a woman anymore.
You think that she threw in the towel?

60
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:12,600
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,260
Or do you think it's gradual or
which has she always just been like,

62
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,020
I don't feel like I don't
feel like it today. Ah, man.

63
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:22,410
I think it's been a slow process.
Yeah. First of all, I will.

64
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,300
I don't like pointing this out.

65
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,430
But you did a hundred percent assume
or pronoun and Sodas. I right.

66
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:32,490
Then we don't know.
There's no way of knowing any anymore.

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,860
There is no way. And how cruel
of us to assign a pronoun
to some, I apologize. Hey.

68
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,070
Hi. How are you? What's your
name? What's Your Pronoun? Well,

69
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm assuming it's a she.
It's used to be a share now it's,

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,250
it's a day. Do you think so? No, they ish.

71
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,100
That's interesting.
It does happen to women at a certain age.

72
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:57,420
I mean we've talked about the, shut it
down. Why? For the shut it down lady.

73
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,820
So it's a phenomena.
It's a shut it down.

74
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,250
Usually the shut it down starts with a
haircut. That's what we've learned. Oh,

75
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:09,110
with the, with the moms? Yeah. Mom. Yes.
Do a more masculine cut and they go,

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,830
yeah, part of my shut it down.
Move. It's the Tony Hawk.
Yeah. The bags shut it down.

77
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:16,740
Happens with bodies too. I mean, we
always see, I mean with both sexes,

78
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,890
it's not just a female thing, but
you see people, they're like, oh,

79
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,460
they threw in the towel on that
hunt nuts. Yeah, no self respect.

80
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,690
Nah. Yeah, yeah. Total disregard.
Yeah. It to me, look it.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,260
I just say it because you know, you gotta
fight. You gotta fight. You gotta fight.

82
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:37,290
You can't just throw in the towel. I
mean, look to fight every day. For me,

83
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,620
I'm struggling. It's always hard for
both of us. Yeah, I'm pregnant. You know,

84
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,080
you're tired. I'm tired. Anything
I want to fucking put on makeup,

85
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,310
we're going to say no to sweets.
Hire a trainer.

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,130
Try a man is making an effort.
Just try to make,

87
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:53,220
so that's the thing is that
your significant other sees
the effort and they'd go,

88
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:57,150
well, he's trying. He might look like a
fucking pile of dog shit, but he's trying.

89
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,950
I don't think you look like a pile
of dog should. I think it was great.

90
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:03,470
Much better than that. At least we're
both swagged out in our three stripe life.

91
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,280
Finally, I'm so excited that
you've joined and my tribe,

92
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,800
I've been in euro trash my whole life.

93
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,040
I came out of my mom's vagina
wearing one of these. Yeah.

94
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,530
And I'm so excited that team Adidas has
given you, threw me some nice, I love it.

95
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,600
Gave me a bunch of stuff.
I would just been,

96
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,140
I've just been flexing stunting on
these pools are all my newest like it a

97
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,330
welcome to team euro trash.
How do you feel? Fucking great.

98
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,000
Right and Free Shit,
you know,

99
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,360
I understand it's gross to be able to
buy stuff and get free stuff at the same

100
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,230
time.
It's a massive box of free Adidas.

101
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,110
Shout out to Adidas. Um, you know I got,

102
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,120
I got some nice messages from executives.

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,080
I gotta write some Adidas Shit in
my next special dude. Just do it.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,210
Do any product that you like.
I know I should. Any free

105
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,520
new baby coming pampers. Yeah, I'm going
to do that. Actually. I like pampers.

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,570
Huggies,
Pampers.

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,600
I can't even use fucking Huggies
man. Yo, I didn't know. I mean,

108
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,240
of course I had no idea cause I
had never bought them. But Damn,

109
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:18,380
diapers are expensive as shit.
And I buy like a month's supply at a time.

110
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,290
$50 dude,
I know for like a box.

111
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,820
And then you got to do the wipes.
You can't just dry wipe the baby's ass.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,030
That's another fucking fortune, man.
You gotta get the quality wipes.

113
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,200
You get the cheap wives, you're buying
double, you pay, you pay the price, man.

114
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,130
I know they sent you the
track pants that go with it.

115
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,810
Are you going to go full euro trash and
do that? And they also sent me this gray,

116
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,860
uh,
Adidas sweatpants,

117
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,100
sweat matching top 11 flights almost over.

118
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,510
Let's say I tell you in the 90s,
I was all about the matching Adidas.

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,770
They had the roll over sweat
pants and I had the tearaways,

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,400
the three stripes airways that match this
jacket. Yeah, I mean that's fantastic.

121
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,790
Also, there's products, you know,
you'd never think of trying,

122
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,650
but someone gives it to you.
I'm telling you,

123
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,340
this is not a paid thing,
but those boosts,

124
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,140
they sent me pure boosts and ultra boost
shoes so I never would have bought them

125
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,640
because I just don't,
I don't buy everything that I hear about,

126
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,140
but I went crazy on it.
Can I ask you though,

127
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,230
because now looking back in retrospect,
those tear away pants,

128
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,340
not very like practical. Like what? Two
people? I guess just for bath it's a,

129
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:34,341
it's a spinoff from basketball because
in basketball you were there your warmups

130
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,530
so you were more warming
up and then it's game time.

131
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,600
You just go group and your shorts or on,
I don't have to pull them down. Right.

132
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,130
You can just rip them off. I always
thought ways were the coolest thing too.

133
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,130
I remember I remember playing
Jv basketball and we had
tear away pants and that

134
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:53,540
was the thrill and the game was
just doing the terror weapon.

135
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,300
You feeling like you're a, yeah,
I mean I wasn't athletic at all,

136
00:08:57,301 --> 00:09:00,990
but I just liked the idea of
snap up pants. So silly. Yeah.

137
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,180
And then like the super cool guys,
you know,

138
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,590
they didn't bug them all the way down,
so they had like two open at the bottom.

139
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,120
Yeah, I did that. I'd give it a
little flare flare. Yeah, Kinda Nice.

140
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,580
When you kind of half Giagos things, you
didn't really jarring when you had them.

141
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,540
You're like, you know what I
do love about the three stripe.

142
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,100
A full track suit never goes
out of style. No, these, yeah,

143
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,900
this is timeless.
It's timeless.

144
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,070
This is the same thing that
run DMC was wearing. Yeah,

145
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,280
it's fucking dope.
It's still looks fresh.

146
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,520
Does Adidas, I love this. This
is official Hungarian gear, Dude.

147
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,220
I'm so stoked. Deputy. The all white
ones. That's, that's real gangster.

148
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,390
I need to get you a gold
medallion. Where's your gold
jewelry dude? That's coming.

149
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,670
Let's see what they continue to do here.

150
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,240
They're really pissed that I believe
this is the garbage truck driver. Oh,

151
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,860
poor guys. Just the worst.
It's the worst job to have.

152
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,360
I don't know if it's the worst job. It's
like, but can you, can you give the gun?

153
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,970
I mean, listen, hard job. It
really flips out. Oh Geez,

154
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,850
these are not cars.
They don't stop on a dime.

155
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,670
Big Boy.

156
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,700
I left the carpeting and the
note,

157
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,100
four bags aren't so much more than

158
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,543
ordered.

159
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,930
You know,
it's uh,

160
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,380
I'm always amazed by this ladies so angry
and she doesn't curse when someone can

161
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:49,930
do that and she's like big boy,
your rear end.

162
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,920
She so heated and she's not dropping any,
I don't know how people do that.

163
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:58,921
She keeps it Christian
Christian temper temper on him.

164
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,550
Oh No, I can't do that if I'm super
pissed. The worst things coming out.

165
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,510
Yeah. I mean she's really,
he keeps saying shit.

166
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,490
I'm still blown away at how man masculine
she is and the shoulders and the

167
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,250
shoulder. She might be a weightlifter
though. I don't think so.

168
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,680
You don't think she, she, she ain't
shit better shit to do if she were,

169
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,890
I just feel like she got him up and going
on. I won't be doing a strict press.

170
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,070
A lot of power cleans.

171
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,350
Okay.
And you're going to pay

172
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,060
you liked your job now.
I'm a garbage man.

173
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,960
Good luck.
Cause you ain't going to happen.

174
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,050
Okay Weirdo.

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,500
It's always crazy to me when someone
thinks they have that much power,

176
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,040
but what is she fuck?
Are you,

177
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,320
you're going to decide whether
this guy has a job or not.

178
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,150
She's going to spend that energy doing

179
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,703
stop.

180
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Don't stop.
Don't stop

181
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,523
time.

182
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,520
I think the interesting is what do you
think those tits way we were talking

183
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,270
about doors, those are no joke, right?

184
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,920
She's not wearing any kind of support
bra. What size do you think those are? No.

185
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,420
H H h sloppers and they're
not even contained,

186
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,560
but I'm surprised there's no wild tits
on that top is not flattering for that

187
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,630
either. Yeah. She's got some big fuck.

188
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,320
She is special is touched,
but you know,

189
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,910
I just think it's such a,
I don't,

190
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,400
I don't know how people have
time for this shit to call up.

191
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,850
The man's boss was fired up.
I know.

192
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,590
What worse cares?

193
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,620
Well,
what

194
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,540
you were supposed to do.

195
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,543
Yeah.

196
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,520
Who are also, have so much empathy
for people that do pick up our trash.

197
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,570
Did that stop? Was it ever
turned on? Yeah. All right.

198
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,890
I just had to do a little
camera card switch up.

199
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,710
Um, I'm just saying like I can't,
I don't, I mean, isn't it hard?

200
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,860
Is it his day? Like hard enough.
He's up at the crack of dawn.

201
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,250
He's picking up trash. It
doesn't smell good in there. Oh,

202
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,630
you don't think she has these
thoughts? Like who cares? Let the guy,

203
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,700
but don't you also at this point, this
upset at some point? Don't you go,

204
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,620
you're not upset about the trash? No,
she's upset because she weighs too much.

205
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,670
Didn't get the right Bra. That's what
she got. The wrong fucking support Bra.

206
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,270
I know she has 25 pounds each.

207
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,700
She's upset because she woke up a man
cause she's so fucking, she's so gnarly.

208
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:06,090
You know, she's just angry.
She's angry at other stuff now.

209
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:07,910
She loves in look,
listen to this mocking.

210
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,040
She's would like Ab psy fucking talk
to you like a baby. And she goes, no.

211
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,430
All right. And you can even
follow. Why don't you go back?

212
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:24,570
Yeah.

213
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,860
You know, my mom was like this, so, and
I think that's why it also bothers me.

214
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,043
Balanced.

215
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,780
Exactly.

216
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,220
My mom would like yell at salespeople
like this or she took everything

217
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,054
personally.

218
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,003
Yeah.

219
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,750
Crazy. She's good at the alphabet. Jesus.

220
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,170
Yeah. Okay. What'd you
rather do it with her? Yeah,

221
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,900
or at the Moose suit lady.

222
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,820
That's a really good point. It's really
good thing to think about actually. Yeah.

223
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,910
Um Hm.

224
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,580
Or menstrual blood lady and she's got
managed her blood on her face as you're

225
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:10,414
doing.

226
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
You guys are good.

227
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,420
You guys are doing good.

228
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,990
Yeah. It's just in the same family.
Yeah. They're kissing cousins. These two

229
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,120
new soup lady. She's sweet. She's what?

230
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,930
She's trying to offer you something to
this lady's raging out. It's terribly,

231
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,100
terribly attractive.

232
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,330
She's just

233
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,143
tier.

234
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,150
Yeah, they're moving. I didn't see him
move before and now I see him showing him.

235
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,710
You've got to restrain those
tests. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh boy.

236
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,890
Yeah. This guy, I mean,

237
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,900
she's kind of feels like an audition
way that she's very theatrical.

238
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:16,120
What she's, yeah, sure, sure. I'm a
kind of impressed directing skills.

239
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,610
It's pretty good.
Pretty good

240
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,413
look.

241
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,380
Oh yeah. She's on drugs or mental
illness. No, you do that sometimes.

242
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,770
The chicken thing. The
Gog, like, damn you do.

243
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,220
I've heard you do it every do chicken
things. That's my thing. Do it. Do it.

244
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,150
See,
hey,

245
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:48,151
she's really losing it and
see if the tape until now

246
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,340
with that mirror wasn't there.
Oh,

247
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,550
she got that.
The fucking world.

248
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,800
There's a big old milkers
goes flat wagons. Oh, am I

249
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,883
guy

250
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,710
dumpers yeah.

251
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,920
She's got big old fucking dumpy to hate
when these videos and like this and I

252
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:19,550
don't know what happened next,
what the resolution was or anything.

253
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,620
It is compelling.
It is compelling stuff.

254
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:25,160
If anybody knows what
50 pound tits did next,

255
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,650
anyone has a follow up,
we'd love to hear about it.

256
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,880
I mean hers way more than mine,
right? Oh yeah, of course.

257
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,990
Those are three times the size of
your test. Speaking of your tits,

258
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,450
um,
at least I hardest mine properly.

259
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:45,810
Like I buy the right size
bras. I got it. Do that. Um,

260
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,240
here it is.
Where is it or is

261
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,370
it a better, I'm sorry.
See it a lot of, uh,

262
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,050
votes on how much my tits
way. Yeah, that's what I was
trying to find. I saw. Sure.

263
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,180
I'll just tell you the tweets.

264
00:17:57,181 --> 00:18:01,620
I've been getting people who have been
ranging from six pounds each to two and a

265
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:06,330
half to 15 or 20 I have some relevant
info regarding the weight of money.

266
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,920
Mommy,
Tina's mushy perps.

267
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,810
My girlfriend had g size slobby hangers
when I first met her due to them

268
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,420
interfering with our com
hugs and her spine curvature.

269
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,750
She had them reduced to see cups and
lost a total of five operation genes.

270
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:25,140
Hangers have got to be high
and tight with mommy milk.

271
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:29,880
So 15 pounds a piece is a fair estimate.
You both.

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,320
Wow. So when I'm, when they're full
of milk for sure. At least. Yeah.

273
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,710
Cause they keep growing
during your pregnancy. Yeah.

274
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,740
They're getting bigger now
even more because there's
the milk ducts are starting

275
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:45,450
to and then people have
submitted different techniques.

276
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,700
Great quick solution for tit.
Wait,

277
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:50,130
just have Tina Stan on
irregular bathroom scale.

278
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,730
Then have her do it again
while Tommy holds up her tits.

279
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,960
The difference that's from Dane.
Okay, well let's think about that.

280
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,810
Does that really work? Yeah, I guess
I guess that would work. I don't know,

281
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,381
but I feel like,

282
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:06,150
I mean that's a technique but it's not
going to be as accurate as just getting

283
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:10,200
that team. I'm not so sure. Someone said
they weighed the tits on a Deli scale.

284
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,780
Um, if you'd be interested. Years
ago when I was just last double D's,

285
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:20,100
I worked for a deli. It was a slow Sunday.
It's working with the all female staff.

286
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,700
They were not as blessed as I am in the
10 department and like to gently tease

287
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,040
me about my abundance.
We wildly,

288
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,890
we wonder how much they weighed a well,

289
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,960
we had it happen to have
a deli meat scale at hand.

290
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,350
We were silly on free milkshakes and
all the weed we smoked in the basement.

291
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,070
He gave it a try after placing a
sheet of Delhi tissue on the scale,

292
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,450
I stepped up,
popped out my broad,

293
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:44,190
proceeded the way that my had
a lefty at 4.7 pounds, right,

294
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,290
was 5.2 don't sanitize the scale and
everyone got their tits out and there was

295
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,220
hot scissoring. Just kidding.
We cleaned up and clocked out.

296
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,330
Now I have a great story to tell it.

297
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:58,920
My job interviews your Moshi purples
high and tight. Lisa in Virginia,

298
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,940
if you would like any advice on
how to accomplish a tit weigh in?

299
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:05,730
I consider myself pretty
much an expert in the sport.

300
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,910
Well now I just have to get my
hands on a deli scam. That's right.

301
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:09,870
People had mentioned that.

302
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:13,290
They have been mentioning that somebody
else said that this kitchen scale is

303
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,470
something you could do.
A couple of months ago,

304
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:18,090
my boyfriend and I had the same question,

305
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,670
so I got out that glass top kitchen scale,

306
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,780
laid it on the edge of the table and
got down to the level of the table where

307
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,360
the bottom of my tits lined
up at the top of the scale.

308
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Plop the tit on top 34 double d and
each one rounded out to six pounds.

309
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,660
Whoa.
How's total Holly?

310
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,210
Who Found Lynn Canada? He asked.
I estimate Christina's tit.

311
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:46,860
Wait at 18 pounds. Wow. So we
can just buy one from Amazon.

312
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:47,990
Yeah.

313
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,710
Glass scale too.
Here's the thing though,

314
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,980
but how do you know that the pressure
of you? I know what she's saying.

315
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,070
You're going to plop it on there,

316
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,190
but how do you know you're not putting
more pressure on the scale by how you're

317
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:00,850
standing or something to consider
for horse? These are all factors.

318
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,940
I think the Deli scale might be the only.
Yeah.

319
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,930
Do you think we could try the whole farts?
You think they would let us do it?

320
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,470
Yeah, we were friends
with those workers. Yeah,

321
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,700
that's totally possible.
Deli meat scale cause a deli meats scale.

322
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,430
I feel like it's used
to being very precise.

323
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,340
You know he measure out
thin slices of meat.

324
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,490
It's very precisely right.
Those are big tits. Oh,

325
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:31,240
those are real big double D's. Even.
I'm surprised how much those way.

326
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,770
Huge Teddy's I want to get
mine reduced after. Definitely.

327
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,260
What do you wanna bring him down to see?
Yeah,

328
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,320
a C Cup will be like being in fifth
grade again for me. I can fucking run

329
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,600
right before we started recording,

330
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:51,601
I saw this came up that I'm
Sony pictures has apologized.

331
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,890
Yeah. After Peter Rabbit, the movie
exploits a food allergy setting.

332
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:01,270
Some parents. Oh, the a food allergy. Huh?

333
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,350
Her Son has food allergies and a scene
in the film shows blackberries being used

334
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,184
as a weapon.

335
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,270
The backlash to the scene has already
drawn an apology from the filmmakers. Oh,

336
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,250
good. Good. Holy Shit.

337
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,170
Well,
I'm glad we're apologizing.

338
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,370
The big corporations are yielding
to these idiots. That's great. Oh,

339
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,850
good example. Encouraged the
other dummies to come forward.

340
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,250
Allergies are often not
taken seriously enough.

341
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Haven't trivializing the big screen by
such a popular character is immensely in

342
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:34,090
a statement. Sony pictures apologize.
Food allergies are a serious issue.

343
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,270
Our film should not have made light
of Peter Rabbit's, arch nemesis,

344
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,000
Mr Mcgregor being allergic
to blackberries. Even in a
cartoonish, slapstick way.

345
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,030
The statement which attributed in
part to the films, directors, writers,

346
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,900
and producers added.

347
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:50,440
We sincerely regret not being more
aware and sensitive to this issue.

348
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,870
And we truly apologize.
She's just,

349
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,270
is this, the end of us is
as a CN of America. I mean,

350
00:22:56,271 --> 00:23:00,680
this is a food allergy joke. And
here's the thing. I, you know, I was,

351
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,360
as I was posting Christ,
uh,

352
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,220
a joke about he man the other
day on my Instagram, it's a,

353
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,350
it's a meme that someone
sent me on Twitter.

354
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:13,280
It's like he man is now changed
it to himself to the man and I,

355
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,350
and I was just picturing the backlash
though. Yeah. That's pretty funny. Yeah.

356
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,000
And um,
and somebody being like,

357
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:23,780
but I'm non binary and I was really
thinking about this in a logical,

358
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,170
philosophical way. Yeah.
Okay. So what's wrong?

359
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:31,340
So someone has a food allergy.
What's wrong with making a,

360
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,280
putting it in a story that somebody has
a food allergy? You know what I'm saying?

361
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,570
Well, cause you're making, they
made fun of like he was written,

362
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,520
it was trying to find his
epi pen and then he went in

363
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,650
shock. And that was the joke. He did
not, yeah. Oh, is that right? Yeah,

364
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,540
but so what,
so what if somebody is upset about it?

365
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:52,140
I have that thing and you can't make
fun of it. That's the logic, right.

366
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:57,350
Affects me. It makes me sad.
Therefore you can't joke about it.

367
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,870
Claude. Things that don't affect
me personally, but here we go.

368
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,610
If we keep apologizing to everybody,

369
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,640
then it's an infinite apologies
and we can't talk about shit. Yeah.

370
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm sure that you could go to
some of these people and be like,

371
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,810
how do you feel about jokes about
Mexicans? And they'd be like,

372
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,430
I mean that's fine.

373
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,400
I don't know any Mexicans I know about
these fucking peanut allergy remedies.

374
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,950
Blackberries are upsetting to my, to me
personally because I have the allergy.

375
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,860
It's very selective.
Yeah.

376
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,710
It's just always about only
what affects you is offensive.

377
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,050
It's just a logic.
So I was thinking to myself,

378
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:37,490
let's say somebody is going to contact
me from the non-binary community.

379
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,260
I'm non by. Okay, so what,

380
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,580
so why does that mean I can't joke about
it because you're being, I dunno, it's,

381
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:47,730
you're being insensitive to
something being insensitive.

382
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,470
And so why is that?
Is it necessarily immoral?

383
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,480
Is it wrong to be not funny?

384
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,050
It's not funny because
it's something that,

385
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,130
that, um, that I've,

386
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,120
I've been going through and I
can tell you that it's not funny.

387
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,560
It's not funny for you,
but it's funny for everybody else.

388
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,400
They shouldn't be laughing
cause it's not a fun day.

389
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,670
So we should control the external
world to make your internal. She just,

390
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,990
if you were actually funny,

391
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,020
you could figure out something
else to joke about that didn't,

392
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:19,130
it wasn't at the expense of people with
allergies who haven't decided their

393
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,550
pronoun yet. It's my favorite. Yeah,
no, it's a, it's an endless cycle.

394
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,090
I mean it could just go on and on and
on. And the problem too, like I said,

395
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,980
as the Sony's are cowtowing
to this horribly stupid logic,

396
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,260
amazing part is that they extended
her an apology for that. I mean,

397
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,680
is there a huge blackberry allergy
community that there must be somewhat,

398
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,240
I think it's also not even just
blackberry allergies. It's just parents.

399
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:43,290
I mean I have friends,
we,

400
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,260
we know people whose children
are allergic to. Um, you know,

401
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,850
foods peanuts. Are you kidding me, Lj?

402
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,030
I put him in preschool when I
was doing the enrollment papers.

403
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,170
They give you a sheet this long.
Just reading you the riot. Act On,

404
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:01,690
do not pack any, not related.
No peanut butter, almond butter,

405
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,360
nut butter, soy butter at any good,
no nuts, no nuts, granola bars.

406
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,790
You have to buy them without nuts.
Is that even possible?

407
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,980
Is there even a bar thing?

408
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:14,981
Is that I totally get that part
and I get some kids going to die.

409
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,680
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it and
I get it that it's just, you know,

410
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,350
this is a really serious issue for some
families. I'm glad we don't have it. Yes,

411
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,184
of course.

412
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,370
But I still think you can make
jokes and make fun of the allergy.

413
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:29,990
Not you're not making fun of the kid.

414
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,190
You're making fun of the fact that they
gave to give you a sheet now because of

415
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:37,580
the thing or whatever the joke is.
I mean, people have aids jokes. Oh,

416
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,130
such good ones and you know,
we haven't heard enough.

417
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,910
I feel like people have been writing
it in. People have holocaust jokes.

418
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,860
Yeah. Rape. Rape is great. Yeah.
I'm glad that was your sentence.

419
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,170
But yeah, people joke about
all types of things. Deafness,

420
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,170
disabilities, everything. Yeah. We've,

421
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,460
I think you and I have covered personally.
I've heard from a few people

422
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,560
I know. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, I think the thing is,

423
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,480
the answer for all those people is like,

424
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:13,620
just don't laugh if you don't think it's
funny and also watch something else.

425
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,340
Let's move on with your life. Are there
no other movies playing right now?

426
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,980
Here's the thing.
You know me and I don't like vomiting.

427
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,920
I have a phobia of vomiting,
so whenever it's in a film,

428
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,030
I just don't like it for that brief.
Second,

429
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,150
would I write the movie people
and let them know I have a phobia?

430
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,630
I don't like seeing it. You should
take it out. You just go, oh,

431
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,140
that's a moment that I'm not going
to care for in this guy's act.

432
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,500
Or it's just so silly.

433
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,220
People are fucking out of there and I'm
kind of enjoying watching people spiral

434
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,150
though.
I'm kind of getting off on it now.

435
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,250
Like now that it's extended to
food allergies now it's great.

436
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,960
I hope it keeps going.
I hope it, I hope the,

437
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,460
the outrage keeps going to more and more
absurd things like I hope they start

438
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:56,364
going like,

439
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,780
and then he made fun of his friend for
not liking cheese in the movie and I come

440
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,930
from a dairy family and then
somebody was like, you know,

441
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:08,931
we should have been thoughtful about
the dairy community in Wisconsin and we

442
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,660
apologize for that joke and that and
then just let it keep going, let it.

443
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,280
But the only reason that the Sonys of
the world are apologizing is because of

444
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:22,050
the internet and the visibility of
these dummies who rallied together and

445
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:27,051
Facebook groups and groups on Twitter
and they use social media to collectively

446
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:32,730
be idiots. And you know, Sony doesn't
want their name being tarnished,

447
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:36,250
I'm assuming. So they have to shut these
idiots up somehow. It's ridiculous.

448
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,340
Anyway, speaking of lunacy, we found the
best goddamn reality show last night.

449
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,980
Oh my God. Well, what's the called? Love.

450
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,500
I posted it on my Instagram.
I'm Christina [inaudible].

451
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,320
Mais I'm the Christina p.

452
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,320
It's called love after lock up.

453
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,900
And you would think that it would
just be a show about like dating,

454
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,000
but it's better than that.

455
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,390
Oh my people that are
marrying convicted felons.

456
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,450
It's amazing. It is amazing. I
wonder, what is it called again?

457
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,300
You just said love after lockup.

458
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,580
It's on we TV and we were
scrolling through last night.

459
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:22,581
You were taking a shit as usual and I
saw this jam and I thought it doesn't get

460
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:26,610
any better than inmates
dating non inmates.

461
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,740
Jesus help me.
Jesus.

462
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,740
I discovered thought, oh
my gosh, it's beautiful.

463
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,090
Lives in California.

464
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,000
Convict Grandad.
Oh Wow.

465
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,410
They looked up and saw as
mugshot. I was like, wow,

466
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:57,140
this guy takes a really hot mugshot
out.

467
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,860
My man is a good man.
Prison man.

468
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,360
Once released

469
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,220
my dream wedding, my dad would be walking
me down the aisle. If you're crazy,

470
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,050
do they have to?
Why do they have to marry immediately?

471
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,150
My Dad and mark it down the aisle is hard.

472
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,600
I had a twin that daddy would walk me
down the aisle that will be hospice and

473
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,490
all my bridesmaids would
where? Few shot. Yeah.

474
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,000
That girl is obsessed.
They're all fucked up.

475
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,450
These people are actually super sad.
Yeah. You could tell that they're all,

476
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,080
they're all scared, like they were
like kicked dogs. They're like,

477
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:53,220
I just want a nice owner,
and oddly enough, ironically,

478
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,210
they feel like this will be
the good owner. Well, yeah,

479
00:30:57,211 --> 00:31:00,720
because what it is is that they
say it in the shell like, well,

480
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:02,130
the thing is there's less quote,

481
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,480
less risk dating an inmate because there's
less theoretically things they can do

482
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:09,690
to you. Right. They can't cheat on
you. They can't do anything bad,

483
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:14,040
but the irony is they're actually way
more harmful to these poor souls because

484
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,460
they're criminals.
They're manipulating this.

485
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,150
This woman took $20,000 from this guy.
Well,

486
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,890
he's sent her and she admits.
Then she's like,

487
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:26,910
at first I was just like trying to
pull money out of them. You're like,

488
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,930
I'm a con artist, but now I'm
not now change. Yeah, they're,

489
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,580
my favorite is that one lady's dating a
guy who's been locked up for eight eight,

490
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,270
eight eight 18 he has not seen
the outside for two decades.

491
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:47,580
He's never like see the enter and she
has kids, she has kids. She was like,

492
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm gonna marry him. And like this
will be their new debt. Instant Dad.

493
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,230
And you're like three small children
and they're all like young children.

494
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:58,230
Yeah.
Nice little sweet kids and she's new dead.

495
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,140
Well he has been uh,

496
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,320
doing some stuff and he's finally here.

497
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,130
It's nice and thoughtful of her because
she also likes to think of what gang

498
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:11,490
affiliation he has when she gets
dressed and stuff believable. He's like,

499
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,750
well he's a crip so I can't wear red
when I pick him up. And you're like,

500
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:19,140
really is that important right
here he is talking about it.

501
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,370
I never had a job in my life until I
started working in and out of jail.

502
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,213
You know what I'm saying?

503
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,960
I'm not saying maybe these guys in prison
can't turn it around and maybe they

504
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:37,771
are a nice cute cause.

505
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:42,710
Not everybody's all and no such
thing as redemption and all that.

506
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,540
But I mean how about you give it
a minute before you get married?

507
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,410
Running into the, to the wedding is it
cannot be a good idea. So then the girl,

508
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,540
this is her daddy or looking
at and she's 26 or 26,

509
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,750
and her boo is getting
out of prison and he's 24.

510
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,400
Just a laundry list of when is it vehicle?
He's stealing cars.

511
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,020
All kinds of stuff. Yeah,
he's stealing and um,

512
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,470
he's broken in the homes and credit
cause he's my favorite. He's one,

513
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,170
he's one of these white
boys like, yeah. You know,

514
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,050
relationship with a female in a minute.
What Dude?

515
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,590
Transracial I believe he's
really adaptable. Lingo. Female.

516
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,250
Yeah, he's cute relations
in a minute. Uh Huh.

517
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,520
Mormon girl.
Shoot somebody.

518
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,670
She gets mad when they teaser. They
like, you married a guy prison.

519
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,580
Where did you get that ring? Like in, uh,

520
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,490
at the little penny slot machine
in prison. And she's like,

521
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:01,430
you gotta make up funny one. Now
she could, that's disrespectful.

522
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,850
You're being disrespectful. It's like, no,
they're actually being honest with you,

523
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:08,840
dummy. Uh, so the, the,
the 26 year old girl,

524
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,650
her whole thing is, she just
wants the wedding. You know,

525
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,150
it doesn't matter to who,

526
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,040
just that this guy comes out and that
I can't wear a dress and my bridesmaids

527
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,620
can't wear burgundy and
we can handle anyway.

528
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,470
Then it's like you don't even
care who you're marrying a lot.

529
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,140
Both of these women are like, I
just want the dress. I just want,

530
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,530
they just want to have their fantasy
wedding. Yeah. It's really fucked up.

531
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,280
And I think that's what's really fucked
up about women and how they raise us

532
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,610
little girls from the very beginning.
A lot of this Disney horse shit. Uh,

533
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,140
it's called, I mean, listen, my parents
certainly didn't pump that into my head.

534
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,420
The, no, I know. But I
think now there's such,

535
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,810
there's such a level of awareness that
you have a chance if you have a little

536
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:51,470
girl, Ooh. To not put that in her head,

537
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:54,650
that the greatest day ever
will be your wedding day,

538
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,750
most important day of your
life or into your life.

539
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,560
And you can be a princess prep for
one day. Get to be the princess.

540
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,220
All the colors that you love the most.
Yeah. But remember like those Gypsies,

541
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,720
the Big Gypsy wedding show,

542
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,580
that was her whole thing my mother had
put in my head at one solitaire diamond

543
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,700
with diamonds all around it.
And then horses.

544
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,060
That's my dream.

545
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,310
And then you're just uses live in
the memory of that day? I think so.

546
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,940
That's the best day.
I mean it's so,

547
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,760
it's so crazy to me that that's the
biggest highlight of your life is a stupid

548
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:35,480
fucking wedding. You gotta
be kidding. She's a real,

549
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:37,980
I guess

550
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,660
you could call him a trick.
It wasn't true.

551
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,560
And the thing is though,

552
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,830
that the way he was with me,

553
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,290
how I was able to be honest with him,

554
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,190
he was okay with me being me.

555
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,200
He's broken too. Just like, oh,

556
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,080
okay baby. I ain't buying shit. He
can't afford for her. Yeah, she's gonna.

557
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,170
She's gonna Bleed them dry leave.
It's of course it's, it's all,

558
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,200
it's so great though. What a great,
what a great show. In delusion,

559
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,400
you get to see how people talk
themselves into bad ideas. It's fun.

560
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:18,750
If you guys want to show love after
lock up, I wish I could find this guy.

561
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,050
This guy is guys, the Trans Racial
Man. Yeah. Yeah. The trans racial

562
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,170
identify with. Would you say is he
here? He has Garrett. That's his name.

563
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,140
[inaudible]

564
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,920
and then, um, that's the other
thing is that they're Marion people.

565
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:44,580
They've never also slept with,
never had sex, never had a date,

566
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:46,440
never had anything normal,
nothing.

567
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,070
Can't have conversations on the
phone longer than 15 minutes.

568
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,850
And then there's the guy marrying the
heroin girl. Ah, forget that. He's sweet.

569
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:58,350
He was a, he's a marine. He's an
it guy. Crazy eyes though. Yeah.

570
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,990
Doctor drew was telling us when
you see the tops of the whites,

571
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:05,110
it's like a pulmonary thing.
No, that was the best thing.

572
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,160
Is that crystal meth or
drugs? Dr Group. But uh,

573
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,730
yeah, so he's sweet as
can be. He's a good guy.

574
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,180
And then just eastern European hall,
one of my tribe,

575
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,180
a ropes and in with the Internet
pictures of her and she's a former yet

576
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,910
recovering heroin addict and
she got put in prison for,

577
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,480
for what was she doing? Possession and
intent to distribute or something. Heroin.

578
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,960
Special heroin.

579
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,730
Yup. Good stuff. Could you
imagine your child being like,

580
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:44,580
I'm marrying this? Well that's
what this shows you. These,

581
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,510
these parents did Fallon fuck
that one guys. So he's like,

582
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:53,100
you're gonna marry this guy. She's like,
he'd give him a chance. He's a great guy,

583
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:58,820
but the great guideline is my
favorite. They should, I don't know,

584
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,920
just earn the great guy. Satisfying.
If you have to tell people,

585
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,320
you know what I mean?
What is up with this great guy?

586
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,990
He's doing 18 years for armed robbery.
Oh yes.

587
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,550
He's great at crime.
That's what I meant to say.

588
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,823
Oh,

589
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,980
and then waiting and waiting for this data

590
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,630
is going to pick them up.

591
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,440
I'm freaking out.
She's about to get out of jail.

592
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,100
She got some a matching outfit.
That's the priority. Is that

593
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,760
2198 Oh yeah.
And then the lady,

594
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,470
he goes and buys a car for the
one of the 18 year felon guy.

595
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:45,500
She buys him a new vehicle. Okay.
Let's see. She's Mormon too,

596
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:49,480
so her community is not going to be
pleased with the shit. By the way.

597
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:53,860
Watch this first full episode on Youtube.
Okay.

598
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:59,010
[inaudible] please,

599
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,500
please people so we can hear
him. Tom, I think he's held

600
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,040
in prison for burglaries,
grand thefts,

601
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,530
Dnn from people's homes,
cars and a jog, jog,

602
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,230
use and drug possession.
I was sentenced to eight years in prison,

603
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,150
five years probation and judge treatment
when I was 18 it was definitely crazy.

604
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:31,260
You know, going to prison for all those
years. Living with 80 guys in the room.

605
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,430
I love it. Everyone has onto your motives.
Everyone always wants something from

606
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,770
criminals are shitty people.

607
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,580
Like a hundred best days of my life.

608
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,210
It's one of the best days of my life.

609
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,990
All right.
Can we go

610
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,130
bibs? The layman's part is that this
bitch brought him a matching outfit.

611
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,413
Does that,

612
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,990
you know what I'm saying? Like if I,
when I come to get you out of prison,

613
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,590
do you want me to bring our
matching? Of course. Of course.

614
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:14,490
We'll walk out and be like free again.
You know, Sam, I've been locked up.

615
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,180
I ain't been with a female and
about six and a half years.

616
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,200
I would love if you as a president
came back talking like that. I'm like,

617
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,800
who are you? Who am I a bitch? Who
the fuck are yous? It's Florida talk.

618
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:29,460
He's from Florida now.
I mean he is from Florida,

619
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,400
but he's um, yeah, he's been
doing this thing. Dade County. Uh,

620
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,590
I think he's a Tampa boy. Oh yeah. Tab.

621
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,860
I can see you with a guy like that
for sure. He's actually a cute his,

622
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,000
you know what she said. So
they, these people out Mugshot,

623
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,480
these people find the inmates on an
inmate dating site and they put their

624
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,890
mugshots up and she goes,
well he had a hot mug shot and I was like,

625
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:57,840
this bitch is crazy. And I saw
it. I was like, you're right.

626
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,560
He kinda does on Mugshot.
Same with the truck driver.

627
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,040
That's what that scam, that
hooker, she's got a great mugshot.

628
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,460
She's smiling and hers and Shit.
She knew her and code as the heroin girl.

629
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,930
She was like modeling before hot inmates.
So that's what happened.

630
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:16,290
You know what it is?
Is these broken people go,

631
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,360
that hot person would never wait.
That truck driver said like,

632
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:26,160
okay, so like out of jail she's a 10,
but in jail she's a nine and a half.

633
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:29,670
Remember he didn't say it that way, but
he goes, I'm like a five. She's like,

634
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:33,540
I'm nine, nine and you go, why do
you take away the half a star? Yeah.

635
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,550
Like whenever you're talking like
star search, your significant other.

636
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:41,900
You don't be, you don't dial it back
just like a nine and a half. Yeah,

637
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,860
half a point. Cause she's a felon.
But that makes sense by the way,

638
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,880
somebody's got their mom to do this
just in case you're wondering. Okay,

639
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,550
well I have to do this thing for school.
I need to just to say something. Okay.

640
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,470
Can you say my name is Mary Jo Ann.
I'm a ball hog.

641
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,570
You gotta say it like sexy. Like my
name is Mary Jo and I'm a ball hard

642
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,850

My name is Mary Jo.

643
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,380
Good job. I like Mary Jo. Uh, just
a little cool little audio note.

644
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:27,400
Maybe turn down that TV if you're
trying to get audio next time.

645
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:32,200
But nevertheless, good job,
Tyler. Get your mom on the,

646
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,160
on the ball hog thing and then
they're cute. This is for Eugene. Uh,

647
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:40,910
last week you made me
order for artichokes. Yeah.

648
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,100
And somebody ordered

649
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,700

650
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,370

651
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,970

652
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,690
the vegetables or no vegetables.

653
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,920
Okay. All right. So that's the

654
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,580
chicken Fajita Nachos.
All

655
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,430

656
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:20,400

show. That was fantastic, Donald.

657
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,040
Man, I was hilarious. I can't,
I can't laugh enough with those.

658
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,310
And I love when people fuck with
people like that. Furniture.

659
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,420

668
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:10,660
I'm just says as a scrum master, you'll
play a major role in shaping our success.

669

mommy Thomas next dream job.

673

I don't know how long the job will
stay up here it is. By the way,

674
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,090
I'm the guy you met,
uh,

675
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,700
with Ari and Brent Chrysler when you
guys were leaving top golf in Atlanta.

676
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,840
And to attest the toms story,
Brent was the one who proposed.

677
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,180
I take a picture with him
and later with you guys.

678
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,420
So if there's a trophy for
attention whore champion,

679
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,570
I think Brent takes it easily.
Yeah. Love all your guys. Shit.

680
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,230
Piss on me and bite my balls.
Gus from Atlanta. Uh, he's a,

681
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:57,240
he's referring to when we
left, uh, top golf. This guy,
Gus was just like, oh, hey,

682
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,910
what's up Burberry? What you want to
take a picture? And then was like,

683
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:03,990
you were three picture with the guys,
so it's kind of hilarious.

684
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:08,700
But sue this, so basically
Bert saw him was like, no,

685
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:11,790
we'll all take a picture and
made him take a picture of,

686
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,190
you guys all have beards.
Yes.

687
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,710
Beard grew French kiss each other with
your beard's. Yeah. It's so funny.

688
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:20,160
I was who was, I was a full
charge this weekend. Yeah. And uh,

689
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,410
I got recognized a few places and he
was like, you get recognized a lot.

690
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,510
And I go,
just depends on where and he goes.

691
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:30,930
But basically every guy with a beard
seems to recognize you. Like, yeah,

692
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,040
I think it's true. Oh, that's funny
guys that look like me or like, Hey,

693
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,960

you seen this? This is like,

699
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:54,240
okay.

700
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,880
Happened a couple of weeks ago and a
lot of people were talking about it,

701
00:45:56,881 --> 00:46:00,330
but I don't know if you
heard about it or saw it.

702
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,150
And that is Tom Brady the quarter.

703
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,510
Tom Brady is how you're supposed
to say. Some people say that. Yeah,

704
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,120
I've heard that.
I don't know anything about,

705
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,480
he did this show for Facebook where
he let cameras follow them around. Oh,

706
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:15,260
I heard about this and he his son and
kissed him or something and it wasn't good

707
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:19,760
enough. And he went back for seconds.
Well just here. Just why. Okay.

708
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:20,594
Let me see.

709
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,370
So getting like treatment,
I was wondering if I could check my,

710
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,083
we won't get

711
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,120
every now and Jack.
Everything comes at a cost,

712
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:38,180
but it was like a peck is your
fantasy quarterback check Cam Newton.

713
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,393
Yeah.

714
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,380
See now that I see it because I've heard
people talking about it. Yeah. Okay.

715
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:51,510
So he goes in for one pack and then he's,

716
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,900
he goes in for a second one and the second
was really meaningful mouth cast with

717
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:57,300
his dad. It's weird to
me. Okay. Yeah. Look,

718
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,660
I know that some families they mouth kiss.
Yeah.

719
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,960
But I think the same sex is kind of,
it's a little for me personally,

720
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:08,340
it's just not my thing. I don't mouth
kiss our son. I don't think that that's,

721
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:12,940
I've never kissed anyone in my family.
No. I accidentally did my Stepdad once,

722
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,980
he wa he turned his head. Yeah.
My Indian stepdad accidents.

723
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,940
But I'm talking about the regular
[inaudible] that happened in the early

724
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,900
nineties and I'm thinking about it ever
since. Like it was a bad moment cause

725
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,730
cheek kissing is so big in,
um, my mom's culture. Yeah.

726
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,100
Like there's never a mistake

727
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,180
for a mouth. No, I don't. I don't know
if I didn't, if I didn't have her,

728
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,450
um, I think my dad's family, I probably,

729
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,790
I don't even know if we'd go past hugs.
You know, your dad's more formal. Yeah,

730
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,860
they're definitely Gary. And
you kiss both cheeks. Yeah.

731
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,080
Now it's where cheek kissers we're not
mouth kissers this is a very weird thing.

732
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:53,150
I don't, I'm not into this man. So
He's coming back for number two.

733
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,740
It's so sensual to, it's so weird
in this account. It, let's go

734
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,600
already know Jack. Everything comes
at a cost. That was the short one.

735
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,980
He says, come back. Oh,

736
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:10,810
that's weird. I'm, is Dan here?
Wait, did you hear him say,

737
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:15,430
but I'm his dad. It was like,
here he is with his dad.

738
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,100
So yeah,
this has caused a huge

739
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,320
conversation before. So
he's 11 years old, Tom,

740
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:33,840
because this is a family thing.

741
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,240
Maybe it's a little bit
longer than it should be.

742
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,700
Oh, they didn't show it because he also,
they show him Tom with his, you know,

743
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,850
70 year old dad and they killed the mouth.
The mouth.

744
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,080
Could you imagine kissing top dog's
mouth feel so bad for my mother? Yeah.

745
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,990
I mean the smells alone that
come out of your dad's mouth.

746
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,580
His Dad mouth on your dad mouth.
Yeah. And I keep drinking coffee.

747
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:03,410
It's going to my dad. Matt's going to
kick in generational dad mouth kissing.

748
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:08,000
Disgusting. I Dunno. What do you think?
I mean, would you kiss Ellis? No.

749
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:11,900
You don't kiss Ellis on the mouth? No.
I mean, I think, I mean probably as a,

750
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:15,940
I don't, I kiss him on his cheeks. I
think it's an appropriate personally.

751
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,290
And
I don't,

752
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,080
I don't want to as a little
kid personally, like,

753
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:25,940
you know how Nasty Your Dad's mouth is?

754
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,110
My Dad's mouth has been nasty
since I can remember like,

755
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,050
just try putting his mouth on.
I don't even like the idea of it.

756
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,060
Just Devin mouth

757
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,560
is nasty. I don't like that. I know.

758
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,430
I Dunno. I don't wanna
like I don't want to, um,

759
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,900
I'm sure we just contributed to that.
That kid probably got tortured at school.

760
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:56,150
Well that's enlisted and that's Tom
Brady's fault for exposing his children on

761
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:59,960
the fucking show or whatever.
But now that being said,

762
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,290
I grew up with a family.
A friend of mine,

763
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:08,370
he would mouth kiss his mother, his father
and his sister, good night and hello.

764
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:13,220
I am it. There are nice family
ethnicity. They were Jewish,

765
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,300
White Jews. Uh, and uh,

766
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,480
he was a goth kid with us,
which is even weirder.

767
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,150
Mouth Kissing and they were a nice family.
They're are super nice.

768
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:26,060
And it was like, I remember
the mom would be like, hey,

769
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:27,830
give your sister a goodnight.

770
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,060
And then he would go and mouth kiss
sister goodnight and then goodnight dad,

771
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,780
mouth kiss, dad mouth kiss mom.
What's a weird one too? I've had,

772
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:41,781
it happened only a few times but kind
of had some high society girls that are

773
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,720
like theirs that they're friends.
It's not a dating thing.

774
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,350
Greet you with mouse case.

775
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,770
Not that I know I've had it
before too where you go like,

776
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,840
and what I mean by high society is,

777
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:58,841
you know like a fluent types who like
country clubbers who greet you with mouth

778
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:04,760
kisses and, and like a, they do
with all their friends, you know,

779
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,180
friends.
I do think family,

780
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,630
especially opposite sex
might be a little hanky. No,

781
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:15,080
I'll say I think it's kind
of odd in my family though,

782
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,870
we bathed together and we
have for years and you know,

783
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:21,620
when I go home and I see my folks will
take a bath, I took a shower together.

784
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,430
Well a lot of times I'll tell you
what, my mom and dad and we, you know,

785
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:29,300
we soap each other up, but it's like
I've just never thought twice about it.

786
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:30,620
Family shower.
Well,

787
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:35,570
in California two we have strict water
regulations and I remember in college

788
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:37,670
when I would go home, uh, if I brought,

789
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,670
like sometimes my friends would
come with me, it'll be my dad,

790
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,870
myself and my friend.

791
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,860
We'd all take a shower or bath together
and that was just how we do things.

792
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,690
And then sometimes when you pooped,

793
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,070
your dad would poop in between your
legs or I would put it between his legs.

794
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:53,480
That's right.
So we poop at the same time,

795
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,870
which is also a nice water
saver to water saver. But again,

796
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,880
some people think that's weird.
Sure.

797
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,720
I mean that's just how we do
it in our house. I don't know.

798
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,460
My family was not affectionate either,

799
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:08,570
but I think the mouth kiss would fucking
Allen like that to you with hung goes,

800
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,980
you guys do cheek kisses shakes.
Yeah.

801
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,960
You give one to sometimes a
third I've seen have been, uh,

802
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,090
I think in Spain it was
always two, one, two,

803
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:19,640
and then there's places where you
do three, one, two, three. It was a,

804
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,450
I think the Swiss do three. Yes. Yeah.

805
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:27,150
Hungarians you say that's
a lot of work by the

806
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,860
stupid Poussey for people don't
know is kissing. Yes, yes. Yeah,

807
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:37,530
I do. Um, I think one, two, three
is a lot of work too much. Come on.

808
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,720
And I didn't like kissing Hungarian guys
growing up because they were a lot of

809
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:45,260
aftershave. And I remember
like my dad's friends would be,

810
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,340
have really greasy,
smelly cheeks and then they kiss you,

811
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:53,660
they kissed you as a kid and then you
smell like what that fucking hongos face

812
00:52:53,661 --> 00:52:56,420
smelled like.
You know the Argentine men,

813
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,660
you kiss each other the same
way because in like in Peru,

814
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,100
it's only opposite sexes that greet
with a kiss. The Argentinians,

815
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:08,390
the men do it to each other. That's
fucking gay too. Yeah, it's Super Gay.

816
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,830
I thought. So the first time it
happened, I pulled back and uh, my,

817
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,350
one of my cousins was like, I dunno,
this is, I was like, Nah, Bro.

818
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,780
And then he grabbed her nuts and then
he's like, let it go, relax. And no,

819
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,810
Hungarians are way too homophobic
for that shit. They'd be like,

820
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:28,370
fuck you fucking me. Kiss me,
kiss my Dick. Right now. Yeah,

821
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,730
no way, Bro. Here's some foreigners. These
guys are, let's see. This is the, uh,

822
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,120
the shepherds,
Bush Raiders rugby team.

823
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,180
They are an Australian rules
football team based in London.

824
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,490
Apparently this speech helped him out.
Account a comeback.

825
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,880
I love this type of sports shit.

826
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,113
Yes.

827
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,463
Fuck these cuts.

828
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,560
That's what I'm asking

829
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,900
God, these guys. But he's saying
these cunts, which I respect. Yeah.

830
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,410
They came down,

831
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,460
there were 48 points down in the second
quarter and they won by two after that

832
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:45,680
cut speech. Wow. Yeah. See,

833
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:50,520
I feel like I would just
talk that way normally. Yeah.

834
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,710
Doc was like, those are the kinds
of speeches I'd be giving. Normally.

835
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,760
You'd just talk like that. I feel like
that's the kind of fiery need to win.

836
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,440
You know? That's how I talked to
myself before I go up on stage.

837
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,510
Fucking cons is fine. Take this. You
take care of yourself down before you go.

838
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,940
Do you really need that? No. No,
no, but I can't be in a good mood.

839
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,230
I can't feel good about
myself or feel, um, happy.

840
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,410
We have a hundred percent
opposite requirements.

841
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,640
What do you do?
I don't like go.

842
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:26,570
I've obviously you've everyone who's
done it this long has gone on stage with

843
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:29,630
the full spectrum of
feelings. So I know, you know,

844
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,250
I've gone on stage in a horrible mood.
I've gone on stage and a great, uh,

845
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:38,270
I think I'm a much better show and a
better comic when I'm in a great mood and

846
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:43,440
when I feel loose and I'm laughing about
stuff, I think I'm a better comic. Yeah.

847
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,350
Um, but some people, you
know that energies is weird
on that doesn't work for me.

848
00:55:48,351 --> 00:55:50,000
I have to feel miserable,

849
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,530
have to feel a little self loathing
and I ha I just have to get,

850
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:57,620
it's like it's not that I'm really
feeling that way but because I'm a pretty

851
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:01,040
happy person actually.
But from my comedy brain to flip over,

852
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,580
I have to go in there before I can get up.
It's like a weird thing.

853
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:06,890
I have to switch into that mode.
I can't,

854
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,810
I can't just be like happy go lucky and
go up there cause I won't focus. I won't,

855
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,040
I won't be funny. I don't know why
you won't be funny if you, if I go up,

856
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:19,490
they're happy, everything's
great. It doesn't work for me.

857
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,060
I have to get content out
to get miserable. It's just
how, it's just how it goes.

858
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,320
It goes, I got to my
Tonya Harding, I gotta,

859
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,160
I gotta fight the imaginary, uh, you know,

860
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,360
mom figure I think is what's happening.
Honestly, I got to prove somebody wrong.

861
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,990
I'm so crazy. My brain. I
got it. Yeah, it's a lot.

862
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,300
Well, it's a, it's a lot
only for comedy, but I don't,

863
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:43,630
I don't do it in my regular life,

864
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:47,920
but I just know like that's where I have
to access to do the thing that I do.

865
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,810
You know what he's,
what do you say to yourself?

866
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,670
What if you're in a good mood? Yeah.
Then I have to talk myself down too.

867
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,070
I mean I just have to get,

868
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:04,630
I have to remind myself of the harder
times to stand up and when I used to have

869
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:08,230
to fight for the audience to pay
attention to me. And if I like,

870
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:12,130
I have to go to a like Toledo
comedy connection with two axes.

871
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:13,060
When I was opening,

872
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:17,710
it was an opening act and I'm eating
fucking Nachos for dinner and I'm staying

873
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:22,500
in a motel. I just remember
those times when you really,

874
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,880
you deliberately take yourself. Yes,
I do. I have to go back to like the,

875
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,540
the grime and the hard stuff.
I don't know. And then the
performance feels better.

876
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,970
Yeah. It's like Rodney, no respect. Think.

877
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,910
Imagine if Friday went up there
and was like, everything's great.

878
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,610
My wife loves me, my kids
respect me. It just wouldn't be,

879
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,290
I think for me how I'm funny is to
be just a little miserable, a little,

880
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,770
a little saucy. Right. I
have to be a little spicy,

881
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,720
by the way,
I didn't even see that this was here.

882
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:52,630
We were discussing the pronouns earlier.
Um,

883
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,640
I worked for a Social Services Agency and
recently my agency forced all staff to

884
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:01,090
declare our gender
pronouns, public emails. Oh,

885
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,740
can coworkers and anyone in the
public we might email. Well,

886
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:08,950
I support individuals rights to declare
their own identity and pronouns.

887
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,660
I feel like this top down decision is way
overreaching plus for the people still

888
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:14,500
nervous about it.

889
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,860
My work is basically forcing them to
make a decision they may not be ready to

890
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,760
make.
That's interesting.

891
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:23,770
I wanted to hear your thoughts before I
sent her a long email about my thoughts.

892
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,160
Hi, how are you? What's your
name? What's Your Pronoun?

893
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,970
Well, here's the thing about
gender identity is that it's fluid.

894
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:35,620
So what you may want to say
to HR is today I'm, I'm a her.

895
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,750
Tomorrow I could flux and be a hero

896
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,420
is actually an excellent point. Thank
you. Would I would highlight, I would,

897
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,830
I would make that an even bigger
point and say, um, you know,

898
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:49,910
I don't appreciate being forced.
Ooh,

899
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,200
good declaration right now.

900
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:56,690
Although I see that you're doing it so
that people who have made their pronouns

901
00:58:56,691 --> 00:59:00,120
decision can let people know.
And people can not offend them.

902
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:05,121
But one of the things that really bothers
me is as a gender fluid individual,

903
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,990
um, I am only into using
this pronoun for the moment.

904
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,890
That doesn't mean that at all. Like it
tomorrow or even by the end of this email.

905
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,100
Exactly our hourly,
I can change my gender.

906
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,960
You could also speak for others and say,

907
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:22,070
and others also have the right to
change their pronouns on a regular

908
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,490
basis.

909
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:26,420
Here's the way I suggest that this email
go out at the beginning of each day.

910
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,380
I would go a step
farther. Every hour. Yeah.

911
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,240
Hourly and update as to what
everyone's pronouns are.

912
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:36,290
So nobody's affected negatively. When
somebody miss identifies their pronouns.

913
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:38,780
What's Your Pronoun? Yeah,
maybe keep up. I Dunno.

914
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,550
Like we used to have these
when I worked in offices,

915
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:42,380
you know the messenger window.
Yeah.

916
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,280
And whoever's fluxing at the
moment can update the entire staff.

917
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,690
So we all so nobody gets their feelings
hurt when there are misidentified. Yeah,

918
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,630
that's true.
It's so complicated.

919
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:59,260
Mistake. It's very, you
know what? It is. Logical.

920
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,960
Makes Sense. Makes a lot
of sense. It's a good one

921
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,440
way to spend the HR energy.
You know what I'm saying?

922
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,340
Corporate energy needs to be spent on,
on pronouns and identify them.

923
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,620
Yeah. Um, what is this world?

924
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,350
Mommy's loved the show.
Can't wait to see Tom and Omaha.

925
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:22,070
I have a story about my cousin who was
born with six toes on his left foot. Yeah.

926
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,670
When they went to the doctor to get it
removed, they cut off the wrong tone.

927
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,730
Shut up. So instead of
cutting off the outside Pinky,

928
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:32,090
which I don't know what you call that,
the cut off the actual pinky toe. No,

929
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,721
look at his foot.

930
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:37,721
He has a two inch gap between the ring
toe and his pinkie and being the mess of

931
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:40,970
person I am. I would laugh
every time I saw it. Sure.

932
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,850
Fuck all the haters and the cross eyed
doctor who can't tell the difference

933
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:48,590
between a regular tow and the extra
one, Billy Jesus. That's bad luck.

934
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,580
How does that happen?

935
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:52,430
You don't have like a big marker
that you point to the fucking thing.

936
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:53,650
Yeah, I will. I've read,

937
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,650
I've seen that in movies where people
put an x on the leg they're supposed to

938
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:59,340
have amputated just to make
sure. Yeah. Yeah, I do.

939
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,060
How do you get the wrong one off dude?

940
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:05,670
I Dunno. Fuck that. I remember
in town it was Tampa. Um,

941
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,980
it was a big, it was a, it
became a national story,

942
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:10,490
but it was a guy who was supposed
to have his leg amputated.

943
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,110
Amputated the wrong one. Yeah. Cool. So
he became a double amputee. God dammit.

944
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:19,290
Hang on. Oh one sucks. But
at least it's, you know,

945
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,980
survivable kind of.
Yeah.

946
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,080
Yeah. Cause you, your equilibrium will
be off with the, with a missing toe,

947
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:25,914
but you won't be

948
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,850
completely horrible. Or at least
that guy, the guy who, you know,

949
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:33,050
I'm sure one of those last thoughts.
And last they said it was like, hey,

950
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,240
at least you'll still have one leg.
And he was a true,

951
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:39,860
and then you wake up and they're like big,
actually

952
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,400
I second sake you're going to lose both.

953
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:46,900
But also we're going to give you like
$6 million. And he was like, all right,

954
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,890
for, is that worth it? Does that mean,

955
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,300
what dollar amount would that
be worth to you? I'd be super,

956
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:59,740
do you know that's how the
law works though. The idea
is to make you whole, again,

957
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:03,610
that's the phrase I used in my two weeks
in law school to make somebody whole

958
01:02:03,611 --> 01:02:06,800
again. And what that means is
monetary compensation. It's,

959
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:10,570
that's literally what they're doing is
like we'll just fill up the leg hole with

960
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,140
money.
Oh

961
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,280
that um,

962
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,580
those monetary settlements
are based on the,

963
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,093
you have

964
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,850
and your ability to earn
money. So like when, right.

965
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:27,060
Tracy Morgan was in that huge accident
with the Walmart driver. Oh, right, right,

966
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:29,640
right, right. He, you know, the
terms has never been released,

967
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:34,641
but it's been a reported
that his settlement amount
is astronomical because he's

968
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,430
earned,
you know,

969
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:43,431
he's worth a lot of money
and the potential earnings
that they could affect when

970
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:49,150
he was out of commission are
off the chain to diminish.

971
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:53,370
How would it affect it as potential
turning and you saw it like with him,

972
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:55,860
they don't go like,
like for a regular Joe they might say,

973
01:02:55,861 --> 01:02:59,970
we'll give you $5 million. Right, okay.
Yeah. And with him it's many, many,

974
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:04,590
many times. That's his definition of
making him exactly, which is just money,

975
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,700
which is bananas to me.
I would also throw in stuff like,

976
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,590
I mean like if you got murdered by
someone, like I be like, I want to,

977
01:03:12,591 --> 01:03:16,200
I want that guy to apologize to me every
morning I wanted to come to my house

978
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,260
and like get down on his knees and
beg forgiveness and stuff like that.

979
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,230
Like what is this like for instance carry,

980
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:26,600
you just demand that whoever did the
wrong common repent like every morning to

981
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:30,120
you don't think you can do that.
I'd like to, if someone murdered,

982
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:35,120
did you see that guy
that wanted to kill the,

983
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:39,900
the in the courtroom? Who is it? It's
that famous trial and he's like to the,

984
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,900
to the judge, like can I spend
some time alone with this man?

985
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,360
The one that was at the coach
that was molesting? Yeah.

986
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:48,560
The doctor that the USA
gym and then he took off,

987
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,880
tried to attack them and the,
yeah,

988
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:55,650
the cops tackled them and yeah,
but that was great. He's like,

989
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,620
can I have money alone in the room
with this guy? And she was like, no.

990
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,340
It's like I was going to do it
anyway. You like good for you. Yeah,

991
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:06,060
totally understandable. Was even held in
contempt or like, I don't know, probably.

992
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,570
I'm sure it's one of those things
where they have to, you know,

993
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,630
protect any citizen from that happening.
They pry pull 'em back and they're like,

994
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:18,840
that's $5. Yeah. It's all good man. I wish
we could give you five minutes with him.

995
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:23,160
Yeah, yeah. God Damn. Doctor Nassar. Yes.

996
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:24,960
What a scumbag.
He was like,

997
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,620
he molested sexually abuse
like hundreds of girls,

998
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:33,690
so horrible real piece of
garbage. Um, this was great.

999
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,720
This is from super bowl
week. Uh, this is a guy,

1000
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:41,910
his name was Al Sean Jeffries and I
think he played college ball at South

1001
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,280
Carolina, if I remember
correctly. Plays for Philadelphia.

1002
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,800
And one of the big things about
the super bowl is you have,

1003
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,530
it's basically media week.
There's a lot of hype around the game.

1004
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,940
So the guys have to do media day and
there's just all these things around the

1005
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:57,600
game and he could not be less interested.

1006
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,590
And you could tell that when he's being
interviewed. I mean, this is just magic.

1007
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:02,940
I love shit like this.

1008
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:07,480
We were talking to lane earlier and he
said that he and the team and everybody's

1009
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,980
trying to keep this as
normal of a week as possible,

1010
01:05:09,981 --> 01:05:11,990
but this is anything but normal.

1011
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,200
How much fun is this and how much are
you enjoying this experience so far?

1012
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,730
All right, misty. God
Man, this shit terrible.

1013
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,980
Donatos I find that we
could have stayed in Philly.

1014
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,010
Come on Friday or Saturday.

1015
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:29,060
Yeah. Love it. I love it. Totally
honest. Yeah. He's not doing the,

1016
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:32,000
um, the answer that they want you to
like the NFL wants. You'd be like,

1017
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:34,250
this is great, man.
I'm having so much fun.

1018
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,430
Then you wouldn't get to see Timberlake
and all the other celebrities.

1019
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,780
It's part of the experience,
right? Uh, you're a normal person.

1020
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:46,440
Then he bleeds just like, I believe
he got through. It was just like, so,

1021
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:49,530
I mean he's, he's a celebrities
to you. I mean, hats off to him.

1022
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:52,740
I listen to his music. I'm here,
great guy. I mean great artists,

1023
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:56,340
but I'm here to play football.
I care less about other shit.

1024
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,950
Agreed.
It's such a great answer.

1025
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,960
Did you see the temperature for Game
Day on Sunday? Can we plant indoors? Oh,

1026
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:11,900
she wear outside though. How
would that affect it? I mean,

1027
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,530
we'll be here. It makes sense. The
headache calling New York, right?

1028
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,740
I don't think super. We'll
be here. Fair enough.

1029
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,300
Yeah. Good for him though.
He's got a point. I mean,

1030
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:27,330
do you see the temperature for it?
We're playing indoors. Doesn't matter.

1031
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:30,750
What if you weren't, I think those
hypothetical's it's like what?

1032
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:35,130
But can you imagine if you guys weren't
allowed to wear helmets on Sunday? Yeah.

1033
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:39,000
That would be crazy. I mean, yeah, don't
bother me. The temperature doesn't matter,

1034
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:39,420
dude.

1035
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,570
You know what I was thinking about these
athletes and they're traveling to China

1036
01:06:42,571 --> 01:06:45,000
and even these guys would
have to play foosball.

1037
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,540
I mean more time you could spend at home
sleeping normally eating normal food,

1038
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,740
you know,
not in a hotel room.

1039
01:06:52,741 --> 01:06:56,190
When you can't sleep and
they're disrupting their lives,

1040
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:59,860
they're not going to be in optimal
shape. The distraction, you know,

1041
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,620
the potential for distractions
is the big thing. Yeah.

1042
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:07,050
That's really what the worry is
when you play in these games. No,

1043
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,920
it's just sad it he's right. Let me stay
home. I can be with my fucking family.

1044
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,830
There's a double pipe validity questions
here. Okie dokie. Let's see. Hey,

1045
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,960
Hitler's today at work had a double pike
classic for the first time in two years.

1046
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:22,740
I have a question about its validity.
I had been chewing gum all day. Oh,

1047
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,110
interest heard acts as a laxative.

1048
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:29,220
So does it count if my body was getting
a little help from a possible laxative,

1049
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,990
fuck me, piss on me and beat me. John. No,
chewing gum is not a laxative. It's not.

1050
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,870
I thought he was going to say
it probably contributed. Um,

1051
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,810
and he'd be correct in assuming too.
Maybe that burp. No error. These,

1052
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:45,630
you're chewing and you're swallowing
air cause somebody beat me. Um,

1053
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,940
I think it's definitely still a double
pipe. I mean everybody who has one,

1054
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:55,590
nope, ate or drank and has
some ahead of time, you know,
you can't listen. But he's,

1055
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,640
this person is saying that they've kind
of enhanced the odds of having a double

1056
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:03,240
pipe in it and that's manipulating the
score. I'm sorry, I don't agree with that.

1057
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,980
That's like saying I chew gum,

1058
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:09,210
I had a can of beans and then I drink soda
and then I had a double pipe. Classic.

1059
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:11,000
Well yeah,
because you're manipulating.

1060
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:14,520
Definitely still count because people eat
beans and drink so it all the time and

1061
01:08:14,521 --> 01:08:17,450
it doesn't because you're
still like the air.

1062
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:20,170
It's not that that air is going to
come out because you ate a drink.

1063
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,990
That's why you have that gas buildup.
It's that they came out at the same time.

1064
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:28,370
If they really did BURP Fart, same time,
then you had one, well let me tell him,

1065
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:32,570
this is not a sneeze.
Take steroids and you win the race.

1066
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,910
Is that still going to be winning?

1067
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:39,530
And I think that if the double pipe
classic occurs in nature, it's natural.

1068
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:43,300
It happens without forcing
it. You're like, no,

1069
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,480
I think it's equivalent to using steroids.
What do you mean the 20 friends?

1070
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,590
Anything that you eat is going to affect
your gas. So then you're saying like,

1071
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:55,660
okay, I had a Tacos for lunch as
account. No, because you had to go.

1072
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,380
But we're talking about gaming the system,

1073
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:03,260
talking about purposely loading up on
re fried beans and purposely drinking a

1074
01:09:03,261 --> 01:09:07,580
lot of soda to create the effect of the
double pipe. That's what I'm saying.

1075
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:11,450
I'm not saying you happen to have
tacos and that's a different thing.

1076
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,610
I'm saying this person,
this person is saying they're forcing it.

1077
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,970
They didn't say I forced, they said I
had gum and then something happened.

1078
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:22,700
It is a rare event and you get credit.
It was a double pipe classic. Uh,

1079
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,170
you did it John.
You did it all right.

1080
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,790
That's what you think. I, you know,

1081
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:33,620
potato Patato I think it should occur
without interference. Do so when,

1082
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:37,210
when like let's say he's like, I had
a coke before, does it count now?

1083
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,860
It doesn't count either. Like what,
what can be hearsay? Here's what,

1084
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,680
here's what it'll count. It's fine if it's
just a coke. Okay, let's just say no, no.

1085
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:50,240
I'll tell you why. Yes, yes, you
may. You may increase the Burbage,

1086
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,690
but you're not. It's not going to affect
your [inaudible]. Now, if you were,

1087
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:57,650
say I ate a bunch of re fried beans and
dried apricot and then I loaded up on

1088
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:57,980
coke.

1089
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:02,210
You're trying to game the system and at
delet pipe classic has to kind of happen

1090
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,290
organically. You cannot force it.
You just can't unreal and if you do,

1091
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:09,530
it's cheating. I don't think that's fair.
I don't think that's right. I would say,

1092
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,200
what is,
I'm going to go out and say this.

1093
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,590
I don't think you should be able to
weigh in on this if that's your logic.

1094
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:19,310
I mean you're like one of those corrupt
referees that's also betting on games.

1095
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,700
Okay. Now I know a lot of people
have been writing about last week's.

1096
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:25,010
Would you rather we did.
Would you rather,

1097
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:30,011
all the music you listened to is the
song the heat is on or all the movies you

1098
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:32,000
watch be sister,

1099
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:36,240
act two and now people run back in the
habit if you don't mind doing the full

1100
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:40,550
time. Sorry. Uh, and people
were like, Christina,

1101
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,570
what about when the music happens in
the film? Is that the heat is on? No,

1102
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,360
those are two separate things.
If you're,

1103
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:51,530
if you chose the only film you can
watch is distract too back in the habit,

1104
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:55,010
you're entitled to all the tunes
and all the music you will hear.

1105
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:57,290
It just drags you back in the habit.

1106
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:01,560
It's not that you'll hear the
anxious all the time. Yeah. So, but,

1107
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,260
but they're saying if you chose the ages,
oh,

1108
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,990
as your only music than if you're watching
sister act to will you hear the h is

1109
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:12,800
oh, oh, that's interesting. Well then
that would be, yes. Sorry, sorry.

1110
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:17,100
So I'm, I'm fucking flipping here.
Well, let's say you choose the Hso.

1111
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:21,390
Every form of music you hear will be,
the heat is on.

1112
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,540
So you watched sister out to as you
get to watch. No. But that's the thing.

1113
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:25,980
You get to watch whatever
movie you want now,

1114
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,900
but any form of music you hear
will be the heat is on. Right.

1115
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,150
So in the movie sister act too, they
could be singing. Hallelujah. Jesus.

1116
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:35,790
But you're going to hear the
heat is on because you're,

1117
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:39,570
the only songs you can hear are the
heat is on. You don't want, I'm sorry.

1118
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:43,920
So you don't get to think you're confused
by the question now what be initially

1119
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:47,850
it was if you choose one or the
yes. Sorry, I'm confused if you,

1120
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,330
if you pick songs. Okay. If you pick,

1121
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,440
I get to listen to any music
I want. Right, right, right.

1122
01:11:53,441 --> 01:11:58,090
And you're only movie his sister act too.
Back in the habit.

1123
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:01,810
Okay. Yes. Then you can
listen to any music you want.

1124
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,830
You only get one fellow sister act to,
Oh hey, sorry. Go ahead. Quite yet. Okay.

1125
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,730
If you pick, I can listen
to any music. Sorry.

1126
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:13,090
You're only movie his sister. Act
correctly. Correct. Back in the habit.

1127
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:16,090
You can listen to any
music you want after that,

1128
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,880
but you can never watch any TV or films.

1129
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:22,330
You only get to watch sister act too
back in the habit and you get it.

1130
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,920
It's an in it's entirety.
Okay. The way it's performed.
Okay. If you pick, I don't,

1131
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,530
I'd rather have the other choice.
In other words,

1132
01:12:29,531 --> 01:12:33,460
I'd rather be able to watch any film.
Right. Then you only get one song.

1133
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,740
In that case, the only music you
ever hear is the ages. Oh, okay.

1134
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,010
Right. Yeah, that's, that's
good. Yeah. That makes sense.

1135
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:46,260
Does that answer the question
though? Yeah, I think so. Um,

1136
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,400
all right.
Is there anything else Jean?

1137
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:54,090
I don't think so. I mean, I
got to get a deli meat scale.

1138
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:58,070
That's right.
Am I get my hands on one of those?

1139
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,050
We should just look on Amazon. See
if it's possible. Look at that.

1140
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,960
We've got a ways. Our banner. Yeah.
I mean we gotta be able to wait.

1141
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,570
