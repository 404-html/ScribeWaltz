York titties coming over here.

him and his little curls.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,600
Well that'd be here very shortly. We've
been friends in the area for a long time.

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,580
He's been our guy long time.

East Coast airy

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,600
and a strange ranger.
I can't wait to hear what he's been up to.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,650
Definitely got a weird something
going on. What's going on? Well,

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,460
let's start this show. Let's get
into, sure, sure, sure. Jean shirt.

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,620
Play with our genes,
our genes. These chicks.

15
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:09,630
I'll do anything for a buck.
Horny.

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,460
Bored housewives are waiting
and you watch these bitches.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,020
Big Black Cocks.
How do they do it?

18
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah,

19
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,430
try it out. You made such a dad face
like you are like a dad playing a guitar.

20
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,200
I was jamming out with because Lou
reed. Hey Lou reed. I don't hate him,

21
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,410
but um,
I love the velvet underground.

22
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,530
I likely read and were affected
when he died. I was, cause I,

23
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,540
I like the velvet underground more than
I liked his independent stuff. Yeah.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,680
But when he died you were
very disrespectful. Oh,
you were so disrespectful.

25
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:01,830
You were like, fuck Lou Reed.
I don't know what put him,

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,740
I don't give a show Ballou poker
room. A bus driver from the Bronx. Now

27
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,760
you are pretty much like that.
You're like, fuck that guy.

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,570
I don't like his fuck his shit.
No, I wasn't wearing, you're very,

29
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:18,620
I don't like his fucking Shit fucking
shit. But you were, you're just very like,

30
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,000
ah, I don't care. That sounds more like
me, Lou Reed, whatever. I don't care.

31
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,840
That sounds like, I think because
you don't like good things.

32
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:30,650
Like you don't like good music.
Right. The way I like good stuff

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
so far,
so far argument.

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,780
We were in the car and there's like two
songs in your whole iTunes library that

35
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:42,540
I really like and the rest I'm like,
is this real or do they just pull one

36
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,760
gifted me tones.
But you listen to like mall music,

37
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:52,040
like the shit they play an h and m,

38
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,430
that's the shit that's in your
iTunes like Rihanna or fucking like,

39
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:02,080
I know a lot of people like, and I
don't, I'm, I'm ashamed to say I don't,

40
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,130
I couldn't name tell me the story
again of me that waking up last year,

41
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,180
the worst. You're such an
asshole. You're the worst.

42
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,990
So our child, our infant was
crying at two 30 in the morning.

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,140
First child was crying it one
hour before you and I being super,

44
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,710
super preggers at we, we sleep upstairs,
the baby's downstairs. So I was like,

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,770
I don't want to get up, go
downstairs. It's hard for me
to lift him at this point.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
So woke you up on the first cry in
a fucking deep sleep on that one.

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,730
You always in a deep sleep. Okay.
So, oh no, I'll throw up. And um,

48
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,330
so the second crying fit of
crying comes and I sleep light.

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm immediately awake.
The dogs are up there like who's crying?

50
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,820
The whole house is up except for you.
You're in a deep snore

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,430
and I can't reach over to
touch you because I have
that pregnancy pill that I'm

52
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:02,110
in Cayston. I can't like touch you
too far from me. And so I'm like Tom,

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,690
Tom, Tom and I keep getting
louder and I go, Tom Segura,

54
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,500
Tom Cigar, Tom Cigarette.
I'm like screaming.

55
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,600
The dogs are like jumping up and down,

56
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,130
like freaked out and you're
just sawing away. I'm like,

57
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,430
this is on fucking bully of
all. I didn't hear a thing. No,

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,670
because you're in such a coma.
And thankfully he stopped crying.

59
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,400
He put himself back to sleep.
But I was like, this is

60
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,280
the thing is you get a little
adrenaline when you first jump.

61
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,480
Like when I went down at one 30 you have
a little adrenaline to get up out of

62
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:39,470
sleep and go down to,
you know,

63
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,780
to pick up your kid. Right? So I went
and I went down there. I was like, Ooh.

64
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,820
And I remember when I sat in the
chair with him, I was like, Oh shit,

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,830
like I'm half asleep right
now. And he went, he,

66
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,390
he chilled back down pretty easily.
But when I got back to bed,

67
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,450
man,
that really,

68
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,210
you're so ridiculous.
I,

69
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,920
I sang it just as easy as
I have no recollection of
this obviously. No, I know.

70
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,200
And I was like,
I can't believe he's sleeping straight.

71
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,540
You were ripping through it.
I love it.

72
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,240
You said my full name course.

73
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Thompson Thompson hoping that maybe
you thought I was referring to.

74
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:21,070
I had indifferent Tom in the room
and you were like, that can't be me.

75
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,450
That's not my thought with me here.
It so fucking crazy dude.

76
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,890
How you deep you are.
You're such a deep sleeper.

77
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,420
But it's good cause I get up every
hour to p practically and I'm like, Oh,

78
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm just waking this
poor guy up all night.

79
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
Don't remember fully disrespecting this
guy. When he died, he did not like him.

80
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,020
How would, I don't even know
Yana, any super fans. I think

81
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,420
I,
I know I have a somewhat of recollection.

82
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,040
I think what happened to be fair
is that when he died and was like,

83
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,550
what's he known for? I was
like, oh, I don't care for
that. Like, whatever he did,

84
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,930
I don't care for.
So,

85
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,930
oh,
it doesn't on the wild

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,920
side. And I don't look at
it, I'm saying I, I'm like,

87
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,760
I don't care for it. It doesn't affect
me. No. And therefore his death is like,

88
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,780
you know, I'm not happy he's dead, but
I'm just saying like, you know, no,

89
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,720
you were a little hostile. It was
that. Yeah, it was a day for you.

90
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,110
It was an off day. I think maybe
you were taking it out on Lou Reed.

91
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,200
Really Yanas out there listening.
Uh,

92
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:26,201
if y'all could reference said episode
and question super fans out there,

93
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,100
we could dig up that audio blue band
and we could replay your reaction to Lou

94
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,070
Reed's dad. I don't know how this
came to us, but this is from, oh,

95
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:37,850
you're just changing the subject just
so that this is a Lou Reed. Oh, oh,

96
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm sorry. I don't know how
this, this video came to us,

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,600
but this is a special feature from the
thinking triple x DVD featuring Lou Reed,

98
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:49,601
very reading various taglines
from tricolor triple x
movies and advertisements.

99
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,710
Right. Cool. Why this is in our inbox,
but I like it. Yeah, you like it.

100
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,050
There's no reason for me to read the
title of the piece. I love the title.

101
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,270
Welcome Lou. Sure, sure. Welcome.
Little pause. Yeah. Really welcome.

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Low by Lou Reed. Yeah.
Welcome Lou by Lew. Hey Lew.

103
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,020
These chicks,
I'll do anything for a buck horny.

104
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,600
Bored housewives are waiting from you.

105
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,100
Watch these bitches be Ainley destroyed.
Big Black Cocks.

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,720
How do they do it in the same
penetration is a fucking baseball bat.

107
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,590
No bullshit.
These horny women will do anything.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,790
Why be alone?

109
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,850
Japanese hardcore anime and Ken Tie Art
Nasty and the 25,000 x x x by today's

110
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,390

111
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,450
These women will moan for you the flesh
pussy tighter and better than the real

112
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,980
thing and they won't Tom back.
It's

113
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,740
real nice when they do the voiceover
with a toothpick in his guy was just

114
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:54,870
thinking that that was very distracting.
I mean, you know, you know what, honestly,

115
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,880
not enunciating the way you should
be with to in your mouth. No.

116
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,650
You know who hates toothpick users?
Your dad hates them. Yeah. Like,

117
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,930
since I was a little kid would point out,

118
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,590
look at this fucking asshole with his
fucking tooth. Picky thinks is cool.

119
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,220
And he just had the such disdain
for this Kinda toothpick thing.

120
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,190
Like where it's hanging. Yeah.
Yeah. Hanging out of your mouth.

121
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,440
He said you look so stupid to picking
the food out of his mouth to the fucking

122
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,000
toothpick. Why? Why there to
stay pluralize it toothpicks.

123
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,450
Why do you think you're still upset?
I don't know.

124
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:29,530
He must've had some early childhood
experience with toothpicks that stuck with

125
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:34,400
it. Excuse me. That's pregnant
vomiting and my own mouth. Um,

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,550
I don't know. He, he just felt it
was very American and very crass.

127
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,590
You think I'm not a big tooth pick
user or, you know, I mean, I, I will,

128
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,780
if I'm leaving a place as I'm leaving,

129
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:50,200
if I feel like I need it and they have
them, I'll do that for that moment.

130
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,120
You know, like if you don't
know, I feel something here,

131
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,490
but I'm not always getting toothpicks.

132
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,600
I feel like they don't really
do adult job around with them.

133
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,040
Like this fucking jackass.
Oh, there's a disdain, right?
You go there it goes. Yeah.

134
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,020
I don't think they do much.

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,680
I feel like they just pushed the
food further in between your teeth.

136
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,840
Level of disrespect for the
people that asked me to come in.

137
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,780
I'm gonna do a voice over with it.
Toothpick in my mouth. I agree.

138
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,810
Well he's Lou Reed, man. I know, but why
don't you start chewing gum? I'd be like,

139
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:19,860
I'm going to do the fucking
voiceover chewing gum. Quiet. Hey,

We cut their hair short.

144

156
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,810
Then when I went to shit,

Yeah. Looks like if I took the
tooth pick out he did. Yeah.

choice there. Real Nice. Real Nice.

died. Yeah, I didn't care. Wow.

172
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,490
I can't wait until Skinner dies.
And you start crying rivers. Who?

173
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,650
Leonard Skinner. I cry about that. Well,

were like, you had, first of all,

175
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,590
I've never heard a full Leonard
Skinner and song in my life. Yeah.

176
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,420
You played it for me. What did you play?
Free Bird, right? I know the title. No,

177
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,070

179
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,400

scanner. Now a shuffle. It's not,

180
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,020
you're acting like you're
grabbing the valley.

181
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:53,460
We don't listen to Leonard Skinner
in the San Fernando Valley. Okay.

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,900
God,
we more class than that.

183
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,880
It's a, here's a sonic Saturday night
special. Okay. I bought that song. Uh,

184
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,040
after hanging out with Joey
Diaz or does he like, yeah,

185
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,940
he played it for me and I bought it. I
liked the song. I like the way it opened.

186
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,190
Can I hate that shit?
That shit is like, yeah,

187
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,510
but you think that I would
be emotionally affected.

188
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,030
They have some like that favor.
You're always playing.

189
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:19,050
Scanning even know the name of
the song you play WWE, we parked,

190
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,990
we were parked in the driveway. I remember
a couple of days ago. And you're like,

191
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,880
this is Leonard. I know,
I know what you're saying,

192
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:27,300
but you're saying that I would be
affected. Yeah, he'd probably cry.

193
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,410
Cause I remember,
you know,

194
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:33,240
every time I hear one of your garbage
music's like that in your iTunes.

195
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,400
Really,
really disrespectful with this shit.

196
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,510
I imagine you in college in
South Carolina, North Carolina,

197
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,320
same thing and the two,
and you,

198
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:44,700
you and your friends are sitting in lawn
chairs and you're drinking your beers

199
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,830
and there's like a barbecue
and then you're like, I
read, I turn that Skinner up.

200
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,360
And then you guys all shares each other
and then you go raping or Oh my God.

201
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,700
Hogging. That's what you called it. When
you go find, you know, big checks. Yeah.

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,130
And then you'd bang her.
Didn't you go hoggin?

203
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,560
No. Who had hogging this kid?
Craig told me about this.

204
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,880
I told you the whole story. He said
he was going Haagen what does that?

205
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,540
And he's like, come on man. You
know what Hoggin is? No, he's great.

206
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,050
You just go try to find the fastest check
you confined Fucker, you know? Yeah.

207
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,130
It's like, whoa. You've never
done that? No, of course not.

208
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,463
No.

209
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,260
Make it a game to hunt for fat chicks.
No.

210
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,460
Rapey isn't as I bag thing to do. And
this guy was your best friend? No,

211
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,500
he's a guy that lived in the dorm.

212
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:39,640
There's a lot of weird fucking
people in that place. Oh

213
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,870
really? Yeah. In North Carolina. No Shit.

214
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,520
We used to call this one kid. What
did we call him? Gray. Here we go.

215
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,240
I call them like n word.
No, what we call them.

216
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:53,750
Like something.
It was something revolting,

217
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,210
like vomit or something
like that was his nickname.

218
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,150
He used to sleep on a
mattress with no sheets.

219
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,200
It was just like gray with stains
and just the most just vile,

220
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,090
really gross people. Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,490
There was definitely gross people all
over that hall and this guy with his

222
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,510
hoggin was pretty gross too.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,190
I, it's so funny, I can't even picture
you living in north cal. Cackle Acca is,

224
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,620
as you say,
I can't picture you being,

225
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,900
I don't mean that there's
gross people in the Carolinas.

226
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,370
There's gross people everywhere. But I
was saying specifically my dorm hall,

227
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,480
just gross people there. Yeah.
There was this one Italian guy,

228
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:37,510
I don't know if I've told the story on
this show, I don't want to say his name,

229
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:41,260
but he was an Italian foreign
exchange student on our hall. Yeah.

230
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,760
And one time he woke up in the middle
of the night and a friend of our saw him

231
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,820
washing his penis in the men's
bathroom and they're like,

232
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,440
what are you doing dude?
He's like, go ahead

233
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,400
to wash him up INA soften to the sink,

234
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,840
wash your Dick off work because he
has an erotic get a wet dream. Yeah.

235
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,980
And he washes pinner off in the all
boys' bathroom or something. It's weird.

236
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,810
I always thought it was weird to
have coed shitters in um, colleges.

237
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,230
They do that. Yeah. We had a
separate, yeah, sort of way.

238
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,050
God see the girl next
door of being pounded.

239
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,830
Ron wanted to shoot it as wide.
All over my big boobs.

240
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,720
I finger myself at the same time,

241
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,560
watch the glory hole and these
bitches don't care who they suck.

242
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,310
Titus has pounded hard, wet
change, homeless black women

243
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,970
beyond that. So awful. Even for me. Jeez.

244
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,790
Yeah. Homeless black women. That was his
breaking point. Yeah. That's funny. Yeah.

245
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:45,110
That's what we liked. That
homeless black women. Yeah.

246
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,910
He's a racist. Right guys? We need
to boycott Lou Reed. He's a racist.

247
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:54,040
It's a really bad thing. Black cocks.
Wherever the social justice warrior. Yeah.

248
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,260
Buzzfeed.
Come on starting article.

249
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,100
Zoom his body and stab him.
Stab him for laughing at that guy.

250
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,690
Shouldn't laugh at certain things. No, you
should not. You should be told when it,

251
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,610
it's okay to laugh and when
it's not okay to laugh.

252
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,360
I believe in that wholeheartedly.
Guys.

253
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,510
Are we mocking the black female
homeless community out there that,

254
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,980
I mean the privilege of that man
has and is unaware of. It's just,

255
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,220
Ooh, I bet he used a gender specific
restroom before he read that too. Yeah,

256
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,950
I know. Yup. How dairy?

257
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,670
Somebody said they had a lung infection,
a picture

258
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,370
mommies. I was listening to episode
four 51 when something big dawned on me.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,540
I couldn't believe how big it was.
My brother wouldn't believe it either.

260
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,040
He has no neuropathy issues.
He believes me now though,

261
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,480
and I'll start when you,

262
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:52,350
Hitler's began mocking that God's given
him raw art form of scatting only to

263
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:57,000
turn around and praise a lung infection.
Ramblings of a desert BG.

264
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,110
It occurred to me that the desert
BG could in fact be scatting.

265
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,580
According to Wikipedia,

266
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,650
scatting is a type of vocal music that
involves using nonsensical syllables to

267
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,100
sing non vocal dance tunes.
In my opinion,

268
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,630
the desert bgs,
lung infection loaded singing is largely,

269
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,520
if not wholly comprised of nonsensical
syllables and non vocal tunes.

270
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,350
What do you think? Anyway, my moose
soup is ready. Got to go. Thanks Zach.

271
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:26,340
Zack Hitler.

272
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,590
Zack, you're, I see your logic.

273
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,910
However it is flawed because we
all know that he's trying to sing,

274
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,930
staying alive.

275
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,350
It's not nonsense gibberish.

276
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,740
It's his version of staying alive.
Yeah. He's saying the words in his mind.

277
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:51,300
He's saying the words right. He's
trying write scat. There's no agenda.

278
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,520
There's no plan and scheme. Yeah, he's

279
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,110
a beeline. Stay be ah, ah,

280
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,880
AH,
stay beeline.

281
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,670
That's true. Well there
you go. There it is.

282
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,390
Who would you rather hang out with?
The No neuropathy guy?

283
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm talking like a hang.

284
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,320
You guys go to a coffee house and you
have just a cup of coffee and you have to

285
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,840
talk and listen to what this guy says.
Yeah.

286
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,920
It's either the known rob Athey four
strokes. Yeah. Or the try it out guy. Oof.

287
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,440
Like you have to really talk to him.
Um,

288
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,240
or better yet you're stuck on an
airplane and it's a cross country flight.

289
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,900
And do we, who are you sitting next
to try it out? Or No neuropathy,

290
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,053
man.

291
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,880
I don't know. For stroke. What is
this for? Stroke. Anthem deal, man.

292
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,270
Somebody gave me a fourth.
Uh,

293
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,950
you're not answering my question.
You're distracted with the soundboard.

294
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,210
So answer my fucking question
either for stroke guy or try it out.

295
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,390
Oh, definitely. Hanging out
with for stroke. I first.

296
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,780
Why definitely you make it sound like
it's a no brainer because it is a no

297
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:18,770
brainer.
Why you could tell that

298
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,930
for stroke guy has like a level
of politeness to him. He's,

299
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,600
he makes points like I'm not trying to
make you do anything you don't want to do

300
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,640
and you don't believe in this.
Don't do it.

301
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,390
I'm not saying to do it anything you're
not uncomfortable with. Like he really,

302
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,930
he has awareness,
social awareness if you will.

303
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,490
He does the, the other. Yeah.

304
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,060
Guy Ipad.
Any kind of direct tau disorder problems.

305
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,840
I mean this guy, he's even
more articulate. It makes
me feel like there's more,

306
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,603
you know,

307
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,160
we don't think the try it out. Guy would
be fun because of the rambling. Yeah.

308
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,330
He'd be like, it's scary. Here's
the deal man. I got way, he's way.

309
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,400
He's way scary. Right. I kinda, I gotta
have this peanuts man. I got my other,

310
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,270
it really smoked with me. He put his dick.
I can't believe how big is stabilized.

311
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,340
He jacked off boards. Yeah, and
shot the most coffee every time. But

312
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,480
here's the problem with this here,

313
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,060
the neuropathy guy is that I have a
feeling he's going to be fixated on this

314
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,000
subject and you're going to have to
hear about the entire flight. Yeah,

315
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,630
but the other guy can't get off
of it. It might snap. He's really,

316
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,710
he's really fucking freaked
out. You know, he's freaked out.

317
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:32,860
But he might have tangent, tangential
thoughts and like interesting studies.

318
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,410
Gross.
I think he's pretty gross.

319
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,130
I think bad things happen when you're
around him. Let's try it out guy.

320
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,910
No fucking way. I take the
try it our guy. You know what?

321
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,460
Why don't want to hear about
him jacking his deck for four.

322
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:46,410
He's only going to talk about Dick Jacks.

323
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,120
That guy's going to talk about
pissing on him and beating.

324
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,800
It's more interesting than
the known neuropathy needs.

325
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:57,940
Know your app and your app and he knows
the mind his business when it's time now

326
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,710
near apathy. The other guy
does not really doesn't. Yeah.

327
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh uh,
oh God.

328
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,730
You're disgusting. Tells me that.
Anyways. Do you think he's right?

329
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,440
No, I don't think that guys right. Zach's
not right. It's not scanning. No, no.

330
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,150
He was singing a fucking sending
a scouting is nonsensical.

331
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,020
It has no plan or rhythm.
It's random,

332
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,510
but that guy is clearly singing a version
of a song. You know what I'm saying?

333
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:31,870
Scat. There's no agenda. It's like
free form that this isn't free for him.

334
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:34,230
This guy has a plan and here's
another one. Dear Tyler,

335
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,830
Christine and I got to pay him.

336
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,480
After recently being the wedding,

337
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,730
I received a thank you
card from her that ended,

338
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,240
you are the reason my husband and I
started fighting in front of each other.

339
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,660
I managed to accomplish just amazing
feat by bringing up my friends,

340
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:52,320
horrible gas to her. Then
boyfriend, when I first met him,

341
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,440
now they consider me the hero
of their love story. Oh Wow.

342
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,670
Seeing as releasing bottom burbs can be
an important milestone in a relationship.

343
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,480
I would love to hear about the first
time you floated Airbus gets in front of

344
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,580
each other. Well, we've
covered this for sure.

345
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,380
You're covering the last
episode and it says,

346
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:09,840
do you think it's possible to go to entire
marriage that letting your mate here

347
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:13,240
a single, but I mean, this is literally
what we just talked about. Um,

348
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,680
well everyone knows the story
of me farting in front of you.

349
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,150
I don't even remember your first part,

350
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,090
truth, nor do why mine was
obviously really impressive, but

351
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,140
I don't recall. But I, you know,

352
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,490
we've been astounded by couples
that don't and don't Brown.

353
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,760
We don't brown in front of each other.
That's the last boundary we've maintained.

354
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:38,360
Really? Yeah, but we talk
about it constantly. We do,

355
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:41,810
but we don't actually like
browns. We just like, yeah,

356
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,270
no part, but I'm not going to shit
in front of you. I personally look,

357
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:51,650
it's not so much about the farting per se.
I feel like it's an intimacy barrier.

358
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,320
Like if you're not farting
in front of each other. Yeah.

359
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,800
Like what else are you lying about?
There you go. It's like lies to me.

360
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,500
It's a great thing to bring up to the
next person that doesn't want to Fart in

361
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:04,580
front of you. Like, why are you lying to
me? Right. It feels like it's not real.

362
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,440
I agree. How do you not for like 20
years, people hold in farts. Nasty.

363
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,110
You Want to take a quick pee break?
Yeah, I got to go see. I see. Yeah.

364
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,890
And we'll wait for Aerie. All
right. Uh, we did it and it's great.

365
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:17,780
We're back with

366
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,660
one and only Joe mother fucker.
Yo are,

367
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,410
you should be here for a second. We've
been so excited to play that drop all day.

368
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,290
I was like, why are you pausing? That's
a weird, oh that's it for hatred,

369
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,440
hatred. I mean what's
better than that guy? Yeah.

370
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,130
What is that from? That's from
Grifols. From Casino Casino. Okay.

371
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,280
Nice talking to cm. Rosene
fuck you mother fucker. Yo.

372
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,270
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fatso
I can't wait for the,

373
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,040
for the fucking liberal
movement to find the,

374
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,920
all square says these old
movies and be like, wait, what?

375
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,100
There's so much to boycott.
We were just talking about that.

376
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:02,570
We played a clip of Lou reed reading a
porno descriptions and I can just see the

377
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:07,040
social justice warriors pain cause
he lacks zoom his body and stab him.

378
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,360
He laughs at one point
he's made laughs uh,

379
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:12,740
black on black homeless
women and they were like,

380
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,810
well now they would just be like,
you know,

381
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,520
hates Titus has pounded hard with change,
homeless black women

382
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,510
beyond that. So awful. And now
they'd be like, is it, is it awful?

383
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,620
Awful though?
Louis a woman who's black,

384
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,310
marginalized by society and homeless
is something to laugh at. Oh,

385
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,120
so we laugh with people
getting downtrodden. Okay,
I see what you're saying.

386
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,770
I see what you're doing that cause
you're rich to think everyone downtrod is

387
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,020
worse. I got it. Bad side,

388
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,290
something to laugh that pull all
of his albums and ruin his career.

389
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,183
I mean are you,

390
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,210
are you kind of going like what the fuck
with how outrageous that shit is now?

391
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,830
Some of it's like naughty and it's the
pressure that's put on everybody to react

392
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:56,670
the same all the time. Right. The guys.

393
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,710
Because then we'll know what team
you're on. I know, but it's like,

394
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,380
it's like with normal people have to
in silence go. I can I talk to you?

395
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,990
I'm sorry. No worries. What
happened to that one guy?

396
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,820
I'm going to see people coming
and pick up your fucking pick it.

397
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,710
Yeah. Well that's crazy. With Elise,

398
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,280
the Chris Hardwick
thing is that that girl,

399
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,820
the accuser just wrote
like a blog essentially.

400
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:24,800
Like it wasn't even a vetted
article in a print. It was like,

401
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,040
Hey, here's just what I think
and then everything's gone.
Everything is just gone.

402
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,370
His careers, everything else.
So I don't think he did.

403
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:35,360
Even in her wish she wrote
it is sexual assault.

404
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:38,600
It's just like I really want to fuck
all the time. And it's like, okay,

405
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:42,710
well no deal from it. She said within two
weeks she was doing everything he said.

406
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,300
So if I'm to believe that there's
this sexual assault that was,

407
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:46,460
he must have a power over here.

408
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,610
So Chris Hardwick must be some sort
of demon or a wizard to be able to,

409
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:56,960
in two weeks for somebody, maybe he's a
pimp with longterm pit. It's like crazy.

410
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,670
It's walk away. Whether or not it's,
it's, it's like not even vetted.

411
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,050
There's no due process.

412
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,710
It's just like this girl says it and
now we don't know her mental state.

413
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,740
She was an actress. They're
all morons. Every one of them.

414
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,650
Even the ones who made it,
they're all fucking loopy.

415
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,770
Dipshits some of them are well read cause
they get a lot of scripts in front of

416
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:20,000
them. They are more Roz. You guys
have met actors, actresses, the guy,

417
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:22,970
actresses of justice,
bad solipsistic garbage.

418
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,080
Everyone's world where it was just them.
What about Johnny Depp's thing?

419
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:31,140
Have you read the recent interviews
of him and being broken? I that,

420
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,700
that's crazy. That's an
actor. You fucking moron.

421
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:41,890
How would you broke? You broke and
part of a franchise. They have the,

422
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,250
he got 30 million a flick

423
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,520
for though. What the fuck you talking
about broke? No, that's not an option.

424
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,780
They uh, they have an email in there from
him, from his business manager to him.

425
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,560
Uh, it's like from when they
were obviously still working
together and he's like,

426
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,250
Hey, I got to give you a warning.
I got to give you a heads up.

427
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,870
The holidays are coming up.

428
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,250
I need you to keep your holiday spending
within reason. And he writes back,

429
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,020
thank you. Uh, I appreciate what you're
saying, but also what am I supposed to do?

430
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,620
It's the holidays.
Have a family.

431
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,360
People rely on, they need
$5 million. He needs boats.

432
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,510
I don't know what else to say to you.
Um,

433
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,850
and he's like, do you want me to sell
art? If not, what do want me to sell it?

434
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:27,600
Like eight question mark.
What do want me to sell

435
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,960
more? It was like, oh, I need
something. Let me pause this.

436
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:36,120
Just a rich version of pawning,

437
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,240
something to be able to afford something
else because of what I can sell it.

438
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,830
Lord. I know his, his is, it really is
though. Like a psychological disorder,

439
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:48,510
I think. Like legit. No, no,
no, because they said, you know,

440
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,310
it is compulsive. Like 2
million a month. Just Bandanas.

441
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:59,310
2 million, $2 million
a month. Wow. I mean,

442
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,430
we're talking about spending $25
million a year and he's just like,

443
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,690
not enough.
I spent like two months,

444
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,970
but we both were in a Hong
Kong and bought suits. Huh. Uh,

445
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,830
I don't know what you spent on the
road I spent, how much did you spend?

446
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:17,040
I think 300 okay. He
went to Singapore. Okay.

447
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,330
He dropped 110 grand on suits. Well, see
if he had just gone across the water.

448
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,780
Hong Kong. I, by the way, when I
heard it was 300 I was like, what?

449
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,360
Tom Road? That'd be like, yeah man,
this is the guy who worked from,

450
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,060
now he's going to fuck you,
make you a nice suit. That's
way less than a thousand.

451
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,840
You're like, oh. I thought it was like 50
bucks just to a hundred grand on suits.

452
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,950
My favorite is 5 million on
shooting hunter s Thompson,

453
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:45,090
his ashes into the sky with a canon.
How much you spend on that?

454
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,960
They claimed that the article claim 3
million and when he was met with that,

455
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,930
he goes, that's bullshit.
It was five to shoot.

456
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,760
You can just get one of those
fucking to shirt cannons. Yeah.

457
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,340
I mean if,
and any type of business owner,

458
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,680
and Johnny Depp comes to
the room and says, Hey,

459
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,920
I'd like to do this thing that really
hasn't been done much, can you do that?

460
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,030
And I just, it my eyes turned to cash
signs and they go, yes, it will cost

461
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,660
5 million.

462
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,690
Try something to cost you 250 bucks.
And he's the guy who's,

463
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,350
who's definitely like whatever
you say. He's like, we got
to do it all right. Yeah,

464
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,330
because he also had emails to her. His
manager was a busy manager, was like,

465
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:41,040
you know, we got it. It can't
do this, this is your behind
on this. And he was like,

466
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,720
I need that house,
make it happen.

467
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,860
We have to have this house because he
bought like all these properties all over

468
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:51,910
the world. I mean, how many
houses? They were like,

469
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:56,080
can you sell your villa in France
that you don't go to? Like, no,

470
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,250
I heard somebody say,
this fucker for first sound like rockstar.

471
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,550
It might've been a beetle, might've been
someone else, but someone like that.

472
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,080
And um, he goes, oh, it was a
rolling stone. And he was like,

473
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,590
don't have too much of a nut.

474
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,650
Don't have your costs be too high because
then you will have to do things in

475
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,300
order to pay for that nut to a hundred
percent what he does. And he goes,

476
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:23,950
not for me. I have three nice
houses, one in New York, one in La,

477
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:28,570
one in London, and I have to
do some shitty commercials
sometimes to pay for it.

478
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:33,190
I don't want to do those things. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Now this is a, it's they,

479
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,170
it's crazy. How was he broke? He is the
guy on the thing you just talked about.

480
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,020
It's like get an allowance.
He is doing that. He's like,

481
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,710
they said like the whole thing is
always trying to get him to do work,

482
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,570
which he's happy to do.
Yeah. And he's like,

483
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,430
I'll make a fuck load of
money and we'll be all right.

484
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,180
And then he'll blow it all
immediately spend it all the crazy.

485
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,080
That's why you see them also in
those like weird. Um, you know

486
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,370
when you go to Asia to,
he's everywhere.

487
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,800
That's all so crazy buying his fucking
bullshit, man. Did you get a suit? Yeah,

488
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,360
yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. I went to, yeah,
it was in Hong Kong. Yeah. It was great.

489
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,900
From Rhodes Guy, rocky.
No, but in that pavilion,

490
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,760
Danny's suit district is to district.
Yeah. You walk out of there with a soup,

491
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,490
you're like won a suit.
I'm like, I, I have over my
shoulder. Like come on, come on,

492
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:27,940
get another suit. You know what,
back to the, uh, the Hardwick thing.

493
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,800
But one thing that's kind of, I realize
is the difference now in culture is, um,

494
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,520
the, when you fire someone,
like when you're done with them,

495
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,010
that's what they judge you
now on is how swiftly. Yeah.

496
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,580
And in absolute and complete that is
done. So it's like, it was that day.

497
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:49,060
I think the Huh. It's crazy.
Cause I'd like to see what
happens. It's not my money,

498
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:51,610
so I can't really tell them, but it's,
I'd like to see what happens of a network.

499
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,320
Just refuses to comment, not says, not
such, which I love. It's like, Hey,

500
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:57,280
we've actually been working with this guy,

501
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:01,190
we're friends with this guy for a while.
Um, while we figure this out, if it's,

502
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,240
if it's right, that's terrible, but
we believe in the sky. He Says No.

503
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:08,230
So right now he's our buddy and if we
find out that it's that he's lying,

504
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:09,700
then you know,
we'll take actions that we have to,

505
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:12,100
but for right now that's been a
part of our life for a long time.

506
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:12,934
We're going to stand with them

507
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,390
instead of just ruin a dude's
life without any, to be honest.

508
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:27,040
That's all I'd want from any network is
just to shut your mouth and let me take

509
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,580
the heat, let the fucking heat
come at the person and say,

510
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,180
you could take our job at comedy
central for all they do. Good or bad.

511
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,750
They are great at just fucking
shutting up and they don't get,

512
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,050
they don't get involved. In fact, when
Tj had his thing and people were like,

513
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:45,310
comedy central, cancel the show,
they put out like, oh no, no,

514
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,160
that was canceled six months ago.
Don't put this on. Put this on us.

515
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,940
We actually did not get involved, which
is, that's great. That's all you gotta do.

516
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,350
Yeah. Just be like, don't go to
you. Yeah. Had an article is really,

517
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,630
oh my God, it's, it's strange.

518
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,050
The uh, you know, look, and I'm not
questioning the validity of her claims.

519
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,730
I'm not questioning factual, whatever,
but at least for the public's sake,

520
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,800
you know, at least if it's in print, they
have to vet these people are all idiots.

521
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,210
No stupid for us to be so kind of
fact finding flying with this shit

522
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,700
just happened. What, can you give
me a trick? Last spilled coffee?

523
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,740
Is it a hot no, it's not hot, but
I've got to think like coffee.

524
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,930
You're going to stink like shit. Ah, oh.

525
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,660
Well to fly home with a rotten
milk on you. Thanks buddy.

526
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,820
Hey.
But to not even explore the claim,

527
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,640
even explored sure that they're right and
that she's of sound mind and that this

528
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,460
is true.
It's just like off

529
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,960
McCarthyism. It's a form of a social
McCarthyism accusations. Enough. Aye.

530
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,460
Aye. Aye. Yeah. I'm on the side of these
accusations aren't even up something.

531
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:55,460
Fireable I don't know what you're
saying from the article. Yeah.

532
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:58,140
It's like what she's saying
easy. Even as like, I don't know,

533
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,020
he pressured you a lot and by the way,

534
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:02,560
when he says the first thing he said after
she had her surgery was going to have

535
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,840
sex, if he said that in front
of your mom, the fucking,

536
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,370
come on guys. What sees a
sociopath? Suddenly if he said it,

537
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:13,530
it was a complete joke. Yeah, no, I,

538
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,200
when I read it because I read it,
I'm like, that's funny to say. Yeah.

539
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,510
That is such a harsh overboard thing
to say. I'll never forget he said it.

540
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,770
I'm like, oh, come on. Yeah,

541
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,020
that was definitely a comedian making a
joke to release some tension in a room.

542
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,200
Right? You just had surgery. Yeah.

543
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,540
I think what the problem
is is that there's no sense
of context context anymore.

544
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,460
It's like you, you said the word that
nobody likes and now you're in trouble.

545
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:40,160
You did the thing that nobody likes
and it's like, well what about,

546
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,910
and they're going for like,

547
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,370
there's tons of ways to interpret
anything you say or do. Yeah.

548
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,350
So what's the worst possible way I
can interpret this? Right and no one,

549
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,710
what's the worst to me is when comedians
don't even look at that and go, hold on,

550
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:53,750
hold on, hold on. Yeah.

551
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,940
Can we look at what may be a positive
way he might've meant that? Yeah.

552
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,320
Like instead of just straight to like how
dare you. Yeah. It's fucking horrible.

553
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,420
It's scary. It's, it's kind of
scary. It is. Yeah, it is. But,

554
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,050
but like, I dunno where I didn't know.
You just got to keep your head down.

555
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,040
It's also a form of like ultra
conservatism. Do you know what I mean?

556
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,640
It's no better than being like on the
other end of that ultra liberal ultra

557
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,470
liberals are out of their
fucking minds. Yeah. Yeah.

558
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,780
The far left is they are far left.

559
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,780
That's a good way to say they are crazy
as shit crazy and they're completely

560
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:32,190
without any reason and they don't care.

561
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:36,840
And a big reason I think that they act
out in this way right now is because the

562
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,510
lies with the other side.

563
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,050
So Trump is in office and
he hit him saying bad daddy.

564
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:47,430
And it triggers the shit out of
other power sources.

565
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:49,830
A group mentality,
group mob on the Internet saying,

566
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,720
we want this guy gone and
having it happen. That's,

567
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,070
that's more powerful
thing Trump is right now.

568
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,870
And he's saying the motivation is because
the leadership is so, it's saying like,

569
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:59,600
we don't have the control,
right?

570
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,810
So what can we control and trusting
that control to not like leaders of that

571
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,340
side, but to fucking dummies. Yeah.

572
00:36:06,341 --> 00:36:09,390
I don't want people who are the same
people that were beat you up because you

573
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:11,310
like the fucking writers
instead of the 49. Right?

574
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,760
Like that's a sign level person
from sports to fucking politics.

575
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,740
It is like really,
it's really bad the way the,

576
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:24,210
the conduct of, of what has
become the, the f I mean,

577
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,590
obviously both extremes are extremes
and they act like complete fucking

578
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:33,170
lunatics. The far left would eat their
young and they'll do [inaudible].

579
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,020
If you don't,

580
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,990
if you don't respond the way they want
you to respond to every situation,

581
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,980
that's it. They're there. They're fucking,
they're that far left. When you get your,

582
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,850
your father, when you get
your partner pregnant, um,

583
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,180
the number one thing they're
hoping for is a trans baby

584
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,230
crawl and then the far right. The funny
thing about the far right is that they,

585
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,030
they coined the term snowflake,
you know,

586
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:04,470
like that's what they, and they're the
biggest snowflakes. No, right. For sure.

587
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,130
The most sensitive,
easily offended.

588
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,780
They'll just lash out at you. Again, not
sharing a perspective. Then they're like,

589
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,470
fuck dude, obvious people are double
standards. Totally. No, they totally are.

590
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,120
Comics do that too. It's like they,
they shit on all these people for, for,

591
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,670
for taking like pride in their victim
hood and then they talk about some Twitter

592
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:26,360
response to what are their jokes for
an hour. It's like, all right, fuck it,

593
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,880
get on with it.
I feel like I don't exist in this world.

594
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,750
I feel like I just observe it, you
know what I mean? Like matrix style,

595
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,500
but like what you're saying
like, oh, the victim comedian,

596
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,090
that's like doing the hall,
I,

597
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,320
this thing happened to me and
I'm the victim and then how it,

598
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,970
but then it's how dare you.
Oh yeah. No, not even that.

599
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:49,200
I just mean comics talking about like,
I mean you had it with retard,

600
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,850
you know, like at some point like,
all right, get back to jokes.

601
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,700
Let people don't, don't us
also be the ones saying, well,

602
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,640
I had it hard because of this. Yeah.
He's like, came at me after this joke.

603
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:02,900
It's like, let them just go on
with it. Go on with it. Yeah. Yeah.

604
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,800
It's fun for promotion, but like if it's
a real, like how dare they, it's like,

605
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:12,510
it's fine. Let them, let them,
let them act like people walk,

606
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,850
walked out of my shell and like,
yeah, Eleanor, you're harsh.

607
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,820
You want a couple of people walking
out or it's too safe. Right.

608
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,380
You need those people. That's true. They
make the rest of the people enjoy it.

609
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,890
I tried to not engage this long time,
you know?

610
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,080
Really for sure. Well, you know what,

611
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:30,220
my dad always told me
what could ignore retard

612
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,100
by the Holocaust. You guys, you've
got to allow that. My Gosh. Yeah. I

613
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,070
do wonder

614
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:42,230
what the actual numbers are of people
that are genuinely offended by things or

615
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,980
I want to ask me about like are
you okay? I'll, I'll stop it,

616
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:47,840
but let me just tell me the truth.
Are you offended?

617
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,640
Are you trying to get
offended? Right? Which one?

618
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:53,180
Is it here or do you
wonder who's pissed off?

619
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,590
Do you want to feel the applause of
the people who hear you say that you're

620
00:38:57,591 --> 00:39:02,570
offended because then they think of
you as this righteous. Yeah, Christina.

621
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,750
Yeah. Yeah. When tig goes, I don't know
what Louis Ck was thinking. It's like,

622
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,220
well you could,
I mean you have his number.

623
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:10,880
The better way to find out who's doing
an interview. It's just a call the guy.

624
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,260
Look, what were you thinking? When
you have a direct path to an answer,

625
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,570
you find fucking climbers.
Get the fuck Outta here.

626
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,560
Shut up. What are you in food? No idea.

627
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,840
The whole time you fucking
heard everything we had,

628
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,170
we heard whether you were
doing your fucking show with
them and get your show on

629
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:32,000
their fucking bull shit. Well, now that
I know, I'm glad my show is canceled.

630
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,010
You can always just cancel your own show.
You're just saying,

631
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm not doing my show anymore. Yeah, you
have that power. I'm so glad this is now.

632
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:42,440
It's, I'm able to fuck shut up.
Shut up. Everyone's a hypocrite.

633
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,650
Yeah. Well, yeah, that's
interesting isn't it?

634
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,060
I mean, I'll go by, but Janeane
Garofalo who was like, yeah, I heard it.

635
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:56,180
We heard about Louie. I was at that
fucking festival. We all laughed about it.

636
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,300
You've got a different time and it is
a different person than he was then we

637
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:03,440
heard about it and our response was
laughter. That's Janeane Garofalo yeah.

638
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,310
And now you're a bit like, how dare
you. It's like we heard it them, uh,

639
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,770
during the time it happened, we weren't
as harsh as you guys are now. Right.

640
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,260
So like,

641
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,500
it's suddenly we're supposed to be mad
about something that happened a long time

642
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:13,334
ago.

643
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,610
I'm trying to think of when the started
and I'm texting with a friend of mine

644
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:21,260
who's a professor in university and he
says to me today that the students are

645
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:24,440
now asking him to give them
trigger warnings. Yeah.

646
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:28,480
His lectures and asking if they can read
their own books cause they don't want

647
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:29,870
to read what's being assigned.

648
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,370
And that some woman wrote an open letter
to the dean open letter complaining

649
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:38,660
that they were, they were assigned
to read Shakespeare and that, um,

650
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,380
that, that, that, that is part
of rape culture and you go,

651
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,450
well how did this get slick work?
Is this,

652
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,400
is this because of this veal generation,
this millennial generation race? So,

653
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,440
so stringently that now they're adults
and they don't understand how the real

654
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:58,160
world functions because their parents
have fucking Molly coddled them and put

655
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:01,400
helmets on them and made everything safe
and secure and now they're in the world

656
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:02,630
and they can't fucking deal.

657
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,410
I don't think, I think I'll
just start doing that, I think.

658
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,950
Have you ever known safe space
rooms meltdown? No. Like that. Oh,

659
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:11,530
is that what they're called?
Yeah. Yeah. Safe space rooms.

660
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,830
I thought that was all comedy is that
there's a high overlap for sure. But, uh,

661
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,600
there's, there's a meltdown was
a safe space room for a while.

662
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:22,720
They had it as a safe space for him and
it was a called that it could just be

663
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:25,960
the individual shows it got gut
book. Yeah. That's the genre almost.

664
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:29,740
They have like urban knights, they have
six space. Nothing is going to offend you.

665
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,170
Yeah. You just can't do anything there. I
don't even, I mean sure. It's, it's funny.

666
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,360
Is it two hours ago I guess,
and thinking about his,

667
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,380
his catalog,

668
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Chappelle stopped in to meltdown and did
like that first round like trans stuff.

669
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,490
And that's where that like big blog, oh
yeah. Blew Up, came out. She was like,

670
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,520
I was here and I was initially excited
to see who I thought was a great

671
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,890
comedian. But then you wanna hear
something funny about that. Um,

672
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,260
a friend of mine was like, yeah, I was
there. Uh, when he did that, you know,

673
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,380
cause it's half comics.
Yeah. And he was there.

674
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:11,381
I was there and I was sitting next to the
person who wrote that blog and she was

675
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:16,490
dying laughing the entire time. Yeah.
And then later it's like, well hold on.

676
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,450
How can I get, well, I mean,
are you thinking that with
the amazing race and stuff?

677
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,470
And people are like,
how dare you? And if I,

678
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,290
if I like actually right on pathway to
human, I was like, come on, come on.

679
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,170
Those aren't, that's not real. It's
fucking calm down. They'd be like, well,

680
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,830
I have to admit I kind of kind of where
from the provost when I saw it and then

681
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:34,850
he went to a fucking raise and say, well
by die from, from laughing at first. Yeah.

682
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,890
So it's all ridiculous. Are you going
to say about the safe space room? Oh,

683
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,390
so they do these, what was I gonna say
about it? They do these sat scores.

684
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,230
They're fine with me to to put on.
It's just like, I don't know if that's,

685
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,830
if you're really kind of don't want
comedy that infringes on that at all.

686
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:51,320
It's fine to have those rooms.
So colleges that safe space room,

687
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:54,950
but just know that if I now go to a club,
I'm not going to get that.

688
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,240
So like once you're out of here
in college, you're going to,

689
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,570
it's going to be real world again,

690
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,160
but it's okay if you just want a
nice fun bubble to like, you know,

691
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,610
it's kind of silly that they even provide
that for you though because it's not,

692
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,590
it's not preparing you for the real
world at all. Well, in other ways it is.

693
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,760
How so? I mean, learning how to
put put memos and your boss's desk,

694
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,460
it prepares you for like legit things.
Well yeah,

695
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:21,710
but I'm saying it doesn't
prepare you for the safe spaces,

696
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:23,120
safe spaces that doesn't prepare you.

697
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,760
It's just a safe environment
which you can learn,

698
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:28,920
I guess when you're like Yale or
Princeton, a few years ago who was like,

699
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,080
I'm like screaming in the professor's
face because he suggested something that,

700
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:37,520
you know,
I'm also supposed to be safe.

701
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,570
It's a safe thing.
And what's not going to trigger somebody?

702
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,800
Let's say I one time choked
on cookies as a child.

703
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,250
And you mentioned that you had cookies
for lunch and now I'm triggered the fuck

704
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,560
up. Yeah. I always want to know what
the line was. What percentage of people,

705
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:54,140
how to have been through something before
you can, can you talk about murder?

706
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,040
If someone's been murdered,
can you talk about like what,

707
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,690
what's not triggering to me? I know a
lot of things trigger and it's also like,

708
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,040
you know,
you might get triggered,

709
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,430
I dunno what's triggered a
memory of something emotional.

710
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,360
Yeah.
And emotional association with something.

711
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:12,840
Maybe I went to see a panorama
last year. I went to see, uh,

712
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,490
um,
the,

713
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,860
the festival Panoramio Sorta went right
from Montreal and nine inch nails was

714
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:19,660
playing.

715
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,660
I just had a friend hang herself like
three weeks before and he started doing

716
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,000
hurt and he does it so well.
And I,

717
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:33,780
I'm balling just because of the, are the
lyrics because it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:37,510
Everyone loved goes away in the
end. Just like, it's just so sad.

719
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,490
Fucking pick Jay's
daughters right next to me.

720
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,350
Just stare at this adult fucking
crying with flip flops on and uh,

721
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,750
but like,
yeah,

722
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:50,340
I guess I was triggered into thinking
about people that were important to me and

723
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:54,810
that made me sad. But like,
it's so bad. Yeah. Like what?
You're allowed to be true.

724
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,660
It's okay to be that you can be
what

725
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,440
everybody wants to
feel. I think, you know,

726
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,380
part of this is a generational pushback
on the fact that care about different

727
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:09,780
things.
Well know that the generation before us,

728
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:14,580
like our parents were raised and
the whole world was like, yeah,

729
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:17,250
I'm like, it's not fair. This is hurting
right now. Me Emotionally, they're like,

730
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:20,720
what are you fucking stupid? Like yeah,
that's the word they use. Stupid. Yeah,

731
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,330
that's for sure. The word that they
use, it was like magnet but different.

732
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,670
I'm the negative. Like it's an, it tells
you a mag. And partially because they,

733
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,210
you know, they didn't know. They didn't,
they never knew to be emotionally aware,

734
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,810
basically. So if you're like,
something's bothering you,

735
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,540
you wouldn't express it.
They wouldn't get it out of you.

736
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,750
They wouldn't coach you through it
because they weren't raised like that.

737
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,000
And then we'll move into the
era where they're like, hey,

738
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,000
you can be really in touch
with feelings and emotions.

739
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:55,800
And then that gets heightened so much to
overcompensate for an entire era where

740
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:59,010
nobody did it. It feels like
that's almost kind of pick up.

741
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:03,870
Then the gen x or is have raised the
millennials, the Gen Ed, we're gen x.

742
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:07,560
We were raised by that generation
that was like fuck it soldier on.

743
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,450
Put your head down.
Don't talk about your feelings.

744
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:11,480
So we fucked up the world basically then.

745
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,610
Cause then we raised our kids to be like,
you need to have feelings.

746
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,830
This safe place. We a helmet. When
it's an extreme, it's too much.

747
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,690
It's too much. It's just terrible.
By the way, don't call me again.

748
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,990
I was born in 88 I don't know what you're,
you're on the,

749
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,820
you're not not millennial gen x.

750
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,630
That's nirvana bras younger than you.
I don't know what you're talking about.

751
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:36,150
79 or 80 is the cutoff.
Okay,

752
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:39,840
so 84 so that means for my ass,
definitely younger than you.

753
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,080
I was born in 1993

754
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,930
I check it out. Look what I'm
growing up. Your Jew Curls? No,

755
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,400
I thought that in there and I was like,
that was kind of racist to point out.

756
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,150
Why are you doing that for? I'm
doing this hour and Edinburgh. Oh,

757
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:00,320
for your two hour play area. So we're
trying to grow them out a little bit.

758
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,210
My girlfriend hates it. She's
like, what? Get a girlfriend.

759
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,800
You have a girlfriend? Yeah.
Wait, how do we not know this?

760
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,990
But I don't want us, I don't know
much about her. I don't want,

761
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,860
we just had a very cutting. Tell
me this. God. It's been a while.

762
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,020
How long has it been? I don't
even know. What does she do?

763
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,880
Art Curator in New York.
Yeah,

764
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,690
you can text me this.

765
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,910
What am I going to do fucking in the
conversation and let you guys burn on me.

766
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,250
Just fucking send me a message. I
have a girlfriend. I love her so much.

767
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,320
Gave her kisses all the time.
I would never ever do that.

768
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,140
Do you guys living together
in sin? Okay. First of all,

769
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:47,320
the point of all this was look at
these jokers. Wait, is she Jewish? No.

770
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,580
What does she think of it? She really
hates it. She's like her garbage.

771
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,740
Does She Christian? No. Why would, I
wouldn't want her to convert for me.

772
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,340
When you guys get married getting married,
he marries you.

773
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah. They used to do that thing. We were
like, you hit your own back, right? No.

774
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,670
Flagellation and then you tie the

775
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,730
tie the box you did. We tried to tie
the box so tight. This was our, what?

776
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:16,630
We are bad asses.
We would be time.

777
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:19,180
So tied that to see how many
periods that would last.

778
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:20,320
Like the annotation with last.

779
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:23,400
Once you take them off you have to go
through breakfast and first period like

780
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,180
check it. Oh, what? What era were you the
most hardcore you think in your belief?

781
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,970
Like if somebody would ask, if somebody
were to stop you and be like, Hey,

782
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:33,790
are you into this? You'd be like, the fuck
are you asking me? Like, of course I am.

783
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,940
Yeah. Yeah. When I was in Israel and your
Shiva and like how old were you then?

784
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,160
20 Oh, so 20 your your
die hard. Die Hard. Wow.

785
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,010
Died pretty. That's
pretty grown up. Fuck it.

786
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,040
You were convinced to this is your path.
I mean, I hadn't really thought about it.

787
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,780
Yeah, but like for Shai, what age
are you like, no, of course not.

788
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,180
This is 21. God Damn. During,

789
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,430
I think after I turned
21 I was really like,

790
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,460
I think I might be out and then just done
what the hardest conversation to have

791
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,500
with family. Yeah. Probably.

792
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,090
I remember when I had to tell my dad
about being a serial rapist and that was

793
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:15,700
difficult, but this was far, far harsher

794
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,510
when you tell him that this is the worst
thing to tell him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:27,020
This was Harvard.
I didn't believe him.

796
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,200
He's not as hardcore as you
were at 20. Right? He is.

797
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,830
He is that hard core about
that hardcore. He's sly. He's,

798
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,130
he's like loosened up a
bit. Um, like he was like,

799
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:41,660
get a fucking burger if you're around
me. They don't curse. I'm sorry. He's,

800
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,540
but he's like, you can get a burger.
It's okay. Yeah, yeah. But like, yeah,

801
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,500
he's like, why, what am I fighting for?
You know, people, it's calmed down. Yeah.

802
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,180
It's funny,
my parents used to,

803
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,970
I mean I didn't have anything that
was intense is what you were doing,

804
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:55,900
but you know,

805
00:49:55,901 --> 00:50:00,901
it was just never a question that you
would obviously go to church on Friday

806
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:06,580
obviously. So whenever I came home from
college on Sunday, it was like, Hey,

807
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:09,700
are you ready to go? Not even like you're
coming today, right? Oh, you're ready.

808
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,710
Ready? And like I would just go and
then it's like out of college, you know,

809
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,990
conversations like,
yeah, to get phone calls.

810
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:20,680
Like are you going to church out there?
And I'd be like, yeah, all the time.

811
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,630
I'm an ally.
I didn't want to do the line anymore.

812
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,000
But then they came out and that would
have to like find a church to go to and,

813
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,703
and then,

814
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,890
and it was like Christina would come with
Christine would come with me home and

815
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,400
we would go and there would be things
like we'd sleep in let's say when I came

816
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,230
home to visit. Yeah. And then it's
like, uh, you know, they're like,

817
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,220
well, you missed the, you know, the 11
o'clock and you can still make yeah.

818
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,470
And I'd be like, yeah, we're
going to try to go later.

819
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,770
And then they would kind of check on
that. Did you go? And I was like, no.

820
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,090
And then he'll look, what am I
doing? Can I just say this already?

821
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,700
Then he would never go, well they did
this thing where they would bring it like,

822
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,140
you're not going to go to church this
week or something. And it would be like,

823
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,350
I don't think so. And they were
like, okay. And then locked it out,

824
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:16,350
see how it played, plays, look
at them. And then there was, uh,

825
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,310
the one when I knew I would,
I had actually done it,

826
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:24,170
made the leap and that it was
like not an issue anymore.

827
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:28,430
I mean it was, this was years obviously
like, you know, cutting down the time,

828
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:31,520
but it was just like
Sunday and they're like,

829
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,750
or a Saturday night and they're like,
um,

830
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,180
I'm gonna pick up a coffee on the
way home from thing tomorrow or like,

831
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:38,990
do you want me to bring you a coffee
or something? I'd be like, yeah.

832
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:42,800
And they're like, okay. And then
no, uh, no mention of it. No guilt.

833
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,650
Like they would just show up and be
like, got your coffee. Need, why?

834
00:51:46,651 --> 00:51:48,800
Argue with them? Like, do what
you want to go see a movie today.

835
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:53,150
Like they're just not a big moment.
That's a huge, where I was like,

836
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,410
I don't have to pretend anymore. And
then now like they used to, you know,

837
00:51:57,411 --> 00:52:00,710
always be like, are you my mom? Not My
dad. My mom be like, are you praying?

838
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,980
I was like, yeah, and now she
doesn't, she doesn't even know.

839
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,960
Sometimes she'll be like, do you
think God for like all your blessings?

840
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:11,990
And I'm like, oh definitely. I
definitely never think my agent

841
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,860
so,
but it is funny how,

842
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:19,880
I mean it's really like
it does, it does. It is,

843
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,700
you feel kind of Shitty when, when you
feel like you're breaking their heart.

844
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,940
I know it's us, but then at some
point like I just can't do it for you.

845
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,680
Kevin Meaney and my
podcasts before he died,

846
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,910
talking about coming out of the closet,

847
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:32,690
a 50 years old and it was like he didn't
want to hurt his dad when his dad died.

848
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,570
He could come out. But it's like she
would place your entire sexual life yeah.

849
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:41,160
For not being free because of offending
or hurting the, but did he die of,

850
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,290
is it cancer? Uh, I don't know. No,

851
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:50,240
I'm not sure. That was like two years
ago. Yeah. You don't know what he died of?

852
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,060
I don't know. It sounds like
aids. I assume it's, yeah,

853
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,780
I think he just thought,
I don't know what he died of fat too.

854
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,050
Not like huge fat, but like,
but like I had a belly on him.

855
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,990
He's been gaining a lot
of weight. Bert? Yeah.

856
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,530
They called me and he's like, I'm getting
so much. And I go, why? He was like,

857
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:17,840
I ran that marathon.
That was so long ago.

858
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,800
How long do you think the afterburn
last? He's like, I know, but

859
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:29,580
um, hold on. This is coming out of
the closet was hard on my parents.

860
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,530
But you had to do it to your parents?
Yeah, no, I mean a about religion.

861
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,600
I thought you meant it for you guys.
And what were you going to show me?

862
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:39,390
What he could show me? You know, I
just saw that he had posted this thing.

863
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,930
He did that, the tour with those
guys over the weekend. Oh yeah.

864
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:47,190
Where did he post a? Just
like 48 but like, oh my God,

865
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:51,970
look what a piggy Jesus, this
little piggy went to disease.

866
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,710
See it. It's like, that's
big man. By the way,

867
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:59,670
Canadian Berg Gatsy love this picture
because they're like, oh, I'm fine. Oh,

868
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,880
they're like, what am I,
one 50 this? Yeah. I mean,

869
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,980
it takes up most of the screens. Look,
CGI is distended and everything. Yeah.

870
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,430
It's really, it's really
sad. He's real big. I mean,

871
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,670
he must get out of the chair the way
Chris Christina gets out of a chair,

872
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,570
like pregnant belly first and
then let the weight push you up.

873
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,860
You've been going hard. I bet if we did
the Wayne's right now, you'd be like,

874
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,340
Oh fuck. I bet he wouldn't weigh
on publicly right now. No, no.

875
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,790
I asked him about it recently. He was
like, it's just bloat. It's bloke,

876
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:34,160
it's bloat from liquor. And
I'm like, so that means if you,

877
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,230
if you stopped within like a couple
of days to be back to normal.

878
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,400
One is a bloke and he's, I don't
know, become subject change. Yeah.

879
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:45,100
Well that's the thing is like, it is
probably directly related to that. Yeah.

880
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,370
Which is directly related to
touring right in the road.

881
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,110
You're never going to stop.
He's never going to stop
touring. No, absolutely. Yeah.

882
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,580
Absolutely not by the way. Um,
I know a lot of like when Ralph,

883
00:54:57,581 --> 00:55:01,740
he got the stomach stapled, people were
like, he needs to go see a therapist.

884
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:04,510
Now sometimes it's not enough to
cover up what's wrong with them. Sure.

885
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,980
So I think a lot of what's
Burt gaining that weight?

886
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,160
It's because of the guilt.
Those children. I mean,

887
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,700
cause he was working out a lot and
running and then suddenly he gains weight.

888
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:22,701
Right about the time he refused to give
that money that he owed to the children.

889
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,140
Yeah. Sad. We all donated for him. Yeah,

890
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,600
we did that. Does that the uh, children's
hospital. Children's hospital. Yeah.

891
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,510
If you guys want to donate,
it's a go fund me.com/evil Bert and uh,

892
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:41,250
we're trying to raise the $10,000. Did
he said it was going to, now he's saying,

893
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:45,150
I guess now he's saying that he never
even intended to give that money.

894
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:49,830
Crazy. Yeah, I remember him saying and
it calling me on and telling me about it.

895
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,330
Yeah. Yeah. Oh wait, when are you
doing? Uh, Edinburgh's is it August?

896
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,750
All of August 2nd pool. Have you done
it before? I've done it twice before.

897
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,040
Do you like this? I love it. I
mean, I think I'm the only American,

898
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:05,310
but sounds like Bronston or
people like that, that like that.

899
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,800
Like it sounds joyous.
So yeah,

900
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:11,880
I'm definitely one of the Americans
that doesn't because I would hate to be

901
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:16,770
somewhere for a month. What? What?
Oh, okay. I see my beautiful.

902
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,520
Um, they would hate to be
there for a month. Yeah. Okay.

903
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,230
Imagine I wouldn't hate
being an Edinburgh,

904
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:24,970
but I'd hate to be anywhere for a month.
Do you have a place though?

905
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,000
It's like a new home. But you're
doing what? 30 days in a row?

906
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:32,820
25 days in a row in a row? No, I don't
like that either. One day off. Ah,

907
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:36,130
Monday the 13th. Why is it every
fucking day, man? It's just,

908
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,860
but it's just only an hour a day.
You're free.

909
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,920
No, but you're not, you're,

910
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:43,200
you're never relaxed because the whole
day or thinking about your show that

911
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:46,250
night, you're never really, you can't do
anything at time. Where are you doing it?

912
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:51,850
Number for both. You are fucking
faggots. There's no way. Pablo. Um, I,

913
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:59,010
I did eight shows in a row like
a year ago somewhere. Oh, no, no.

914
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:02,970
Some were here and I was like, dude,
it's a marriage. And I was like, come on,

915
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,830
it's a marathon. It's a marathon. It is
like a thing you've got to get up for,

916
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,570
but you don't barely have to get up.
And then you're,

917
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,930
and then you have the full range of shows.
Right. I guess if you're doing 25 yet,

918
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,300
you have a heart.
Do you have train wreck shows?

919
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:19,020
Do you have like there are better and
worse shows? For sure. For sure. For sure.

920
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,040
Yeah.
Um,

921
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:25,410
but I saw those guys out there doing
their fucking crazy UK theme hours. Yeah.

922
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:25,891
And I was like,

923
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:30,090
I saw the first year I just
did my storytelling show
and the next year I did my

924
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:31,290
own.
But just regular American,

925
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,810
you're transitioning to a European guy
and then it's like, no, I'm not sure.

926
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:38,370
This comedy, you're
transition. Yeah, he is.

927
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:42,930
He's dog dot Tran's comic
started growing your hair out.

928
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:48,220
How? Who would be an uglier woman?
You are Tom [inaudible] or Tom,

929
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:49,930
who's the Uglier Trans Woman?

930
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,420
I mean, I know what the answer is. What
is it? Oh No, you do know it's done.

931
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,600
No, no, but you're so
tall and you're so lanky.

932
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:06,260
Tall like Grace Jones. Yeah, but your
bro, like your shoulders are bony.

933
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,870
Yeah. Let me see. Hi shoulders.
That means it only show weight.

934
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,620
Do you think you'd be an attractive woman?
If you are trying to think.

935
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:16,180
I'd be a five and a half and me, I'd
be like, I take it. You wouldn't have,

936
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,770
you wouldn't have to be drunk to fuck me.
You would have to be buzzed, but not to.

937
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,590
What about me? No, you wouldn't
have. It would be a fetish.

938
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,430
It would be like a northern
type of person. We're
hideous. Yeah. Would be like,

939
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,560
it'd be like, oh, people
want to punish themselves.

940
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,170
The same type of people who want you
to shit on their chest during sex,

941
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:34,000
but also want to fuck you.
Have you ever, by the way,

942
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:37,690
because we know God only
knows the nightmares you've
been involved with in your

943
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:41,320
sexual history.
Then with one of these absolute,

944
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,980
have you been with a woman
that's a total fucking surprise.

945
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,400
Mental case with what she likes.
Oh, what she's into. Yeah. Yeah,

946
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:53,020
because I imagine that you have been
with just the full drags, right?

947
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:56,740
Cogging come on.
Do you ever go hogging what's hugging?

948
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,950
Like where you just go out and just
try to find the fattest check possible?

949
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,720
Like AAA stuff? Yeah, it definitely
allows that. Does that? Yeah.

950
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,170
Just as a way to that. I do not
go hogging. Ah, no I do not.

951
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,460
I've wound up with a hog not
knowing how it's happening at all,

952
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,080
but I've been pheasant hunting
and wound up, so wait a minute.

953
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,080
Have you been though with a
real fucking, oh my God. Yeah.

954
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,180
I mean I almost hooked
up with somebody in,

955
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,030
in Scotland a few years ago
that I was like, hmm, this
might be it, dude. Oh really?

956
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,320
Yeah. Where I had to start
showing once it hit my brain,

957
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:32,180
I started showing people like
pictures and they were like,

958
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:37,150
I could go out of the way. I don't know
Asian. Wait, but you saw there their junk,

959
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:40,430
right? No, I didn't get,
I didn't get that. Oh,

960
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,420
have you ever had like a request though?
Like I'm saying as far as, you know,

961
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,600
not necessarily shitting on,
but something where you're like,

962
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:49,240
that was fucking crazy request.
Uh,

963
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,610
like bossing them around in a way,

964
00:59:51,611 --> 00:59:54,700
like make him crawl around on the floor
and do chores for me. Ask for it. Yeah.

965
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,360
Yeah. And then some of them, I can't
give that to them enough. I'm like,

966
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,100
I can only to meet you so much
before it gets weird for me.

967
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,620
I'm fighting Ari's a better woman.

968
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,580
Cause he's a little nervy saying it's
not a question. Yeah. Now wait a minute.

969
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,110
Who would be worse and worse
as a woman? Me? Yeah. Or Diaz.

970
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:16,060
Oh, okay. Oh, this is easy.

971
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:19,420
This is easy. It's, he has
to be a worst woman. Oh Man.

972
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,910
Going to be the worst of all time.
Maybe grow

973
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:31,360
his fat is a male fat too. It's not
like a, it's not, it's pushed out.

974
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,430
You look honestly,
Christina,

975
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,350
you look like a how to draw
things to see jaws shape.

976
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:43,150
And then another smaller circle,
circle, circle like leg circle.

977
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:48,040
I'm in the very end of it.
This is my due date

978
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,200
is uh, is uh, they're doing this new
thing where it's, um, well, okay,

979
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,970
this is a fake one, but then I'll
give you a real one in a second.

980
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,140
But that were men are trying
to be closer to the uh,

981
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:02,750
baby by drinking the fluids,
the salary, placenta.

982
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,230
We've heard this. Yeah.
This is disgusting.

983
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:08,310
Can I tell you guys the most baller thing
to do? The best way to show your love?

984
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:13,380
Yeah. Okay. Having a baby
together. Your sperm.

985
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,880
Your Vagina. Yeah. Um, that's
an a great act of love.

986
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,420
But so sexual love, which is part
of it. It's how you get there.

987
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:23,490
The most baller,

988
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,520
most sexual thing you can do
[inaudible] is while Christine,

989
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:33,180
interesting is giving birth.

990
01:01:33,181 --> 01:01:37,650
Like when she's like pushing out are
fucking the baby back here. Okay.

991
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,080
Sorry. So you're saying you
guys don't love each other.

992
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:45,700
This is so disgusting.

993
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:50,920
You say it comes out in my terms that
the relationship will always be about you

994
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:53,980
guys hooking up and they have to,
oh,

995
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:58,630
well back be quiet
at the moment.

996
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,260
How would you do it? Get under her maybe
like split level bed with one of those,

997
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:05,120
um, those, um, massage head things.

998
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:11,170
I mean, just what is, it's very,

999
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:14,320
the one take me up on, I'm going
to write a blog tonight. I,

1000
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,240
social justice warrior
Aries art meets him.

1001
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,480
I don't understand why you won't,
it's it, just show it to me.

1002
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,260
Then the three of you closer
as a family. Oh, Mike,

1003
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,390
this is pretty gross right here.
Somebody wrote in, let me tell you,

1004
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,180
tell me if you ever done
anything like this. So here's
an email. Hey, Mommy's, uh,

1005
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,910
I recently had something new happen with
my girlfriend when we were having sex.

1006
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,810
I had to pee really bad before
we started having sex. Oh,

1007
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,210
we'll start to get into it. And I
was like, fuck it. The peak and wait,

1008
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,010
I've got a boner and it needs attention.

1009
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,450
So we start to bang and after
about 22 to 24, good through us,

1010
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:53,630
I shoot my load into my girl's vagina
immediately following this in voluntarily

1011
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:57,210
start peeing and her as
well as you would expect.

1012
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:02,220
She was not happy that I emptied my urine
load into her and we haven't spoken in

1013
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:04,800
days. I'm pretty sure she's
getting ready to move out.

1014
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,620
If you ever heard of this happening
before, does it have a name?

1015
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:12,570
I told my friends and we settled on all
nerd, an Arnold Palmer half and half,

1016
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:17,940
half p half come to any thoughts
on how to avoid this happening?

1017
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:22,170
Case series. Thanks. You guys are
the best. Try it out. Dr Nick. Yeah,

1018
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:25,960
I have an idea on how you can
avoid this out of the bathroom.

1019
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,230
Just take a leak and uh, that's it.
That's the end of my explanation.

1020
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,980
Joy to paint is oh no, no, no.

1021
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,790
I mean I wonder how bad he had to pee.

1022
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,200
If it was like if it was a 10 and he
rejected it and then his body was really

1023
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:44,670
like,
you have to empty this right now.

1024
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:48,630
That's the only way I can imagine not
being able to control. Once you do it,

1025
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,440
can't pinch dreadful. Let it all go
out. Right. Why did you say your food?

1026
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,210
You're pissing, can't you just pull
out and pee on the bed versus ego like,

1027
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,290
Hey, that's a lot of calm.
A lot of conflict may be
filling you up. And he's like,

1028
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,570
hold on, don't move. Which is like, um,

1029
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:08,940
how gross would it be to have
BPD a shit rude. It's rude.

1030
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,210
I'd be so upset. I mean, you know
better than, because it would probably,

1031
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,080
what would it do to you?
I could give you all kinds of infections.

1032
01:04:19,081 --> 01:04:23,290
I'm shutting her out too. Yeah,
we could try it out. Yeah.

1033
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,520
It's like athlete's foot of the Pussy.
That's a piss on it.

1034
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,690
He's done it before this.
Inside a vagina. Yeah. No,

1035
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:32,250
but I have docked with a dude and piss.

1036
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:34,110
We've both pissed inch
in each other's holes.

1037
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:38,460
What ice cream cones together with rocky
road is put on a peppermint. Does this,

1038
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:42,510
that year 20 in Israel? Um, no.

1039
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:46,170
I've never pissed inside
a woman done that. No.

1040
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:49,740
You have to make a decision. Like
I maybe got lost in it. I'm like,

1041
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:51,810
well this is already going in there.
I'll keep going.

1042
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,440
How would you empty at handstand?

1043
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:00,560
Walking with her legs up to the
bathroom to empty. Yet afterwards. That

1044
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:05,280
falls on the bat, but then why? Why
not just pull out in the first place?

1045
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,910
That's what I'm saying.
I mean I think we're all in agreement.

1046
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:13,050
This man made an error just as a bad
thing to do. You don't want to do this.

1047
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,110
I mean I could see this breaking up.
Your question

1048
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,260
for your area, would you,
if you're super broke,

1049
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:25,890
what'd you sell your shit to somebody
like would you shut up his bag and then

1050
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:31,350
like sell it to somebody or would you
shit through a hole in a hammock and led

1051
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:32,560
that person eat your shit.

1052
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,420
Do what I'm saying like a really all
you're doing is something you do anyways,

1053
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,570
but someone else's really enjoying it.
Listen,

1054
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:45,100
I don't want to like be a
broken record on this podcast,

1055
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,750
but it's kind of the same as that fucker.
Would you rather with big retarded.

1056
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:54,320
I mean I want to do that anyway. I
want to shit in the stomach. You do.

1057
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,000
If we could get a hammock situation where
you get somebody pay me all the better

1058
01:05:58,001 --> 01:05:59,920
because then you're a good crowd.
You know you got free tickets,

1059
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:03,670
you're not as good at crowd but you
pay me and I shit in your mouth.

1060
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,270
I went have to be broke.
I'm saying I'm down for that.

1061
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,720
Would you let someone shit in
your mouth and absolutely not. No.

1062
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:11,940
For 100 bucks though.

1063
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,010
Sure. Blocks? No, no.

1064
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:23,410
Come on.

1065
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,733
Sit down.

1066
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,100
They have my card is

1067
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,643
McAfee

1068
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,300
got sick.
I didn't agree with that.

1069
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,700
She's talking about Hardwick.
Yeah.

1070
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,240
It's a no brainer for you. I would
for sure would you not the first time

1071
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,660
I'd be embarrassed at first

1072
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,260
she likes it and never had done that.

1073
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:18,990
She texts growlers till you can sound

1074
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,750
to shifting his mouth.

1075
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,950
I feel like every time is that easy
but yeah, there's money on the table.

1076
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:33,680
Every time I take a shit without somebody
there and you save water on water

1077
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,560
flush constantly.

1078
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:39,100
I think also she probably got to the
point that one was probably like,

1079
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,780
just have breakfast. I got to
get over it. Mcafee's house.

1080
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,690
Is he jerking off all this happening?
Well, they don't talk about this,

1081
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:51,450
but we always assume that has to be tight.
They'll reveal secrets. Tiger lover.

1082
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,080
I think it has to. It
has to be yes. So yeah,

1083
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:57,370
cause I can't just be the joy of
having it in your mouth or I could be,

1084
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,210
it's good to be that fantastic. But isn't
there some sexual gratification there?

1085
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,530
Hassle if he's not jerking it in
front of them as they share. Yeah.

1086
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:09,190
But then he's waiting, I'm sure
a later jerk off course. Yeah.

1087
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:13,640
I wonder how you'd, how you build that
fetish. That's what would that one really,

1088
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,470
I mean, you would have to happen by
accident. Like this guy, that word in.

1089
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,910
I mean that was all, that's all he could
do. This is how girls, that's interesting.

1090
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,000
So it's, it's an accidental thing
and then you're like, oh wow,

1091
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:26,930
this is a doorway to something I'm
really interested at. My name is

1092
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,130
John McAfee.

1093
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,810
Is that a fan? Yeah, somebody, man.
That's great. Could you use your time

1094
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,420
escaping dad? He always missed John. Man.

1095
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,460
It was fucking readmitted.
Make

1096
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:08,330
good ones. That's, um, yeah,
he's nasty. He's fucked up man.

1097
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,920
You just net bro. Ever
done crystal meth? Ari?

1098
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,480
I would like to you can you
live in the city? They sell it.

1099
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,170
Did we found a bag of fucking drugs
at this festival last weekend,

1100
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,980
two weekends ago. And it was just
like, oh, what are we going to do?

1101
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,930
Did you take him?
No.

1102
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:31,820
So we have to find it on the road
back to camping at, at firefly.

1103
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,490
So we're like going back
to where everybody camps.

1104
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,470
It's guy's such a psycho stopped.
They're just hell. I was a miserable.

1105
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,630
It looked down,
there's a Baggie full bag.

1106
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,220
And I went to tie my shoes and fucking
palmed it did, there's powder pills,

1107
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:49,610
everything powder. This powder. It's one
of those little tiny drawbacks, you know?

1108
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:54,800
And uh, so our, our buddy that was there
with us, he's, he's just the trier.

1109
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:58,460
So we're a luck. Let's give it to him.
Let's give it to him and see what he,

1110
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:03,350
he tried. It goes, it's either
really shitty coke or amazing coke.

1111
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,400
Oh. Like he didn't know and we didn't know
what to do with. Should take it or not.

1112
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,630
And what happened? His girlfriend was
like, do not take it. We have other drugs.

1113
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,410
We brought other drugs to do, we don't
need to do this fucking street drug.

1114
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,990
And um, we ended up just doing the other
drugs. Yeah. I wouldn't take drugs.

1115
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:23,740
I'd found on the, on the ground.
I normally would not. What do you,

1116
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:26,600
do you stick to just like psychedelic
stuff or do you fuck with it too Molly?

1117
01:10:26,601 --> 01:10:30,350
Sometimes ketamine once in
awhile. Yeah. That's more
recent. That's pretty fun. One.

1118
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,330
I Dunno, but I want to try heroin.
Would you want to try heroin? No.

1119
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:40,250
You don't know. That's a horrible
one. Cause the addiction,

1120
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,030
take that out and don't you want to
try it? You want to feel what it,

1121
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,840
what it must be feeling. Yeah. Yeah. I
get what you're saying. Don't you want to,

1122
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,840
so are you going to have, but what about
just another opioid, but why don't you,

1123
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:55,670
why don't you go straight to heroin? Just
try something else. I mean, what's a,

1124
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,320
I'll try shit.
Was it methadone?

1125
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:03,230
Methadone's right. So I'm saying I
don't want to do oxy and say it's like,

1126
01:11:03,231 --> 01:11:04,130
just like heroin.
I'm like,

1127
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:07,100
let you fucking try heroin and tell you
what's like heroin needle and really

1128
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:12,020
start going, no bro. No, I don't want to
go needle right away and like smoke it.

1129
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,160
Smoke done that accidentally

1130
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,620
when I was 15 at a party.
Yeah. And I just accrue.

1131
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,010
Yeah, he's got a, I just spaced out
watching the easy stitch commercial.

1132
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:25,590
All my parents ended up coming
to the party and taking me home.

1133
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,780
Like it you just kind of,
yeah.

1134
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,430
You should do math though. Makes
your Dick Super hard. Yeah. Yeah.

1135
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,540
You'll come faster and harder
than you ever come to you.

1136
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,840
You won't believe how big your Dick
yets you've known neuropathy issues.

1137
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,640
I'm not interested in Beth.
What,

1138
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,680
why a little speed with like in
some ecstasy maybe, but not math.

1139
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,660
Wow. Okay. So what is your lady party?
Sounds like it, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,790
The same kind of drugs. Yeah. It's
mostly the second art gallery curator.

1141
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:52,781
No art curator.

1142
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:55,480
So like people would go to them like
they're building the fucking the Hudson

1143
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:57,700
yards. And I need to like
art for the whole thing.

1144
01:11:57,701 --> 01:12:02,520
And so like there they find
artists and I don't know. Yeah,

1145
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:06,040
she has, her job is to go to
galleries fucking twice a week.

1146
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,730
It's such a fun job. It's like I don't
want to come gallery often with me today.

1147
01:12:09,731 --> 01:12:14,700
I'm like, alright. Hmm hmm. Hmm.
Hmm. Hmm. It's exciting. Sorry.

1148
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,850
That's good. Do you like it?
What goes in the gallery? Yeah,

1149
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:24,700
it's okay. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah. How'd
you meet Edinburgh? Two years ago?

1150
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,570
What? We've got a festival flag. She was
there in Grad school. She from Oak town.

1151
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,010
The, that she was that
the town? Yeah, sure.

1152
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,250
Wait, sorry, I just had to back up.

1153
01:12:33,251 --> 01:12:37,090
So you go to these festivals like you go
to Coachella. I haven't been there yet.

1154
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,460
I'll go next year. Oh, the burn the
burning man. You're into that. Yeah.

1155
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:45,370
But you like these borrow for sure.
Love Bonnaroo. You love. What do you,

1156
01:12:45,371 --> 01:12:48,250
what do you like most about
the festival lifestyle?

1157
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:52,150
Is it that where you have comedy
festival line festivals? Yeah.

1158
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:53,980
I mean the music sounded
like just standing in line,

1159
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:58,060
standing in line to take a
shit or p. Dot. Great. Yeah.

1160
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,730
So you're just focusing on the negative.
So do you,

1161
01:13:00,731 --> 01:13:02,710
are you the open urination kind of guy?

1162
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:05,740
What did you just piss in front of
people and stuff? You just piss on

1163
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,840
your courtship Porta potties. They're
everywhere. I know. Civilized people do.

1164
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:13,180
I'm asking you about. Oh
yeah, they all do that.

1165
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:17,250
Or I'll pee in this in this actually this
fucking thing. Yeah, that'll MTL later.

1166
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,093
Wash it out.

1167
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:23,740
Oh, why not? And then drink water out of
it later. Not right away, but yeah, later.

1168
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:28,300
Shove your Dick and misty.
It's wide mouth that gets right.

1169
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,900
Okay guys, you've got no, you've got
no vacuum. Splashbacks situation. Yeah.

1170
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,660
Are you one of those guys at
pease and cops in your house?

1171
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,320
Oh, hi guys. I'm a fucking grown up.

1172
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,400
I pay one of the house too and it bottle.
You got the toilet a lot of times. Yeah.

1173
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:47,060
Most of your ps are in
toilet. Oh yeah, those at all.

1174
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,210
Now do you fart in front
of your girlfriend?

1175
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,890
No. But will there be a fart barrier
that you break at some point you think

1176
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,770
[inaudible] I try to
time shit and the shower.

1177
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,730
You and I are both in the same boat
on that? Yeah. The shit show crew.

1178
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,710
Does she know about that? Uh,
not completely, but she says,

1179
01:14:02,711 --> 01:14:04,930
she mentioned offhand that like
what's your morning ritual?

1180
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:06,340
Why you in the shower so long?

1181
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:10,870
If I almost that just running cold
water while I fully shit and then so you

1182
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:12,130
can't the fucking gone,

1183
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,530
they might come out and you know,

1184
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,730
then I cup a handful of this
is maybe different from you.

1185
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:23,500
A couple of handful coat it with toilet
paper to catch the blood droppings

1186
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,560
and then make my way to the shower,

1187
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:30,940
turn the hot on and then
bleed out in the shower.

1188
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,090
Did she know about, has she seen the
Juke lamb? She does not. No she doesn't.

1189
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,940
I would tell her not to watch that.
All right. Yeah. For Brown, Brown,

1190
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,370
Brown,
Brown bread.

1191
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:48,560
Oh he's got that Brown,
Brown, Brown, Brown,

1192
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,080
Brown. You know what you
need. You need a washlet

1193
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,220
Bobby Kelly for the first time, just
like yours. And I really used it.

1194
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,880
I used to it. You move it up
and down, you've shifted right?

1195
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:02,620
Left like a claw for your ass.
It's great.

1196
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,230
But the only problem with
that is as a bleeder,

1197
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:09,970
I don't know when it's just water
dripping back down off it or it's still

1198
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:14,350
bleeding out.
Well then you can take an exploratory.

1199
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:17,950
Why do you ever check that thing out
with a doctor? He said it's cool to go,

1200
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,860
good to go.
We don't mean good

1201
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,080
stuff.
Yeah.

1202
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,920
Then it slows down, but
sometimes, most of the time,

1203
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:44,020
sometimes it just keeps going.

1204
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,980
When does that happen?
I don't know.

1205
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:51,430
I think it might be spicy food and
mature and so I'll walk around often with

1206
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:54,100
just a plug up my bud.
What do you mean?

1207
01:15:56,810 --> 01:16:00,520
Yes, like a Tampon, but just rolled
up toilet paper half in. Mostly out,

1208
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:05,230
soaking up the fuck you.
So is it soaked with,

1209
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:10,480
uh, I was on jury duty last year
and it soak through to the pants.

1210
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:12,743
Underwear.

1211
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:18,840
You gotta try Maxi pads or at small
Tampon? Try Maxi Pad. I'll do,

1212
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,840
wait a minute, is that okay? That was
not okay with to my doctor. I'm like,

1213
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:25,270
are you sure we shouldn't do
something? And goes, it's a operation.

1214
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,910
So fucking annoying and awful, but I'm
almost to the point where I'm like,

1215
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:30,510
I'm just going to get it.
You gotta you gotta get it.

1216
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,090
Might not even doing anything. You could
do a new European hour on it, you know,

1217
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,400
trans, trans, trans comic hour.

1218
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,160
Do you know what they're trying to get
people to say now instead of trans,

1219
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:44,380
because they're saying trans
is or like, uh, it's like, uh,

1220
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:48,190
they're saying one just do short
and things. It's like negative.

1221
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,980
They want everyone to call them.

1222
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:56,320
I swear to God on those trainee sexual,
no,

1223
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:57,940
but that's more to this more pejorative,

1224
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,930
but the heads of leaders in charge of
the trainee sexuals or saying that that's

1225
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:02,570
what you should,

1226
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:07,330
this is thought to be a really
lengthen it trainee sexual training.

1227
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:12,260
Sexual is less offensive and trans. I
disagree, but they're crazy these days.

1228
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,180
There has to be a website where
we can keep up on all the trainee,

1229
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:19,130
sexual.com please. Okay, let
me look at it. But seriously,

1230
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:23,600
can you please try a maxi pad or a Tampon?
I will give you some before you leave.

1231
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:26,770
And you're still a periods while you're,
while you're pregnant. No, no, that's,

1232
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,300
that's one positive and tampons.
Well,

1233
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,490
here's what came up when I
headed and training sexual.

1234
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,380
A lot of results though.
35 million.

1235
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:44,130
I don't think you made two words.
It's one word. It's transsexual.

1236
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:51,370
Homosexual. It's one word. Still.
Hobos. A bag and homosexuals.

1237
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,890
Fine. 20 sexual. Yeah.

1238
01:17:54,891 --> 01:17:57,800
This is not coming with anything that
you told me about and maybe I'm ahead of

1239
01:17:57,801 --> 01:17:59,840
the curve. Yeah, that's possible.

1240
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:05,390
But when I look at transsexual,
yeah, that comes up more. Oh yeah.

1241
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,570
Well what a patriarch or
we live in still look,

1242
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,080
trans woman. Trans is, yeah. Oh,

1243
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:17,870
can you type in, it's just the difference
between transgendered, transsexual,

1244
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,120
transgender, and Transylvania.
Dania, let's see what comes up.

1245
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,670
It's very childish and sensitive.

1246
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,270
Very sensitive,

1247
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:37,820
or your podcast or you can
just sensitivity trader
right here that go here.

1248
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:45,110
Oh boy. Do you know how I
went around the horn or no,

1249
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:49,720
it was was a PTI. No, around the
horn. And they have a guy, um,

1250
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:54,500
the stat boy correcting everything. No.
What's PTI like? What did we get wrong?

1251
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:59,370
Let me get wrong. Yeah. Fucking one
of those people telling us that,

1252
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:05,010
oh, here's a long whole thing had
already said about transsexuals.

1253
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:09,430
It's completely wrong,
but corn starch.

1254
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:18,120
So here we go. Oh, for, oh,
here's some, try it out. So
that came in, um, you know our,

1255
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:20,390
about our tryouts, right? Wait,

1256
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:25,280
I think I had one of these in Edmonton.
Somebody came at me with the try it out.

1257
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,970
They did. So it's based
on this guy who, you know,

1258
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:34,240
he made a video about how he wanted to
get fucked by black guys and he was like,

1259
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,450
you can move in for free. You can switch
accounts, you can live it for free,

1260
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:42,470
free rent, free food, free rent. You
could piss on me, beat me, try it out.

1261
01:19:42,471 --> 01:19:45,800
And he's like, try it out
guy. He always, he just says,

1262
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:51,520
you know, try it out. So

1263
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:58,910
people make their different versions
of the try it out, guy for us.

1264
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,090
I love try it out.
Be Cool about it.

1265
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,700
Listening.
It's a cow with a mustache.

1266
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,213
Calm.

1267
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:21,340
It's free. Rent. You guilty. So the key,
fuck me piss on you. Basically a home.

1268
01:20:21,341 --> 01:20:25,970
I know. He's seen me where I come over
today to try it out, man. My bills.

1269
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:35,190
I like when dogs and cats do people
hostage.

1270
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,360
Try it out by Rick.

1271
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:45,850
Black guys love to fuck and fuck.

1272
01:20:45,851 --> 01:20:50,260
Good Bureau, hot black
guy. You want to fuck me?

1273
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:55,210
Uh, 23 and that you want to
move, then you can move in.

1274
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:56,330
So this is

1275
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,740
very creative. Take on. Yeah, they're
all very crazy. A lot of times, you know,

1276
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:03,130
we have people doing it,
jogging. We had women do it.

1277
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,690
We had a woman do it in a seductive
way. We've had uh, aggressive,

1278
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:12,510
we felt like Shakespearean.
Yeah. We had the uh, kind of, um,

1279
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,760
like the law and order scene where the
guy had like a whiskey with him and he

1280
01:21:15,761 --> 01:21:20,500
was like, you know, try it out man.
So here's a polite, try it out.

1281
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,990
I have something prepared here.
Gentlemen,

1282
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,470
Enjoy Hobo, erotic sex, and have
had extensive experience in sex.

1283
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:34,100
If you're African American who
has made healthy life choices?

1284
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,730
What do I enjoy an afternoon with me?

1285
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:42,731
I currently reside at 2195
do you need a place to stay?

1286
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,650
I can accommodate what you
must engage me sexually.

1287
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:50,690
I have a rare medical condition that
does require me to have sexual relations

1288
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:55,820
often and in return I shall supply you
with food and shelter and anything else

1289
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,840
you may need to survive.
He's a fucking lads,

1290
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,370
plantation owner,
penal system,

1291
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:08,960
southern gentleman residences or from
a more radical different upbringing.

1292
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,650
My doors are always open
to you and your mates,

1293
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,050
your name and all the proper
paperwork and I do have an extra key.

1294
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,720
I do grant you permission
to urinate on me.

1295
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,280
It's pretty good, man. That's,
that's pretty good. I enjoyed it.

1296
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:30,770
Who is that guy? Did he get
what he wanted? I bet he
did. I don't know that the,

1297
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:34,980
the guy actually got you ever see the
guy looking for a girlfriend? Yes,

1298
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:37,160
I'm looking for,
I'm looking for guilt.

1299
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,100
They had those posts all over New
York with looking for a girlfriend.

1300
01:22:40,101 --> 01:22:42,860
Just want someone to be,
until I talk about books and movies with,

1301
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:46,700
if you're into that,
I'm looking for,

1302
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:50,060
I look for the kill so you can
just have like a flyer and be like,

1303
01:22:50,061 --> 01:22:52,070
I'm leaving her girlfriend.
The guy's kind of ugly though,

1304
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:54,530
and it's almost like
putting the focus on like,

1305
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,720
do you know if she wants something
real, I'm here for you. But it's like,

1306
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,480
I see that,
but yeah,

1307
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,260
it's fucking weird as fuck what's
happening to your body. Hey, no,

1308
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,480
it was crazy.
What the fuck is,

1309
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:11,620
are you blowing up like a goddamn balloon
right now? You've got a thing inside.

1310
01:23:11,621 --> 01:23:15,940
You're kicking against you. I know.
Like alien. It's bananas. It's nuts.

1311
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:18,580
It's a person. Can you feel it as
done? A kick and a punch? Yeah.

1312
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:22,650
It kicks your ribs. He
stretches out. What does flips?

1313
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,830
He flips around and say, fuck
on this podcast. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1314
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:32,140
How much do you want to be to kill
these people? Nope. Cool. Hang on.

1315
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:36,670
No water scapes. Just a such
a serene, tranquil setting.

1316
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,440
Shut up page.
Doring.

1317
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:50,530
Yeah. Would you go to Romania? I would
go. What'd you participate? Yeah,

1318
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,550
just a little bit. You put on the mermaid.
I mean, I wouldn't give up spots for it,

1319
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:58,670
but it was a daytime thing and a city I'm
in and I start our radio day. Yeah. Oh,

1320
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:00,330
maybe you'd go,
that's a little bit

1321
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,590
borough North Carolina.
Are you still live there?

1322
01:24:02,591 --> 01:24:05,870
I mean it's from all over the world here.
This is the largest,

1323
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,890
he lives in Greensboro.
Yeah. So fourth grade. Huh?

1324
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,980
First herb meetup ever

1325
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,890
Marie meetup as global.
Cause they got one,

1326
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:20,840
one lady from Afghanistan I this
harmless. Yeah. You think so?

1327
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,700
One of us.
I mean,

1328
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:26,300
except for the extensive
abuse that what if that would,

1329
01:24:26,301 --> 01:24:27,290
if they were abusing them,

1330
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:31,250
like the fucking Michigan State guy was
somebody to meet me up at this beautiful,

1331
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:32,750
nice thing and it's
like, oh no, it's ruined.

1332
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,900
I've made these tails right here. They
make their own trails. Don't tell anybody.

1333
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,310
They take me over four months.

1334
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:44,210
My Tales of our range from 2,902
her gown tail and it gets swimming.

1335
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:54,360
Wow. You think it's hurting anybody?
Oh No, he is hurting anybody.

1336
01:24:54,361 --> 01:24:57,960
I mean, I think it's, it's beyond
absurd. I wouldn't see that walk.

1337
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:01,140
I don't want to see them like
they're like, ah, oh yeah, sure.

1338
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:03,890
I could walk in this thing that's
been taught by grand for it.

1339
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,720
I mean it's for children, the children
for children, but a good, that's an adult

1340
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:14,790
weighs 50 pounds, 50th neutrally
buoyant. That's important.

1341
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:18,800
What do you mean?

1342
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,040
How many fuck ups do you think happened
during the day while they're deciding to

1343
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:26,650
do? It's like, oh right. It was 90
pounds. We did lose a few people. Yeah.

1344
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,900
When people were drying up,
we didn't pay her last merger mania.

1345
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:33,260
We lost a few of our fellow Mermaids,
but what did they do?

1346
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:36,590
They just put on there nice couture gowns
and then swim around with each other

1347
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:38,540
and then look at each other
and that's the whole point.

1348
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,880
But he's just a convention pool,
like a bunch of fucking nerds in a pool.

1349
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:43,240
That's what it is.

1350
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:47,770
Four years ago I discovered that there
was other word bracelets. People bad.

1351
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:52,940
We're in love with Mermaids
as I was as easy as the girls.

1352
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:56,380
You see a mermaid, like everybody's
like, oh, how beautiful.

1353
01:25:56,381 --> 01:26:00,780
But you see a guy and there
they're kind of, yeah,

1354
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:04,160
of course. Yeah. Yeah.
But also like how often

1355
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:08,030
are you seeing people see mermaids
where you're making this decision? Yeah.

1356
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,800
It doesn't happen all the time. Yeah. I
feel like your data points are not enough.

1357
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,750
This guy,
he really,

1358
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:18,650
I mean the crazy thing is you get this
level of heterosexuality in the Merman

1359
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:23,720
industry. It's very weird. I still don't
know how people have time for this shit.

1360
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:28,100
That's always a thing. As an adult, you
don't have a fucking job. A mortgage.

1361
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:32,090
Kids like I have the answers
for your mermaid. Yeah.

1362
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:35,570
Where are you making time for these
kind of hot Megan Megan Tales for four

1363
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:36,020
months.

1364
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:40,780
I mean even for him to go down to the
pool with the fucking crown and they make

1365
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:43,480
on and you've got to rent out
the whole pool or can you,

1366
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:46,370
this seems like a giant pool and
you get half and half with my kids.

1367
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,280
I don't know. Seems like other
like serious swimmers Beck.

1368
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,700
You guys got to get the fuck
out. It's five o'clock now.
Get Out. We're doing laps.

1369
01:26:52,701 --> 01:26:56,750
Yeah. Take your, your come fins
Outta here so I can work out.

1370
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,970
Yeah. Yeah. This is just a
different version of wild,
wild west. Get them out of,

1371
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:05,660
he's clearly, he's straight, so I think,
yeah. Well do you think he's there?

1372
01:27:05,661 --> 01:27:09,470
He's in it for the girls. The in which
case that's a good bracket. It's a good,

1373
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:11,870
how are you going to get
laid when everyone's wearing
a fucking tail over your

1374
01:27:11,871 --> 01:27:16,040
vagina? Yeah. It's not, it's not thought
out. It just comes when they're like,

1375
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:19,250
when it's time to like, hey, let's, let's
go look at our tails together in my room.

1376
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:20,930
It's a flop around like
wherever the water,

1377
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,320
other Merman

1378
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:25,930
have the world talk to

1379
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:32,210
share the love of the seat
in it and a bunch of dams.

1380
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:36,200
Yeah. I'll have to do is it, don't
like kids doing this. That's cool.

1381
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,110
When I first started
doing this mermaid thing,

1382
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:42,710
there was no one else in the world
that was doing it as a freelance job.

1383
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:47,360
And it is a child to look around
and see that there's hundreds,

1384
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,480
thousands of roommates around the world.
How do you know that I'm living? I agree.

1385
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:52,460
How would you know what no one
else is doing it? Freelance.

1386
01:27:52,461 --> 01:27:54,320
We have something super
positive to awesome.

1387
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:57,410
That would be so disappointing
about like meeting her.

1388
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:01,100
There's no fat mermaid.
She's a murderer.

1389
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:04,670
Met this girl at a bar or something
and you have no idea. Yeah. You like,

1390
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:08,060
she's cute. Oh that's articulate.
Yeah. And then she's like,

1391
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,790
I got this thing this weekend. I don't
know if you want to come check it out.

1392
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,890
And you're like, yeah, what is what?
I'm interested in your interests.

1393
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:18,400
I'm a mermaid. And then like all yours,
you're a fucking red flags. Kinda going

1394
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,460
like fuck you.
I'll be like all your fucking hat.

1395
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,020
I have a male ready to go out and
it just flags up flags up. This is,

1396
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,640
this isn't going to go anywhere.
This thing.

1397
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:33,200
Well and also she claims to be the
world's first freelance mermaid. But yeah.

1398
01:28:33,201 --> 01:28:35,930
How does she know that?
Well, because before this,

1399
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,030
it was only people who
did it for a living.

1400
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:41,960
They got four one ks and no one was
able to really shift this around a time

1401
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:45,350
where you up time, all
freelance. She's a freelancer.

1402
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:49,070
Thousands of roommates
around the world now.

1403
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,620
Hundreds of thousands.
I don't know.

1404
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:55,240
No living from doing this
beautiful art form art

1405
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,440
form. I mean, Pete, how does she know?

1406
01:28:56,441 --> 01:28:59,710
She's the first machine still
drown at every convention,

1407
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,500
but every week it better.

1408
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,350
Yeah. There's a big one
there. Big Old Merc.

1409
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,183
Wow.

1410
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:12,720
Back to the birthplace of all life itself,

1411
01:29:12,721 --> 01:29:15,780
which is the Ocean Mermaid accent.

1412
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:23,040
Well, no, but wait,

1413
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,570
we need this to reconnect

1414
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:27,230
with water. You know,
you can just go ahead.

1415
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:32,510
It also doesn't give you
breathing ability. So scuba
diving is nice as well. Uh,

1416
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,380
snorkeling, swimming. I just
want to say you're both jerks.

1417
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,350
That's a nice thing.

1418
01:29:38,351 --> 01:29:41,150
People were getting together for
a nice time and you guys were just

1419
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:46,390
were just bullies. Yeah. You're
just, you're just terrible.

1420
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:52,320
Seems like it really,
I think what angers by five another Merman

1421
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:59,010
is going through a 65 five another
merman. And the kid was like, Yo

1422
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,240
you sorry your buddy. I knew you were
here. I didn't choose to say anything.

1423
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:08,610
It just anchors me that it's adults like
grown people wasting their time with

1424
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:09,390
this horse shit.

1425
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:13,790
Do you think it's the same as a
kickball league or dodge balls?

1426
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,600
35 year olds.
Yeah.

1427
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,170
So you know,
uh,

1428
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:21,010
bangs on,
it's like stop it gross.

1429
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,210
Last week we had a

1430
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:24,813
banks

1431
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:31,400
grow the fuck up because anymore you're
not 12 stop it and quit wearing onesies

1432
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,510
idiot women pajamas. Get the fuck
over yourselves. We're adult clothes.

1433
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:38,450
Take you 45 minutes to Piss
stop it or non functional.

1434
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,300
You know we had a Fart Simpson.

1435
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:46,360
Tony do that prank call and
amazing prank call aware.

1436
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:51,500
He used that, try it out guy
and played it for people. No,

1437
01:30:51,501 --> 01:30:53,720
he had a guy,
he put an ad in,

1438
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:59,140
he went elaborate had the guy had
an ad out for renting his home.

1439
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:02,750
So then a guy was like,
I'm interested in renting this place.

1440
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,870
And then he answered the
phone and was like, Oh,

1441
01:31:05,871 --> 01:31:08,150
talk to my dad or my uncle was his place.

1442
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:13,430
And then use the soundboard to be the
piss on me, beat me guy. Like, um,

1443
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:17,750
and they got talked to
him. It was amazing. It was
amazing. And it was, I mean,

1444
01:31:17,751 --> 01:31:21,740
it was amazingly, and the guy was like,
I wouldn't, yeah, I want to come in July.

1445
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,590
And then the board would be like,
you want to move in? You can move in.

1446
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,240
And he's like, yeah, I want to come in

1447
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,170
food

1448
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:33,010
free rent at guys like free rent. And he's
like, fuck me, piss on me. I was like,

1449
01:31:33,011 --> 01:31:37,870
wait, what? It was fantastic. Played
it perfectly time. It's perfect.

1450
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,360
Wow. He did another one
where he called, um,

1451
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,810
this Texas rapper that he
found on craigslist. Um,

1452
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:49,210
he's been calling him as different
members of will Smith's family. And uh,

1453
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,130
and this time he got,

1454
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:56,131
he got this kid to talk to
a soundboard of Jaden Smith,

1455
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,040
will Smith's son. I mean, the kid talks to

1456
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,873
him,

1457
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:08,220
what's pop? And this,
my name is Jaden Smith.

1458
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,990
You seen La la land in
Minlow Anda and man. Yeah,

1459
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:20,650
like base my life mostly off of La la
land. I've never seen that movie though.

1460
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:24,320
If that's a movie, it's an ammonia.
Yeah. Who live in my life level.

1461
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:26,280
They Will Smith's son.
Yeah.

1462
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:33,040
So I guess you know I rap correct.
Last verse was before the Award Show,

1463
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,580
I contacted on my torso.
I don't have icon tatted on my torso.

1464
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:41,990
Do you know what I'm saying? I
know what you're saying. Damn.

1465
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,410
Um, yeah. Being obsessed
with like the sunset,

1466
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:51,290
the sunset and I'm like so obsessed
with it. I'm in the Sun, Sarah. No.

1467
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:56,291
Are you watching me or something that
somehow this is very strange as some say.

1468
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,320
It is nice though. I agree. It's
just a random guy. It's a random guy,

1469
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:03,080
I guess has put that he's
a rapper. Oh yeah. Online.

1470
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:07,580
And I know it's so how
disconnected are you?

1471
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:11,180
Just a mice drawer at the fucking keys
to compelling knowing what things to say.

1472
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,210
Oh, I think he's prepped for every cause.
You're not just playing and pausing.

1473
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,110
You're like deciding what to play
well in the moment. The future. Yeah.

1474
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:22,260
I believe you, you know, but my vision is
for people to listen to the inefficient.

1475
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,240
What do you mean? What
do you think? Joe Smith,

1476
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:28,700
Jimi Hendrix lighting guitars on fire.
It's like, wow. Like no one does.

1477
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,530
No one does this. Oh, like bat
like that inner vision. Yeah. Yeah.

1478
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,810
Bedroom in his bad ass,
man. That's just shit son.

1479
01:33:35,811 --> 01:33:38,540
You should go for it every
time he three brother.

1480
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,410
I don't got to tell him to put you
on a stretcher stretcher. I am here.

1481
01:33:42,411 --> 01:33:46,370
Anna still flex and flex and I am just
an icon living start a record label.

1482
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:50,240
Ms Fish just did it while I'm high
snob cover five minutes. Whoa.

1483
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:54,490
We are too hot in the business world.
You just make that up. Yeah, you did.

1484
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:58,420
Didn't she hit? Yeah, you just
made pretty incredible man.

1485
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:02,560
You can make freestyle music then. Thank
you. You should do it, man. Just tell him,

1486
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:04,820
tell him the streets down.
There'll be like holy shit.

1487
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:06,490
Much respect because
they're very respectful.

1488
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:10,000
That shit in that what's your spitting
is nice, Bro. What's at this point?

1489
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:13,300
This guy's having like a fucking five
minutes. What is this? What is this?

1490
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:17,770
I don't know. So necklace in mind. It's
like he's just talking to a sound bar.

1491
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:21,460
You know? It's so crazy, but I think
this guy might be a little crazy.

1492
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:25,000
The guy that he called. Yeah, definitely.
Yeah. I think something's wrong with him.

1493
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,620
Yeah, it's sick like Xanax. Let's take
as in they smoking out, chill out,

1494
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:30,281
then get blunt.

1495
01:34:30,281 --> 01:34:34,300
He's trying to be hell cause the blood
comes after the yell cause the hours in

1496
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:38,470
why? That's the way it goes. The sake
of the EC has spoken blood. Whoa.

1497
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:43,830
People hit me on Twitter like [inaudible]
let me talk my piece on and they hit

1498
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:48,970
me on the gram like Jay, you styling.
You know my swag was on a thousand.

1499
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:54,130
Hello, is this you guys do
send me a picture of it.

1500
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,200
Wait, what? Forget it.

1501
01:34:58,330 --> 01:35:02,650
It's so embarrassing to hear people rap.
Isn't it like freestyle? Absolutely.

1502
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,720
I can't think of what's more embarrassing.

1503
01:35:04,721 --> 01:35:09,721
Somebody singing with an acoustic
guitar at me or somebody rapping to me.

1504
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:13,910
I feel like they're both part
three of the somebody rapping

1505
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:18,840
at you. Yeah. So it sounds like you want
to hear me spit and you're like, okay.

1506
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,810
And then they asked. Yes. I would
love to hear your spit. Yeah.

1507
01:35:21,811 --> 01:35:23,920
And then there they actually go for it.
Uh,

1508
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:26,820
everything inside of me would
tense up for sure. Two. Pardon me?

1509
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:29,430
Thinks any musician is
super lame because like,

1510
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:32,400
so what do you have like a singing
club with your friends? Yeah.

1511
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:35,150
Like when you break it down to that level
of like if we were in high school and

1512
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:38,130
you're just like, hey, we're all going
to sing together, play some music.

1513
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,430
John would play the piano and
I'll sing. It's true. That's a,

1514
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,280
we have a joke telling club,
I guess. Yeah, that's true.

1515
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:48,120
We don't all meet together and do it.
We do it on stage alone. That's true.

1516
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:53,100
But it is weird, right? It is
joke. Yeah. It's weird. But
how weird is it? Someone's,

1517
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:55,850
uh, when somebody's like, hey,
you want to hear my new bit? Oh,

1518
01:35:55,950 --> 01:36:00,540
I don't like that either. They tried to
do it to you. I got to. Who does that do?

1519
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,900
What the fuck is this? Do you guys send
me a picture of this in front of boobs?

1520
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:08,950

don't know, cause he took drugs.

Well do you want me to throw it? I will
blow up. You want me to throw? No, no,

1528
01:36:35,711 --> 01:36:39,310
This is crazy. All right. It's
reality hasn't really hit me. Okay.

1529
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:43,990
I'm trying to clear people's palettes.
This is bad ass man. What do I do?

1530
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:48,400
What do I do to make my, make my music be
heard by the masses, man. Somebody will,

1531
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:49,900
Smith's son Tommy went to do,

1532
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:53,770
you can sit and like whatever way
you want to say it or imagery.

1533
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,120
What's going on here?

1534
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,760
Yeah, and it just keeps
going on. Parasites. It is.

1535
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:02,630
He really embarrassed or just things to
be said in some of the things that I say

1536
01:37:02,631 --> 01:37:03,950
are super important.

1537
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:09,350
I wouldn't talk when I was young
because I was contemplating life weird,

1538
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:13,490
you know? I mean this guy just as
full hook line and pull in. Yeah.

1539
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:17,930
He's all eight on this asking
for advice saying crazy shit.

1540
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:21,710
But I think,
I think he's pretty fucked up.

1541
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,680
Just thinking about Jada
Pinkett Smith the other day,

1542
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:27,550
I remember when her children
were younger and she was,

1543
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:31,270
they were starting to push them
into show business and she was like,

1544
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:34,840
they were doing show business shit
really loud 10 yeah. And she's like,

1545
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:38,170
there is so much talent in our house.

1546
01:37:38,171 --> 01:37:42,940
We are so talented like, and I just
think now that I'm a parent and I'm like,

1547
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:47,170
I couldn't even imagine the
pimping my children at all. Never.

1548
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:51,060
I would never pimp out my, you know what
I mean? Yeah. It's handy or all 11 year.

1549
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,150
They're too young. It's too, it's too,
if your child actor best case scenario,

1550
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,183
case scenario,

1551
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,050
best case scenario, they book
nothing. Right. They just,

1552
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:03,660
and then they're met with like their
parents disappointment cause they're not

1553
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:07,230
doing well. Right. That's best
case scenario. Worst case scenario,

1554
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,250
they book a bunch of stuff,

1555
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:13,790
become child celebrities and have
an Odi at 26 that's like crazy.

1556
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:19,230
It was pretty bad. Said, why
would you make your kid, I
don't know. It's terrible.

1557
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:22,810
It's terrible.
I so talented.

1558
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,580
There's so much talent in this house too.
Celebratory.

1559
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,150
When they asked her about literally are,
they're fucking silly.

1560
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:33,090
People asked her about like
if they have an open marriage,

1561
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:39,870
we all can do what he wants to do.
If he can look at himself in the mirror.

1562
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,700
Oh, and everybody was like,
wait, what does that mean?

1563
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:48,510
That means that means that some
shit don't fuck anybody ugly.

1564
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:53,220
Basically. You could look himself in
the mirror, like whatever, I guess. Wow.

1565
01:38:53,221 --> 01:38:57,120
Oh my gosh,
that's crazy.

1566
01:38:57,510 --> 01:39:00,750
How do you put reins on will Smith?
I mean, he's like the hottest dude.

1567
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:03,870
You know guys like that.
They just fuck.

1568
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,710
This family's too talented
to be held back sexually.

1569
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:12,250
Trying to think of can you,
what if,

1570
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,910
what if we were one of your kids wanted
to go into acting? What would you do?

1571
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:20,250
I say, wait until you're 18 at least
to your same as same as alcohol.

1572
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:25,470
Same as what? Same alcohol. Like not
now. These are adult things, things.

1573
01:39:25,471 --> 01:39:29,280
I don't think you're emotionally equipped
for the judgment and the criticism and

1574
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,970
especially now. I mean, my goodness,
he put something up on Youtube,

1575
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:36,510
people shit on you. It's like, Gosh,
why would you want that to like,

1576
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:41,670
no, I'm not interested. I
don't even, he doesn't need
to work. You know what I mean?

1577
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:48,030
Fine. You can just be cured job later.
Get a summer job and that's it. Yeah.

1578
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:52,110
I wouldn't put the kid to work, man.
Let's work. It's show business, you know?

1579
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,180
Terrible. Yeah. No.

1580
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:58,260
What kind of mom or Dad to knowing
now what you know who would do that?

1581
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:02,680
I think they're living through the city.
This fucking city where I know,

1582
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:07,190
I think you think it's glamorous and fun
and like a hobby or something like that

1583
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:11,640
kid don't know. There's like,
Whoa, let them in a school play.

1584
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:14,160

it. Yeah, maybe that I'd be like,

1585
01:40:14,161 --> 01:40:18,990

festival. No, that's right.

1588
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,250

1589

city. I got three days there.

1596

1599
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:16,510

think about it. They might not want jokes.

1600
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:19,860
When are you due?
July 18th.

1601

Then I could finally hit the road
for life and I'll see you later.
