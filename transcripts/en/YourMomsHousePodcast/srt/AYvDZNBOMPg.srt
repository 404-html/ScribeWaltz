57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,520
ma'am. I can call him. He likes
me too. You need to set down.

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,620
You need to settle down to find your
business, ma'am. Once again, man,

59
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,670
don't bring it in one loving

60
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,700
well. Well. Well, go to your mom's house

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,920
and
Christina.

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,753
Oh,

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,790
Ooh. Snap. Like, Hey, how
are you? What's your name?

64
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,820
What's Your Pronoun?
Really funny that you would ask?

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,020
What's your Pronoun Tom
Today? Um, he him. Wow.

66
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:38,130
Traditional Z's him. He, him. I'm always,

67
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,770
they you are. Well, yeah, I'm,

68
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,170
my gender is fluid throughout the
program. Oh, so you can go anywhere.

69
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,120
I could.
I started as a woman this morning,

70
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:51,090
but I'm feeling a little neutral right
now. I'm going to go anyway. Yeah.

71
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,320
That's nice. Yeah. So you feel
you've got coffee gendered?

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,980
Hey,
that's a new one.

73
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,380
Yeah. I really like
that. It's, what is she?

74
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,340
It's ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. Like Gosh,

75
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,220
she can't tell why somebody would
be confused by you. I mean the,

76
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,670
the righteous indignation
over the confusion.

77
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,913
Clearly

78
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,960
I respect and I really do. If anybody
was like, here's my my pronouns,

79
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,310
I'm going to call you by your
Pronoun Preferred Pronoun.

80
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,090
But you got to expect some
mistakes, you know, out of the gate.

81
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,290
Right.

82
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,640
There's no way you're walking around like
that because she looks like she could,

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,280
you know, start at
defensive tackle. Right.

84
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,270
Excuse me. It's ma'am, ma'am,

85
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,630
you need to settle down and mind
your business once again man,

86
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,170
I guess she is at game stop
or something like that. Yeah,

87
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,240
something like that. Let's just call
it a nondescript game store. Okay.

88
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,630
A nondescript game store trying
to I think make a return and uh,

89
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,800
I think it's, you know, she's being
offered to them as all game stores do.

90
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,250
You're like, I bought this for 60 bucks.
They're like, we'll give you $2. Okay.

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,900
So trying to maybe do a sale like
return or something like that. Um,

92
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,680
and then gets indignant,
very upset about,

93
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,480
I think the offer that's being made
for the game. And then his mis-gendered

94
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,503
uh,

95
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,850
both of you guys right beforehand,
your fucking

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,833
mother Fucker,

97
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,113
mother fucker.

98
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,900
And then she kicks over
to him merchandise there.

99
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,690
I like how her gender is fluid too,
because when she wants to be a surf,

100
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:02,900
she can be as hard as she did. Say,
I'll show you a search. She's like,

101
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:06,740
I'll fucking show you. So
that's, that's, that's pretty,

102
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,000
that's pretty fluid.

103
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,460
Talk. Call them and talk about how
it's misgendered several times. Oh,

104
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,130
I need your corporate number now.

105
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,530
Well,

106
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm going to ask you for the fifth time
to stop calling me a man because quite

107
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,180
clearly I have not,

108
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,220
no,
clearly,

109
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,863
Ooh,

110
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,960
you're going to disrespect
and Trans people in the store,

111
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,990
which I plan on telling the entire Lgbtq
community who was mulling over this

112
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,980
damn hello. She's so up. It's almost

113
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,300
like I kind of feel bad,
you know? I do. I do.

114
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,220
Cause I imagine it's
very difficult when you,

115
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,210
when you are trying to present one way
people keep mis-gendering you and you're

116
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,960
like, dude, look, you know, but what
I learned from what was that show?

117
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,210
A lost in translation or trans
life for yeah. Yeah. One it,

118
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,750
those like the Tlc one is,
uh,

119
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,260
like I remember there was a
guy who was transitioning, uh,

120
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,820
Boston transition lost
in transition. Yeah. Um,

121
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,620
there was a guy who was transitioning to
a woman and had just basically started

122
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,400
and look like me with longer hair,
no beard,

123
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,410
but like big shoulders.

124
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,640
And she was getting her nails done
and somebody was like, hey man.

125
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,960
And she was like, God, why are people
calling me? Man. It was like, well,

126
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,990
cause you look like a fat guy
with a pink with a pink, um,

127
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,530
crop top, like the pink crop top
doesn't mask everything just yet.

128
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,310
I'd give it some time,
trap fool and shoulders.

129
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,960
I want to get my nails done. And they're
like, okay. And then so it was like sir.

130
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:07,260
And she was like, God
dammit, what do I gotta do?

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
I've been doing this for two weeks. I
don't know. You need a lot more surgery.

132
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,100
I know. And well, and too, I think I
would, it would be ruder of me to be like,

133
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:20,310
what should I call you? I don't know
what you are like, how should I,

134
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,320
what Pronoun should I call you? That
might be more rude. Really? Yeah.

135
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:29,950
Then just making an assumption expert.
Hey,

136
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,060
how are you? What's your name?
What's Your Pronoun? Yeah.

137
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,070
That's how you should do
it. Yeah. I don't know.

138
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,480
I would feel more rude to
anything. No. Now that I,

139
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,310
now that I hear it and I see this now,
I feel like you probably should,

140
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,270
but and you don't delete in is, you
know, just say what your Pronoun, it's,

141
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:48,690
what's your name? What's your name? Cause
sometimes someone's going to be like, oh,

142
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:53,370
it's Angela. And you'd be like, oh,
I was going to go. But if it's pat,

143
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:57,180
Chris Terry, yeah, but like then if
you're following it up, what you go,

144
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,290
what's your name?
What's Your Pronoun?

145
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,200
Then it's like you're trying to make an
effort and if they're like the fuck are

146
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,800
you asking me that?
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
And they're like, is Kyle my
God? What the fuck? I'm sorry.

148
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:14,010
I just thought maybe that you are. Well,
and here's the, here's the deal man.

149
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:18,360
Here's the problem is that a lot
of these I would, if I had another,

150
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,980
if I had more time in my life,

151
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:24,900
I would become like a trans coach
and I would help women dress.

152
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,870
Oh,
I see women dress like more feminine.

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,370
The problem is these patients are trying
to dress like they're a car Dashi and

154
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,350
hot and they were like
the Valore tracksuit.

155
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,450
That casual female style, like if
you're gonna, if you're a new female,

156
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,410
you got really fem it up so
that the public knows like, oh,

157
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,980
they're very much presenting as a
female. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.

158
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,990
It's kind of go overboard and then dress
it up and then when you're more changed

159
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,260
then then you can dress down as a
hot chick. You know what I'm saying?

160
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,380
Like I go big dangly earrings,
real obvious rate, long, long,

161
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,510
long hair extensions and
shit. You can't be like, oh,

162
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,550
just like casually agile girl. No
Dude. Like I can pass as a fee.

163
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,510
This is casual girl.
How'd he saying?

164
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,940
I mean I present as a woman sometimes.

165
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,080
It's brings me to my next topic.
I was on the airplane traveling.

166
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't know if you do this. I was
in Madison. Oh Dude, I big debts.

167
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,970
Now we're talking. That's my mom.
Yeah. She's got a big tits too.

168
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,250
She's got a big old and she
doesn't like to wear a Bra. Anyway,

169
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:41,320
so any huddles,
I don't know if you do this,

170
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,750
and I wrote this down because I
wanted to talk, talk about it.

171
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,500
When you're on a plane and you're in an
airport and you're looking at people,

172
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,520
and let me preface this,

173
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,010
preface this by saying it's so random
who you end up with in life, right?

174
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:54,760
It's crazy.

175
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,900
It's a matter of like that
night I could've gone out
with a different comedian,

176
00:12:58,901 --> 00:12:59,740
a different person,

177
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,650
and then falling in love with somebody
else and now I have a totally different

178
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,380
life that doesn't involve
sold out theaters,

179
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,470
Ferrari's, Mcdonald's, sponsorships.
I mean I'm fucking ball.

180
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,320
I know and I,
that's why I preface,

181
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,310
I clearly made the right choice.

182
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,630
Ular but do you ever stop and
think like sometimes I'll be like,

183
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,510
what if I wasn't like with Tommy?

184
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,170
Like do you ever see people on the plane?
You're like,

185
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,570
what if that was my spouse all the time?
Really course.

186
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:34,690
But then I immediately find a flaw
and the stranger and I'll be like,

187
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,310
but we would never work
out because that guy,

188
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:39,250
we're top siders topsiders
with the gays thing.

189
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,450
And you always find something like where
you're like, man, yeah, I've got French.

190
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,710
She got French mannequin. Yeah, I
fucking hate French manic. Yeah.

191
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:49,870
And like I could never love somebody
with a fresh manic and then I feel like

192
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,390
telling her, I'd be like, you, you got a
lot going for you. But the solid color,

193
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,760
I feel like telling them too.
That's so funny. Like if, um,

194
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,460
like for instance in
Madison it was so cold,

195
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:06,250
it's like two degrees and then there's
a guy in front of me who gets on the

196
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:10,960
plane wearing shorts and sandals, sandals
and you're like, I could never love you.

197
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,050
I could never love you.
Because fundamentally we see the world.

198
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,840
So definitely as human
beings it's completely,

199
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,970
it should be mandatory that your mind
plays that game and your mind should also,

200
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,000
if you're somewhat, I mean,
unless you're like miserable,

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,790
but your mind should get to the
point where it goes like, oh,

202
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,820
but this wouldn't work out
the game that your mind plays.

203
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,460
I think everyone does that though.
Yeah. You see the person, you're like,

204
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,630
I can be married to you baby.

205
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,070
I don't ever think I go, I go like, I'll
see a nice looking guy and I'll be like,

206
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,620
I wonder what their light like,
what's wrong with that guy?

207
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,780
Because there's always some,
there's always a rub with people.

208
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,880
There's always there.
They're given,

209
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,050
they're taking their bad
sides and you're like, yeah,

210
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,650
what's the darkness and that person, like
what's their flaw? And then you know,

211
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,880
you make one up in your head and like,

212
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:58,650
I know that guys immediately
sometimes you'd be like, yeah,

213
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,490
if I was married to her,
then she starts talking.

214
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:03,690
You like this bitch never shuts
up. Or You'd be like, yeah,

215
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,640
it's just give good head.
You can see the way she's eating.

216
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,140
You can tell that just by watching it.
I'm just saying,

217
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,790
well in my head I'm making it up, but
she gets bad blow job. I'm like, yeah,

218
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,570
she doesn't use spit enough. You know?
She always neglects the balls. Yeah, yeah.

219
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,090
That's what you're worried about is the
blow job quality. Well also, you know,

220
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,530
like just conversation is a big way,
right? So I'll start being like,

221
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,310
oh yeah, that could be what
if I was married to her?
And then she starts talking.

222
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,930
I'm like, oh for fuck's sake. Yeah.

223
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,040
Like if I were married to
somebody who wasn't a comedian,

224
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,910
how difficult that would be for me
because then I'd have to pretend like I'm

225
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,700
this normal person all the time.
Yeah.

226
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,450
Because I did date an
attorney before you and eh,

227
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,620
when I became a comedian and it
ruined her. Do you ever have the ammo?

228
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,640
I've had it now where I've met
a few people and I have just a,

229
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,480
I dunno, I guess my professional
demeanor on with them, like just polite,

230
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,830
nice, you know, a couple of times. And
then they come to a show and they're like,

231
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,440
whoa. Yeah. You're like,
well that's really who I am.

232
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,543
Yeah.

233
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,950
You know, that would be likes I
met you at like whatever, you know,

234
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,630
accounting office or something.

235
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,440
Cause I like on this show,

236
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:21,970
I get to be myself 100% in our home
life. I'm 100% mean, but then if I,

237
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,450
you know, I'm at the airport or if I am,
I'm trying to be normal purse. It's a,

238
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,290
it's a concerted effort for me to hold
it together and not say what exactly what

239
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,140
I'm thinking all the time.
Of course it takes a very,

240
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,710
and you know what I love about you too
and I, I told you this the other day.

241
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:40,030
Why think I'm so lucky to have you.
I'm so messy. Yeah, you really brought,

242
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:42,630
you were really into that.
I'm so messy.

243
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,650
I just dropped and in 15 years
together you've never once been like,

244
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,000
God damn it. You pick up your fucking
underwear. Why don't you pick up your,

245
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:56,410
so like you've never done and you
let me wear any of your shirts to bed

246
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,700
cause I've had boyfriends in
the past who have been like,

247
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:04,390
you can't wear that shirt. That's
like my good one or what? I know.

248
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,070
Horrible people. Right. See that's why
I only can marry you bay. Of course.

249
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,170
No, but you never give me shit about it
either. I know. That's why we work out.

250
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,870
I know. Thank God you almost married
this guy on the plane though. There's no,

251
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,210
there's no like specific. Literally like
I'll be sitting. Did you touch his leg?

252
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,420
No. I'm sitting in a plane likes people
pass me by and I'd be like, can I,

253
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,960
can I love that person? I want to hear
about the ones. I love that person.

254
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,910
It's very specific for me. I
look to see some photos. Okay,

255
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,500
next time I find a guy I think I might
love if I could love that person started

256
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,710
doing the same thing. Think
I might love her. Yeah.

257
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,740
Could I love her? Could I love
that? I think I might love or it's,

258
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,380
can I love this person? And then
you have to find the flaw and then,

259
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:03,010
and then I'll be like, oh,
we hooked up. Oh No, no,

260
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,890
I fucked her and she,
now here's the game, Tom.

261
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,950
The game is stupid shit.

262
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,540
The game only lasts a total of 10
seconds by the way, last that long.

263
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:20,040
So if I haven't done it in a while,
no, I mean the game of everything.

264
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,270
10 seconds. No, no. Here's
the game. You're on a plane.

265
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,330
You're watching people filing,
you go, could I love this person?

266
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,430
And then within 10 seconds you find
the flaw and then you're like, I,

267
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,840
that's why I love my husband ones. If you
don't find the blog then are you like,

268
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,140
oh my God, that's the worst. No,

269
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,100
you'll always find the flaw because
then you don't find the pull in my mind

270
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:41,340
cause I go, I'll be like,
that guy's way too neat.

271
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,340
He would never put up with my message
is Tom puts up with, no, I know,

272
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:47,630
I see those type a women too who
are like, perfect. Oh my God.

273
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:51,120
You imagine how mad they would get
at me. Oh my God. What is this?

274
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,130
The farting and the burping. Scratching.
Scratching my arm pits. Yeah.

275
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,800
Yeah, that'd be like,
Oh shit. She be like,

276
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,110
Oh, you know, I did not sign up for this.

277
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:08,160
And like that's what you got
now was your new man, ain't no.

278
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,620
And then, um, so there's that story.

279
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:14,190
So play that with your spouse if you're
listening and I'm curious to see what

280
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:16,590
you guys come up with as
deal breakers with strangers.

281
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,130
Maybe run your finger along.

282
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
That's a fun game to play
with your spouse too.

283
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,040
You gotta know what your smells are.

284
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,200
You to learn to learn your smells,

285
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,110
smells in here. You should kind
of know them a little more.

286
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,650
Everybody knows their own smells. You
know you're asking him. I was like, yeah,

287
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,260
from running your finger along it.
I don't have to run my finger.

288
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,270
I feel like I just know that with every
narrow and then if you need a shower,

289
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,080
because my nuts

290
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,860
where those compression shorts to the
gym yesterday and then I didn't have time

291
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,330
to shower.
We went to that appointment.

292
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,630
Then I came back and men really stripped
down in the bathroom. I was like, whew.

293
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,380
Ripe. Really? Right. Do you
wash the shorts? I hope so. Nah,

294
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,610
I put it back on right
away. Yeah. Yeah. What the,

295
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,790
how many guys work kind of brew?
How many guys listening are like yeah,

296
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,950
just put it back on. Oh,
there's guys right now we're
like, oh, keep talking Tom.

297
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,080
That's hot stink.

298
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,640
So weird out coach. I wouldn't even
know what to do without coach. Yup. Um,

299
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,860
and so also another topic I wanted
to bring up is that when I was away,

300
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,570
when you came up, you have a new thing,
you've found the new show. Oh yeah.

301
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm really excited and it actually
informed me and I think you're going to be

302
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:49,930
happy about this.

303
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I now think it is stupid and
wasteful to get jewelry for my 40th.

304
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,750
Yes, thank you. Praise Jesus. You know
why there's no utility in jewelry.

305
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:04,180
You're absolutely 100% right.

306
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,110
So the idea that you would spend that
amount of money on something I just put

307
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:10,770
around my neck a silliness.
It's stupid. And Liz,

308
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,600
Danny Brown said someone could come
and snatch it. Exactly. You don't want,

309
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:18,601
that's why I want to refocus my efforts
and yours hopefully into getting a jet.

310
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,670
I was watching this show selling jets
where couples who look like they own jets,

311
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,310
we're buying jets.
And how much money do you think we have?

312
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:34,600
Like we don't Mcdonald's, we had to give
back the money. We don't have 2 million.

313
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,750
Here's the great thing I learned that
most jet brokers let you just put 20%

314
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:45,370
down. So it's like buying a house and
we just need, how much is 20% for a jet?

315
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,400
Well, that's the thing is that
there's so many options. You know,

316
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,530
like there's light jets, midsize
jets, super admid heavy. I mean,

317
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:58,120
I think right now we're probably looking
at like a super light or something.

318
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:01,080
You know? How much is that? I mean
that's the thing. I don't think Steve,

319
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,090
I don't want to get lost in
the weeds of the numbers.

320
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,790
I think it's just something that
it makes a lot of sense. Yeah.

321
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,770
So much more utility than a stupid
chain. You're so funny. I can, I know.

322
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:17,080
I can hear the future we have to get,

323
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,010
we also have to buy the helicopter
that goes with the jet way later.

324
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:25,240
That's like three years from now and then
we have to build the hell a pad on top

325
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:25,960
of the house.

326
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,300
That's a great idea to buy the yacht
with the helicopter landing pad. We have,

327
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,710
why do you have a chopper if you
can't land it on your yacht? Right.

328
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,370
Look all I'm here. Just a few loans. Yeah.

329
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,720
Okay. A few loans. We
got to get some loans,

330
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,940
how many millions of
dollars we're talking about.

331
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:45,340
That's the fun part is you can decide,
you know,

332
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,260
you just basically look at,
you know, your needs and,

333
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,840
um, person, here's the great thing.

334
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,970
I found out Rockefeller and his
[inaudible] found out that, uh,

335
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,680
through executive charter
services that manages these, uh,

336
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,620
chats,

337
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,240
we can bring down basically our whole
operating costs by at least 50% just by

338
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:11,740
chartering it out 150 hours a
year. I'm like, God, who are we?

339
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,380
I don't know. I just, you know, I
think it's a good idea. Anyways,

340
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm turning 40 in a couple months and
I'm looking forward to seeing, uh,

341
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,590
in the driveway and I'm
like, God, do you get,

342
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,900
I would get, yes, but what
would our church think?

343
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,070
I mean, that's true. They don't,
we don't, you know what I mean?

344
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,740
They're gonna be like, wait, why aren't
you donating money to the church?

345
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,030
He should be giving it to us.

346
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,060
What can I say to get you to just
sign off on this jet ID thing?

347
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,120
There's nothing you can say that would
make this remotely logical. I got an idea.

348
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,100
I cannot, I'll donate some of my
flying hours to the church. Okay, good

349
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,980
deal. You got yourself a deal,
homie. You know important.

350
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,040
It is for the church,
me and my church.

351
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,690
I needed my priest to be able to
fly around in comfort. All right.

352
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:10,310
You have a point. Can we show up
and do it? No, no. It's insanity.

353
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:14,510
I mean it's you talking like a crazy
person. Is there one dream I can pursue?

354
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,100
He goes, support. Here's what, here's
what I will tell ya, bro. Real talk. Yeah.

355
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,980
If you're at that like Ron white
level where you know what I mean?

356
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,800
I know one has a plain crazy. That's
what I'm saying. Like if you're

357
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,460
there and I got an idea. That makes
sense. Hey, we got a book, Ron White.

358
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,250
Oh, he's the big guy to get them
on here and we got to talk about,

359
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,030
we got to Cadillac to talk here.

360
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,290
Doesn't he live in Florida or the
south somewhere? He has a Texas place,

361
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,150
but he's in La a lot. God, he's so fine.

362
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:44,570
You just need them to do a sales pitch
on why we should get a plane. Okay.

363
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,980
All right. Great idea. Thanks. I love
her. I'm like, thanks Ron in advance.

364
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,943
All right.

365
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,060
Um, and also we, yeah, I mean

366
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,540
I'm still upset about it. We
watched the Michael Jackson. Yeah.

367
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,300
We need to actually, we're
going to do this, I think,

368
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,300
think,
um,

369
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,060
this would be a great conversation
to have with our very own Josh.

370
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,990
Oh, the expert in creep salad.
Yeah. Sad. Dude. Why don't we,

371
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,420
should we stop down for a moment?

372
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:22,070
Why am each we'll be right back and we
are back and this is one of the most

373
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:23,770
exciting

374
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,070
times that we have doing this podcast.

375
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:29,970
We get to bring in a hilarious comedian,

376
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,200
a good friend and a questionable person.

377
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,540
It is Josh Potter.

378
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,590
Ooh, it's good. Right? I like that.

379
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,893
I like it a lot,

380
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,610
Tanner, for making that tanks. Tanner,
you really affect the lady's Josh.

381
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,590
I guess so. I have some sort
of effect, I guess. Right?

382
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,440
I guess any effects is goods and nun.

383
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,670
That's true. Uh, their effects
on me so far have been the same.

384
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:13,460
And that is no effect.
So we're still a no.

385
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,140
Recently I have, I have
put some reps in. Yup.

386
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,410
Sort of some research, if
you will, to find, you know,

387
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:24,310
to keep finding the bottom of this
mystery. And a, I did, you know,

388
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:29,170
I started at the bottom and
now we're here and so far,

389
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,530
you know, I've gathered some research.
I think I need to have like a,

390
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,620
a brain orgasm first.
You know what I'm saying?

391
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,290
Like a connection with somebody, you
mean? Yeah, because I drift away.

392
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,940
Maybe when you're on that,
what is that?

393
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,220
Oh,
that's my bedroom.

394
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,920
That's where I bring girls to come.
Do you like it?

395
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,920
Don't like I had a girl
not liked it recently.

396
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,800
She said she would get
my going to die here.

397
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,030
She was cold and that she would let me
tell you. I mean, why don't you describe,

398
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,820
let me break it down. Describe it.
Describe it. Well listen. Hey, it's clean.

399
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,450
So that's wonderful. You're already
a step ahead. I don't own any things,

400
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,100
so there's no way to make it messy.

401
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,270
So it's just like a bed in
a corner and there's, um,

402
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,250
I've been candles and you
have a candle. It, hey,

403
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:18,570
that's a for effort and that's my weed
next to it. And that's your weed. Good.

404
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,730
I mean, look, it's sparse,

405
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:25,731
but I liked that it's clean and I liked
that you even have a frame work that was

406
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:28,740
there when I got there, so. Oh really?
I was really pumped about that.

407
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:31,560
I've never had one of those before.
I've slept on an air mattress.

408
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:36,090
I slept on a regular mattress lay
sleeping on. Now that's a tempurpedic dog.

409
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,210
It's not as good as the sot
vote, but it's a, you know, I, I

410
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,110
immediately, yeah. What are you
doing here? I mean, I'll take,

411
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,740
I'll take a new mattress for a, sure. That
suitcase. That's a suitcase, by the way.

412
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,580
I see that. And then what's draped over
the headboard? Those headphones? Oh no,

413
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:54,480
that's just the blinds from
the, Oh, I tell you, number one,

414
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:59,200
what's wrong is that his bed is pushed
against the cold windows. I like,

415
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,910
of course you do. But any woman who's
laying nude in your bed or semi-closed,

416
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,370
it's fucking cold.

417
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:08,060
You're not supposed to sleep next
to them as a total lunatic with,

418
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,980
I know he's a cockroach.
They complained also that I like.

419
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,780
I don't have enough like
pillows or something. Well,
how many pills he, I have one.

420
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,660
That's all. I've only one head weight.
One pillow. Why you can you see?

421
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,770
What about for the chick that comes over?
I get one from a couch or something,

422
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:26,940
you know? No, no, no. She can't sleep on a

423
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,490
pillow. Tells a woman. This
is not going to be, well,

424
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,230
I think experience into pillows.

425
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:38,040
Presumptuous like human
sleep on two pillows.

426
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,130
You deserve to pillows.
Yeah.

427
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,520
God. Blue Band. Do you sleep on two
pillows? Yeah. I'm not a psycho.

428
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,680
That's a psycho move. I have your
head, your badge at f four pillows.

429
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,980
It's more that I don't even have
four of anything in there. No,

430
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,970
you should get four pillows. I have.
I don't have even for blankets.

431
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,110
Two for you to, for the lady that's not
going to live long after she lives there.

432
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,180
Okay. Let me ask you this. What's with
the medieval, the medieval tapestry.

433
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,810
That's a buffalo hills. That's
Buffalo. Bill's helmet. What? Okay.

434
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:15,960
That needs to go serial killer.
Now this looks,

435
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,250
it looks like he's got a medieval
combat tapestry. Buffalo bills,

436
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,570
a blanket that I got from a couch now
that's take that off. That this terrible.

437
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:27,630
Then I don't have any blankets like a
dog blanket. You should get you one.

438
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,570
Let's get you a different
style blanket, you know? Yeah.

439
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,690
That's not a bedroom blanket and that's
just some clutter at the end of my bed.

440
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:37,770
I'm sorry. That's fine. It's actually
pretty bare. And that's how I live, dude.

441
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:41,980
I that suitcase, I put that down
the day I moved in, that's where

442
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,900
it stays. It's part, it's
like my nightstand, the
nightstand, the nightstand,

443
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,740
the nightstand. That's what I had to
search with the suitcase does. No, no,

444
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:55,570
I get it. But I mean, you know, you're
not a freshman in college, right?

445
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,410
So yeah. But I mean like, I guess
here's the thing, like for real,

446
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,010
I always think the next day they're going
to throw me out of these places. Why?

447
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,290
You know what I mean? I Dunno. I've
lived in so many different apartment.

448
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,890
I've been here now for a while, right?
Yeah. Yeah. It's been, this is a little,

449
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,720
maybe one of the longest departments
I've ever lived in in my whole life,

450
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,280
so that's why it's like,
can you take him Jesus Christ and take,

451
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,830
take it until the way Ikea.
Yeah, somewhere and gets them.

452
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Let's go shopping for furniture.
I need help.

453
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,870
I just want to get you some pillows.
A blend of different blanket.

454
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,020
I'll tell you another thing that they,

455
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,490
that the thing hang on the
wall while they, yeah, that's
where I was going to get.

456
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:34,290
They said that. That's weird. I don't
have anything on the wall. Zero.

457
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,330
It's all bare. Yeah. He's cause
he's living like he's a transient.

458
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,770
I'd be kicked out. Why do you think you're
going to get kicked out at any moment?

459
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,260
Is that a real threat?
Never been kicked out of her apartment,

460
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,070
but I've had to move at a rapid
pace a lot and then like you know,

461
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:50,900
you on the road, sometimes you
want to have an apartment. Yeah.

462
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,200
You're just kind of live in
other people's departments.

463
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,660
Do you think he'll stay here
for awhile and I want to,

464
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:59,380
I hope I stay here for a long time.
The bare walls not good. No Shit.

465
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:00,214
What do I get? Like, oh,

466
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,510
so I should get like a Jim Kelly poster
or something a way football player.

467
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,880
No, boom. Now we need just like,

468
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,540
let's just go get you a ladder
football player like ray Lewis or

469
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,770
maybe like a, you know, whales
jumping out of the water. Like A,

470
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:19,110
I like a neon Miller lite side.
[inaudible]

471
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,520
we have to squint your eyes
and the image pops out.

472
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,770
Well where would you
rather spend an evening?

473
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,390
In my bedroom or in the
now vacant Neverland ranch.

474
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,810
So yeah,
we were getting on a topic that,

475
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,810
I mean like if he want to listen
to Michael Jackson's music,

476
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,220
don't watch that documentary cause it's
so hard to go back to loving him after

477
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,054
all that.

478
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,830
I mean the part that makes me the craziest
is that he wasn't trying to conceal

479
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:52,480
the fact that he was a PDO file is your
dad says yes. There was no concealing it.

480
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:55,000
Like in the 80s. He, he paraded his,

481
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,950
his boys around out in the open end.

482
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,780
He did that and we all were complicit.
Everybody was like,

483
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:06,340
Emmanuel Lewis is your date
to the grammys? Cool. No
problem. Yeah, he likes kids.

484
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,323
That's a big guy.

485
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,270
And Jay Leno would make a joke at night
being like a kid's pants are half off.

486
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,640
And then, uh, everyone would
laugh and we'd all clap.

487
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:19,510
And then we listened to thriller and
that would be that he's the ultimate,

488
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,590
he was the ultimate,

489
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:25,330
like we've seen this with people
that are talented where we, um,

490
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:30,010
the talent pollutes our mind
into excusing certain behavior.

491
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:30,761
It's a hall pass.

492
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:35,761
He is the ultimate talent and name where
he was so famous and so talented that

493
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:41,840
we were like, he fucks. But I mean,
have you seen thriller? Like, yeah,

494
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:42,920
it was basically,
yeah.

495
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,920
That's what the sentiment that
was going to be weird with kids,

496
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:50,921
but boil them in a studio and it makes
mad really mean off the wall was a pretty

497
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:54,140
perfect at all.
Have you seen that moonwalk?

498
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,920
Touch my kid? You know, Daniel, by
the way, in that documentary, if they,

499
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,850
uh, if the parents were my
parents and they were like,

500
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,220
they were like a, hey, you know, sorry,

501
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:10,640
we've been separating from your
child so much. Uh, we just need,

502
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,820
we want you to have the nicest hotel
suite. My mom would have been like, yeah,

503
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:18,200
you can fuck him to
a hotel suite.

504
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:22,460
That'd be dope. Yeah. I
would totally be like,

505
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,770
just do whatever you want. Actually,
I think my mom would be the,

506
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,040
she would've been,
I would've been like so pissed at her.

507
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,050
She would have been like, you can't go
hang out with Michael Jack. I'd be like,

508
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:30,890
fuck you mom.

509
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,620
And then I would like go listen to Michael
Jackson in my room and turn the music

510
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:35,020
up real loud.
It would be because

511
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,070
Mommy said we're going to fuck.
And that she'd be like,

512
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,670
what's a disturbing doc?

513
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:48,671
What am I disturbing to me is that the
parents are still recounting the events

514
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:53,720
with Michael fondly. Like, and then we
got to fly first class all the way back,

515
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,650
the glimmer in their eye and talk
about it. It's sickening. Yeah.

516
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,320
There's still recalling it like
it was just a pleasant tail.

517
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,070
Nothing bad happened in that
situation again. They'd be like, yeah,

518
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,540
I think it all turned out fine. It's
worth it. We got to ride in a limousine,

519
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,020
Wade Robson's mom seemed
unfazed and it's like, well,

520
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:16,260
my son became a dancing prodigy.
Yeah, so she's like, how bad was it?

521
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,310
The way she makes sense.
That's the way she looks at her face.

522
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:23,750
It's me now are they all were like, it was
really an interesting house. Oh my God.

523
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:24,500
They went,

524
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,590
I wanted to bring up the house actually
because of this for sale right now.

525
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,690
Do you know that Neverland
ranch is for sale?

526
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,050
Besides do you want to be in on this
jet? Okay. What's the numbers? Well,

527
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,940
I want you,

528
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,940
because it went on sale initially in
2015 and it was worth $100 million guy am

529
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,030
now since this documentary's.
Yeah. Let's talk about the barn.

530
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,170
The value has dropped. Sig Nicholas. Okay.

531
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,490
Where do you think it's at right now?
To him? That's 500,000 came out. Yes.

532
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,700
Really?
Yes.

533
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,710
Well also the prelude to this
coming out, you know in, yeah,

534
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,290
people talk cause you
were saying you know this,

535
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:06,440
is this going to change the way you said
there was a lot of hype on this before

536
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,810
it came out.
So in the wake of that,

537
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,090
where do you think it shows up in the
mind thing to the nun sexual abuser.

538
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:15,200
It's probably a turnoff,

539
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,270
but I think to somebody that
celebrates um, pdf files,

540
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,360
like my dad,
it's a pdf file hall of fame.

541
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,560
He's covered in just, yeah, that Shit's
Canton. If you're, you're a pedophile.

542
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,700
And I was talking about it before.

543
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:35,910
We guessed the number that one of the
guys was talking about all the rooms he

544
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,880
went to Aa.
That's another thing he's

545
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,160
going to think I think lower than the
value of your more details in here.

546
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,250
And we did it here. Whereas before, if
like if you didn't know any of this stuff,

547
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:48,000
you'd be like,

548
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I want to have this Michael Jackson House
to remembered honor Michael Jackson.

549
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,770
Now you'd be like,
we got to tear this shit apart man.

550
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,310
Which was like a murder for me.

551
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,040
Let me preface this by saying I had lunch
one time at the Charles Manson murder

552
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:05,070
house right now and I want to get
to that in a moment for his guests.

553
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:08,610
You're fit to be cleaned.
I was counted land.

554
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:12,750
Hold on more early on is discounted
land and significantly so it's child sex

555
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,110
land. This was priced at 100 million. Who?

556
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,250
I would say injured went down to 70
I'm going to go low or I'm going to go

557
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,270
70 25 million to him.
You are in the department.

558
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,610
You're kidding.

559
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:32,610
Dropped 70% it is now
listed at $31 million.

560
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,400
Wow.
I don't think it's going to go up

561
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,090
now. You mentioned that it, is it just
bank? Nobody owns it. I had to know.

562
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,480
I don't know who the broker is.
Have you made a Ferris wheel?

563
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,420
The cotton candy machine.
The monkeys played and this is,

564
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:53,220
what do you think he was
like that all the time.

565
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:56,600
Do you think he talked like that? Like,
cause you know he was like, you know,

566
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,820
he'd have to like, it's
ignorant. Ignorant on that.

567
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:04,560
Do you think behinds you'd be like
your Shit's off key. Yes. Yes,

568
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,790
yes.
I think he put on that bullshit total.

569
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,650
This is gentle and I lacked children's.
How did he get his,

570
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,340
how did he get a skin lighter?
No, that's all surgeries and she,

571
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:19,290
when you have that much
money you can do anything.

572
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,220
He made his daughter in a lab
and she's a gorgeous, gorgeous,

573
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,950
probably started with his ass
hole and then he was like,

574
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,860
she bleached asshole I think. So
He's like, I'm going for this,

575
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,130
lifted it up, showing it to the
doctors. No, take a closer look.

576
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,620
And then they were like, oh
yeah, that is pretty white.

577
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,320
And then there was a point
where he was perfect.

578
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,820
I would say when he came out and
thriller, he really looked, has knows.

579
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:48,840
Is it a good place? He was cute,
like off the wall. A little rough.

580
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,250
But that's the Thrillist started
plastic surgery. If he had,

581
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,090
if he hadn't pushed it past that he,
yeah, it would have been like, oh,

582
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:01,770
this guy had a little work done. But he,
and then he just kept going like that.

583
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:04,560
Do have plastic surgery.
He became probably addicted to it.

584
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,160
Total body dysmorphia
for sure. But you, Brent,

585
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,580
you've mentioned the Charles
Manson that you went to visit.

586
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,830
I had lunch one time at the clo drive
and I spoke to the gentleman that

587
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:20,850
purchased it and he said, well, yeah,
that murder land is discounted land.

588
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:23,880
So he got it at almost half price.

589
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,260
It was a tear down exact.

590
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,480
He tore it down and he built
this completely garish nuns.

591
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:33,930
It was multiple waterfalls
and Elvis Presley Room.

592
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,040
The guy is a total but is not a,

593
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,780
this is a common thing. Jon Benet Ramsey,
his house has been for sale forever.

594
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,010
That they had to change the
fucking street name. Oh, J house.

595
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,780
So the coalition didn't even kill
her there. That's right. Yeah.

596
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,790
Those apartments still function. I bet
some of lives in that fucking unit. Yeah.

597
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:55,150
I believe in that fucking go hook it up.
I got a bed in a suitcase.

598
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:58,870
I can move into there, but uh, I got
a lease and a key, the question is,

599
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,880
would you rather live in a home
where a terrible murders occurred?

600
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,550
Yeah. Or the Neverland ranch. Murder.
Murder. All everyone say murder.

601
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,700
Why? Well, what is the
ultimate eat the worst.

602
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,470
Evil is definitely what Michael was doing.

603
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,050
There's nothing more evil and
distinction where my uncle,

604
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,860
but I'm thinking in terms of aftermath,
you know like in,

605
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,090
in terms of living in a place,
the murder they splayed open,

606
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:31,000
their guts are everywhere. There was
blood everywhere. Sure you clean it.

607
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,720
But that happened. A person was inside
out in the home. They don't, don't care.

608
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,150
Not compared to care to a kid. Yeah, but
there's nothing, I mean there's nothing.

609
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:44,151
I rather bathed in the blood of a hundred
slaughtered women even step into a

610
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:50,050
room where something happened to uh, wow.
Well, Manson and the Sharon Tate murders,

611
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,190
she was seven months pregnant. They cut
open, her pregnant belly took her baby.

612
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,490
I wouldn't live in, I'm saying I would
live in the Manson house over Neverland.

613
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,000
Amy [inaudible] is terrible. I
mean, look man, even in prison,

614
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,680
inmates have a code that
what Michael was doing is

615
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,450
I would have signed up to watch the
little, do you think are Kelly's here?

616
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,210
If our Kelly does go to prison,

617
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:12,610
you think they fucked him up where
they're like they fuck with him.

618
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,110
They won't put him in the general, he'll
be in protective custody. But he also,

619
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,120
there's a term for it
and I forget what it,

620
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:24,121
cause I've seen it in one of these
shows that he actually targeted women

621
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:29,110
entering their sexual a 14,
15 year.

622
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:33,070
That's what I mean. So the prisoners will
be more because our Kelly's brother, uh,

623
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,830
in this documentary about
r Kelly for instance,

624
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:37,630
if we can shift gears for a moment.

625
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,250
His brother creeps is involved in the
documentary and he's actually in prison

626
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:45,190
from the documentary.
He is good. Yes. He's,

627
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,800
he's interviewed from prison now
are Kelly has a couple brothers.

628
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,240
He's got a brother Kerry who's younger.
Those are right there. He's there.

629
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,670
What I do, man, he, yes.

630
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:59,410
And then what he did was he'd be like
singing about sex and fucking and shit.

631
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:01,510
And then he'd go, I'm going to do
a church song. And everyone's like,

632
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,620
it's forgiven. You know what I
mean? Well, same with Michael,

633
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,630
wasn't he like you got to save the world.

634
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,040
It's got to make the world a better place,
our than,

635
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,380
and you are not alone by the way. It's
a, it's a, it's always the and huge.

636
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,570
Yeah. Our Kelly wrote that nailed
years ago. We play years ago.

637
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:24,980
Peter King, I think that's
his name, right? I am the
only guy with the right was,

638
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,300
this was right after Mike died and

639
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,710
I think this guy's still in
office. Uh, 11 uh, but he,

640
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,810
The v celebration of Michael
as being ridiculous like this.

641
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,690
Hi, this is Congress from pitching
and a yesterday I'm watching tools.

642
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,520
What did your wife Prays and One
Chore and Really Reminded me Of,

643
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,380
do you have a great men and women who
sacrificed so much for our country?

644
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,400
People fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan
today? Yup. Cops, firefighters, teachers,

645
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,240
none of whom really get much in the last,

646
00:41:57,241 --> 00:42:02,241
I don't know how long now this lowlife
Michael Jackson space picture is all over

647
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:04,660
the newspapers, television, radio.

648
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,630
So we hear about as Michael Jackson
and let's knock out the psychobabble.

649
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,180
This guy was a carver,
Arkansas Child restaurant header file.

650
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,870
And to be giving this much
coverage to him day in and day out.

651
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,460
What does it say about us and our country?

652
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,750
Well, here's the deal. He
must be really mad today.

653
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,620
Oh man, this guy's probably
play playing this deal. Look,

654
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:30,350
I know it takes on, this is the only
correct opinion on all of this. Oh, sure.

655
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,930
Skype. It came into my head
immediately, right? No. Yeah.
The next morning I woke up.

656
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:36,360
I remember that guy we
played. Yeah, this is the guy.

657
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:39,530
This is the right fucking
way to think about this whole
thing. Play the rest. Yes.

658
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,290
Correct. No one wants to stand up and
say, that's right. Michael Jackson. Yeah.

659
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,360
He died. He had some talent and you're
fine because people dying every day.

660
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,310
There's men and women
dying say in Afghanistan,

661
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,960
let's give them the credit they charge.

662
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,660
I really think the media
has disgraced himself.

663
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,730
I think of too many people in public life.

664
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,460
I made fools of themselves by
talking about Michael Jackson's.

665
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:00,550
If you some kind of hero,
there's nothing good about this.

666
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,660
Maybe a good CEO did some dancing.
You let your child

667
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,310
never may have been a good thing and
dance. Dancing. Oh by the way, I want,

668
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,300
I just want to take this moment to thank
you for taking me on the road and never

669
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:20,770
making me stimulate your nipples.
You're welcome or spread. That was my,

670
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:23,800
that was the other one. See
your a turn me off. Yeah. Yeah.

671
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,400
I just hope I don't get old and
gross and kicked off tour. Yeah,

672
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,170
but are the answer.

673
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,400
Did some dancing.

674
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,420
But I wanted to show you our Kelly's
brother cause he was in prison and he is

675
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:40,890
the only one coming to his
brother's aid in this documentary.

676
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,300
Yeah. I haven't seen the art Kelly Doc. I
can't. Why can't, there's a Jetta goodbye.

677
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,200
Oh Geez. A commercial
jet. Sure. Younger women.

678
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,500
You have people who have
fantasies about different things.

679
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,610
I like hold your women. Okay. Figure.

680
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,410
Nope.
That's just a preference.

681
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,640
It's a preference. Everyone
has preferences. It's true.

682
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,440
So what is the big deal?
What's the big issue with my brother?

683
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:13,930
Hmm.

684
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,340
Can Dare to answer. Yeah. We mean,

685
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,530
I think for people who,
I

686
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,700
don't know,

687
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,860
those people who are listening or
watching who don't know about the r Kelly

688
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:30,150
details. Really? You don't think so for
sure. It's, I mean, with the documentary,

689
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:33,450
I thought, no way the people
have the same amount of this,

690
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,210
this story has the same amount of
exposure as Michael Jackson in a way.

691
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,750
That's a good point. And uh, I think
though it's, it is in the news right now.

692
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:43,800
Michael have, Nadia has picked
up another charge for our Kelly,

693
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:47,540
so he is being prosecuted again in
the wake of this documentary. Yeah.

694
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,000
But his brother,
uh,

695
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,080
his other brother Carey was not so ride
or die with r Kelly because r Kelly

696
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:59,841
approached him about taking the fall
for the pee pee tape being like,

697
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,100
oh,
tell him it was you in there.

698
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,620
Well, you just turning on your
radio. We're talking to Carrie Kelly,

699
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,750
r Kelly's younger brother. You did a
body double for your big brother Robert.

700
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,240
You body's calling and things kind of
turned a little ugly when this whole child

701
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:18,990
molestation thing came into play.
People were trying to say was you,

702
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,950
his attorney said that it was me and a
video saying, hey, that was the argument.

703
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,400
He never came forth and said, hey, you
know what y'all are hearing is not true.

704
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,290
Yo, did we have another tape
of a tire? More restaurant?

705
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,740
Do we have another type of a Bruce? I
can't remember. Oh yeah, that's the third.

706
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:34,760
Yeah.
Can you play that one?

707
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:39,761
This is Bruce's reaction to his brother
not liking the idea of being not only

708
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:44,340
the body double in music videos, but in
his sex tape as well. For what he does.

709
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,470
Robert simply ask Carrie
to tell the truth,

710
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,930
do a deposition with his attorney stat.

711
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,740
The things that he was saying
was not true. And he said,

712
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,430
if you do this deposition
with my attorneys,

713
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,640
I will give you $100,000 in
a one record contract deal.

714
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,090
I never understand that
it's wrong causality.

715
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,600
If you could have been rich,
I never understand.

716
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:17,030
So he's like, I can't say like
turn that idiot. He's like,

717
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,340
hold on million down
to the recognize shit.

718
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,390
Put My fucking name on that deposition.
Oh my God. So, um, so Bruce,

719
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,820
what's he in jail for? Well,
he's been in there for,

720
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:30,270
I had to write down his charges.
Nothing wild by the way.

721
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:34,590
Nothing like r Kelly has ever done. Yeah.
For the record it's just burglary. Oh,

722
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:37,660
things like that.
Like a drug possession and okay.

723
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,190
And stuff like a no violent
crimes unless you, uh,

724
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,990
consider basically like for people
that aren't well informed on the arc,

725
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,520
how the scandal that he like,

726
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:51,840
part of it is that he's
been keeping women, uh,

727
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,750
basically as sex slaves.
Oh yeah.

728
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,780
Like locked up in homes with like no cell
for to that because he's been allowed

729
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,620
so much leeway in the past.

730
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:04,710
He was just kind of doing things like
Michael Jackson where he was bringing

731
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,320
younger women around and things
like that. People just thought, oh,

732
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,450
he likes the younger one and
people help facilitate that.

733
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,650
He married Aaliyah when she was 15. Yeah.
That was so, and it's also the thing too,

734
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,770
it's like prodigies that
they build, right? Yeah.

735
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:20,610
It's like Wade Robson has turned
into an international dance,

736
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,470
Super Mega Star choreograph for dance.

737
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:27,930
You know that I did not know that the
way the Australian boy that could, yeah.

738
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,420
Yeah. He, he's uh, he was the
choreographer for like Brittany Spears.

739
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,560
That right guys is that they

740
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,773
say,
what did I say?

741
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,790
I want to be a comedian more than I want
to be anything in the fucking world.

742
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,010
I want it so fucking bad.
And if you,

743
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,340
if you make me go back in time and you
told me like this is what you do it,

744
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:58,610
but you're going to be Sebastian.
I don't know that I would've said no,

745
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,620
take the deal.
Really.

746
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,180
You would just have your childhood robbed
from you and now you're doing Madison

747
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,890
Square Garden, right? There's
cause. Think about this.

748
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,380
I said this to somebody and
they think I'm a monster.

749
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:16,090
There are so many children that are
victims of terrible crimes like this,

750
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,130
that are in a fucking alleyway
or a fucking dumpster behind it.

751
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,020
You know what I'm saying?
Like terrible circumstance.

752
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,360
These kids got immune park at least right?
Free Popcorn.

753
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,610
She got to see screeners a fucking
Bambi before that came out probably in,

754
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,550
I don't know if I can get onboard
with this lie not taking jobs.

755
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,020
Obviously all of its pair. Wait a minute,
you are a comedian, you know I want,

756
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,221
you know what I mean?

757
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:49,960
Like I and I'm very happy to be a
comedian but that's my point. Like I,

758
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,710
my desire is so much and it's like how
much do you love dance and dude like is

759
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:56,980
it wasn't what I would like to ask them
that question. Was it worth it? Yeah.

760
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,230
Being Michael's sex slave as a child.
Oh my God,

761
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,650
we could bring Sebastian and on this

762
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,950
John here another phone quote from
our Kelly's brother. By the way,

763
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,240
me and my brothers, we all have our
ways with our girls were very jealous.

764
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,520
We don't want our girls
doing certain things.

765
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,160
You're not going to see our
girls talking to too many people.

766
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,480
That's just the way we are.

767
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,170
Cause he was keeping them behind closed
doors and shit and like he was keeping

768
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:26,860
them safe, keeping them clearly really
his ride or die. This brother. Yeah man.

769
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,610
He is, well, could you imagine being
in jail for all these petty things?

770
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:33,490
He's probably in there for a, for
a quite a few, few years, you know,

771
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:37,930
after amounting so many crimes and his
other brother gets this other opportunity,

772
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:40,810
he's just sitting there and this
felt like, shit, what the fuck?

773
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,120
I would love to fucking do that.
You know what I'm saying?

774
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:46,510
I wonder what you would be willing to
do right now. Other things you want.

775
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,400
This is interesting.
[inaudible]

776
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,740
it's not about what I would be
willing to do to anyone else.

777
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,620
It's like what I would be willing
to have it. I'm talking to me.

778
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:57,454
That's what I'm saying.

779
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,580
I would degrade myself to levels of which
are inconceivable to achieve my goals.

780
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,290
Yeah. I mean, I haven't
sold my soul at this point.

781
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:12,490
I mean like, I don't know. Let's
say a big time promoter. Yeah.

782
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,930
Um, he's like, you know, I,

783
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,550
I can hook up any gig and
I'll have a plan for you.

784
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,850
We were going to do is we're
going to start off in these clubs.

785
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,960
It's going to be this and then
theaters and it's a three year plan.

786
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,670
You're going to make millions
dollars. You're going to
sell all these tickets. Uh,

787
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:34,160
kind of my house at first thing's first
hands behind your back, mouth open.

788
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,160
I'm dipping my balls. In your mind.
Who is this guy? First of all?

789
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:41,180
Is it he's a Michael Jackson guys. A
little creepy. He's a little weird.

790
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:45,490
He's a heavier set man. Older. It
doesn't smell. Is it a try it out guy?

791
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,800
Kind of like the try it out guy. Yeah,
you have to do the try it out guy.

792
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:49,820
You're his sex slave.

793
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But the end game is something
inconceivably successful
or it's Harry or we asked

794
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,050
to do Terry's butt plug every day,
I think. No, I think try it out.

795
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:03,670
Just the plot plug and try it out.
Guy. That guy is, I have to eat.

796
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,970
Try it out as you can come every day.
He lays it out for you.

797
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,250
He tells you the deal,

798
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:15,190
you know you got gotta you got to bend
over showing her ass whole lot. Yeah.

799
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,870
And he wants, you know,
now what if I'm you,

800
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,240
you said I have to make
him calm every day.

801
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,870
Do I have to make him calm or do
I have to at least try to, no,

802
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:26,360
you have to mention he doesn't come.

803
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,460
I and I put in all the effort and I'm
really just firing on all cylinders and

804
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:32,330
I'm giving them everything.

805
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:35,930
I got the whole kitchen
sink and everything and he
doesn't come and I still lose

806
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:40,670
out. You can make them come though
achievable goal. Is it okay.

807
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,850
Cause that's the only thing that would
concern me is if I was put into the

808
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:47,510
situation and I couldn't succeed in my,
uh,

809
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,700
end of the responsibilities.
Do you know what I mean?

810
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,410
Then he takes it away from me.

811
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,920
Then I wouldn't have liked to
put myself in that kind of a,

812
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,750
how many days do I have to make
them come? Like, is that expressive?

813
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:59,990
It's a deal with the devil. Oh,
so it's like if forever ever,

814
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,710
I don't know if I could do, here's
why. No, no, no. Let's do forever.

815
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,910
Only because when you molest children,
yes. Ruins them for their whole life.

816
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,960
I still have the psychological damage,
not as an adult. It's a little more, well,

817
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,180
can you mess with children that way you
destroy their soul for the rest of their

818
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,450
lives,
right?

819
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,490
The rest of his life be destroyed.

820
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,350
Let's have a time limit
though to see if this works.

821
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:27,140
I don't know that I could do rest
of my life. I think I could put a,

822
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,890
let's say there's a six round through.
Well, you mentioned the three year.

823
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:34,550
It's a three year progression to success.
Once I hit the mountain top,

824
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:38,410
I get to stop you. How it'd be
like, all right. You know, sniff,

825
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:43,850
sniff. No, no, no.

826
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:46,310
Let's do this way.
Let's do an actual deal with the devil.

827
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,850
So he gets successful and
then in the afterlife thing,

828
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:54,680
there is one every day he has to
suck the train. See land stuff.

829
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:57,590
I'm talking about a real
fucking pitch where the guy,

830
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,780
I am giving you my pitch pitch. The
guy says, come over to my house.

831
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,660
Suck my balls and eat my ass every day.

832
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,300
I'm going to fuck you and all your holes
and then I'll give you gifts. I look,

833
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:13,250
try to negotiate some of it down. I'd
be like, everyday it's tough. I'm going,

834
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:16,400
I got stuff. So then he says in the
fuck area. Okay, well then I'd be like,

835
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,300
can we do three days a week? And
we do, you know, get out of here.

836
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,120
Do you want it fine? Yes, I'll, I'll do
every day. We'll see how long we know.

837
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,820
What did you really do it?
You think you would really do it for that?

838
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,350
I don't know man. I really think I'd
think about it. I really do. I don't.

839
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:36,140
First Time, the first time he comes
all over your face, you're like,

840
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,200
and you go like to wash off and he hands
you the envelopes got like eight grand

841
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:44,000
in it. He's like, yeah, your job.
I would feel funny that he's like,

842
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,830
you're playing the Improv this week.
I would feel discussing with myself,

843
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:51,240
but it doesn't it. I would feel
happy at the end. End result.

844
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,410
I already hate myself, so that's
not going to like decrease really.

845
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,340
Do you know what I'm saying? Like so
much therapy. I just don't think like,

846
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,530
I think it would be out to, I'd call
my friend and be like, you know,

847
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,970
I had to suck this fat old man's thick.
It was terrible. I mean it was everything.

848
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,450
He was as awful as you think it is.

849
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,390
But you threw me an envelope of
a crane and I've got a fucking,

850
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,560
I'm doing all the improv snatch, so, so
I think other comics would it be like,

851
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,960
well shit. All right, you really, you
really think you would do that though?

852
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,500
I think I might think about
it. That's all I, I don't,

853
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,980
I've never been put in there. What if he
started really the way that you put it,

854
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,870
like where you're like, and you're
doing theaters. I'd be like,

855
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:27,840
am I selling all these tickets
because I sucked a dick?

856
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:30,000
Then that's all it takes then fine.

857
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,170
Now what if he really started hurting your
ass hole? That's going to hurt. I mean,

858
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,650
that's key, but you're selling
more tickets, more pain,
more game, baby, let's go.

859
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,610
You know? I mean Shit,
I see his point though.

860
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,690
It's hard to sell tickets and
to become something in this.

861
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,550
If I just had to suck a dick,
then I would do it the way that I,

862
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:54,480
I when I pointed it out. Yeah.
Speaking of tickets, where's your show?

863
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:59,220
March 22nd at the Hollywood improv lab.
I will suck all your dicks.

864
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,310
Buy Tickets. 10:00 PM show, 10:00 PM show,

865
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,090
line up in the back after and
uh, we'll get it going. You know,

866
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:06,891
you're putting that out there.

867
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:11,730
There they have a right to get their dick
suck now. Okay. Some dicks. All right.

868
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,670
All right, good. Um, I would
rather get buck pounded than suck.

869
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,920
Suck dicks to Jesus and saying,
think it tastes people.

870
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,610
Oh wait, no. I would rather,
I would rather have a dick
in my ass then in my mouth.

871
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:30,710
Wow.
To really think about it to my mouth.

872
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,950
No, no, no. Think about it. But
really think about it for one minute.

873
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:39,720
Your ass is a nightmare. All Ready?
Yeah. Here's the thing. Taking it.

874
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:44,480
Yeah, I agree. I'll do.
Then you have to taste it.

875
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,310
You're going to fucking have
to scope and be like, ah,

876
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:51,330
and you're going to be like, it's
your fucking teeth and shit face babe.

877
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:55,890
Someone's fucking your face and asshole
where your poop comes out. Who Cares?

878
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:00,910
I agree. I'm with Josh on
this thing 100% all right.

879
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,220
Time to think about it though. Yeah. You
really want them in your beard and stuff.

880
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:09,730
Think it tastes it all day. You can't
get that taste out. You don't like,

881
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:14,440
you don't even eat certain foods.
Right. So trail, I don't like olives.

882
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

883
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,890
And I did like all is all
in your beard on your eyes?

884
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,620
Depending who's Dicky tastes.
It'd be like an dog.

885
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,810
It'd be like a big holiday and his nuts
could stink real bad. Oh they will? Yeah.

886
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,241
This guy,

887
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:32,280
this promoter guy I'd rather do in this
class because then you can just hear

888
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,180
you're bucking heel shit.

889
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:39,160
All the Jews out of Utah Right about
definitely finishing in your asshole.

890
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,030
Yeah. But I mean, I was
like, and he's like, aids

891
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,490
comes in your butt. And then I'd be like,
Oh God, you know, it's tough to sit down,

892
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:51,340
but I'd rather that than
be like, yeah, we're like,

893
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:56,080
the rest of the fucking day he tastes
it and every time he's in here Tommy,

894
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,280
I don't want that. And he's like, Oh God,
it keeps the of your butt. But good news.

895
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:06,310
You're playing Talia Hall of Chicago
so it's all sold out. I'd be like,

896
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,380
not my stomach.

897
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,400
I had some other nightmares I
wanted to bring up. If we have time,

898
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:18,490
I don't know how much, I don't
know. He may not. We're running out,

899
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,780
we'll have to shelve it.

900
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:24,310
But there is one other gentleman I'll end
on that is from a band called the lost

901
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:28,300
profits to ban. I listened to as a
child, as a teenager I should say.

902
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,910
And they weren't very popular at all.
That shit man right there.

903
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,680
He was Michael Jackson on
steroids but had no fame and no,

904
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,950
nobody helping him in this regard.
And he was not like,

905
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:42,160
as you noticed that these guys are
like all elaborate in their schemes and

906
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:44,770
everything like that.
This guy was not at all.

907
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:47,230
So he was pretty easy
to catch an a monster.

908
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:49,330
We got out of the realm pretty quickly.

909
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,920
What happened to him was the British
version of the NSA went to hack his

910
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:58,030
computer because there was rumor that he
had child pornography on it. Oh Jesus.

911
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,310
Crowl and uh,

912
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:04,410
they didn't take long to crack it because
his password turned out to just be I

913
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:09,640
fuck kids. What? That was
his password to his computer.

914
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,210
Could you imagine being those,
that crack team of detectives and you,

915
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,390
do you think it took them long or do
you think they sat there and were like,

916
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,450
I'm just gonna try a couple of things
here real quick and just put in a couple

917
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:23,350
of last words. Guess number one.
Yeah. He's like, the guy did one, two,

918
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:26,110
three and he's like, no, that didn't
work. Let me try my second idea.

919
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,470
And he figured it out pretty quick,
but this guy's in jail.

920
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:33,400
So you listened to his music? I had
t shirts. I had, I was doing my,

921
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:37,630
I was given to the band and it, it was,
it wasn't like I didn't give a fuck.

922
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,220
I'll never listen to the band again,

923
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:42,490
like it wasn't that prevalent
in my life that I was like,

924
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:45,190
I'm going to miss he locked up
right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:48,280
He's fucking in jail for
this guy on a plane, Tom,

926
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:52,870
to go back to our first discussion. Okay.
This guy's walking past me now and I go,

927
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:56,950
could I love him? Here's the number. What
do you think the turn off his hair? Yeah.

928
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,960
I'd be like the hairs too complicated.
He's got teeth to co two intro.

929
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,270
I was going to say the
earrings too complicated

930
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,030
and I don't like carrying your angel hair.
It's too dark. It doesn't match. Yeah.

931
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,300
Sorry about that.
About those lobes wear earrings.

932
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:18,670
I don't think so, but he's
too, he's too complicated.
That's what I would say. Yeah.

933
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:21,500
He was in like an emo band. Yeah. Why?

934
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,770
I get a cold cold eyes
for sure, man. Well, yeah,

935
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:28,070
he's going to jail in that picture. Yeah.
It was probably like, you know what,

936
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,203
I'm fucked.

937
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:34,080
Yeah. I saw kids is definitely,
what a terrible password.

938
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,000
Thanks Josh. Can we run this real
quick? This? Yeah, we have time. Yeah.

939
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,840
Let's run this script. So what is this?
Well, this, I have here also like, uh,

940
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,880
we have talking sex tapes and
all kinds of celebrity, uh,

941
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:51,240
musicians that are into wacky, wild
stuff. This one's a little more fun.

942
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:56,200
It has nothing to do with children. It's
just a fun guy, you know, shut with Barry.

943
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,390
Barry Barry, you know my
cousin. It's your cousin Marvin.

944
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,950
Marvin Berry. Yeah. Yeah.

945
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,730
That this is a,

946
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,960
this is credited with being the pioneer
of Brock and was like the king of rock

947
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:13,350
and roll. Yeah. He's the
man. Well, he also, uh,

948
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:17,550
enjoyed filming women that he
would have sex with and uh,

949
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,180
doing a number of demeaning
things to them. And in fact,

950
01:00:21,181 --> 01:00:24,090
he has a sex tape somewhere in this world,

951
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,940
but because of the time of that,

952
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:29,720
it was in like the sixties or
seventies or whatever, you know,

953
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,350
we don't have it heavily distributed.

954
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:36,530
So what I've gone through
is the transcript of the
sex tape and I've delivered

955
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:39,780
it to you so we can reenact it today.

956
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:44,810
That's the role of Berry will be Tom
Secura and in the role of blonde,

957
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:48,050
white whore. Thank, we'll
be Christina P. Wow.

958
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:52,290
Will you read the salaried, the
stage directions? All right,

959
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:54,700
so I'll start at a table read and
the industry. Tom, this is it.

960
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:58,440
It's all you did for your soul, allegedly.
Of course. Yeah. Right? Yeah, he's Dad.

961
01:00:58,441 --> 01:01:01,230
He didn't care. Yeah. All
right, ready? Uh, okay.

962
01:01:01,231 --> 01:01:05,880
Do you have any tips for me that a ta at
a table read Europe near a white horse

963
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:11,370
with big, big tits and you're blonde
and white and whore. Okay. Alright,

964
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,310

All right. [inaudible] are you
bathing? Yes. Got To get clean.

966
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,700
Yes, I do. You like to
stay clean, don't you? Yes,

967
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,830

I'll give you something to
bathe. War. You know what?

969
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:33,730
You know that he stands up over her and
would give you something to bathe for.

970
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,110
See this here? Yeah. He's
wiggling his dick. He, yes.

971
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,520
Yeah. That's what you
bade where it is. Kiss it.

972
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:48,620
Kiss it again. Suck on it. You my girl.

973
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,720
Yes. You love me. Yes, very much.

974
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:00,980
No Bitch. You do. I do.
Well, you really love me.

975
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,190
He begins pissing on her face.

976
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:09,320
She Gaffes surprised. I
really, I love you. Yeah.

977
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,160
Put your hands down by your das.
Take it.

978
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:16,270
She continues gasping as he
continues to Piss. Take it. Take it.

979
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:21,210
Take over your mouth. Open your mouth,
the sound of Piss, gurgling in her mouth,

980
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,350
and then Barry unleashes a loud,
long parts. You could smell my farts.

981
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,570
Piss on you. That's what I'm doing.
Pissing all over you. You love me.

982
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:36,210
Tell me you love me. I love you.
All right then drink my piss.

983
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,190
Drink my piss. Chuck grabs a towel
and hands it to her. Dry myself off.

984
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:46,020
Clean yourself off. How's that piss
taste? Bitter. All right. All right.

985
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:50,430
All right. Tastes better. Doesn't
it? Salty. Yeah, I know. Yes.

986
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,060
You dragged my pis. Yes I
did. Yes. Suck. They suck it.

987
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:59,340
She is sucking and gasping and grunting
as if in pain. Can you clean yourself?

988
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,330
Clean the piss out of gas portion of it.
A little baby wasn't mad baby.

989
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,290
Did I piss in your eyes? Yes.
Without pissing your eyes. I'm sorry.

990
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,970
There's Piss all over your neck and
your head, but you love me. I love you.

991
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,180
I won't. I won't betray you. I
won't betray. You have a believer.

992
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,500
He leans in to kiss her, then stops
immediately. I can't kiss you.

993
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,940
Smells like piss. I know. I'm sorry.
Clean yourself off. Take a shower.

994
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:29,150
He walks out of the tub as she
turns on the Faucet to clean herself

995
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,780
and saying, wow, that
was really good stuff.

996
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,860
It was nice.

997
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,330
We should send that one off for
like Chuck Berry and the bio page.

998
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,890
Is that what it's like for the movies?

999
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:42,980
When you guys do your table
reads exactly like that.

1000
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,960
I kind of want to send that to a
couple of directors. Yeah, you could.

1001
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,730
I mean,
could play some

1002
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,450
abusive. Yeah. Yeah. He, oh,
abusive guy. A number one God,

1003
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,850
I would love to play something like that.
What do you mean?

1004
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:58,390
That's perfect for you? So what
I'm saying, it's an instant family.

1005
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,930
You're a jerk in that movie. Yeah. But I
mean he wasn't pissing in Fart on girls.

1006
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,110
That mean? Is that what you took into
the role in your mind? You're like, okay,

1007
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,030
I'm showing the behind
the scenes chuck berry.

1008
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,420
Um, we, uh, this was great.
Thank you. As always. Josh,

1009
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:18,460
thanks for having me. I hope I see
everyone. March 22nd Hollywood improv lab.

1010
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:22,480
10:00 PM get your tickets.
Yeah. Yeah. Your mom's house.

1011
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:25,840
We'll be right back and we are back.

1012
01:04:25,841 --> 01:04:30,640
Everyone peed and farted and eight and
we are back now with one of our all time

1013
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,790
faves. Um, a real country singer.

1014
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:39,000
It is wheeler Walker Jr. Thank you very
much. [inaudible] guys. I love dailer.

1015
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:43,660
The new place is fucking killer.
Thanks man. Steakhouse vibes studio.

1016
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:47,110
What'd you call the studio
jeans? Yes. Inside Studio G.

1017
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,680
I liked how you didn't model it after
studio g. You actually can put shit up.

1018
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,650
Yeah, that's right. It's not just an
empty conference room. That's right.

1019
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,170
That's right. You know, I didn't,

1020
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:00,130
I didn't really notice that your right
wheeler that he just doesn't even bother

1021
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,390
decorating it.
Oh,

1022
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:04,240
he didn't give a shit that he thinks
people are just going to fucking look at

1023
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:07,840
him. Yeah, he's right. Right
before he snap somebody's neck.

1024
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:13,220
And we hope one day he tells us where the
bodies are. But Garth is a really, he,

1025
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:16,050
we were talking about creeper musicians,
you know, we didn't talk about, yeah,

1026
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,130
we didn't have, um, I was
trying to think of his name

1027
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,290
and uh, Jerry Lee Lewis. Yes.

1028
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,360
He married her 13 year old 18 year olds.
Nice.

1029
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:29,710
That's like pedophilia,
an incest. And then Elvis,

1030
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:34,060
I mean she was a fucking teenager,
but the room,

1031
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:38,640
I think the story that he tried to tell
was he met her when she was 15 and then

1032
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,320
they get married at like 19 or
whatever the legal, I waited,

1033
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:47,710
I waited finally. I mean does it,
it not get what he wants, you know,

1034
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:51,610
but we were just talking about the Chuck
Berry thing. Man, I love Chuck Berry,

1035
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:53,800
but the day he died,
um,

1036
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,410
you tweeted the p video and I was kind
of bombed like fucking Chuck Berry, man.

1037
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:00,330
It was crazy.

1038
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,980
And that I was alive at the same time and
I started getting bummed out about it.

1039
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,840
And once you see him pissing on white
women and kind of, you know, just kind of,

1040
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,400
and you can bring your base like,
you know what, I'll be, I'll be fine.

1041
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,800
So it helps you. I helped you grieve
in a way. Do you have no idea?

1042
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,380
But there was no,

1043
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,730
I grieved for about half a second until
I saw him fucking pissing off women.

1044
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:21,820
I'm gonna, you know, world's
probably better off if I do
love him. His music. Yeah.

1045
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:24,480
Yeah. Well that's, we we're
talking about that weighing the,

1046
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:28,720
the fame and the talent against doing
something horrible. Yeah. I mean it's,

1047
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:31,360
it's strange too, because we were
talking about before, it's like,

1048
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,450
do I let my life, am I allowed to listen
to thriller now? Like, how's it going?

1049
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,010
You know? But you definitely are
allowed, but it's like, does it play,

1050
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,630
does it play a game in your mind?

1051
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:43,450
Having listened to us since I
watched that thing, which by the way,

1052
01:06:43,451 --> 01:06:48,070
and I don't want to start controversy,
I think he's guilty and the doc I saw,

1053
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:52,460
but I just don't want to get myself in
trouble here and start, you know? Yeah.

1054
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:57,250
You know, I'm not the judge and jury.
Right. But there was a lot of evidence,

1055
01:06:57,251 --> 01:07:00,400
you know, once I hear about the
actual blood and the anus, I'm like,

1056
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,810
I think this guy did it. Yeah. And then
I'm like, but, but thrillers such a great,

1057
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:09,310
it's not a bad note in the whole
thing. It's amazing. It's so difficult.

1058
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,040
But it does make you wonder.
I mean,

1059
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:15,580
now we're just in an era where we're
accepting that our heroes are pieces of

1060
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:16,090
shit.

1061
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:20,140
How many of our past heroes have been
pieces that we don't even know about or

1062
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,950
even know about? I don't
see nothing wrong. Well, my,

1063
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,670
my thing is just always assume they're
a piece, a piece of shit. I mean,

1064
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,750
everybody who's talented, Amy,
I mean, you guys know, I mean,

1065
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,780
you didn't get into comedy because like
you had your all your shit together and

1066
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:39,820
I didn't start playing music cause
like, man, I got it all figured out.

1067
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,350
Now I'm going to get, it was this guy was
covering up a lot of fucking shit. Yeah.

1068
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,460
But not an island stuff. Right. I
mean, um, pedophilia, no violence,

1069
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:52,690
no pedophilia. I've lived a pretty
clean life compared to, well the people,

1070
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:56,140
you mean what's your big vice
though? You have a big vice. Um,

1071
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,690
cause you don't really seem like
you're my, I guess my advice would,

1072
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,960
would say fucking, but now
that I'm married, you know,

1073
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,750
I didn't even know you were married.
Married. Yeah. I'm married with a kid.

1074
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,780
That's what ww three my new records about
w three is named after my son Wheeler

1075
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:14,980
Walker. The third. Oh my fucking
name man. Congratulations.

1076
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:19,300
When I talk to people and Catch Ketchup,
I forget some of the details. Yeah. Wow.

1077
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:22,670
So that's what the new record
is all about. Low Wheeler. Yeah.

1078
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,270
He's basically retired. The pussy
king. You want? Yeah, I mean,

1079
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:30,260
I mean he's done conquering all the walls.
Now I'm teaching him,

1080
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,730
but that's like some of the new songs,
you know,

1081
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:34,530
all the pussy you will slay telling him
about the new. Right, right. Was He,

1082
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:38,870

He's, he's Pussy King Jr and you know,

1083
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:44,000
she's, my wife has, is she
has her own Instagram. She's
the Pussy Queen, you know?

1084
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,930
Really? Yeah. God Damn. Wow.
I want to see some pics. Yeah,

1085
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:51,740
we got to look her up. No, now
I'll take a soda Pussy Queen.

1086
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,890
The pissy queen. How did, so
how'd you meet him? Shoot,

1087
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,930
I was playing a Gig in Alabama and she
came back in the days when I was meeting

1088
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:04,160
chicks after gigs and we, and I was
like, oh, I'll just banger and take off.

1089
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:07,760
But I kept talking. I was like, fuck,
I want to talk to talk to her again.

1090
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:12,170
You know what's her handle?
Is that it? No. Yeah, that's
her not as good. I that's,

1091
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:16,250
I don't know who that is yet. Her,
what's her hand? Her Instagram handle.

1092
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:21,230
It might be miss, Ms. Wheeler
Walker. I don't know. I forget.

1093
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:25,360
I got off social media to tell you that
did, why I fucking over it. You know,

1094
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:26,001
the main,

1095
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:30,140
my main thing was like when I first
started out and I took over country music.

1096
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:33,290
You guys saw it. Of course.
I was all, it was all about,

1097
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:39,140
I felt like I was, I was, the new
guy was punching up. I love it.

1098
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:43,520
And, but now that I'm bigger than these
fuckers, I just feel like it's, I'm bored.

1099
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:47,040
It's like people, I make fun of
these new country shit holes.

1100
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,890
There's all this news,
garbage pop country,

1101
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,180
but I've figured them so I can get some
kind of punching down and these people

1102
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:55,700
cry and complain to their
managers and Shit. She's like,

1103
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:58,880
it's just not worth it anymore
than like now they're coming on.

1104
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:03,200
They would go on my Instagram and try
to insult, insult back. I'm just like,

1105
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:06,590
I don't have time for this shit. The point
was to get rid of Shitty pop country,

1106
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,920
Florida, Georgia line, Florida. Georgia
line is still a lot bigger than me, but,

1107
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:12,980
but the, all these new, the
Florida Georgia line wannabes,

1108
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,840
they just don't have time to like insult
it. Cause Contra national man there,

1109
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,940
they got new shitty artists
coming out of every 10 minutes.

1110
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:25,410
It's like I can factory. Who
Do you hate right now? Um,

1111
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:29,360
well there was this guy called, he's
still around, but that was a good,

1112
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,880
the fire just, it didn't feel
right. It's like, why am I,

1113
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,760
why am I shitting on this guy
that no one's even heard of?

1114
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:38,060
The name was Mitchell 10 penny as a real
fucking name isn't really stupid named

1115
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:38,894
Bi.
And um,

1116
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:44,050
he had a song called bitches and I just
got pissed cause I had song called fuck

1117
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:48,890
you bitch. Which I felt was emotional
song and that's a huge hit, Bucky,

1118
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,910
that he just, so then he just took bit,
he's like, he's like literally just like,

1119
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:55,070
I'm sick of bitches. I'm like,
that's not what my song was in.

1120
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:59,390
And he like has a big label behind it and
was trying to pretend like it wasn't a

1121
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:00,224
fee,
was like,

1122
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,040
that's a whole nother thing saying I
hate bitches versus fuck the girl who

1123
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:08,600
dumped me, I think fuck you bitch bitches
about a particular person. Yes, exactly.

1124
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:12,280
I mean, I don't want to get
into an argument with this
dope about it, but it just,

1125
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,650
but him on,

1126
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,590
I was going down like I don't want to
wake up in the middle of the night and

1127
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:21,060
just tweet at some random read and
write. Yeah. Yeah. Understandable.

1128
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,610
And these aren't this,
I mean I've said it before.

1129
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:27,450
I do think most country artists and fans,
you know, even though you know that,

1130
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,890
do you mean football is so big in
the south and high school football?

1131
01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:35,670
I really think the majority
of country fans have CTE.

1132
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:38,640
I think that's where this shit,
you don't listen to,

1133
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,120
you don't listen to friends
in low places a hundred times.

1134
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:46,590
Cause cause you're all there, you know
something's wrong. And these people,

1135
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,190
and I think the artists have it too,
cause everyone I've talked to like yeah,

1136
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,060
I'll meet these guys on
the screen somewhere,

1137
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,630
fans and I'll talk to them like
something there. Yeah. You're like, what?

1138
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:57,030
So what did you play? College ball
or, yeah, that's it. Yeah. They all,

1139
01:11:57,031 --> 01:12:00,830
I mean nowadays like Sam Hunt, who was
one of the big guys I went after, he was,

1140
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:05,010
uh, a college QB. So I think my, my, my
theory checks out because these dudes,

1141
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:08,670
I mean to, to like this kind of music, you
got to get hit in the head a lot. Yeah.

1142
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:13,020
Yeah. I think you, I think
you solving real. Yeah, no,
I do. I swear to God. I mean,

1143
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:16,800
when, if there's a, if you can fill
up Wrigley field. Yeah. With Florida,

1144
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:21,090
Georgia line fans, that's a lot of, I
mean they all got car wrecks or something,

1145
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:21,710
I don't know.

1146
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,430
Right.

1147
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:26,750
But even going to see Garth and hearing
friends in low places for the thousandth

1148
01:12:26,751 --> 01:12:30,960
time. I mean, do we have enough of
friends and little bright places? And I,

1149
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,420
I've had off,
I've had it.

1150
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,800
Yeah. I mean that was the thing.
And we talked about a little bit,

1151
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:35,790
I think last time I was here,

1152
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:39,930
which is people don't under like right
now because country music is basically

1153
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,140
computers and bullshit and
stuff. That's crazy. That's,

1154
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,790
that's found its way into country.
Yeah.

1155
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,370
Cause I mean they're trying to do our
Kelly and there's going to be an art Kelly

1156
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:49,950
of country. I guarantee you
somebody who's coming. Yeah.

1157
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:52,410
I mean the stories I hear about
these artists, they're just,

1158
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:55,040
these guys are fucking degenerates.
Um,

1159
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,940
but like people don't understand
that when in the late eighties,

1160
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:03,660
early nineties, like it was Dwight
Yoakam, Alan Jackson, good country,

1161
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:07,260
ours and black and Clint black.
And then Garth came along.

1162
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:10,650
He was the Florida Georgia line at the
time cause he was playing that real pop

1163
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:13,380
shit. Yeah. All those guys
hated Garth and people.

1164
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:17,720
Now I get why they get pissed when I
make fun of Garth but all but you got to

1165
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:19,830
remember,
cause I'm older than these fucking dudes,

1166
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:23,170
they at the time Garth was Florida,
Georgia line. You know, he was a guy.

1167
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,080
I didn't realize that.
Yeah, because he was,

1168
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,190
you hear it not like it's the so
slick and keep me going for pop radio.

1169
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,600
Well its soul. I personally,
from what I've heard, cause
I watched part of that, um,

1170
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:38,200
Notre Dame concert. Oh God. That was
all, yeah. And I, and I was like, okay,

1171
01:13:38,201 --> 01:13:40,540
where's the soul? And I,
and I, I'm not, listen,

1172
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,700
I'm not an Aficionado of country music,

1173
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:46,150
but when somebody sinks from
their fucking heart, you know,

1174
01:13:46,151 --> 01:13:49,420
you listened to Dolly Parton
singing Jolene or whatever you like,

1175
01:13:49,421 --> 01:13:52,570
that really grabs you
emotionally. But for him, there's,

1176
01:13:52,571 --> 01:13:56,680
I don't feel that from him
with authenticity. Yeah.
You did a lot of bullshit,

1177
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,900
but would you, if you just
heard it on a blind taste test,

1178
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:04,210
would you think that was country music?
Probably not. No. It's like pop. Yeah.

1179
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,810
To me it's just like kind of almost
like just pop songs with me. Yeah.

1180
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,230
And at that time,

1181
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:14,080
him getting all that success kind of
made all the other guys try to sound like

1182
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:14,760
Garth.

1183
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,040
And I was trying to be the new Garth and
people like Alan Jackson were just I to,

1184
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:23,710
I want pedal steel. I want to play country
music, you know? But anyway, fuck him.

1185
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:25,150
He's fat,
he's fat.

1186
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:31,060
He's the worst version
of the gummies fam, man.

1187
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:35,350
Um, yeah. So speaking of, uh, old g,

1188
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:40,300
by the way, how old wheeler?
Like being married with a kid,

1189
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:44,760
I fucking love it, honestly. It's just,
it's like you don't always reminds me of,

1190
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:48,990
which is kind of my dumb movie
references. Remember enough, Forrest Gump,

1191
01:14:48,991 --> 01:14:53,170
when he like got that thing in the mail
with the, that he'd like had had um,

1192
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,050
put, he'd put a bunch of money on apple
stock before it, like got big and he just,

1193
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,500
he just like Forrest Gump, just like
dope, get some thing in the mail.

1194
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:04,530
Like he's like a billionaire. He's like,
oh, there's one less thing to worry about.

1195
01:15:04,531 --> 01:15:05,550
That's how I kind of feel

1196
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:10,660
I got married. I'm done. Like, it's just
like pussy, one less thing to worry.

1197
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:15,630
I don't have to do deal with it anymore.
The fucking texting and you know,

1198
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,410
look going out on dates. I just hated
all that shit. How she feel about you,

1199
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:24,720
you know, Torrin as this country artist
and you know, doing shows on the road

1200
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,290
knows I'm going to,
I mean it's,

1201
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:29,900
she knows what you guys know is that
I'm the most honest and cleanest guy out

1202
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:31,970
there, so there ain't gonna
nothing to worry about, you know?

1203
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,600
Yeah. So hold on one second. We've got to
stop one second. Well that was fun. Um,

1204
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,360
thank you for the Burp. Introduction
to, yeah. Well, you know,

1205
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:43,190
I just try to keep it real on the show.
Keep it true to who we are. You said it.

1206
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,730
Sorry. Let's take a break. I was talking
about my wife had to whack off, so, yeah.

1207
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:50,760
Yeah. I didn't want, he didn't want to do
it on the cameras. Oh, she's so electric.

1208
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,240
You've met her on just like one of your
regular Gig and had gig gig outside of

1209
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,420
immobile and you're like,
I'm just going to bang and leave.

1210
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,120
And then I kept thinking about her and
then what, how, here's what happened.

1211
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,370
There's a song on my new album, ww three.
I'll hold it up for the listeners. Yeah.

1212
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,200
Um,
and uh,

1213
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:11,600
this song called stilling sick of
fucking you, which is real. That's real.

1214
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,420
Cause I'm, I'm so dumb. I didn't know.
I don't know what love is. You know,

1215
01:16:14,421 --> 01:16:19,340
this is my first love album and it just,
that's how I'm, and I'm admitting it.

1216
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,050
I don't,
I just didn't know how fucking dumb,

1217
01:16:21,051 --> 01:16:24,080
I was like fucking this girl was cool
fucking her second. And it's like,

1218
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:28,290
after 50 times is this love cause I just
still want to keep fucking her and that

1219
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:32,690
is love. That's what I, I finished
and I got off the bed ago.

1220
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,410
I could do that like a bunch of more
times, like even till I die. And I go,

1221
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:40,580
that's probably what my parents were
telling me about when they met each other.

1222
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,160
That's probably exactly what they
meant, but it's just like, but you know,

1223
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:46,220
I like to say it in my own
way. So let's, I'll do a song.

1224
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:49,250
What's Mama think it was Mama
Walker? Think of, oh, she loved it.

1225
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:53,450
They all love her because she's normal.
I mean not normal to me.

1226
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:58,730
And they love having a grandkid that
they hope won't ever hear my music. But

1227
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,270
let me just now about almost
a year. He's a year old. Yeah.

1228
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,490
So exciting. Now. Um, uh,
the three of us, you know,

1229
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,130
really like to dissect g and m

1230
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,690
a lot of his antics. You actually,
we're always on the lookout for new g,

1231
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,440
uh,
footage and,

1232
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:20,160
and material and that you
actually pointed out this twice.

1233
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:22,310
You have a g alert.
What's it called?

1234
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:26,810
Google alert and the alert for the
g alerts. Yeah, he put on hang.

1235
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,840
That was so fucking ridiculous.
He did like his own trip.

1236
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:33,560
You know that Bohemian rhapsody
moving? Yeah. That was like,

1237
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,720
but can that guy be any fucking weirder?

1238
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,750
Think they always say it. It's like, man,
he was so great. He seemed just like him.

1239
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:43,970
I think it'd be just like the
dude's kind of w it's like,

1240
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,480
is that really acting and some
impersonation. That's true. But anyway,

1241
01:17:47,481 --> 01:17:52,190
so Garth did this tribute
to the movie like freelance.

1242
01:17:52,191 --> 01:17:55,310
I don't think it's part of the promotion.
Did it on his own.

1243
01:17:56,310 --> 01:18:01,040
He just loves him and shot it with like
real like you know like the g live in

1244
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,750
studio g's like fucking iPhone cameras.

1245
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,070
This is like fucking film cameras and it
looks like he's ejaculate and the whole

1246
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:09,200
fucking time he said,
you've never seen anybody,

1247
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:12,980
I haven't seen this anybody to see
anything more than he loves queen.

1248
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:17,320
And he starts kind of singing along and
moving his hands. You know, like, like he,

1249
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:20,510
he gets so into the music that I,
like I said, I think he's wet himself.

1250
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:25,340
You gotta tell me how to
set up my ga alerts. Yeah.

1251
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,670
Oh God. Yeah. No, let's,

1252
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,670
let's do the things that Freddie mercury
flamboyant entertainer from across the

1253
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:36,290
water had in common was this kid.
And I'll cost the drafter wash.

1254
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,370
Oh boy can secure as hell under the music.

1255
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:45,470
I saw the courage.
He always goes a creepy rough,

1256
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,290
still important. But wait, wait till he
plays a museum. Starts doing this thing.

1257
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:51,680
It's already more to crunch. Oh my
God, I'm going to be actual lunch man.

1258
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:55,920
The music, every time they stepped up
to the micro over time. Some parents,

1259
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,850
it's kind of weird to wear your own GE.
Ha.

1260
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:03,830
Like should I get t hats and wear them?
Would you wear a t hat?

1261
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,970
You're t hat, I'm wearing
mine. You are yours. Well,

1262
01:19:07,971 --> 01:19:11,930
I've wheeler Walker Jr hats and I put it
on once, you know, if I forget a habit,

1263
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,950
I just, I feel so stupid wearing, it's
so dumb because as you, well, it's like,

1264
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:19,060
it's kind of like, can I, can I say
it from the jump? What are ready?

1265
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:22,630
I'm annoyed with, with him
is this phony Baloney. I'm,

1266
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:26,360
I'm just a humble boy from
Oklahoma and you know, and he like,

1267
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,920
he's so accepting like,
oh,

1268
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:32,750
run the tractor from across
the water to a humble boy.

1269
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,830
Oh, you can't say Angland mode fucker.
Yeah, well that's cross the water.

1270
01:19:36,831 --> 01:19:38,370
The other thing too that I don't,

1271
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:41,840
that annoys me is like the hottest
shit right now is that movie and Queen.

1272
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:44,840
So he's like, no, it's
really about me. You know,

1273
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,540
it's like people are missing
the point of the movie,

1274
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:52,160
which the point of the movie is the Garth
loves queen. That's Louie. How he sees,

1275
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:56,770
he has to make it about his queen
resurgent is about Garth loving, ah,

1276
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,940
forgot the garlic.
Loved him before the movie.

1277
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:02,330
Just to just like make a movie with
a reminder. There's a Ge logo here.

1278
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,750
There's a Ge logo here. Yeah, there's
a Ge logo here. There's a Ge logo here.

1279
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:06,723
All right, go ahead. Go.

1280
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,890
They what was impossible and impossible
was every day thing for them.

1281
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:17,710
Yeah.
It's all done in a zillion part.

1282
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,080
Harmony.
Find me somebody

1283
01:20:22,930 --> 01:20:24,590
that tap

1284
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,790
Jesus Christ.
Man,

1285
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,720
I think he just came in his pants and
he's young and he's also just like,

1286
01:20:31,721 --> 01:20:35,200
you know, he's, he wants it to look
like he's, he's conducting queen.

1287
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:38,110
He writes do this was
recorded 30 years ago.

1288
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,220
Motherfucker like he has a part of it.
There's a check this shit out right here.

1289
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:47,440
Like that. Just like, yeah. He's like,
he's like, as if he quieted them down,

1290
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:51,050
say no dude, that song's been the
same since we've been listening to it.

1291
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:56,530
So insufferable. Got, yeah, the
ego. He's such a weird fucking guy.

1292
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,380
He should've played fraud mercury
and they'd be like, you know,

1293
01:20:59,381 --> 01:21:02,320
we had this one weird guy. I auditioned
for it. You're weird as fuck too.

1294
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:06,060
Why don't you do it? Well, he did
want it to be Chris, the Chris Gaines,

1295
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,670
his foray into that be crazy.
If he's like,

1296
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:14,000
he got his demand is people putting it
on. He's like, he thinks he looks like,

1297
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,620
I think I'll go to make it. Listen, I
don't look exactly like him, but you know,

1298
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,450
get the guys who did fucking
jar jar just make me look like

1299
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:29,800
a total where he just like, he had
aids. Man, you're like, you just,

1300
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:30,700
you're way too much.

1301
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,900
There's nobody that sounds like Wayne.

1302
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,330
And that just tells me how far
ahead of their time they find me.

1303
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:44,331
Somebody to love digging into those lyrics
that no matter how different mean you

1304
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:46,840
are,
the basis thing is

1305
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:52,240
again, with this love one another
bullshit. He invented that by the way.

1306
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:55,450
You know what we were just talking
about the darkest motherfuckers,

1307
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,440
Michael Jackson, who
else? Uh, the cause they,

1308
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,730
cause they all have these
bullshit and messages of like,

1309
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,060
he takes kind of love the world.
You get a huge world with love.

1310
01:22:05,061 --> 01:22:09,380
Meanwhile they're doing dark stuff
behind closed doors. Uh, Garth doc,

1311
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,700
40 years from now. Oh, 100%
there. And it'll be like all,

1312
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:18,150
they'll just show footage. Like this
guy, he was always like, hi y'all. Hi.

1313
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,540
Got To waving and smiling and then you
know his billboards like let's just let

1314
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,530
us love one another
and then it'll be like,

1315
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:28,640
and this is where he cut people's hands
off and it'll be like on his ranch.

1316
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:32,210
I could see him.
He looks like he like works out,

1317
01:22:32,211 --> 01:22:35,660
but it looks like there's a
little extra pounds from, well,

1318
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:38,843
yeah.

1319
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:44,000
Well I watched Tricia's baking channel
and he and Trish make a lot of bad treats.

1320
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:47,060
Like it's, you know, corn
flake, peanut butter balls.

1321
01:22:47,061 --> 01:22:49,940
Can you see on one day watching that
you see like a fingernail or something?

1322
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:55,880
She's like, what is this? He's like,
I'll tell you, I keep finding these air.

1323
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:59,450
I don't know what this is, baby.
Just some bullshit spin on it.

1324
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,083
Oh boy.

1325
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:08,300
Chen had a body and find me all
the stuff that separates us,

1326
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:11,830
that divides us, the draw
boundaries between us. He says,

1327
01:23:11,831 --> 01:23:16,780
find me somebody to love and all of that.
There's the message for me, for him,

1328
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:21,580
for him forever. God, I never
look at lyrics that way.

1329
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,080
You actually know that the lyrics were
about something besides you. Right.

1330
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,600
He thinks is funny. Some might
love was written about the garden.

1331
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,200
He thinks they took a time
machine and like it's so, yeah,

1332
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:39,550
you're absolutely right. Really
like he took away too. Yeah.

1333
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:44,350
But it ends with like, uh, like the like
the logo Bohemian rhapsody like it's a,

1334
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:48,060
it's like a Promo for the movie that
the movie didn't even want. I was like,

1335
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,900
I love that movie.
I'm going to make them a promo.

1336
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:52,300
And I think they thought they were
gonna use it at the Oscars or something.

1337
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:56,380
Every time he wants to really make
a point on any of his social media,

1338
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,280
he always always goes to,
and then I,

1339
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:04,280
he talks like that always has to
do is sexy voice and like it's,

1340
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:07,510
it's so forced and it's,
it just sends shivers.

1341
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:11,560
I really liked that.
Really like that

1342
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,670
kind of like his weight.
It's like,

1343
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:20,640
it's like you're still the same dumb
fucking yeah. Thought. It's just softer.

1344
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:26,510
It is. It is a soft or dumb thought.
I'm, I'm a step above you. I,

1345
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:29,410
you guys could use it in the morning.
He'll respect him. I don't know.

1346
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:32,460
I just think he's fucking
sucks. Wow. I think he's,

1347
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,340
he's eating the big three for me on town.
Annoying and fat.

1348
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:46,380
Where do you fit on that scale?

1349
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:48,270
Well, I think, um,

1350
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:54,990
Bert Kreischer we certainly got the
fat and he's certainly got the, um, no,

1351
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,560
I don't find them as well. I personally,
I don't hang out with them enough.

1352
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:03,460
I'll bet he could hit two of those and
you know,

1353
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,260
yeah. I haven't spent any,

1354
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,530
maybe definitely near the end
of that when I'm on the podcast.

1355
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:14,910
Like two more hours. He would, he would,
he could get into Garth's, right? Yeah.

1356
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,680
I don't think he eats people though or no,
I don't know either.

1357
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:19,001
I don't think so either.

1358
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:22,490
But it's good to know that the
Burt's on his way to be quick card.

1359
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,070
Well yet be cool if he could sell
out of Notre Dame. Fuck. Here we go.

1360
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:28,130
Here's the Weirdo.

1361
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:32,630
Everyone had Garth Brooks here
in iconic Notre Dame locker room.

1362
01:25:32,631 --> 01:25:35,570
This is where the players go out
to take the field every Saturday.

1363
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,300
This is where all our players are
getting ready to take the field for this

1364
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:42,500
concert. So tonight the fighting Irish,
they're going to become the singing Irish.

1365
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,393
This is going to be good.

1366
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:48,640
Can you just picture him on the way up?
Teams have players, bands have played on.

1367
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:52,090
Just came up with that role started from,
and do you also,

1368
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,960
you realize too that there'll be like,
there's like a CBS executive is like, Hey,

1369
01:25:55,961 --> 01:25:57,460
we were thinking for the Promo.
He was like,

1370
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,130
I got the fucking promo
and then he wrote the copy.

1371
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:04,140
You guys think hundred
percent yeah, no, I think,

1372
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,120
oh my gosh.
Jesus

1373
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,220
legendary coach had this sign put up.

1374
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,490
That's now probably one of the most
famous sides and football history.

1375
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,140
Play like a champion today.

1376
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,080
I love that.
I love that.

1377
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:27,550
But look at his face right there.
Just even see that's why that smiles,

1378
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:31,590
that skeletons exactly.
Fingers chopped off in a bowl somewhere.

1379
01:26:31,591 --> 01:26:34,230
He only smiles with his mouth,
never his eyes.

1380
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,910
That's how you can tell a smile is fake.

1381
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,480
He says there's just butts stuff going on.

1382
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:42,740
Yeah.
Do you wear wheeler on stage?

1383
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:45,620
Do you do the the Janet
Jackson headset or do you do

1384
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,000
her phone? I do them. I would
never wear that headset.

1385
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:50,940
It's the fucking corniest thing ever.
Stupid.

1386
01:26:50,941 --> 01:26:53,070
But that's the thing too is
like what does he need it for?

1387
01:26:53,071 --> 01:26:56,670
He's not going of course at dancing,
but don't forget the old early days,

1388
01:26:56,671 --> 01:26:59,280
like when he used to come into my
home town, he would, they'd pull them,

1389
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,380
they'd be hanging from that fucking wire,
you know,

1390
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:06,080
flight fly around like Bon Jovi. Now he's
too fat for that show. And the wired,

1391
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,670
you know, he's, he's worth
too much to too many people.

1392
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:13,010
The wire would fucking break and now
he's just kind of got that place.

1393
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:18,690
Yeah, that's his name. It his
biography to five for the wire.

1394
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,200
They used to fly him around there.

1395
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,960
I did not know.
Now what is it?

1396
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:26,900
I have friends in low places and
then he's up high. Is that the,

1397
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,360
they probably tried to rig it
once, you know, and they're like,

1398
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,720
this thing's not really flying

1399
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:38,820
because the a special light at Notre Dame
and keep the party going by streaming

1400
01:27:38,821 --> 01:27:42,570
all of our music exclusively
on Amazon music. Hey Alexa,

1401
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,760
do you have friends in low places?

1402
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:51,340
Sometimes, but they aren't big on
social graces. She got to love that.

1403
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,340
He's the

1404
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,410
only person who likes it. Yeah. Yeah.
You know his music, it's not on iTunes.

1405
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,330
I was going to ask you that.
Do you know what the deal is with that?

1406
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:02,060
Why is he doing that? Yeah, no, he, he um,

1407
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,290
well what happened was when
iTunes and all the other,

1408
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:10,400
like Spotify came out and he decided
to make like I'm not making this up,

1409
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:13,370
like not instead of MP,
he decided to make his own format.

1410
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:17,360
Like instead of MP three, he had like
a GP P G's. Yeah. It was like, yeah,

1411
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,550
it was like Julio g p three.
Yeah.

1412
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:22,160
It was like eight or
whatever it was like his own,

1413
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:24,600
he was like going to come up with a
better one than my own form. I said,

1414
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:29,750
put it on my fucking, you know, just,
I'm bigger than apple. I'm doing,

1415
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,640
I've got a g phone, I don't
have an iPhone. Exactly.
Exactly. Yeah. I'm sure someone,

1416
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,490
some asshole wants to write
g cross out all the eyes.

1417
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:40,730
But he tried to compete with them,
but come up with a format.

1418
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,650
So they,
and the also,

1419
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,830
he didn't want to give them the
30% cut that like everybody does.

1420
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,610
And so then he got, he,
he was like, I'll just be,

1421
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:51,500
he put out an offer to all
of them, whoever's going
to pay me the most gets it.

1422
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:55,040
Cause I ain't playing all your
fucking games, you know. So he's like,

1423
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,910
Amazon made the biggest offer and he's,
you can only get it on Amazon. Yeah.

1424
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:03,450
So if you, if you're, if you've got
an iPhone, you don't have Amazon,

1425
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:06,130
you don't hit guard,
you don't get the card.

1426
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:09,340
Oh Wow. I'm really, it's gotta
be the one of the only, I mean,

1427
01:29:09,341 --> 01:29:10,720
I know about title and all that,

1428
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:14,800
but it's like he's gotta be the only
major artists where you can't hear one

1429
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:15,820
fucking thing

1430
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,370
on iTunes. Nothing silly. Yeah. Yeah, no,

1431
01:29:18,371 --> 01:29:21,160
there was weird sometimes
on the country charts like,

1432
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:24,700
like iTunes will sell like um,
you know,

1433
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:28,810
like some no name or somebody
playing the hits of Garth.

1434
01:29:28,811 --> 01:29:32,500
That'll actually just to just to get some
Garth on there. Yeah. Or like, you know,

1435
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:36,460
like not a fake Garth, but you know,
attribute to Garth Brooks will actually,

1436
01:29:36,461 --> 01:29:38,860
people will buy that cause they're
good when they searched Garth,

1437
01:29:38,861 --> 01:29:40,760
nothing comes up except for,
you know,

1438
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:44,120
but I think it's a blessing because I
actually want to take my shit off Amazon

1439
01:29:44,121 --> 01:29:46,030
so I'm not being sold
anywhere where Garth is.

1440
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:51,400
I like that too. Hello? I like that. He
always says that at the end of everything.

1441
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:55,100
And I, and I really love that
and isn't that I like that. Oh,

1442
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,800
you can't come up with another tagline.

1443
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,130
It's called the word of life.
Student body calls a touchdown.

1444
01:30:01,131 --> 01:30:05,090
Jesus because it overlooks the north
end zone here and the house that Rockne

1445
01:30:05,091 --> 01:30:07,920
bill touchdown.
Jesus was assembled by stone,

1446
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,210
gathered from all seven continents.
This is the place,

1447
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,320
this is where everybody comes together.
All religions, all shapes and sizes.

1448
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:19,190
And they're all here to sing.
That's what I love about it

1449
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:22,360
today. I love, I would
love to see him like that.

1450
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:25,810
Like the footage after when
they're like in now, just uh,

1451
01:30:25,811 --> 01:30:27,220
we're going to take you down this way.
He's like,

1452
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,810
why the fuck am I up here right now?

1453
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:33,730
Like I would love to see him snap
and drop the wholesome thing,

1454
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:34,600
you know,

1455
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,900
and eat like a camera man saying
just take a bite. Well I told him,

1456
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:40,490
I was telling you guys
before you didn't know this.

1457
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,680
So apparently that Notre Dame concert,

1458
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:46,490
it was so big that you'll
usually for live concert movies,

1459
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,850
they'll do two shows and
pick the best of both cases.

1460
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:52,070
Miss miss a note here or there, but he's
like, I'm playing two fucking shows.

1461
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:56,240
So if you, if all those hundred thousand
people, if they fucked up a song,

1462
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,410
they had to do it again.

1463
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:01,010
You had to sit there at live at a concert
you paid money for and if he fucked up,

1464
01:31:01,011 --> 01:31:05,850
you had to start from the beginning.
Beginning again. The live TV taping. Yeah,

1465
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,720
Jesus, 700,000 and it's like
five hours long. Yeah, no,
it was, it was a little long.

1466
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:14,170
We'll just do two shows because that's
how long it'll take you five hours

1467
01:31:14,171 --> 01:31:16,020
anymore. Well, he don't got
that kind of time, you know?

1468
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:19,063
Yeah.

1469
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:27,150
France in Notre Dame stadium
didn't rhyme or it doesn't fit. No,

1470
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,223
it does.

1471
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:32,950
Since then, have you had one more hit that
people know that you can read it? Yeah,

1472
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:37,410
yeah, yeah. I got friends
in Notre Dame stadium.

1473
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,700
Legend has it that knew Rodney said this
when we're on the road where somebody

1474
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:45,960
else's gas, let's play in a way that never
lets him forget that we visited them.

1475
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,780
That's what we're doing tonight.
And new.

1476
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:52,170
You're not going to forget this concert
day. How many times? Not really bad.

1477
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:56,550
I'd forgotten like since it aired. Yeah.
Yeah. Well you think of that buckle.

1478
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,980
That's like intense buckle,
right? Well I don't,

1479
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:01,780
they'd light and the light blue denim on.

1480
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:05,150
And then is he wearing dark
denim or is it black pants? Uh,

1481
01:32:05,151 --> 01:32:07,780
I think he's wearing just Dickies.
You know,

1482
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:11,770
he's going to go keep it real
grounded. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. No,

1483
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:12,970
those are elastic pants.

1484
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:20,320
I'll bet you that, that those pants
come like with the buckle, like sewed on

1485
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,260
children's story. Everybody. Garth
Brooks here, this is going to be good.

1486
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:29,230
I love that.
I got to love that.

1487
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:34,230
Touchdown. Jesus. Touchdown.
Jesus. All shapes and sizes.

1488
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:38,040
That's what I love. Not
any times. Don't miss it.

1489
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:46,650
Shit man. I was tripping. I was
really good man. He's awesome at work.

1490
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:51,710
Um, so listen, I hate guards. You had
Garth, but we love Wheeler Walker Jr.

1491
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:54,960
So can we can we can hear
something off the new album. Yep.

1492
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:58,410
Track from the new record because,
you know, like I said, I kind of,

1493
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:02,880
I'm going to take a song
that's not exactly the most
of its love songs and songs

1494
01:33:02,881 --> 01:33:03,571
about my son,

1495
01:33:03,571 --> 01:33:07,170
but I s I haven't played this song live
yet and I want you guys to hear it. It's,

1496
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,690
yeah, it's a song about, um,

1497
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:14,480
my experiences and what it takes to be
the king of country music like I am.

1498
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,920
Okay. It's called a sucked
another dick last night.

1499
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,620
I'm gonna take my headphones off.
Sure.

1500
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:24,870
It's a good song for Potter to listen
to too. Yeah. How appropriate. Well,

1501
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:28,870
Josh Potter, you just had a
conversation about second decks. Yeah,

1502
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,530
no,
the day last night.

1503
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:01,240
No less wrong or right.

1504
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,260
First few.
And I'm blue.

1505
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:07,930
I could blame on the booze,

1506
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,040
but now it's just something I do.

1507
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,220
We didn't feel so don't get up tight.

1508
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,240
No other Dick last night.

1509
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:25,663
MMM.

1510
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:30,510
Now I'm Darlin don't get me wrong

1511
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:36,090

1512
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:42,860
Please don't tell our son cause he
won't understand about his cock.

1513
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:48,390
Goblin comes while running crazy old man.

1514
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:53,470
Please.
Except only for the gala and him.

1515
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,760
Not what I do when the,

1516
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:00,443
hey,

1517
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,530
another dick last night.

1518
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:12,060
Not saying that's wrong or right,

1519
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:17,720
first few and I blew.
I could blame on the

1520
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:22,680
booze,
but now it was just something I do.

1521
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:27,560
We didn't feel so,
don't get uptight,

1522
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:33,340
but I sucked.
No other deck last night.

1523
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,930
Darlin stabbing,
yelling down the baby's asleep.

1524
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:47,060
Didn't kiss neither.
You until I brushed my teeth.

1525
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:52,020
Now I need you to stop
all this judging of movie.

1526
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:57,580
The good Lord made all of us differently.

1527
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:00,590
He,
he

1528
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:05,280
as another day.
Last night.

1529
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,200
Not saying

1530
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:13,060
that's wrong or right.
First few.

1531
01:36:13,061 --> 01:36:16,050
And I'm blue.
I could blame on

1532
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:20,950
booze now.
I was just something I do.

1533
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,300
We didn't fuck.

1534
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:28,580
So don't get up tight
once a month that most,

1535
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,040
not all the time.

1536
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:36,210
You have to trust it. Allow me. All right.

1537
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:40,960
But I served another dick last night,

1538
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,470
but I served another dick last night.

1539
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,750
Wow.
Wow.

1540
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:56,740
You see how mature and as an artist
that was really not taking serious shit

1541
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,100
cause we're doing it without
crying. That's a beautiful
song. Thank you man. Yeah.

1542
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:07,910
And that's on the album? Yeah. It's on the
new album, ww three available on iTunes.

1543
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:12,440
It's an Amazon exclusive.
No, I didn't know. Fuck,

1544
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:14,840
I didn't know that about,
about this album.

1545
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:19,050
I feel so stupid for not like
investigating. You know what, you,

1546
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:20,420
you're busy people.

1547
01:37:20,421 --> 01:37:23,540
You got into a whole new fucking studio
filled with books or whatever it is.

1548
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,340
You got shit to do and you got
to read all these books, man.

1549
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:32,180
How far are you into these boats getting
started? I haven't started yet. Yeah,

1550
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:35,660
we gotta you gotta read them. It's
looks like good shit. Yeah, no,

1551
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,860
that's awesome man. I love it. And yeah,
it's a definitely turning a corner.

1552
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:42,470
It's a more mature wheeler for sure.
I mean, I've been hearing that a lot.

1553
01:37:42,471 --> 01:37:45,020
Just kind of like, people are like,
why'd you go so serious? I'm like,

1554
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,610
it's serious shit. Is this 2019 the
serious shit going? Yeah. I'm growing up.

1555
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:52,610
I'm married, I've got a kid, I'm,
I'm fucking mature. You know?

1556
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,700
Here's my song about sucking
dicks. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1557
01:37:59,050 --> 01:38:03,070
Wow. I'm a, I'm like affected by
that too. It is nice to see you.

1558
01:38:03,071 --> 01:38:06,800
Growing up I was, I was a little
worried about you. You only mold,

1559
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:09,150
people get worried, but you know,
I'm always going to, you know,

1560
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:11,200
I still feel like it's still me.
You know?

1561
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:15,400
It is because I remember
last time we spoke, you know,

1562
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:19,960
think your mom went to one of your shows
and she was like, God, I have, I mean,

1563
01:38:19,961 --> 01:38:22,990
you know, you sing so beautifully in
this one. She loved this one. She loves,

1564
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:26,300
she understands where I'm coming from.
It's like serious stuff, you know? Yeah.

1565
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,920
So now she gets it. Yeah, it took a while.
But this is a song like that that like,

1566
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:35,080
you know what? Our Son
has a heart. He's serious.

1567
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:38,230
He's an artist. That's what I
wanted to hear. How about your dad?

1568
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:42,360
He still thinks I'm a fucking degenerate,
but he's also fucking asshole. Yeah,

1569
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:44,860
I don't care about him. Yeah, he's a Dick.

1570
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,100
Tell us about it. I Dunno, but I
told you, I tell you that some,

1571
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:55,070
there's a guy on Twitter who claims to
be my dad wheeler walker senior anyway,

1572
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:59,140
and he yells at me every fucking day.
Really? That he's, yeah, that he's like,

1573
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:02,770
but what's weird is I haven't told him
to stop because he does sound like,

1574
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,640
I don't know how he know.

1575
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:07,450
He just like eat everyday tweets that
he's disappointed with me and he hates me

1576
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:11,050
and I wanted to say, you know, get my
manager or something to take it down.

1577
01:39:11,051 --> 01:39:14,530
But it's, it's pretty close to what my
dad's actually like. I enjoy reading it.

1578
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:19,140
Is Your Dad, is he like, you know, you
with this nonsense music? Is he like,

1579
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:21,820
is he like that? Well, he's like
that until I buy them. You know,

1580
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:26,170
a fucking fucking airpods,
you know, and then he's like,
well, you know, he's a fan.

1581
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,360
He's like, it's like headphones
or no fucking cords, you know.

1582
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:31,660
And then all of a sudden he's like,
oh this, this, these songs are dirty.

1583
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:35,240
But they're pretty cool because he can't
fucking afford airpods fucking life

1584
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:40,190
depended on it. You did. You guys have
an air pocket. Cool. I don't have him.

1585
01:39:40,191 --> 01:39:43,580
I got, but I don't want them.
No, you need fucking half too.

1586
01:39:43,581 --> 01:39:47,310
I feel like the strong army and all
this new shit. It's fucking cool.

1587
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:50,340
I was just talking about that with a
friend of mine the other day about,

1588
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:54,170
he was talking about, he has
like PC products, you know,

1589
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:59,280
for Mac or whatever it's called.
Um, but like I want stuff made by,

1590
01:39:59,281 --> 01:40:02,400
I don't like the Fuck Bill Gates, you
know, given all that money to charity.

1591
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:06,720
I want the asshole who hates who, just a
fucking Dick who's focusing on the shit.

1592
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,670
Yeah. Bill Gates, all his
shit as courts. I want that.

1593
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:14,160
The air pods with the no cords because
that dude hated everybody and wanted to

1594
01:40:14,161 --> 01:40:14,851
get back at people.

1595
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:19,740
So we figured out how to make the fucking
headphones with no court dates is just

1596
01:40:19,741 --> 01:40:24,380
spending money like saving Africa. Fuck
off. Fuck all that shit. Just focus dude.

1597
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,090
By the way, I will give you a break on
any air chartering you're looking for,

1598
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:33,670
uh, in future towards
with this plane on, right?

1599
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,230
I'm sure you're at that level.
I looked into it,

1600
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:37,850
but I don't think I'm going to get it.
Well,

1601
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:42,610
I am and I just wanted to extend
that to you. I'll give you, yeah,

1602
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:48,560
I'm, I'm I to admit I'm lost
by private jet. I'm buying,

1603
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:52,520
I'm pretty close to it as a no,
we lost a major sponsor,

1604
01:40:52,521 --> 01:40:54,010
Mcdonald's this show,

1605
01:40:54,011 --> 01:40:58,690
and we got two point $3 million and then
they saw our content and they pull the

1606
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:02,080
money. So we don't have the money
anymore. Tom. I don't know their money.

1607
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:05,740
And that's not what I'm saying is Morton,
we're the only,

1608
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:09,520
only gave us two grand over
Morton's completely. And by the way,

1609
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:11,320
I like Larson's a lot more than Morton's,

1610
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,930
just so that the Morton's people
can hear that. Well, I can,

1611
01:41:13,931 --> 01:41:17,380
I just tell you right now,
can I just say a lie to your face?

1612
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:20,770
I'm going to stop eating Mcdonald's
in protest. Thank you very much.

1613
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,940
I appreciate that.
It's not really that good or convenience.

1614
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:29,800
Right. That's a friend right
there. Thank you for if my,

1615
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:33,180
if Mcdonald's link there to buy my
friends at jet. Fuck them. No, I know.

1616
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:37,240
I'll give you six to 8% off
any, any charters you're
looking for until you cool,

1617
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:40,810

just could be Tom's planes. Oh,

1618
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:43,930
I thought you were about to do a promo.
No, no, no. I'm just letting you know.

1619
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,770
It looks like you guys are
in our fucking nail it.

1620
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:51,770
If you've got private jets sponsoring
this show, that's next. Yeah.

1621
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:55,710
If someone said, someone said there's
like an Uber for jets now. Yeah. Yeah,

1622
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:59,860
that'd be cool. Yup. Yeah.
Well it sounds like a Tom.

1623
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:04,270
I have just signed you up for it. Oh my
God. Who's more responsible with money?

1624
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:09,010
You or your wife? I mean my, I mean, not
even close. It's her. I mean, I buy stuff.

1625
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:13,670
I mean, you don't need eight pairs airpods
but you know you've eight pairs. Well,

1626
01:42:13,671 --> 01:42:16,750
I just kept, I just, I go to the
store and then I was like, I want to,

1627
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:18,700
you know that feeling you get
when you buy something cool.

1628
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:20,590
And I love them so much.
I want to go to the store.

1629
01:42:20,591 --> 01:42:22,660
I want to have the feeling
it's on buying it again.

1630
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:25,660
You keep buying them just to have that,
get the excitement. I want a new one.

1631
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:30,370
People are like those nerves or
into the open box openings. Yeah.

1632
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,150
I've opened that box and smell
nice sweet fucking airport plastic.

1633
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:35,530
When you're on the road,

1634
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:38,950
it's like when you're on the road busting
your ass and you haven't showered for

1635
01:42:38,951 --> 01:42:41,620
days, you know you're fucking
hung over. It's like, oh,

1636
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:46,510
this is what I do it for fucking two
little thing in my ears. I can roll over.

1637
01:42:46,511 --> 01:42:50,410
I can put my hands here. I don't have to,
he can roll over. You can do anything.

1638
01:42:50,411 --> 01:42:55,030
Yeah. I mean like I've, I can do, you can
do it. I've tried to lay, I shake my head.

1639
01:42:55,031 --> 01:42:58,010
Those things don't fit for you. Then
the other not good. Great for that.

1640
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:02,130
They look like they're going to fall out
of it scares me and I like that they're

1641
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:03,910
so fucking good.
Really.

1642
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:08,170
I mean to me like my favorite artist of
all time are probably Waylon Jennings,

1643
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:12,000
Willie Nelson and airpods.
Wow.

1644
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:16,390
Which I think airpods or not
as good as Willy Nelson. Right.

1645
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:18,560
This so you're a big
air pod guy. Yeah. Yeah.

1646
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:22,610
I'm hoping that they listen to this

01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:28,080
That was my first thought when
I saw that shit. I was like, oh,

1722
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:31,710
wheeler can nail this. So yeah. I mean,
how am I crazy? But did Brad Cooper,

1723
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,600
Brad Coop,

1728
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:50,580

when we had to evacuate our house for
fires, we went to a hotel at night.

First thing I did, I called, I did
Postmates and brought us groceries.

I could get a record player on a jet.

1755
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:25,890
Elvis had a record player.

1756
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:30,480
Oh see, you know Elvis had a record
player in his Cadillac. Oh, even? Yeah.

that too and he's like, fuck you put it.

1759
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:43,530
He probably hired someone that just put
that needle back like over and over,

1760
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:48,100
you know, put it back at the right place.

All right. We're back. And it is
beyond a pleasure and an honor.

1766
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:15,460
You don't know how,
how hard I'm geeking out right now.

1767
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:20,980
I can finally say short dogs in
the house. Uh, two shorts here,

1768
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:25,580
which is surreal to say Kevin [inaudible]
in the house. Yeah, you could say,

1769
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,330
yeah. Short dogs in the house.
Kevin blast in the house. Uh,

places, you're telling me, right?

1772
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:41,190
Yeah. It's very soon it's going to
be uploaded to iTunes and Spotify.

1773
01:51:41,191 --> 01:51:43,330
We had some issues with copy
written music, beef. Yeah.

1774
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:46,020
So I, for now though,
it can be where accessed

1775
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:49,710
dash radio and mixed cloud.
You could find some of our older shows,

1776
01:51:49,711 --> 01:51:53,760
but dash radio, every Tuesday night
we have a show from six to eight,

1777
01:51:53,761 --> 01:51:56,700
a mix tape and then eight
to 10 on hip hop acts.

1778
01:51:56,701 --> 01:52:01,440
So there's an encore performance of how
did you guys hook up? Man, this is wild.

1779
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:04,830
It was, I just know kb from
where we're homies, right.

1780
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:08,940
We started off doing parties together.
His uh, him and his brother promote,

1781
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:13,440
promote parties, uh,
generally around porn events.

1782
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:18,240
So from the start,
the very first party I did with them,

1783
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:23,250
it's porn influenced him. Just,
you know, it, it turned out to be,

1784
01:52:23,251 --> 01:52:24,300
you have a lot of fun,

1785
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:27,930
even make a couple of business
opportunities and stuff
and just things happening.

1786
01:52:27,931 --> 01:52:28,764
So,
you know,

1787
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:32,310
after awhile we started being friends and
if you notice just now you know Katie,

1788
01:52:32,311 --> 01:52:34,450
right? No, you don't know him. No.

1789
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:36,800
He was the one comic at the
store that I don't know. Oh, he,

1790
01:52:36,801 --> 01:52:40,950
he doesn't talk like that. No, I'm a
white guy. That's really a black guy.

1791
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:44,430
Give him a microphone. He starts going
and I used to go to broadcasting school.

1792
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,030
Automatic shitty does,
but he gets on the,

1793
01:52:50,031 --> 01:52:51,980
every time we do an intro, say, hey guys,

1794
01:52:51,981 --> 01:52:55,690
you're listening to all the west
will radio. Yeah. Shut the fuck.

1795
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,890
Turn into Mr. Broadcaster Guy. I'm a strip
club Dj. All slash gym club Dj. Okay.

1796
01:52:59,891 --> 01:53:03,890
Okay. So that's why I got that from me.
I got to say I'm, I'm s I look there,

1797
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:04,930
you know how there's a certain album

1798
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:09,600
moms are music where it's like a time
capsule where it takes you to like a

1799
01:53:09,601 --> 01:53:13,260
certain era in your life.
Yeah. So I remember I moved,

1800
01:53:13,261 --> 01:53:17,100
I was living in the suburbs of Milwaukee
and we moved freshman year of high

1801
01:53:17,101 --> 01:53:17,910
school.

1802
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:22,910
So it's like a fall of
93 I moved to Florida,

1803
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:23,963
Vero Beach,
Florida.

1804
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,630
And I remember it was like one of
the first days I met at the school,

1805
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:31,830
but the middle of school year,
Steve Renick comes up to me and he's like,

1806
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:33,600
we're playing football has just ended,

1807
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:37,800
some were in the locker room and he's
like, do you burn bro? I was like, what?

1808
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:42,240
He's like, you smoke trees and shit. And I
was like, oh yeah, I mean, you know? Yeah,

1809
01:53:42,241 --> 01:53:45,960
I get, yeah. And then he's like, what of
music you listened to? And I was like,

1810
01:53:45,961 --> 01:53:49,860
I dunno. I like hip hop. He's like, you
down with too short. I was like, what?

1811
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:52,530
I didn't know. And he was
like, check this shit out.

1812
01:53:52,531 --> 01:53:54,270
So he gave me getting where you fit in.

1813
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:57,750
That shit stayed in my CD player,

1814
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:02,130
not just through freshman year through
getting my learner's permit through

1815
01:54:02,131 --> 01:54:03,720
getting my driver's license.

1816
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,090
You're telling me that too short
helped you learn how to drive? I mean,

1817
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:09,880
I was like, I want to be a pimp. This
is what I'm going to do with my life.

1818
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:14,500
It was under the tape to the tape gets
stuck in your machine. It was man,

1819
01:54:14,501 --> 01:54:16,210
it was my,
it was that as a sign of the CD.

1820
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:21,220
So CD he waited till the skip to Oh yes,
two matches up. Got a note, a new one.

1821
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:24,640
Lean in, you know, with the hat, the
black hat to the side. And I was like,

1822
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:28,140
this is what I want to do with my life,
man. I was like, well, you know it,

1823
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:32,680
a lot of people get it,
but the majority of people don't get it.

1824
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:36,830
That part of the, the two short
legacy, the, the things that uh,

1825
01:54:36,850 --> 01:54:41,260
make certain songs timeless. Yeah. Is
that it's uh, it's very informative.

1826
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:46,120
Very Educational, very motivational.
Absolutely. It's, it's, it's almost like,

1827
01:54:46,121 --> 01:54:50,010
um, like a motivational
speaking technique thing. Sure.

1828
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:53,200
Because when I write songs,
I don't write songs and,

1829
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:57,370
and say things like everybody.
Yeah, I'm really wrap from me.

1830
01:54:57,371 --> 01:55:00,190
They're like one person.
Yeah. And many listeners,

1831
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,990
like if you were in your car by yourself,
you'd like,

1832
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:05,140
this motherfucker's talking to me. Like,
especially like songs, like getting it,

1833
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:08,590
it's just like talking to somebody
like you got to get, I write like that.

1834
01:55:08,591 --> 01:55:08,960
So I just,

1835
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,070
I make references like I'm just talking
to you and it makes everybody like act

1836
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:14,350
like they, they think they know me
when they see me and I'll kind of shit.

1837
01:55:14,351 --> 01:55:18,860
So it works but, but when you add
up, add them all together. Yeah,

1838
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:22,510
all the albums, all the songs and just
the ones that you gravitate towards.

1839
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:26,020
After awhile you look back and go to
sharp taught me some shit. Yeah, man.

1840
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:30,170
Absolutely. You did teach me some shit.
He's looking at me like I'm crazy now.

1841
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:31,170
I know.
It's funny we

1842
01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:33,930
had it, but I'm just listening
the way rappers think lake,

1843
01:55:33,931 --> 01:55:37,950
we had big daddy Kane in here and
he talked about studying the greats,

1844
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:41,490
his whole thing. He listened to Marvin
Gaye and he kind of was like, oh,

1845
01:55:41,491 --> 01:55:44,160
that's how you're, you're,
you know a, and I'm

1846
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,350
listening to you talk
and your whole thing is,

1847
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:50,190
I'm not talking to millions of people.
I'm going to talk to one person.

1848
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:55,260
So my wheels are just turning it.
How different rappers approach a persona.

1849
01:55:55,261 --> 01:55:58,650
You gotta figure out how to
maximize presenting that and stuff.

1850
01:55:58,651 --> 01:56:00,880
He knows same thing on the
stage with comedy, whatever.

1851
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:04,980
Same thing with acting methods and
stuff. But you know, big Daddy Kane,

1852
01:56:04,981 --> 01:56:09,750
he as some point,
so many ladies wanted to like fuck him.

1853
01:56:09,751 --> 01:56:12,510
I guess. He's like, he realized
he was a sex symbol and he's,

1854
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:15,260
he started his early days.
He was just like, uh,

1855
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:18,430
a tech to Mc that would just
attack you and just, yeah,

1856
01:56:18,431 --> 01:56:23,120
just murder you on the microphone. And
then he turned into a sex symbol. So,

1857
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:26,160
you know, it's interesting though,
because like what you just said,

1858
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:29,910
that sounds silly,
but Oprah Winfrey talks about that too.

1859
01:56:29,911 --> 01:56:32,880
And she talks to the audience.
She's not talking to millions of people.

1860
01:56:33,130 --> 01:56:33,391
She's like,

1861
01:56:33,391 --> 01:56:36,150
I'm talking to one woman who was
sitting in her living room right now,

1862
01:56:36,151 --> 01:56:40,480
or she probably liked me early on. Learned
that that thing works. That personally,

1863
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,510
how did you figure that out?

1864
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:45,450
Uh, doing shows, just, um,

1865
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:51,260
I perfected my technique riding on the
public transit bus with a big ass radio

1866
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,960
and wrapping at like really hardcore
ghetto house parties where two things on

1867
01:57:00,811 --> 01:57:01,644
the bus,

1868
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:07,220
if you plan some music to the public as
like loud and obnoxious and somebody is

1869
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:09,580
gonna say, turn that shit off,
you're gonna get like, like,

1870
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:14,430
like some kind of back back lash. But,
but people used to like love my shit.

1871
01:57:14,431 --> 01:57:17,160
And then at house parties
it's like, it's, you know,

1872
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:21,480
you're at a party where there's no
rules, regulations, there's no security.

1873
01:57:21,481 --> 01:57:24,960
There's, there's just
people who, uh, you know,

1874
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:28,140
have quick tempers and they
don't tolerate bullshit.

1875
01:57:28,141 --> 01:57:31,710
So I used to go to those house parties
and and rock the really rough crowds and

1876
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,980
shit and I knew I could do it
and that was the all confidence.

1877
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:37,500
So later in life she just was like,

1878
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:42,560
it was almost easy for me to like to
present the two short persona and nobody

1879
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:43,471
was doing,

1880
01:57:43,471 --> 01:57:46,770
what was that doing that back in the day
either rappers weren't really cursing

1881
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:49,710
alive, they really weren't
talking about pimp shit. They was,

1882
01:57:49,711 --> 01:57:54,600
it was a very new area and
like when he got that CD

1883
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,810
he's like pimping,

1884
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:02,140
you know,
remind me.

1885
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:06,790
It was like I used to have to go to the
basement to watch def jam or like Eddie

1886
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:09,850
Murphy.
I could not like sometimes I would put,

1887
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:13,300
I give a CD to like my parents have
put in the car and that shit would be

1888
01:58:13,301 --> 01:58:17,110
permissible. Like fat boys are
like run DMC to show. I was like,

1889
01:58:17,111 --> 01:58:21,910
give me that shit man. I know
he's got secret. Yeah. Yeah.
He was saying like dirty,

1890
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:24,240
like I still love,
I

1891
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:28,090
can't tell you how many times,

1892
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:30,500
just like endless hundreds,

1893
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:34,170
thousands of people who have come to
me and said I got caught listening

1894
01:58:34,330 --> 01:58:38,500
too short when I was little and I got
my ass whooped. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1895
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,040
Like lots of gas weapons.
Yeah. I mean you said some foul

1896
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,140
shit,
but you also had,

1897
01:58:44,141 --> 01:58:47,800
remember I told that story on our show
about how he brought it back to New York

1898
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:52,360
and the Dominicans all her too short
and then he became a hero and he stopped

1899
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:56,800
being picked on. He was the coolest
guy in New York. Yeah. But um,

1900
01:58:56,860 --> 01:59:01,250
my favorite is the one where you get
to borrow mom's car or something. Yeah.

1901
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:05,380
Accidentally. And then
she gets in. It's like

1902
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:10,100
we have to talk, but you know,
know something. I'm still alive.

1903
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:14,180
I was in high school, I started writing
really dirty rhymes in high school. Yeah.

1904
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:18,130
I learned, I learned early on the
first time I've said a curse word.

1905
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:22,240
It was like I said something like
I had 10 holes, second 10 toes,

1906
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:26,020
and this was like,
I was in 10th grade that play.

1907
01:59:26,021 --> 01:59:27,880
And people just laugh and I'm like,

1908
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:31,450
I'm about to write a song about all 10
of these hoes and tell you how I met them

1909
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:34,660
all and just tell you a story about my
10 holes. And it just, it just escalated.

1910
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:38,800
And um, I just don't know. I just,

1911
01:59:38,801 --> 01:59:41,050
I just swear I learned early on man that,
that,

1912
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:46,240
that talking shit just yeah,
but also like, you know,

1913
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:49,300
Talk Shit. Uh, but you also had like,

1914
01:59:49,470 --> 01:59:53,280
you were drawn to like funky ass base.
Well the music is the sneaky, right.

1915
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:55,730
I mean that's the, that's what
I am an old lady telling me, um,

1916
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,670
I love your music. It's like don't
really care for the words. Right.

1917
02:00:00,671 --> 02:00:04,510
But I loved the music. Yeah. Yeah. We're
still a compliment to you though, man.

1918
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:08,140
She's like, she's, she's developed a
technique where she could just ignore me.

1919
02:00:08,190 --> 02:00:11,780
Yeah. And they caught the man.

1920
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:16,180
Who Do you think it came?
Cause it sounds like the bus and all that,

1921
02:00:16,181 --> 02:00:19,570
that's it's equivalent to like what the
open mic is for the comedian. You know,

1922
02:00:19,571 --> 02:00:24,310
you're doing sometimes harsh bars and
biker bars and places where they don't

1923
02:00:24,311 --> 02:00:25,530
want to fucking hear you taught.

1924
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:29,890
So you better come in some shit that's
going to get attention and you talk about

1925
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,190
some too short stuff,
you're going to get attention.

1926
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:35,620
You're talking about
bitches fucking your stuff.

1927
02:00:35,621 --> 02:00:40,090
And I had a rat partner in high school
and our f w when we decided to try to

1928
02:00:40,091 --> 02:00:41,500
sell our music in the streets,

1929
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:46,890
our first customers were drug
dealers who were actively working.

1930
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:52,510
Really so because the logic was, well,
if you want to sell it, who's got money?

1931
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:57,670
Right? So instantly we, uh, we got,

1932
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:01,240
we got a drug dealer to
buy one tape and then, um,

1933
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:03,370
the other guys around where like,
I want one too.

1934
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:06,790
So the next day we came back and sold
him some more tapes and it was each like,

1935
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:10,120
uh, uh, tape you had to make, you know
what I mean? The set tapes. Yeah, I would.

1936
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:11,013
I would.
Um,

1937
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:15,280
we would record a tape and then we copy
it a few times and then I'm literally

1938
02:01:15,281 --> 02:01:17,800
the drug dealers who were like three,
four blocks over,

1939
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,270
they heard about it and they,

1940
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:22,810
they sent word that bring on some of
those tapes to know and then we started

1941
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:24,670
doing like a drug dealer
paper wrap kind of thing.

1942
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:27,700
Like everywhere they would
congregate to sell drugs,

1943
02:01:27,701 --> 02:01:29,410
we'd pull up and they
started to be a thing.

1944
02:01:29,411 --> 02:01:33,940
Like I never had to try to sell music
at the supermarket or at school or

1945
02:01:33,941 --> 02:01:36,040
anything owner only drug
dealers in and everybody.

1946
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,400
Did you foresee when you're selling the
drug dealers these that like this is

1947
02:01:40,401 --> 02:01:44,450
actually like, is it wild to you
that it turned into like legit? No,

1948
02:01:44,451 --> 02:01:47,420
we were in high school we were really
just trying not to work at mcdonalds and

1949
02:01:47,421 --> 02:01:50,600
shit like that. We went, we
were not trying to be stars.

1950
02:01:50,601 --> 02:01:53,960
We just wanting to get the money.
Do you ever have this? This is like,

1951
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:56,930
do you ever have where you
listen to a song, any song,

1952
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:01,580
and you realize you've been saying the
lyrics the wrong way. You ever had that?

1953
02:02:01,581 --> 02:02:05,270
Always do. Do you know that I
paid you right? You know I paid,

1954
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:07,190
you know I licensed,

1955
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:12,080
so in my last special I
licensed blowjob Betty.

1956
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:16,010
Okay, okay. I paid you so
that I could say this line.

1957
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:19,730
I fucking said it wrong. I've been
saying it wrong for 30 years or whatever.

1958
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:23,820
What would you say? Check it
out. A bustle left nup right.

1959
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:27,890
Not in a jaw. Sperm on her cheeks.
It's all dissolved. There you go.

1960
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:34,560
It's all she saw that I said it wrong for
fucking since it came out. It was cool.

1961
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:39,830
I was still made money back. It makes
sense though. I get my money back.

1962
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:43,190
It makes sense. It is right. It
does kind of make sense, but anyway,

1963
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:44,760
they're really dissolve though.
It kind of just,

1964
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:49,490
did you feel bad when you killed her
with your nut? Can we talk about that?

1965
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:54,580
That was actually like a proud moment
because if you analyze this story,

1966
02:02:56,150 --> 02:03:00,470
let's go through the store.
Let's go through the story.
The story starts off as a,

1967
02:03:00,770 --> 02:03:05,770
she was a girl who did business with
me and she was terrible at her job.

1968
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:11,290
Her job was to actually go out and date
men and get their money and bring you

1969
02:03:11,331 --> 02:03:13,310
the money.
But she was such a party girl,

1970
02:03:13,311 --> 02:03:17,150
she'd fucking forget and like partying
just right. She'd forget the part to say,

1971
02:03:17,151 --> 02:03:20,000
pay me motherfucker. Yeah. So
we call those thrills secrets.

1972
02:03:20,001 --> 02:03:22,680
She wasn't really like about
that. That get that money. Yeah.

1973
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,880
So I cut her loose and it just randomly
saw her one night doing her little party

1974
02:03:28,161 --> 02:03:29,240
girl thing and I'm like,
you know what?

1975
02:03:29,241 --> 02:03:34,070
I'm just going to step up to this
like angrily faced fucker. Yeah. Yeah.

1976
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:39,080
So I did it. Yeah. And it just, it
was so much anger in it, so much,

1977
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:44,270
you know, ah, yeah, fucking
despise you. And it just,

1978
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:48,560
just hit that wrong pipe or
something like that. I Dunno. Yeah.

1979
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,450
Then the next day you saw it on the news.
Yeah.

1980
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:53,000
And the reason why it's not manslaughter,

1981
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:58,190
it's because the shit was, um, considered
accidental. You know what I mean? Right,

1982
02:03:58,191 --> 02:04:01,020
right, right. Yeah. And it was a bunch
of guys. You couldn't say who did it.

1983
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:04,220
There was no fucking, like, there
was a DNA test or shit like that.

1984
02:04:04,221 --> 02:04:07,090
So it was clear it was an act of God.
Wow.

1985
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:12,480
That is like hearing the
story from the Bible to you,

1986
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:17,240
like in a hostel. Yeah, that was great.
That was like the blowjob Betty story.

1987
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:19,140
We just got to fucking hear
that. Yeah, and that's awesome.

1988
02:04:19,141 --> 02:04:20,910
But you're on your mom's house exclusive,
but it's a,

1989
02:04:20,911 --> 02:04:25,910
it's on the song in the song, you get to
hear you say it, to actually explain it.

1990
02:04:25,930 --> 02:04:30,470
Like I always thought about Betty,
all the music is so infectious.

1991
02:04:30,471 --> 02:04:33,230
And then in the end he goes,
I bust a nut and killed the bitch.

1992
02:04:33,231 --> 02:04:36,980
And you get a laugh and you're like, you
forget the whole how the story started.

1993
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:39,480
Right.
But she was pretty shitty at her job.

1994
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,830
Yeah,
true

1995
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:48,400
man. I didn't even think about that whole
part. You don't even think about this.

1996
02:04:48,401 --> 02:04:51,370
She's had bad, she's bad
editor, John Mann storytelling.

1997
02:04:51,371 --> 02:04:54,520
How damn putting her in a position
where she fucking up from the start.

1998
02:04:54,521 --> 02:04:57,520
So you're not supposed to sympathize
with her dad and she's supposed to earn.

1999
02:04:57,521 --> 02:04:59,680
Yeah, she deserved that
Shit. Cause you had a lot,

2000
02:04:59,681 --> 02:05:01,840
I think I heard you say in an
interview you weren't a pimp,

2001
02:05:01,841 --> 02:05:05,520
but yet a lot of pimp affiliates so
well from Oakland. Yeah. You know,

2002
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:09,780
anywhere you find a group of
pimps. One, I'm from Oakland.
I leave. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2003
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,290
But um, I, um, I've never been a pimp,

2004
02:05:14,770 --> 02:05:18,730
but I have received money from
prostitutes. Does that make sense? I mean,

2005
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:23,930
because just out of like love and
admiration, like is that why somewhat in,

2006
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:28,270
in a couple of instances it was just
like grateful, like just being grateful.

2007
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:33,130
I learned things from you. Uh, one
girl gave me a complete stranger,

2008
02:05:33,610 --> 02:05:38,530
walked up and gave me $1,800
bills and say it one line,

2009
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:42,900
she said, you're the reason why
I'm hauling. Wow. I walked away.

2010
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:47,890
I was in Las Vegas. Oh
Wow. And I looked at it,

2011
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:50,440
I counted it. I turned
to my buddy. I'm like,

2012
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:53,530
it's a chick just gave me $1,800
let's put it all in black.

2013
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:56,770
I look around and there's nobody there.
It was like a fucking ghost. I don't know.

2014
02:05:56,980 --> 02:06:00,430
Damn. So yeah, you got a
story like that, Kevin.

2015
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:07,210
I've got a lot of stories,
but none, no women have ever
given me $1,800. Yeah. Yeah.

2016
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:10,820
So do you feel like though, cause I feel
like the, I already know the answer,

2017
02:06:10,821 --> 02:06:14,750
but if you were,
let's say tomorrow you wake up,

2018
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:18,920
you got nothing to your name, you could
go out and pimp, like you know what to do.

2019
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:23,900
Right? Well you know, during the
recession did a little pampering. You did.

2020
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:29,210
And really, you know, the
economy was fucking up

2021
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:34,370
the show money slow. Now promoters
weren't doing as many shows. Oh wait,

2022
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:39,740
oh wait, oh, oh a 19 guys fucked up time.

2023
02:06:39,890 --> 02:06:44,010
So how do you find the house?
How do you find a girl who's like,

2024
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:49,060
who's a good candidate throughout my
entire career and it's not sincere.

2025
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:52,400
Like prostitutes really have
been flirting with me. Like,

2026
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:56,240
like I went on a date with a chicken one
night and we went to breakfast at like

2027
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:59,300
five in the morning and I
didn't know she was a hoe.

2028
02:06:59,330 --> 02:07:04,160
She's a very nice looking young lady
and she was questioning me a lot and I'm

2029
02:07:04,161 --> 02:07:07,660
like, why the fuck are you asking all
these questions? And she got to finish.

2030
02:07:07,661 --> 02:07:11,120
It's like, she's like, I thought you,
I thought this was like an interview.

2031
02:07:11,121 --> 02:07:13,460
I thought, you know. Oh
Wow. Really? I'm like,

2032
02:07:13,550 --> 02:07:16,160
oh you're a oh you know.

2033
02:07:16,161 --> 02:07:20,900
So things like that had
happened periodically
throughout my life. And I think,

2034
02:07:20,901 --> 02:07:25,430
um, I hang around so many
pimps. I grew up around it.

2035
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:30,650
I really felt like it was an alternative
choice as far as a career options.

2036
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:33,020
But my parents really
wanted me to go to college.

2037
02:07:33,021 --> 02:07:35,410
They weren't super happy
about the rap thing,

2038
02:07:35,411 --> 02:07:39,520
but then they would have been really upset
about the pimp thing if that. Yeah. So,

2039
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:40,753
um,

2040
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:45,190
along the way I learned
a lot cause I would,

2041
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:49,840
I would actually study different things,
literature and stuff about pimping,

2042
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:52,160
you know,
shit like a iceberg slim just let us,

2043
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,180
it's a lot of shit out there
that you can read. Yeah.

2044
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:59,230
On top of two short albums and,
and you know, too short songs,

2045
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:03,710
you can go out there and really study what
this pimp thing is and it's not, it's,

2046
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:08,410
you know, the, the ugly side
of it is the abuse and uh,

2047
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:10,750
you know,
forcing of a woman to do things.

2048
02:08:10,751 --> 02:08:14,200
She doesn't want to do the physical
abuse deaths. That's the ugly side.

2049
02:08:14,201 --> 02:08:18,880
There's a completely different side that
is the more about what I like to rap

2050
02:08:18,881 --> 02:08:21,010
about it and putting the songs
and that's just like the finesse.

2051
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:25,780
It's just finessing the situation, which
is a, you want to know who's a candidate.

2052
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:30,040
Yeah. Um, prime candidates
would be like, okay,

2053
02:08:30,230 --> 02:08:35,230
we are in Las Vegas and he
had a few holes and slowly,

2054
02:08:36,341 --> 02:08:39,220
Michelle, you lost all your hoes. You
wake up one day, you got no Ellis.

2055
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:42,400
It's known.
It's a known fact.

2056
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:47,401
You can jump on the highway like maybe
the 15 drive up to Salt Lake City and you

2057
02:08:50,201 --> 02:08:53,740
know it's got, it's just a great place
to find holes. You know what I mean?

2058
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,510
Why Salt Lake City?

2059
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:00,180
Well let, let's be, let's be specific.
Why it like a little little lady like me.

2060
02:09:00,181 --> 02:09:04,360
I know I went to old to be a Ho. Let's
say it's me only 20 years ago. Am I,

2061
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:07,300
am I somebody that could,
that you would choose as it came from?

2062
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,010
I grew up in the San Fernando
Valley here. Los Angeles, La,

2063
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:14,930
a lot of holes for late one
eight. Okay. But you know,

2064
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:19,800
I'll give you another scenario cause she's
walking a resume is just like a bunch

2065
02:09:19,801 --> 02:09:22,590
of little, you know, little naive,

2066
02:09:22,591 --> 02:09:25,390
kind of not knowing kind of what you want.
Right.

2067
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:28,170
Naive is what you need in that situation.

2068
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:31,950
You wouldn't mind getting away
from the strict parents and shit.

2069
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:36,360
They had a bad girl on the other side.
You go somewhere like Portland, Oregon.

2070
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:37,150
Okay.

2071
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:41,860
They've got like hundreds of strip clubs
and the stripper competition is like

2072
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:44,530
way up there.
So in a lot of cases,

2073
02:09:44,531 --> 02:09:47,990
strippers or like working every
night making two, $300 bullshit.

2074
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:52,120
You pull up in there and like
some fly ass car was so flyers,

2075
02:09:52,121 --> 02:09:55,810
jury asking questions like how
long have you been dancing?

2076
02:09:56,710 --> 02:10:00,550
About a year. Yeah. You know? Yeah.
Yeah. I've been about a year. It's,

2077
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:04,060
I make like a couple hundred bucks a night
and I get to ask some questions like,

2078
02:10:04,061 --> 02:10:07,180
where do you live? How do you live?
What do you drive with my boyfriend, we,

2079
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:09,370
we just ran a place around the corner,

2080
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:12,820
probably like of struggling as boyfriend
type situation. He's, he's, you know,

2081
02:10:12,821 --> 02:10:17,500
he's a musician. Hey, I was
thinking pretty good. No
you're not. He's struggling.

2082
02:10:17,501 --> 02:10:20,140
He doesn't have a deal or anything.
Stupid ass questions like, have you,

2083
02:10:20,141 --> 02:10:25,130
have you ever been to Vegas? I've
been, yeah. I Love Vegas. I mean, no,

2084
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:29,920
that's what they said. They say
so, so far, so far we're vibing,

2085
02:10:29,921 --> 02:10:34,020
right. And then you go get in the car,
bitch. So far as I should, right in

2086
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:38,390
I, yeah, go ahead. The easiest
and quickest way is just
a bigger and better deal.

2087
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:42,590
Oh Oh, so you I, yeah, so I'm like, I'm
paying up Jager. I'm painting a bigger,

2088
02:10:42,591 --> 02:10:44,750
better picture of everything
that's going on in your life.

2089
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:48,770
And then I'm also informing you how,
no, not right off the back though.

2090
02:10:48,771 --> 02:10:52,040
But the numbers are really
great. It really great. How
much can I make with you?

2091
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:53,150
Like if I go with you,

2092
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:55,670
like I make $300 a night here and
you don't tell her right away.

2093
02:10:55,671 --> 02:10:58,640
You're going to be giving me
all the money. Well what? Well,

2094
02:10:58,641 --> 02:11:01,760
how does he get me to get in the car
and go and leave my stupid boyfriend and

2095
02:11:01,761 --> 02:11:03,700
stuff.
And then do you offer it to be mine?

2096
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:10,280
I'm also establishing one thing that
you don't fucking have great money

2097
02:11:10,281 --> 02:11:13,460
management skills. You don't because
you're in a fucked up position right now.

2098
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:16,580
You really drive a fucked up car.

2099
02:11:16,930 --> 02:11:21,170
Live in a fucked up place and
I don't, stupid ass. Yeah,

2100
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:25,220
your shit together. Trust me. So in
Vegas though, literally though, um,

2101
02:11:25,810 --> 02:11:28,640
there have been times,
I don't know the economic state right now,

2102
02:11:28,641 --> 02:11:30,020
but I'm pretty sure it's pretty sure.

2103
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:33,200
It's pretty good now because it
seems like a good time in the,

2104
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:37,190
in the country as far as the economics,
people having money.

2105
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:41,390
When people have money, they like
to buy Pussy, so, oh, perfect.

2106
02:11:41,391 --> 02:11:43,160
So that you're telling me
there's a lot of opportunity.

2107
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:46,450
Now what about my boyfriend? Do I get
to bring him or do I leave him behind?

2108
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:49,430
Who gives a fuck? Fuck the boyfriend.
I mean, who? I mean, who cares?

2109
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:52,640
I don't know if you had a business
deal, you can look, I you,

2110
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:56,210
it can be like Sharon Stone and casino,
you know what I mean?

2111
02:11:56,430 --> 02:12:01,190
Truck Double Life, whatever.
Um, but you should just,

2112
02:12:01,191 --> 02:12:04,790
the math is easy. You make about
five grand a week, you know? Wow.

2113
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:08,360
That's really good. But then
when do you drink it? On average?

2114
02:12:08,361 --> 02:12:10,250
You should really do better than that.
What do you drop it on it?

2115
02:12:10,251 --> 02:12:13,430
But you're going to give that
all to me. Yeah. What's my take?

2116
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:17,750
Any everything you want. What do
you want? I'm on five grand. No,

2117
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:21,530
I'm saying what do you want? What do you
want? Oh, stuff. Yeah. What do you want?

2118
02:12:21,531 --> 02:12:26,240
I want, I want a nice house, I want a
nice car. I want like health insurance.

2119
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:30,300
You can get my teeth fixed. You've got to
hold the fuck up. The more you hold up,

2120
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:34,360
you don't get all that shit. Oh,
I'm gonna get a quick too quick.

2121
02:12:34,361 --> 02:12:37,700
And that's what I like. I like
quick handbags. Okay, so let me,

2122
02:12:37,701 --> 02:12:40,130
let me tell you another
story. Listen to a bitch. So,

2123
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:44,600
so you're like really skeptical about
this. You're like, well I don't want to,

2124
02:12:44,601 --> 02:12:49,180
I don't know about selling my pussy
dance.

2125
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:53,270
Yeah. So take your Shit a strip
club. Sure. Clubs are rough for like,

2126
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:55,460
for like rookies and he'd come back,

2127
02:12:55,461 --> 02:12:58,700
bitches of remain to you can't
get none of the special favors.

2128
02:12:58,701 --> 02:13:00,710
That fucking haters too.
They all hate me.

2129
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:02,680
They're putting you on the
stage when no money's out there,

2130
02:13:02,690 --> 02:13:05,180
like just all kinds of shit. And he's
just like, you're like, this is bullshit.

2131
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:10,450
So what I would do is I would tell you
to go out on a date with a friend of

2132
02:13:10,461 --> 02:13:13,490
mine's girlfriend. Just go, just go
hang with her and watch what she does.

2133
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:19,020
So she's going to take you to a hotel
room and a guy who's already been

2134
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:24,341
prearranged is going to come in and pay
you guys two grand just to like dance or

2135
02:13:25,221 --> 02:13:28,640
Party and hang out with him and you
might be expecting to have sex with him.

2136
02:13:28,641 --> 02:13:32,740
He's gonna be like, Oh, I just wanted
to party and it gives you two ran here.

2137
02:13:32,741 --> 02:13:35,820
You come back to me and go, I made a
fucking thousand dollars doing nothing.

2138
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:40,800
I love this shit. He's like, brilliant.
There's a thousand scenarios that,

2139
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:42,160
and then,

2140
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:46,710
and then there's the other side to where
you're coming from a really fucked up

2141
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:51,120
situation. Yeah, the fucked
up life, like piece of shit.

2142
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:53,640
People are doing bad things.
Even in the house you live in,

2143
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:58,820
you fucking hate your life and you
like just quickly go black pimp,

2144
02:13:59,371 --> 02:14:02,280
take me away.
Take me away.

2145
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:07,940
I love this dope white pimps too

2146
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:15,400
are they're really dope white pimps. Yeah.
I mean it's, it's logic bros, like logic.

2147
02:14:15,650 --> 02:14:19,590
I'm, I do the shit and musically
entertainment. I find the humor in it.

2148
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:23,470
I make it educational. But
also if it's fun, yeah.

2149
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:26,610
I'm not giving you the dark side
of this shit gift of the Gab,

2150
02:14:26,611 --> 02:14:29,190
like the spitting game of it, all.
Everything, all that. Yeah. May of you.

2151
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:34,110
If you're a really talented pimp, you, you
don't even ever have to touch her. Yeah.

2152
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:39,150
Literally I'm told it's all in here.
Okay. Let's say there's a gentlemen,

2153
02:14:39,410 --> 02:14:43,860
a lot of money. He wants to do
something like he made me, he wants to,

2154
02:14:43,861 --> 02:14:47,790
he and his friend wanted a double anal
with me. I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

2155
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:52,010
How do you talk me into
doing the double anal? Uh,

2156
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:54,820
you would have a barter
system going on there. Okay.

2157
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:59,790
And you'd call up another hole that
might not even be your pimps. Other hoe.

2158
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:01,800
You might be like, bitch,
I got a job for you.

2159
02:15:01,801 --> 02:15:06,330
And then she's going to throw you a job
trade trader out. Like I'll be like, dude,

2160
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:11,660
you take this double anal and I'll take
your pill or just throw me a favor later

2161
02:15:12,790 --> 02:15:15,210
because they should definitely going to
give her a whole bunch of money for that.

2162
02:15:15,211 --> 02:15:18,810
So there's a lot of money. He's going
to get a lot of money for a double anal.

2163
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,070
What's that worth?

2164
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:24,630
She better get about 2,500 per guy,

2165
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:28,940
whatever this whole thing, 25 that
was very humiliating. So that's very,

2166
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:31,740
that's probably a lot of,
it's not going to be good.

2167
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:34,470
It's going to hurt
black pimp take me away.

2168
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:40,350
I swear. I believe you. Wait,
so what's your percentage?

2169
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:45,100
Oh of it or all of it? 100 and then
you get, the more you work you do,

2170
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:47,340
you get spoiled. Yeah. So you just,

2171
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:51,270
so you just had you decide like how
much of that I deserve per customer.

2172
02:15:51,271 --> 02:15:55,980
Like there's no fixed rate. You
get no money. Oh stupid bitch.

2173
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:58,110
Oh you just keep me alive and like,

2174
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:06,160
Oh shit. And then the fucking fly ass car,
he pays for the hemorrhoid cream. When

2175
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:12,190
I get my nails done, my hair, it
gets done. That's all you do is work.

2176
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:15,990
And you'd call it up and you
sit around and ball out and you,

2177
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:20,910
and how much do I have to work like every
night or do I get a night off days too.

2178
02:16:20,930 --> 02:16:24,810
What's my schedule?
And that's funny too because it's,

2179
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:28,350
and then this, this, this is
just from knowing their life.

2180
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:33,310
Like literally you might have a guy
who's like, you know, go hit it like,

2181
02:16:33,311 --> 02:16:35,560
like four or five nights a week.
And the girl would be like,

2182
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:36,760
I feel like I can get more.

2183
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:40,750
And she'll be hitting that bank seven
nights a week on an on about choice.

2184
02:16:42,250 --> 02:16:43,940
And that's like there's
over overachievers,

2185
02:16:46,070 --> 02:16:49,420
they're in every walk of life.
This,

2186
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:54,720
that is the best way to become a pimp
is to actually find yourself with a real

2187
02:16:56,201 --> 02:16:59,260
hole. Like before it, before you,
even when you're a rookie pimp,

2188
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:03,900
you get a a veteran,
huh? Oh, right now. Okay,

2189
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:08,130
so she kind of teaches you, it teaches
you how to be a pimp and then, um,

2190
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:11,230
and then um,
just get your feet wet and then shit,

2191
02:17:11,231 --> 02:17:14,800
probably like bring you a couple
of a real hole can make a pimp.

2192
02:17:15,490 --> 02:17:17,650
She could like pick you.
Like you look like you could be a pimp.

2193
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:20,680
You kinda got squashed. Do this,
dress like that, drive like that.

2194
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,300
When you walk in the room,
act like that.

2195
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:25,250
Then she'd go get him to other holes and
say I've got the greatest people in the

2196
02:17:25,251 --> 02:17:25,751
world.
Be with him.

2197
02:17:25,751 --> 02:17:28,990
Next thing you know you went from nobody
to walking around with three holes and

2198
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:31,840
they bring in you how much?
20 nothing.

2199
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:35,170
15,000 a week knowing I'm
sorry, that was my take. Sorry

2200
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:41,200
I forget you get nothing. Any
spare cash. Don't know yet.

2201
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:43,930
Like some spare cash like cause
how do I get out of Hawaii?

2202
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:47,950
Like here's the deal man. Once I'm in the
hallway, okay, let's say I go with you.

2203
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:52,240
I want to eventually I'm going to age
out of that shit. I'm sneaky. Whole Zoo.

2204
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:52,660
Yeah.

2205
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:57,040
Tell me what a sneaky Hode as Nicky House
make 1500 a night and come home with a

2206
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:01,420
thousand. Oh she dare to not
give you all the cash. Yeah,

2207
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:05,840
but she's sneaky as hell is good.
Their wigs pool, dines aside,

2208
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:08,500
I wouldn't want to be dishonest.
Caught him escape plan.

2209
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:09,790
That's how you do it though.

2210
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:12,520
You Skim a little off the top
cause you look at your guy,

2211
02:18:12,521 --> 02:18:17,521
he might be like flamboyant and he's
buying you a BMW and buying him a Rolls

2212
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:19,590
Royce. You're like, my beamer
was nice but look what he did.

2213
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:24,330
And he's the Big Boston, you know
they get, they get mad a lot too.

2214
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:27,580
He was getting mad of course, cause they
figure it out eventually. Like Whoa,

2215
02:18:27,581 --> 02:18:28,414
what the fuck man?

2216
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:33,660
Like in my case I party a lot so I get
a random phone call and we were like

2217
02:18:35,351 --> 02:18:39,310
noise in the background and
then I'm like, hello. It's like,

2218
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:40,750
oh you fucking party and I'm out here.

2219
02:18:40,751 --> 02:18:45,010
I just ran from the fucking
police and you're partying right.

2220
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:48,980
So you just get like the whole blues.
That's why I'm in not that whole blood.

2221
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:50,350
That's why I'm not a pimp.

2222
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:54,070
I said that's the main reason why I'm
not a of those phone calls because of the

2223
02:18:54,071 --> 02:18:58,150
fucking psycho therapy.
The just the therapist part.

2224
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:02,680
I don't like that part. Therapizing
the house that you got, you have to be,

2225
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:05,530
you have to be all that shit.
You got to be a fucking father.

2226
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:10,460
Oh fucking boss or fucking accountant.
Her motherfucking psychiatrist.

2227
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:13,870
Oh yeah. And much bullshit. You know the,

2228
02:19:13,871 --> 02:19:18,760
just the whole venting and all this shit.
Talk Bob like talks,

2229
02:19:18,761 --> 02:19:21,730
talks. You don't want to hear that,
Kevin, you were throw that thing around.

2230
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:27,560
Hoes don't appreciate they depreciate so,
oh sure. There's really no escape plan.

2231
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:28,190
There's no four

2232
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:32,630
o one k.
What about his porn star relationships?

2233
02:19:32,631 --> 02:19:36,740
You have points or relationships? I've
had many dated porn stars. Oh yeah.

2234
02:19:36,741 --> 02:19:39,840
This is something that shortcuts on
the about all the time. He's like,

2235
02:19:39,841 --> 02:19:44,690
you're not supposed to like
wife these girls up. Wham Bam.

2236
02:19:44,691 --> 02:19:49,520
Thank you ma'am. Relationships as Sam
triply would say, shout out to Sam.

2237
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:52,660
I'm just, the guy looks
broken toys. I like the place.

2238
02:19:53,230 --> 02:19:57,650
He doesn't monetize the relationship.
He does. Yeah. Come on. Yeah,

2239
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:01,700
I'm Jewish. I mean wait, so tell me
how though it's get up and go to work.

2240
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:03,510
Go to work. You do. All
right. Well, you know,

2241
02:20:03,511 --> 02:20:05,960
you're one of these guys
who had zero though.

2242
02:20:05,961 --> 02:20:10,300
Insecurity about her doing her blow.
Bang. Never. Well, I never did blow bags,

2243
02:20:10,301 --> 02:20:13,250
so my last girl was a web cam
model. Okay. That doesn't sound,

2244
02:20:13,251 --> 02:20:16,050
they always have the web camera
and with their house. So, you know,

2245
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:19,070
people would come over my
house and there'd be girls
sitting on balloons in the

2246
02:20:19,071 --> 02:20:21,950
other room doing all kinds of niches
and kind of looks like this room. Right.

2247
02:20:21,951 --> 02:20:22,940
And everybody's like,

2248
02:20:23,270 --> 02:20:26,660
I'm trying to watch a basketball game
and literally girls are like fingering

2249
02:20:26,661 --> 02:20:29,060
each other in the other room and
sitting on balloons and pop and blue.

2250
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:30,163
They're like,
dude,

2251
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:34,010
you've got like five hot chicks and the
other room like why aren't we in here?

2252
02:20:34,011 --> 02:20:38,000
Why aren't you watching the game?
Yeah. I might because their work,

2253
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:40,140
their work and let them
work. Damn. You know,

2254
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:43,120
she needs to buy some stuff and I don't
want to, I'm on paying for her hair.

2255
02:20:43,130 --> 02:20:47,180
It's 300 bucks for the fucking hair.
Fascinated by this was this was you,

2256
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:51,740
you brokered sex tapes, right? Yes.
And some big ones. The biggest ones?

2257
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:53,570
The biggest one of all
time. Was that, wait,

2258
02:20:53,571 --> 02:20:56,720
was that before you dated
girls in this industry or,

2259
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:59,690
I was dating a bunch of girls and,
and um,

2260
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:02,030
in fact when I first met
short and like in 99,

2261
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:04,910
I was kicking it with this
porn star name Houston.

2262
02:21:05,130 --> 02:21:09,320
I remember it was a friend of mine and
she did the Houston six 20. She, yeah,

2263
02:21:09,321 --> 02:21:13,640
she fucked 20 guys on one day.
Well six 21,

2264
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:16,880
six 22 would have made her a whore.
That's the way I looked at the way before.

2265
02:21:16,881 --> 02:21:19,220
I forget it was, it,
was it a marketing ploy?

2266
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:22,370
I remember being sad when getting
it came out. And you're like,

2267
02:21:22,371 --> 02:21:25,110
this is the last APP. I was
like, he's going to retire. Yeah.

2268
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:28,400
Is that marketing cause it's brilliant.
Yeah. It was just all, it was all numbers.

2269
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:32,500
There was our marketing scheme
for that album was the, um,

2270
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:37,040
the retirement. Yeah. Uh, what was
it with all of the media and stuff,

2271
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:41,030
the announcement and then the party and
shit. And so you're like, oh, this is it.

2272
02:21:41,031 --> 02:21:43,140
And there was like, Oh shit, this
is what, at that time I had a,

2273
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:46,430
that was my 10th album I remember.
And it is unheard of in hip hop.

2274
02:21:46,431 --> 02:21:51,070
Like nobody had 10 hours. Now you have
73 albums. Not about 2020. I don't know.

2275
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,380
She's crying. He's got a new album
out right now called the pimp tape,

2276
02:21:54,410 --> 02:21:57,740
which is awesome. Awesome album.
It's also very educational.

2277
02:21:57,810 --> 02:22:00,690
It's like a reeducation. All right,
let me get that shit for sure.

2278
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:06,320
Short threatened to, to, to be
tired like four different times.

2279
02:22:06,321 --> 02:22:09,060
And then he also threatened to get
married when he did marry married.

2280
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:15,100
He didn't marry to the game album I got
married on hypothetically can look it up

2281
02:22:16,011 --> 02:22:17,290
right now. You only Internet. Yeah.

2282
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:20,030
Google married to the game and it makes
a lot of sense. Shorts, the shorts.

2283
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:23,130
A player for life too short.
Married to the game. Question.

2284
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:26,020
What's the most common thing men uh,

2285
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:30,300
buy when they buy a prostitute? What's
the, what's the thing you sell the most?

2286
02:22:31,530 --> 02:22:35,580
BJ's straight. I think you'd
have to ask her how. I never,

2287
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:38,520
I never asked a whole what did you
do to late? They don't tell you.

2288
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:42,570
I don't want to know. Yeah, that's true.

2289
02:22:43,210 --> 02:22:45,840
I really don't. Fair enough.
Wedding picture right there.

2290
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:51,570
Yep. Yep. I never seen
that one over there.

2291
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:55,110
Go Up to the right with the
two brides by themselves.

2292
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:01,880
Go there.
That was a great wedding night.

2293
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:09,030
Oh boy. What's the most women
you've had at once? Uh, four.

2294
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:12,140
Four at the same time. Yeah. Yeah.

2295
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:16,410
I never was into that thing where you
like bang a chick then like wash up and go

2296
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:19,080
bang another chair. I never was
into that shit like four at once.

2297
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:24,320
I was never into that cause I
like, I like the indulge. Yeah.

2298
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:27,310
So if I'm indulging, it must be
something I'm really into. I don't,

2299
02:23:27,311 --> 02:23:31,200
I don't want that bang, get the fuck out.
And then looking around like I'm not,

2300
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:34,230
I'm not a pervert like that.
But the night that I had the four chicks,

2301
02:23:34,231 --> 02:23:35,064
it was like,

2302
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:38,970
I think they were all like rolling super
role and they were all feeling good and

2303
02:23:38,971 --> 02:23:40,540
shit. And, and uh,

2304
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:45,590
we were in a hotel room and I was messing
with one girl and she told the other

2305
02:23:45,841 --> 02:23:48,480
girl it was good. What can
I try it? Yeah, it was good.

2306
02:23:48,490 --> 02:23:50,820
Then they like pass me around.
It pass you around.

2307
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:54,480
I thought that I was doing it to them
until I thought back on it years later.

2308
02:23:54,481 --> 02:23:58,080
And I was like fuck to me. Yeah.
They, they ran a train on me.

2309
02:23:58,230 --> 02:24:01,420
They did poor man.
But you know,

2310
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:06,700
shower with the water coming
down. Yes. Feel so used.

2311
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,510
They argued over the last kingdom too.
I remember that Shit.

2312
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:14,580
I argued over the last one. Who was
going to get that last bag? Man.

2313
02:24:14,581 --> 02:24:18,660
Do I have the same story to tell you?
So

2314
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:25,950
those looks so in some
ways [inaudible] stories.

2315
02:24:27,511 --> 02:24:32,430
We all have old whole story, right? We
all only holding the room, you know,

2316
02:24:32,431 --> 02:24:33,630
I've got some old host.

2317
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:39,490
Here's the nastiest of all them.
I was pretty nasty. Oh, stop.

2318
02:24:39,830 --> 02:24:43,400
You're married Ryan. Yeah.
Yeah. That's the best. Yeah.

2319
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:46,300
So you've got to try to gift trader
old whole stories. So we have, yeah,

2320
02:24:46,301 --> 02:24:47,460
but he's Nastier than me.

2321
02:24:47,620 --> 02:24:50,250
Should I remember you were telling
is no standard that Puerto Rican,

2322
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:54,750
I did love Puerto Rican.
Jesus cause you went like this.

2323
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:05,730
How about the, how do you get settled
nurse sex tape and then become like,

2324
02:25:05,770 --> 02:25:09,990
alright, I can handle getting this out
there. How do you get the first one?

2325
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:12,530
That's what I'm saying. Yeah,
that's a good story. So, um,

2326
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:17,600
I had some friends that weren't allowed
to really be in the Internet business or

2327
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:21,150
telecom business based upon some activity.

2328
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:24,190
Just say they were wanted by some people.
They called

2329
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,570
me up one day and said,
hey,

2330
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:29,650
we got this tape of the social
ladder name's Paris Hilton and um,

2331
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,190
we really want to put it out just like
our friend Seth did with the Pam and

2332
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:34,010
Tommy Lee tape.

2333
02:25:34,010 --> 02:25:38,800
So I knew all these guys from back in
the day and I knew what kind of a debacle

2334
02:25:38,801 --> 02:25:41,960
that became to Pam and Tommy leaving.
And that was a scandal from the start.

2335
02:25:41,961 --> 02:25:46,090
It was like a scam. It was never stolen
and lost it just, well no, it was stolen.

2336
02:25:46,091 --> 02:25:50,080
It was that 100% was stolen out of their
house. It was stolen, make money of it.

2337
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:54,700
They never made a dime. Okay. So that
was the standard of what not to do.

2338
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:56,500
That was the standard of what not to do.

2339
02:25:56,740 --> 02:26:00,340
So some friends of mine in Seattle
who had learned through that said,

2340
02:26:00,670 --> 02:26:03,750
we know what to do with this,
but we can't put our names on this and,

2341
02:26:03,751 --> 02:26:07,570
and we want you to go out there and
publicize this thing for us. And I'm like,

2342
02:26:07,571 --> 02:26:09,970
well, what's the worst thing that
could happen? I'm a PR guy in the,

2343
02:26:09,971 --> 02:26:13,540
in the porn business and a,
this tape is interesting.

2344
02:26:13,541 --> 02:26:15,370
And I met with the guy who had the tape.

2345
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:17,680
He was a roommate of this
guy in the brick Solomon,

2346
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:22,340
who's now known as Rick of the Dick.
That's Rick in the, in the Paris team,

2347
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:24,970
or as we call them,
the 50% copyright owner of the tape.

2348
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:30,090
So rare in a time Rick was banging a
bunch of Hollywood was Shannon Doherty,

2349
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,500
uh,
all sorts of like Hollywood people.

2350
02:26:32,501 --> 02:26:34,150
He was the guy who was on
the inside of all of this.

2351
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:35,370
Can I ask you before you go further?

2352
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:38,710
Did they make that with this
intent or was it made for fun?

2353
02:26:38,830 --> 02:26:41,860
Another good question.
So rigidly the lighting was pretty good.

2354
02:26:41,890 --> 02:26:46,450
It wasn't worth the original tape
was a green x ray vision tape,

2355
02:26:46,451 --> 02:26:49,000
if you remember correctly, when her
eyes are kind of glowing in the dark.

2356
02:26:49,870 --> 02:26:53,650
That was the tape that came
to us originally and was
not supposed to ever see

2357
02:26:53,651 --> 02:26:56,290
the light of day because we didn't
have the rights to put it out.

2358
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:57,820
Paris had not signed off on it.

2359
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:01,030
Rick in that signed off on it and all
we got was a bullshit story from Rick's

2360
02:27:01,031 --> 02:27:04,780
roommate who said he's got the rights,
he's going to do it for rec.

2361
02:27:04,990 --> 02:27:08,740
So we gave this guy $50,000 upfront
and Pam and the third of the back end

2362
02:27:08,741 --> 02:27:13,741
profits was our deal until I went
and sent two clips out to the media,

2363
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:17,110
one to us weekly. And when the
entertainment tonight hell broke loose,

2364
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:21,490
this is what became known as the very
first viral video because that got sent to

2365
02:27:21,491 --> 02:27:24,880
editors who sent it to their friends who
sent it to other people who made up the

2366
02:27:24,881 --> 02:27:27,130
title. That was a dump side
and one night in Paris.

2367
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:30,310
I wish I could take credit for it.
I was like,

2368
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:33,950
I wish I could take credit for it.

2369
02:27:33,951 --> 02:27:37,540
But Rick Solomon actually came
up with it with David Joseph,

2370
02:27:37,541 --> 02:27:41,740
the owner of a red light district video.
So we had the original tape.

2371
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,870
I got sued for $10 million.

2372
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:48,400
Did Paris consent to it being sold
at the time? At that time? No.

2373
02:27:49,060 --> 02:27:49,601
In fact,

2374
02:27:49,601 --> 02:27:53,620
and nobody actually knows this and I'm
going to tell you guys the story because

2375
02:27:53,650 --> 02:27:57,010
this is what we do.
Yes. Collusive. So, um,

2376
02:27:57,670 --> 02:28:00,970
everybody was suing everybody and people
were going online trying to find this

2377
02:28:00,971 --> 02:28:01,330
tape.

2378
02:28:01,330 --> 02:28:05,650
And there were literally $100 million
being made fraudulent by people saying

2379
02:28:05,651 --> 02:28:09,160
that they had the Paris Hilton sex tape
and their members area back then you

2380
02:28:09,161 --> 02:28:12,070
could join for $200 and see it and
they'd get in there and there was nothing

2381
02:28:12,071 --> 02:28:16,400
there. But everybody was using the rights
of publicity, which means that, you know,

2382
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:19,300
too short is the only person in the
entertainment business that could use the

2383
02:28:19,301 --> 02:28:22,520
name too short.
That's his right of Tom Segura.

2384
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:25,040
You're the only person who
could use the name Tom Guerra.

2385
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:29,030
So using Paris Hilton or rex almonds name,
you'd be infringing on their,

2386
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:31,460
on their mark.
And a lot of people were doing that.

2387
02:28:31,461 --> 02:28:34,370
So at one point when they were,
everybody was suing everybody,

2388
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:37,850
Rick and Paris had a conversation
and they're like, look,

2389
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:39,830
everybody's making money on this thing.

2390
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:45,050
We should go back and make our own tape
and put it out there. And if you notice,

2391
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:49,640
it's a very well lit. So they go back
and like this time we're shooting,

2392
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:52,730
they go to the four seasons
in Beverly Hills. Wow.

2393
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:55,300
And they shoot it and she gets final cut.
Cause you'll,

2394
02:28:55,301 --> 02:28:58,850
you'll notice in that movie
there's really no nasty cum shots.

2395
02:28:58,851 --> 02:29:02,150
There's no up close shots
of her vagina or her ass.

2396
02:29:02,410 --> 02:29:05,210
She did a cum shot in and the other one,
well there's a cum shot in it,

2397
02:29:05,211 --> 02:29:09,080
but it's not like there's a
full facial. Yeah, very boring.

2398
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:11,600
But she did make the Dick, I know
she did. She made, she worked.

2399
02:29:11,610 --> 02:29:14,240
I should I should I put it in work.
I'm sure the four seasons loves,

2400
02:29:14,241 --> 02:29:16,410
this is funny.

2401
02:29:16,430 --> 02:29:20,750
As I told this to Harvey 11 years ago
and Harvey Levin put it on the TMZ bus

2402
02:29:20,751 --> 02:29:25,640
tour. So originally when it was going up
and down to the tail, when they go back,

2403
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:27,850
yeah, we shoot it. She
has final cut. Right.

2404
02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:32,630
And then they give it to you and they're
like, here it is. They gave it to us, uh,

2405
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:35,470
along with my brother who had now
gotten involved with this, with a,

2406
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:38,750
with a web company up in San Francisco.
And we put up a hotel,

2407
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:42,110
arris.com which was the only
legal place to put it out online.

2408
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:45,500
And of course we, um, how
do you monetize it though?

2409
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:50,270
People would join for 29 95 a month.
Okay. And they were buying DVDs back then,

2410
02:29:50,271 --> 02:29:53,290
you know, now it's just kind of pre
Kardashians. This is pre Kardashians.

2411
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:56,960
This is pre porn hub. This is pre like
nobody paying for porn. It was a big,

2412
02:29:56,961 --> 02:29:57,860
it was a big window.

2413
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:01,630
It's sold more DVDs than any other adult
movie in the history of adult movie.

2414
02:30:01,631 --> 02:30:02,540
Wow.

2415
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:07,220
And it was a huge website for many years
and in fact it's still makes money all

2416
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:08,960
these years later still makes money.
Not a lot of money,

2417
02:30:08,961 --> 02:30:10,530
but I mean if you go to porn hub people,
you know,

2418
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:12,380
you could see the Paris
Hilton clip for free,

2419
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:16,850
but now it's monetized by the traffic and
the advertising on there. Wow. So yeah,

2420
02:30:16,851 --> 02:30:21,260
that kind of, so you can still make money
from traffic on a, like a porn site,

2421
02:30:21,261 --> 02:30:25,260
like a free tube site. Yo. Yeah. Really?
People make money because you're,

2422
02:30:25,330 --> 02:30:28,730
you're buying clicks and you're actually,
you're monetizing it like, you know,

2423
02:30:28,731 --> 02:30:33,070
years ago in a niche website and it's
being like midgets, let's say, uh,

2424
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:38,150
one in like 50 people looking for little
people online would buy and convert.

2425
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:42,860
So that was good traffic. I heterosexual
site, maybe one and 200 back in the day.

2426
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:45,500
Now because there's so many hits on porn,

2427
02:30:45,501 --> 02:30:50,480
have you got to like one in maybe
like 50,000? Well, Joel actually join.

2428
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:53,100
Okay. If they're still convergence,
it's still converted to convert.

2429
02:30:53,630 --> 02:30:57,110
And the more specific you get in,
the more niche oriented you get,

2430
02:30:57,111 --> 02:30:58,250
the better off celebrities stacks.

2431
02:30:58,251 --> 02:31:03,110
They've always been the number
one driver on search engines.

2432
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:06,740
Just the mere mention that there's
a sex tape out there of a celebrity.

2433
02:31:06,741 --> 02:31:09,830
People go and Google the gun yet with
Eco Bananas looking for that sex tape.

2434
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:13,220
So how, I've heard stories
by the way, um, that,

2435
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:18,820
that the Kardashians sex tape
was like very orchestrated.

2436
02:31:19,321 --> 02:31:20,400
Like as an idea

2437
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:22,540
from the start,
like this is what we'll get

2438
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:26,970
me to the next level. At first.
Kim Kardashians, as you know,

2439
02:31:26,971 --> 02:31:30,820
is a really good friend of Paris. And
she saw the phenomena happen, the Paris,

2440
02:31:30,821 --> 02:31:33,130
and she said,
I want to be big and famous too.

2441
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:34,750
I don't want to just be some hanger on.

2442
02:31:35,350 --> 02:31:37,720
I'm going to put out my tape and
I'm going to leak it for free.

2443
02:31:38,350 --> 02:31:41,920
And that's when ray Jay came to me and
a friend of mine and we had a meeting

2444
02:31:41,921 --> 02:31:42,850
with him and he was like,
look,

2445
02:31:42,851 --> 02:31:46,060
you know she's wants to put this thing out
there for free. I'm like, no, no, no, no,

2446
02:31:46,061 --> 02:31:49,630
no, no. You guys could make lots
of money with this. And he's like,

2447
02:31:49,631 --> 02:31:52,750
well let's do this. And I said, well, let
me take you over to a couple of places.

2448
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:54,880
So initially I wanted to
bring him over to a red light,

2449
02:31:54,881 --> 02:31:56,590
which is where we did
the one night in Paris.

2450
02:31:57,220 --> 02:32:01,340
And then I wanted to take him the vivid,
he kind of sidestep me.

2451
02:32:01,341 --> 02:32:04,240
He went to go see Joe Francis over at
girls gone wild who was best friends with

2452
02:32:04,241 --> 02:32:08,170
vivid. They kinda cut me out of the
whole thing. But again, I'm okay.

2453
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:10,330
I ain't mad at it. You know, we all,

2454
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:13,270
I'm still making money off sex tapes
all these years later cause people still

2455
02:32:13,271 --> 02:32:16,360
come to me with sex tapes. Wow.
Then you know, put them out now.

2456
02:32:16,361 --> 02:32:17,620
Now I make sure they go away.

2457
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:22,460
People if you're a decent is more
money and making them go away.

2458
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:26,930
Well it depends on the circumstance and
if you're a copyright holder, you know,

2459
02:32:26,931 --> 02:32:30,120

2460
02:32:30,121 --> 02:32:32,500
talk about,
so what do you think?

2461
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:36,430
Making one so like I'm not
talking about one of the old ones.

2462
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:43,820
I wish there was,

2463
02:32:45,270 --> 02:32:50,270
there's no Puerto Rican dare got doubled.

2464
02:32:51,550 --> 02:32:56,550
[inaudible] you guys can see
it and I'd love to see that.

2465
02:32:58,450 --> 02:33:02,070
If you guys did a double anal tape.
I'm pretty, yeah, I mean listen,

2466
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:06,170
I'm pretty gross. Do you think?
No, we're both two children.

2467
02:33:06,171 --> 02:33:09,140
I'm 42 boobs aren't where they used to be.
You know what I mean?

2468
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,570
This is exactly what
goes to swinger parties.

2469
02:33:12,470 --> 02:33:15,190
I look just like you stay
away from the boot. Cocky.

2470
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:19,790
I wouldn't dream of it. Have you
been to a hockey party? Short?

2471
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:22,700
Just found out that she was last week.
That's crazy.

2472
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:27,820
Our radio show tonight that Arizona is
the most after they described it though I

2473
02:33:27,921 --> 02:33:32,540
recognize it from Japanese porn as soon
as some jet shit. I love that stuff.

2474
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:37,190
They love it. It's a form of Japanese and
these points should be, I work criminal.

2475
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:41,300
I worked for the comic one time
from Oakland who uh, you know,

2476
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:44,060
I brought you up just like, you know,
we talked about music and he was like,

2477
02:33:44,061 --> 02:33:46,430
Oh yeah, I hang out with short
doc sometimes. I was like, really?

2478
02:33:46,730 --> 02:33:49,670
And then I asked him like, what's
that leg? He's like, I mean,

2479
02:33:49,671 --> 02:33:51,590
if you'd hang around with them long
enough, you'll get your dick sucked.

2480
02:33:52,170 --> 02:33:55,150
That sounds cool.
That's a true story that I can vouch for

2481
02:33:59,510 --> 02:34:03,050
more shorthand. Hung out with us more.
He got his dick sucked. Oh, that's great.

2482
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:05,750
Yeah, I met short. We booked
him for a player's ball.

2483
02:34:05,751 --> 02:34:07,930
That was the name of our porn party
was telling you about it. Yeah.

2484
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:09,111
And we had done it.

2485
02:34:09,111 --> 02:34:12,350
There's a place called the state palace
theater in New Orleans and we have told

2486
02:34:12,351 --> 02:34:15,560
the story a million times on our show,
but it was the weekend, the Bayou classic,

2487
02:34:15,561 --> 02:34:18,830
which is basically to black
colleges playing each other. Uh,

2488
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:23,830
southern Mississippi and I
was at Grambling. Yeah. So,

2489
02:34:23,831 --> 02:34:28,790
um, needless to say, New
Orleans [inaudible] oh,
that's a high school, right?

2490
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:31,750
Yeah, I think so. All
right. But needless to say,

2491
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:33,670
New Orleans was very dark that weekend.

2492
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:38,260
He was sent out to go play a party for
two black black brothers is what he

2493
02:34:38,261 --> 02:34:41,680
thought. My brother and I are
the black brothers. B, l a t, t,

2494
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:46,660
O kb and d money k Bezel and d money.
That was our nom de guerre. Anyway,

2495
02:34:46,661 --> 02:34:50,680
he shows up at the state palace theater
and people are having sex on the dance

2496
02:34:50,681 --> 02:34:53,110
floor and there's a VIP rooms.
It was blow jobs going on.

2497
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:58,120
He comes back and he looks at two white
boys dressed as pimps and I'm suited and

2498
02:34:58,121 --> 02:35:01,530
booted with like a biggie smalls hat.

so happy to have you here tonight. You,

2500
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:07,450
I'm such a big fan of
yours cause just like you,

2501
02:35:07,451 --> 02:35:11,320
I grew up listening to two short course
and Cleveland I was bumping too short

2502
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:16,570
from 1984 on. Yeah. So
um, yeah, he's like a,

2503
02:35:16,620 --> 02:35:19,690
all I know is I'm supposed to be planned
for two black brothers like no with a

2504
02:35:19,691 --> 02:35:23,980
black brothers, you know the
black brothers and he's like,

2505
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:25,630
I thought you guys were black.

2506
02:35:26,410 --> 02:35:29,920
And I'm like why don't we kind
of are us us along with Lego.

2507
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:31,510
And he looked at me cause
like I don't care man.

2508
02:35:31,511 --> 02:35:34,240
I don't care what you guys do and
what's going on, how can I be down?

2509
02:35:34,270 --> 02:35:38,350
Because there is people butt ass
naked out there. Penn House, pets,

2510
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:42,450
porn stars. Yeah. So that
was my initial kickoff.

2511
02:35:42,730 --> 02:35:46,210
It was a great kickoff because we got to
what got him to play with kid Capri and

2512
02:35:46,211 --> 02:35:49,600
a slick Rick that night and
it was all my hip hop idle.

2513
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:50,573
That's awesome man.

2514
02:35:51,050 --> 02:35:54,900
Back then I wasn't really
like participating in any
like AVN awards and none of

2515
02:35:54,901 --> 02:35:55,711
that shit.

2516
02:35:55,711 --> 02:35:59,910
And then you hear these guys come along
and they're like at the backstage passes

2517
02:35:59,911 --> 02:36:02,100
to the AVN awards.
Yeah.

2518
02:36:02,430 --> 02:36:05,010
We're like, sure, we want to book you
at the Playboy Mansion for a party.

2519
02:36:05,011 --> 02:36:07,790
He's like, I'm down. You know,

2520
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:11,460
we had some good times,
so that's how we became friends.

2521
02:36:11,890 --> 02:36:15,650
I'm happy to say 20 years later and
I host a show with, with two shorts.

2522
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:20,200
It's crazy. All the kb one nine these
chicks are like porn chicks. I like,

2523
02:36:21,460 --> 02:36:25,480
I wish I could just fuck a regular
guy right now. I'm like, man,

2524
02:36:25,481 --> 02:36:28,810
let me out the car. I
think you went in, right?

2525
02:36:28,930 --> 02:36:32,980
I maybe a little,
we had male challenge.

2526
02:36:32,981 --> 02:36:35,740
It didn't show up that night
and I'm cheap, so I'm like,
oh, hey, you know what?

2527
02:36:36,220 --> 02:36:39,910
Your wish is my command. Are
you in porns? No, no. Well,

2528
02:36:40,530 --> 02:36:42,510
not as far as you guys would.

2529
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:43,763
Okay.

2530
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:49,620
That means his dingalings been thrown
around and there's a thing called Pov.

2531
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:53,010
Yeah, there's no pressure.
You don't feel the pressure.

2532
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,730
Maybe now more because I'm 50.
I don't know if I would do it now,

2533
02:36:56,731 --> 02:37:01,180
but back then I was kind of out of my
mind. I had a good time back then. Short.

2534
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:04,230
I want to ask you a question. So I
realized this like when we, when they,

2535
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:06,690
when you said you're coming on,
I was so excited. And then I had,

2536
02:37:06,780 --> 02:37:08,910
I remembered that a while ago,

2537
02:37:08,940 --> 02:37:13,410
like maybe over a year ago I was on my
boy Hannibal Burress as podcasts handles

2538
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:15,680
great comic Dj Tony Trimm.

2539
02:37:16,380 --> 02:37:20,390
Yeah. Randomly, I forget how we
got into it, but we brought up,

2540
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:22,700
um,
blow the whistle,

2541
02:37:22,701 --> 02:37:26,780
the song and I realized that
in my memory I was like, oh,

2542
02:37:26,930 --> 02:37:30,410
I broke down.
What that song's about.

2543
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:35,330
Like I was a professor teaching them and
then I realized that you were about to

2544
02:37:35,331 --> 02:37:38,120
come here. I was like, I don't really,
I don't know if I got it right.

2545
02:37:38,121 --> 02:37:40,430
I just decided that so can,

2546
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:43,250
can we show it to you and you tell me
if I was accurate or not. That's go.

2547
02:37:43,890 --> 02:37:44,671
I liked,
by the way,

2548
02:37:44,671 --> 02:37:47,820
did you ever like really explore and at
the time I did and I'll just be honest,

2549
02:37:47,821 --> 02:37:49,530
the concept of blow the whistle,

2550
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,390
it's actually pretty deep concept in and
of itself that he's a referee calling a

2551
02:37:54,391 --> 02:37:58,590
personal foul on you taking his
expression of that word. Right.

2552
02:37:58,620 --> 02:38:01,340
Like that's pretty, I didn't even catch
it. That's what, what the song was about.

2553
02:38:01,890 --> 02:38:03,030
So the song,
yeah,

2554
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:06,360
blow the whistle is that he's a
ref basically blowing the whistle.

2555
02:38:07,350 --> 02:38:10,200
You're saying biatch the way he said
it, you're stealing from him, man.

2556
02:38:10,350 --> 02:38:12,420
He's coming from the
perspective of the referee.

2557
02:38:12,450 --> 02:38:15,420
He is playing a character whistle.
So he like,

2558
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:17,970
he married is like that Dave Chappelle.
I'm proud of you man.

2559
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:21,960
But like you're saying bitch, like I say
it and so are all these other bloating.

2560
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:26,940
Yeah. That's a good way to
call somebody out. It is, man.

2561
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:31,770
I got to fuck fucking up blow
whistle. That's pretty cool. Actually.

2562
02:38:32,310 --> 02:38:34,530
He doesn't get credit for that because
it's always getting his dick sucked.

2563
02:38:37,410 --> 02:38:41,580
How'd I do? Uh, you were on it Kinda. Huh?

2564
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:46,980
But, um, it goes a little bit further
than that. Okay. Because I'm, once again,

2565
02:38:47,010 --> 02:38:48,420
if you just listen to the words,

2566
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:53,900
it's actually I'm the ref and I'm blowing
the whistle on people who are doing

2567
02:38:54,991 --> 02:38:58,890
things they shouldn't be doing that. It's
not really the word bitch in the song.

2568
02:38:58,891 --> 02:39:03,210
It talks about doing too much drugs,
partying too much, staying up for days,

2569
02:39:03,211 --> 02:39:07,080
just doing shit that you shouldn't
be doing. And it's like, you know,

2570
02:39:07,081 --> 02:39:09,810
it talks about falling down hill and just,
you know,

2571
02:39:09,811 --> 02:39:12,900
just if you can't hang with the big dogs,
stay on the point.

2572
02:39:12,990 --> 02:39:16,530
You can't do this shit.
So cause you keep fucking up.

2573
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:20,060
So it kind of goes in life in general.
If you see somebody fucking,

2574
02:39:20,061 --> 02:39:23,410
I've just blown, you know those west, so
hey man, oh the flag on them, you know,

2575
02:39:23,430 --> 02:39:26,230
and whatever the fuck I was almost
there you were, you were going up there.

2576
02:39:26,260 --> 02:39:30,540
I was like, is he gonna get it? Some
little kids told me it means suck my Dick.

2577
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:36,260
Really? I didn't, that wasn't
my meaning, but it was like,

2578
02:39:36,261 --> 02:39:38,310
yeah,
I'm like suck my Dick.

2579
02:39:41,550 --> 02:39:44,040
I'm just saying, all right.
All right. Well cool man.

2580
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:48,310
I'm glad to know that I almost got
it right. I had no idea. I just was,

2581
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:52,230
I was owning the word bitch.
It was started,

2582
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:57,510
it was starting to be an argument
out there of where it came from.

2583
02:39:57,511 --> 02:40:00,630
And Ryan overheard that argument
one day and somebody was saying,

2584
02:40:00,631 --> 02:40:03,420
not too sure I made this shit. Get
the fuck out of here. That shit go.

2585
02:40:03,570 --> 02:40:07,620
And they were logically
putting it all over the world
and shit. And I'm like, Nah,

2586
02:40:08,070 --> 02:40:11,310
I gotta I gotta own this. Yeah.
Cause you definitely, so it's,

2587
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:13,250
it's cemented now.

2588
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:18,540
There's no debuke no dispute,
no debate. It is solid,

2589
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:22,830
too short said made it.
That's it. And I um,

2590
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:25,530
you got to give a little
credit to Rudy ray Moore. Yup.

2591
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:29,150
Cause I can take the old light to some
of his songs when he's in Dulla my

2592
02:40:29,151 --> 02:40:29,984
character.
Yeah.

2593
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:35,120
And he's talking in the movies and on
some of his records and he goes bit.

2594
02:40:35,270 --> 02:40:39,300
Yeah. And he doesn't, I'm like me
and my wrap part in, back in the day,

2595
02:40:39,301 --> 02:40:43,690
we didn't get it from him per se. Yeah.
But he was one of our influences, so sure.

2596
02:40:43,810 --> 02:40:47,070
You know, indirectly that's
the, that's where it ended up.

2597
02:40:47,071 --> 02:40:49,970
So He's getting a little
credit too. Okay, thank you.

2598
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:54,900
You're the one that's really, yeah,
that's, yeah, and then you know snoop dog,

2599
02:40:54,901 --> 02:40:59,310
when he got with death row, he does
demand, they adopted it and they kind of,

2600
02:40:59,430 --> 02:41:03,090
I give snoop the credit
for making it go so pop,

2601
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:07,530
but I gave it to so many millions of
people and then he was one of the ones who

2602
02:41:07,531 --> 02:41:10,800
got it ingrained in him and he
passed it on to so many more million.

2603
02:41:11,010 --> 02:41:12,720
And then everybody,

2604
02:41:13,310 --> 02:41:16,260
I've seen comedians Duff's in old TV show.

2605
02:41:16,580 --> 02:41:20,410
It is embedded in pop culture.
I'm counting people go, you
should copy writing. Oh.

2617
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:00,740

jewelry for different kinds
of reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

And the bling bling is, you've got
to have a purpose for you now. Yeah.

2620
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:12,630
If you don't really have a purpose, it was
just like a waste of money. Like silly.

2621
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:17,040
Yeah. Flashing and videos

02:44:59,670 --> 02:45:01,890
But I mean,

2672
02:45:07,041 --> 02:45:12,041
women in my life understand what
I do for a living and you know,

2673
02:45:13,460 --> 02:45:17,920
it's the, don't let the music
persona distort the reality. Okay.

2674
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,060
It was a hard on there. All right. I know.

2675
02:45:20,450 --> 02:45:23,390
I want to see him when they got
to do on Christmas. I don't know.

2676
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:27,500
Just fuck all a Santa has
reindeer isn't shit. No,

2677
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:31,640
he stopped being a player right
around them. Right when it gets cold.

2678
02:45:32,130 --> 02:45:36,570
Yeah. And then you start back
up like right around now.

2679
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:39,840
Right, right. Yeah, that's true.
I think my dad did the same shit.

2680
02:45:40,940 --> 02:45:43,740
That's when he would bring some girl
around and like here's your new mom.

2681
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:45,360
And I'm like, yeah, I know.

2682
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:49,290
Oh he would have been a good pimp and
then come spring no more mom. Yeah, yeah,

2683
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:53,580
yeah. No. Yeah, totally. Dude.
He could teach a seminar numbers.

2684
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:57,780
He's got numbers cause he gets a bitches
used to clean his house forum and do

2685
02:45:57,930 --> 02:46:00,750
all kinds of stuff.
Pretty solid. Yeah. Yeah.

2686
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:04,480
Really knew how to mute. There's a lot
of ways to go wrong with the shit too.

2687
02:46:04,481 --> 02:46:05,760
Like I know a guy who I am,

2688
02:46:06,910 --> 02:46:11,240
I know a guy who was fascinated by the
look of it and just the idea of it.

2689
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:16,660
So he went to an older pimp
and he said teach me the game.

2690
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:20,090
And the outer pimp was like flattered.
He was like,

2691
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:22,150
cause he know the guy had
to look, you know he, yeah,

2692
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:24,800
he was playing the part but he
wasn't, it wasn't really any, yeah.

2693
02:46:24,890 --> 02:46:26,600
So the Oda [inaudible],
he's like,

2694
02:46:26,601 --> 02:46:30,320
well this is what you gotta do any like
really schooled him for like a long time,

2695
02:46:30,321 --> 02:46:34,880
like two fucking years or some shit.
And this guy figured it out,

2696
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:36,800
but he did one thing wrong.

2697
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:42,170
The first how he ever
had was his girlfriend.

2698
02:46:42,470 --> 02:46:46,890
Oh. And they had been together
and they were like taking in,

2699
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:51,200
absorbing all these pimp talking shit.
And they're like, yeah, we got to do this.

2700
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:56,210
So what happens is
she started working,

2701
02:46:57,980 --> 02:47:02,300
she liked it.
She liked how he as some point was like,

2702
02:47:03,270 --> 02:47:04,103
you know,

2703
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:09,130
realizing the dark side and and realizing
really inside him that he wasn't about

2704
02:47:09,711 --> 02:47:13,880
that. Now he loves his woman. He
loved her before they started this.

2705
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:15,133
And he's like,

2706
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:19,580
in his mind trying to get her
to take a turn with him, like,

2707
02:47:19,581 --> 02:47:23,300
let's do something different. She's like,
fuck, noticed the money. It's that shit.

2708
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:25,820
So she literally got to the
point where she was like,

2709
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:30,440
will you go if the crushing it
crushing, yeah, he went from,

2710
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:35,440
from good kid to pimp to like church boy.
Wow.

2711
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:38,270
He went straight to the church. I
get there. It does it t you could,

2712
02:47:38,300 --> 02:47:42,220
you could and you could get ended up
in situations where you saw called

2713
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:46,010
controlling these women and things
happen to them and that, that guilt,

2714
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:49,250
you can never get over that shit. No.
That's when you go straight to the church.

2715
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:51,680
Hey, you go out there and say, I got
away. I get that money and that baby,

2716
02:47:51,681 --> 02:47:54,700
she never comes back everyone life
ever again. Like whoops. Yeah.

2717
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:59,090
And his father is that,
but luckily white pimp

2718
02:48:02,430 --> 02:48:04,630
hoes out there. So I be
like, she's dead anyway.

2719
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:12,890
Now let me ask you this because you are
of too short too is you can sing two

2720
02:48:12,891 --> 02:48:17,120
shirts. I don't see a woman. Yeah. And
then kind of it, but kind of know. Yeah.

2721
02:48:18,820 --> 02:48:22,610
Maybe I'll singing this
song. Suck my fucking, yeah.

2722
02:48:22,611 --> 02:48:26,960
You think I haven't heard some of

to know this to myself.

2726
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:43,820
Yeah. Um, I think, um,

2727
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:49,080
I had a one time, the first time
I ever negotiated for a big check,

2728
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:54,470
I remember, uh, the check
arriving and it was a,

2729
02:48:54,471 --> 02:48:56,150
it was going to come in increments,

2730
02:48:56,270 --> 02:49:00,080
like four checks to a total of
about like 2 million. All right.

2731
02:49:00,081 --> 02:49:03,470
So I figured they were going to
come quick to, cause it was like,

2732
02:49:03,471 --> 02:49:04,670
we don't want to give you
all this money in one day.

2733
02:49:04,671 --> 02:49:07,740
We'll give it to you over like 90
days or some shit like that. So

2734
02:49:09,930 --> 02:49:13,950
the first one came and logically knowing
that there are more coming, I'm like,

2735
02:49:14,220 --> 02:49:18,430
I'm fucking this one up. Yeah. So
literally I just, it's just dumb.

2736
02:49:18,470 --> 02:49:23,250
Should I could ever think of
it started,

2737
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:29,100
it was probably like 97 and it started,
um,

2738
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:31,410
like in one week,

2739
02:49:31,440 --> 02:49:35,190
I think I bought like 150,000 on a car,

2740
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:38,220
about a fucking hundred
thousand dollar boat.

2741
02:49:38,890 --> 02:49:43,540
Went by two fucking jet skis
with a truck to pull him whoa.

2742
02:49:43,860 --> 02:49:47,910
And a truck for the boat. Yeah.
And fucking I'm, it was just like,

2743
02:49:47,911 --> 02:49:52,410
it was a spending spree of, of,
you know what? This was the logic.

2744
02:49:52,470 --> 02:49:55,830
You know what? I've been making
this money and living his life,

2745
02:49:55,831 --> 02:49:59,550
doing all this good shit. This one
time I'm just going to fuck it all off.

2746
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:02,580
I didn't do it a lot in life,
but that one time I fucked it off.

2747
02:50:02,910 --> 02:50:06,480
And about two years later I went on
a good roll too cause I was like,

2748
02:50:06,900 --> 02:50:10,570
oh that new beamers out. Oh I don't know
shit. They made the special edition. Oh,

2749
02:50:11,250 --> 02:50:12,690
so about two years.
I was like,

2750
02:50:12,691 --> 02:50:16,020
I thought I was like this baller dude who
knee and hip hop was kind of preaching

2751
02:50:16,021 --> 02:50:16,920
that shit at the time.

2752
02:50:16,921 --> 02:50:20,610
That was just the bad boy videos and the
bling bling air and everybody was like

2753
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:23,070
platinum jury and diamonds
and all this shit.

2754
02:50:23,070 --> 02:50:26,300
And people were spending $1 million
on videos and shit. It was, yeah,

2755
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:30,600
it was just out of hand and out of
control and hip hop. So I woke up, um,

2756
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:36,460
it was 1999 and all the talk was y two k
y two k the possibly shit could happen.

2757
02:50:38,311 --> 02:50:39,580
The computers aren't going to reset.

2758
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:43,210
They're gonna reset when they're not
supposed to lie. The stupid y two k right,

2759
02:50:43,220 --> 02:50:45,090
right. Yeah. Well it's
going to end that night.

2760
02:50:45,330 --> 02:50:49,190
1999 in 2000 comes in like
half a bottle of water,

2761
02:50:49,220 --> 02:50:50,430
have everything ready to go.

2762
02:50:50,790 --> 02:50:55,790
So it was 1999 the world was about to
end and I looked out in my driveway one

2763
02:50:56,971 --> 02:50:57,870
morning I woke up,

2764
02:50:58,340 --> 02:51:01,740
I had a big ass fucking house with
like a driveway that you could,

2765
02:51:02,310 --> 02:51:03,840
it was like a three car garage,

2766
02:51:03,841 --> 02:51:08,430
but the driveway can hold like another
15 cars and walk outside my house.

2767
02:51:08,430 --> 02:51:12,630
There's three cars in the garage and
he's like eight cars in the driveway and

2768
02:51:12,631 --> 02:51:15,210
they're all mine. I'm like, I'm like,

2769
02:51:15,211 --> 02:51:19,740
I spent everyday taking one of these
fucking cars to the shop to get the stereo

2770
02:51:19,741 --> 02:51:24,120
fixed to the rim. It's rims fucking
rotated or the guy does this.

2771
02:51:24,121 --> 02:51:27,450
It was just so much shit at,
it was that moment.

2772
02:51:27,451 --> 02:51:32,310
That little two year period I just
realized you stupid motherfucker like you

2773
02:51:32,311 --> 02:51:35,940
really ended up with eight
cars. I just one driver. Yeah.

2774
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:39,390
And I've never done that shit. Aye.
It was like a fire. So I even um,

2775
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:43,350
at that point something
really great happened cause
it was this whole end of the

2776
02:51:43,351 --> 02:51:48,270
world, Shit, I am 2000 kicked in
the world didn't end and I was like,

2777
02:51:48,271 --> 02:51:49,830
damn,
you got to do something spectacular.

2778
02:51:49,831 --> 02:51:53,850
So I told like a bunch of
my closest personal friends.

2779
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:56,880
I was like everything fucked up.

2780
02:51:56,881 --> 02:52:00,030
Last year I fucking lost
every fucking dime I had.

2781
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:03,270
I think I'm about to lose my fucking
house. I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

2782
02:52:03,271 --> 02:52:04,890
Because I used to be the guy who
would always take everybody to,

2783
02:52:05,570 --> 02:52:06,850
but everything's,

2784
02:52:07,010 --> 02:52:09,640
I mean we go out and just everything
and make sure it might make money.

2785
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:11,560
I just wanted to, I was,
it was an experiment.

2786
02:52:11,561 --> 02:52:15,310
I was only going to do it for like six
months or something and I just like I

2787
02:52:15,311 --> 02:52:16,830
just told everybody for a lot.
I,

2788
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:22,320
I was in the house organizing music
files and doing some personal,

2789
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:26,830
you know, Shit. I had all this
music, all these files, all his shit.

2790
02:52:27,070 --> 02:52:29,740
I think MP three s were new.
I was converted all my shit.

2791
02:52:29,741 --> 02:52:33,260
The MP three and I just really liked was,
I thought the world was going end,

2792
02:52:33,261 --> 02:52:35,590
so I really, I was like, I got a
little free time on my hand, the world.

2793
02:52:35,590 --> 02:52:38,230
And then so I played this
trick and guess what?

2794
02:52:39,010 --> 02:52:43,330
Probably about like 95% of my
friends just quit calling. Really?

2795
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:47,620
Yeah.
It was like be in this industry.

2796
02:52:47,621 --> 02:52:52,621
You kind of know that you
have acquaintances and you
had friends and I still

2797
02:52:52,901 --> 02:52:55,030
have the same friends I had
since fucking high school.

2798
02:52:55,270 --> 02:52:58,300
So that just tells you you this shit.

2799
02:52:59,400 --> 02:53:03,010
But I just wanted to see people when
people say Shit like this, you give a guy,

2800
02:53:03,011 --> 02:53:06,850
I'm a $25,000 check for some shit.
He didn't music.

2801
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:11,740
He's the guy who never had money like
that 25,000 you already bro. He goes, man,

2802
02:53:11,741 --> 02:53:15,010
I fucking love you. I will
fucking, anything you need.

2803
02:53:15,011 --> 02:53:16,990
I was killed somebody for you and I,

2804
02:53:16,991 --> 02:53:21,310
that was always my like red
flag and somebody says, go
kill something. I'm like,

2805
02:53:21,311 --> 02:53:25,420
no, that's not what the
check is for it. But, but um,

2806
02:53:26,830 --> 02:53:30,680
as soon as that money's gone, I was like,
they're like, yeah, like you got 25 more.

2807
02:53:30,681 --> 02:53:34,460
He like, Nah, they was the only earning
25. Like, well fuck you then man. Yeah.

2808
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:38,500
It's just, it's just funny like
that. So yeah. So um, yeah, that was,

2809
02:53:38,510 --> 02:53:42,520
it was an eye opener. I've never had
eight cars at the same time since then.

2810
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:48,130
I don't take on a lot of fucking close
circle personal friends and you know,

2811
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:52,300
yeah. Smart. You're in the circle
k mart. I'm in the circle. Yeah.

2812
02:53:52,420 --> 02:53:55,810
I'm very fortunate. He has not
be traded my field yet. Not yet.

2813
02:53:57,840 --> 02:53:58,680
And how did you guys,
oh,

2814
02:53:58,681 --> 02:54:02,140
so how'd you hook up to like where did
the idea to come to do the radio show?

2815
02:54:02,290 --> 02:54:05,550
Well, I was um, another good question. Ah,

2816
02:54:05,620 --> 02:54:08,890
rolling stones doing a feature on me
that's supposedly coming out next month.

2817
02:54:08,891 --> 02:54:13,500
It's all about the me too. It's all
about fixing. A long time ago, man.

2818
02:54:13,690 --> 02:54:16,300
We did. We can, we talked to
her like what, eight months ago?

2819
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:19,700
So it's been taken a little while,
but it's finally coming out. Uh,

2820
02:54:19,701 --> 02:54:24,701
I brought Amanda the writer down to meet
short downtown cause I thought I'd give

2821
02:54:25,031 --> 02:54:27,280
her a little cross section of some
of the people I deal with. You know,

2822
02:54:27,370 --> 02:54:28,660
I fucks with a lot of people.

2823
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:33,670
So she was so blown away by two short
and she was like, this is great.

2824
02:54:33,671 --> 02:54:35,770
What nice guys. What a
great facility. Shorts.

2825
02:54:35,771 --> 02:54:37,460
Got a place downtown called the boombox.

2826
02:54:37,590 --> 02:54:42,300
It's about a 30,000 square foot facility
and every really, really rough 15th.

2827
02:54:42,301 --> 02:54:46,990
That was crazy. 15. I'm sorry.
This is like, just where you work.

2828
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:52,170
It says my thing. It's my thing.
It's this compound he's got,

2829
02:54:52,290 --> 02:54:57,070
he's got a giant studio downtown.
Yes. That's painted like a boombox.

2830
02:54:57,130 --> 02:54:57,820
And the uh,

2831
02:54:57,820 --> 02:55:00,550
the middle where the cassette would be
is the actual window into the studio,

2832
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:04,760
but he's got different rooms.
Got a barbershop in there.
He's got him. And there's,

2833
02:55:04,810 --> 02:55:07,370
there's recording equipment in every room.
So if you're inspired,

2834
02:55:07,820 --> 02:55:10,150
you know he's got artists down there
that are working in every single room.

2835
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:14,360
That's the factory hit factory. So
anyway, I brought down the writers,

2836
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:18,380
she loved it and she started
saying something about a
podcast and shorts, like,

2837
02:55:18,381 --> 02:55:18,770
you know,

2838
02:55:18,770 --> 02:55:22,070
we should really do a podcast together
again because we did one last year,

2839
02:55:22,100 --> 02:55:25,820
a couple of years ago when he did
it and it was really a fun time.

2840
02:55:25,821 --> 02:55:30,360
He had snoop and ice cube and Chanel
west coast and a bunch of cute bash.

2841
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:33,350
You were on the Chanel show. Yeah,
that was, that was, that was an,

2842
02:55:33,410 --> 02:55:38,410
that was kind of like the green
light for me was that we had big,

2843
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:43,100
big, big names on the show.
Russell Simmons and I mean it just,

2844
02:55:43,150 --> 02:55:43,983
the list went on and on.

2845
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,580
Actors sports player and
the Chanel and kb shell,

2846
02:55:48,581 --> 02:55:53,030
Chanel west coast from ridiculousness.
Yeah, that was the highest rated show.

2847
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:56,120
Yeah. So I ended up being on the
highest rated show, but it was,

2848
02:55:56,540 --> 02:56:01,400
I enjoy this because he's says shit like,
what the fuck did you say on that show?

2849
02:56:01,580 --> 02:56:06,050
Who knows? Probably told about just sex
stuff. Yeah. You say shit. He's like,

2850
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:10,640
he's like, um, we just having a normal
conversation like this and then kb goes,

2851
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:15,800
yeah. Like when Kim Kardashian
got peed on the original tape,

2852
02:56:15,801 --> 02:56:18,740
she was getting paid on. What's your
really, Rachel was every in honor.

2853
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:21,410
Ray J denied and Kj denies it.

2854
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:26,060
But I know what I saw while we were just
talking about Chuck Berry's video today.

2855
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:30,850
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, he does.

2856
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:36,110
Before Kelly farts, like
as she's blonde, he's like,

2857
02:56:36,111 --> 02:56:39,680
he's like did our far and she's like,
yeah. He's like, yes, sometimes I do that.

2858
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:44,540
Maybe aren't Kelly saw that shit and you
get maybe I'm like a mitten mentor kind

2859
02:56:44,541 --> 02:56:48,800
of thing going on through possibly.
Possibly. Yeah. I mean, look,

2860
02:56:49,070 --> 02:56:52,760
there's a lot of sex tapes out there
that you know about it. All right,

2861
02:56:52,761 --> 02:56:56,360
let's talk about the sex tapes.
We don't know about.

2862
02:56:57,300 --> 02:57:01,060
Kb is a, he's a cold brother, you know,

2863
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:04,640
he does what's up. He's
like, look at this shit.

2864
02:57:05,270 --> 02:57:09,080
And he shows me his phone. I
show him painting, all kind
of people you know, doing,

2865
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:11,560
Ugh, why sex? I mean,

2866
02:57:11,561 --> 02:57:16,561
years ago I showed short a video clip of
Justin Bieber singing a song with the n

2867
02:57:17,031 --> 02:57:18,640
word in it and I got out that guy,

2868
02:57:19,670 --> 02:57:24,410
he had purchased it five different times
and spent hundreds of thousands to make

2869
02:57:24,411 --> 02:57:24,680
it go away.

2870
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:27,830
When he was 16 he finally had to just
fess and I showed it to shorten shirts

2871
02:57:27,831 --> 02:57:32,831
like that career is done
and we all thought he'd be
done someone's lyrics or was

2872
02:57:35,270 --> 02:57:35,891
this his own?

2873
02:57:35,891 --> 02:57:39,590
He had a song called one less lonely
girl and he was like one less lonely

2874
02:57:39,980 --> 02:57:41,930
inwards.
One lesson he wrote it.

2875
02:57:42,380 --> 02:57:45,690
He was just like trying to get a reaction
out of his white friends and they're

2876
02:57:45,710 --> 02:57:48,380
all laughing along with them,
but it was not nice.

2877
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:53,560
And granted he was a kid are back to
the sex tapes back to the sex tapes for.

2878
02:57:54,070 --> 02:57:58,280
So uh, no,

2879
02:57:58,790 --> 02:58:00,510
no.
I'll tell us why.

2880
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:04,400
I've signed a lot of NDA so I can't
talk about some of them. Yeah.

2881
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:08,280
But I will say that the Tom Sizemore tape,
which did come out eventually,

2882
02:58:08,281 --> 02:58:11,160
it was probably one of the most
disturbing tapes I've ever seen.

2883
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:12,810
Movies or something.
Say selling.

2884
02:58:12,811 --> 02:58:15,510
So somebody from this movie
and somebody from that movie,

2885
02:58:17,130 --> 02:58:19,070
Tom Sizemore had the priapus zoom,

2886
02:58:19,071 --> 02:58:21,450
which is when you have a hard
on for longer than four hours,

2887
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:25,710
that's what they warn you against,
like blink once or twice.

2888
02:58:27,010 --> 02:58:31,380
Um, that was a bad way, I
would say. Uh, okay. So I'm,

2889
02:58:31,910 --> 02:58:34,370
but why was it a bad one?
Tom Size?

2890
02:58:34,371 --> 02:58:38,010
But it was bad because he was high on
crystal meth and he had five hookers in

2891
02:58:38,011 --> 02:58:42,390
the Chateau Marmont and he's talking
to the camera and he's just glazed and

2892
02:58:42,391 --> 02:58:46,440
you're like, well, I feel bad for this
guy. Yeah, no, it didn't link up it,

2893
02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:49,740
it actually came out commercially vivid,
put it out for a little while.

2894
02:58:49,770 --> 02:58:53,850
It wasn't five hookers. Yes, Jesus man.

2895
02:58:53,880 --> 02:58:57,570
I had the Collin Farrel sex tape as well,
which was a really interesting tape.

2896
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:00,960
That really, yeah, with Nicole
and rain, she was one of the,

2897
02:59:00,961 --> 02:59:05,880
a seven black playmates and the history
of playboy. But when I first saw it,

2898
02:59:05,910 --> 02:59:08,710
I was actually a friend
Nicole. Me, she's cool. Uh,

2899
02:59:08,740 --> 02:59:12,460
I was actually taken in the trunk of a
car because these guys didn't have wide

2900
02:59:12,461 --> 02:59:14,490
in the back. So you were on the
trunk of a car before? Yeah.

2901
02:59:15,560 --> 02:59:19,050
This guy's calling me up. They're
like, Yo, you're hands free. Yeah,

2902
02:59:19,051 --> 02:59:21,900
but I was just going up sunset plaza
because they didn't have room in their

2903
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:24,000
Honda to get me up there.
But I was such a horror.

2904
02:59:24,001 --> 02:59:28,350
One guy kidnapped in a Honda
from Mel's drive ever kidnap me,

2905
02:59:28,351 --> 02:59:30,720
kidnap me and something better.
Nice man.

2906
02:59:30,721 --> 02:59:35,430
Better be a chord like 2019 and
core trunk space, man, they um,

2907
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:37,460
they put me up to this house.
I got a little string in there.

2908
02:59:37,470 --> 02:59:38,430
You can let yourself up.

2909
02:59:38,490 --> 02:59:43,010
I wasn't really worried cause they wanted
one point $2 million for the sex tape

2910
02:59:43,011 --> 02:59:45,210
and they knew I was the only guy that
was going to be able to get it for him.

2911
02:59:45,750 --> 02:59:47,670
So when I actually went into this house,

2912
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:50,130
it just kind of back like
then like sorta like relaxed.

2913
02:59:50,131 --> 02:59:52,020
Like when I got in the House I was like

2914
02:59:54,930 --> 02:59:59,550
this for a second. I mean the Trump was
even shot. Did you call your brother? No,

2915
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:03,590
I called him right after this all
happened by the ride. Just got to trunk,

2916
03:00:04,050 --> 03:00:07,620
trunk right now. I drove up from San
Diego. I was living in Carlsbad trunk.

2917
03:00:09,330 --> 03:00:11,700
Yeah. Great. Great. Two
short songs by the way. Yeah,

2918
03:00:11,880 --> 03:00:15,690
in the trunk feature in blessed cancer
featured in the opening scene was like

2919
03:00:16,920 --> 03:00:21,900
big deal. Big Deal. Big check in
the trunk is cracked. So yeah,

2920
03:00:21,901 --> 03:00:24,900
I was going to try some frilliest
kidnappers. Yeah, for real.

2921
03:00:24,990 --> 03:00:26,270
I ended up going into this,
uh,

2922
03:00:26,340 --> 03:00:30,340
Manchin and they put the VHS tape in and
there's Colin Farrell, it really a kid.

2923
03:00:30,341 --> 03:00:32,430
And I said get in the trunk
cause we don't have room for you.

2924
03:00:32,430 --> 03:00:35,190
They said we weren't really planning on
showing it to you and we don't have room

2925
03:00:35,191 --> 03:00:38,280
in the backseat of our car, but we don't
want you following us up in your car.

2926
03:00:38,281 --> 03:00:41,840
So when will you agree to get blindfold
them and put in the trunk of the car?

2927
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:47,640
I left out the blind fold is a Bandana.
So, uh, you can't know where we ask.

2928
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:50,190
So you want me to go on where I was going.
So I went up,

2929
03:00:50,191 --> 03:00:52,170
it was literally three and
a half minutes to the house.

2930
03:00:52,420 --> 03:00:55,650
I now recognize it was sunset plaza
that I was going up. Right. Windy road,

2931
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:58,200
cause I wasn't living in La at the time.
I go in there,

2932
03:00:58,201 --> 03:01:00,490
they put the VHS tape in and there he is,

2933
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:05,050
the shaved head naked with the biggest
penis I've ever seen in my life for a

2934
03:01:05,051 --> 03:01:09,720
little guy. Who's that? Collin Collin.
And he looks at the and goes, go,

2935
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:12,910
I could do this for fucking breakfast.
Fucking lunch and fucking dinner.

2936
03:01:12,911 --> 03:01:14,860
I can eat that kitty.
And I'm like,

2937
03:01:14,861 --> 03:01:17,590
and he's got a cigarette dangling from
his mouth and his holy a Guinness.

2938
03:01:18,070 --> 03:01:22,630
I'm like, if this isn't my tripod
off dude, this guy, I was like,

2939
03:01:22,631 --> 03:01:26,770
does he breathe through this thing family?
Her camera was flying.

2940
03:01:26,950 --> 03:01:31,600
She was filming it with, with her handheld
camera. Okay, okay. And I'm just going,

2941
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:35,500
Holy Shit. This is amazing. I knew her
at the time that that was a scandal.

2942
03:01:35,501 --> 03:01:37,120
She was like, I'm about to be rich. Yeah.

2943
03:01:37,121 --> 03:01:41,020
She really didn't get paid to work and
make money from this. Now we shut it down.

2944
03:01:41,050 --> 03:01:44,800
Um, oh he, he wanted it to be shut down.
He had to pay a lot of money for it to go.

2945
03:01:44,801 --> 03:01:46,000
Really?
It didn't go to her,

2946
03:01:46,370 --> 03:01:49,420
did not go to her because you
were talking about like, you know,

2947
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:53,140
having rights in the copper. Why
does, so how does it work if like,

2948
03:01:53,290 --> 03:01:58,030
if you're the person in it, who are
you paying to make it go away? So why?

2949
03:01:58,090 --> 03:02:02,020
So let's say, um, you're going through
an airport, you guys travel a lot,

2950
03:02:02,060 --> 03:02:05,890
you've got your laptop on one of those
little things going through Tsa and you

2951
03:02:05,891 --> 03:02:08,740
get held back or whatever and all of
a sudden somebody makes off with your

2952
03:02:08,741 --> 03:02:12,700
laptop. Okay? Somebody gets into your
laptop. They tried to put out this tape.

2953
03:02:13,150 --> 03:02:15,430
They can't put it out legally
because if they're not on it,

2954
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:19,600
you and Christina are the only two
people. Yeah. Okay. In a sex tape.

2955
03:02:20,500 --> 03:02:24,520
She's a 50% copyright holder. Europe,
50% copyright holder. Right now,

2956
03:02:24,521 --> 03:02:28,600
if I get ahold of your computer,
I might have possession of your computer,

2957
03:02:28,601 --> 03:02:30,090
but I don't own your computer.
Right.

2958
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:33,850
Which makes me in possession
of stolen material. Right.

2959
03:02:34,090 --> 03:02:35,950
Which is how we shut down 90% of them.

2960
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:39,760
If you don't have the right to publicity
and you don't have the rights from at

2961
03:02:39,761 --> 03:02:42,700
least one of the people and even one
of the people's problematic because you

2962
03:02:42,701 --> 03:02:45,190
need to have both of the people.
So in this scenario though,

2963
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:49,270
let's say we use your scenario. Yeah.
So then it's like, so Tom, you know,

2964
03:02:49,271 --> 03:02:53,650
Kevin's got it or whatever. Um, and
I don't want it to get out, right.

2965
03:02:53,890 --> 03:02:56,470
Am I just paying you to
give me my laptop bag?

2966
03:02:56,680 --> 03:03:01,680
Or what you're doing is you're basically
hiring me to go out there and that the

2967
03:03:02,111 --> 03:03:04,690
person that has it,
I'm going to find out how they got it,

2968
03:03:05,320 --> 03:03:08,050
what their intention is with it.
And 90% of the time, you know,

2969
03:03:08,051 --> 03:03:10,890
we now live in this TMZ world
where people want to go and they,

2970
03:03:11,290 --> 03:03:14,590
they feel this is newsworthy. Oh,
Tom Segura, he's a huge comic.

2971
03:03:15,010 --> 03:03:16,750
We're going to put this out as a story.

2972
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:20,620
He's got a sex tape being
sold around the valley. Well,

2973
03:03:21,070 --> 03:03:24,130
Thomson Guerra might have a deal with
Disney coming up and you probably in the

2974
03:03:24,131 --> 03:03:27,610
next shaggy dog and you don't need that
because you're going to get $2 million

2975
03:03:27,670 --> 03:03:30,430
picture. Pretty cool. Porn said you
guys have, by the way. Thanks man.

2976
03:03:30,620 --> 03:03:35,170
Does look very poor. Very poor.
They could do some good thoughts.

2977
03:03:36,190 --> 03:03:38,050
This neighborhood's very poorly,
by the way.

2978
03:03:38,430 --> 03:03:43,080
I could tell you stories about what
goes Forney. Yeah, that's Porny.

2979
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:44,023
Um,
but yeah,

2980
03:03:44,170 --> 03:03:48,670
so what we'll do is you would actually
me alongside with your lawyers, we would,

2981
03:03:48,671 --> 03:03:49,300
uh,

2982
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:53,410
coordinate getting this stuff back to
you and make sure that there's no copies.

2983
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:58,620
Is that money being paid going to you
and the lawyers or also that guy who just

2984
03:03:59,510 --> 03:04:02,600
so he needs a pay off? Well, they
go away when you pound. Okay.

2985
03:04:02,660 --> 03:04:03,800
You know their horse too.

2986
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:07,730
And later on that people who'd
tried to bravely put them out,

2987
03:04:08,590 --> 03:04:12,480
it's just a boring most,
the most part, right? Nobody
really made money like Paris.

2988
03:04:12,680 --> 03:04:14,210
Yeah.
I will say this.

2989
03:04:14,220 --> 03:04:18,890
Another exclusive and why image and shit.
Hold on.

2990
03:04:19,340 --> 03:04:21,930
This is a wire may check exclusive.

2991
03:04:25,500 --> 03:04:29,210
So exactly a year ago,
last week I was shocked.

2992
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:33,530
A woman calls me up and she's like, do
you have a secure line for me to talk to?

2993
03:04:34,060 --> 03:04:38,230
Right. Like I'm like in the
cone of silence or something.
I'm like, okay, yeah.

2994
03:04:38,231 --> 03:04:40,970
It's like I get on a whatsapp call with
her and I'm like, what do you have?

2995
03:04:40,971 --> 03:04:41,804
She says,

2996
03:04:42,050 --> 03:04:47,050
a guy sent me a tape of this model
slash actress for years ago and she is

2997
03:04:47,481 --> 03:04:52,130
tossing a salad and
it's, you know, oral sex.

2998
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:56,030
Yes, eat the scrum. And I said,
great. How do you know this guy? Well,

2999
03:04:56,031 --> 03:04:59,870

based in Florida. I was doing
some stuff with them. Okay.

see us anytime soon.

3025
03:06:34,310 --> 03:06:38,090
He might hope that he calls me
up one day. He goes, hey man,

3026
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:42,040
I gave your name to a friend of mine. He's

3031
03:06:57,920 --> 03:06:59,700
I can't hear you.
It's really loud in here.

3032
03:06:59,701 --> 03:07:01,290
It sounds like you're saying it's sugar.

3033
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:06,330

3039
03:07:23,810 --> 03:07:28,740
So then he proceeds to tell me what he

3040
03:07:28,741 --> 03:07:32,640

Honest to God,

3042
03:07:36,121 --> 03:07:39,810
we can't put it out legally. And I'm
trying to teach shook night about the law.

3043
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:44,010
And he's like, well fuck that. I'm putting
this thing out. This is how much money?

3044
03:07:44,440 --> 03:07:48,470
Hello? Hello. No, yes,
with the, oh honey, Noah.

3045
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:52,890
I that came to me a couple of times back
when the Oscar de la Hoya stuff started

3046
03:07:52,891 --> 03:07:55,310
happening too. And that's am my
rolling stone article. By the way,

3047
03:07:56,750 --> 03:07:59,760
Jay Jay Lo had a sex tape with her
first husband, the guy by the name of,

3048
03:07:59,761 --> 03:08:03,300
oh honey Noah. That was shot many years
ago, and they shut that down as well.

3049
03:08:03,301 --> 03:08:06,390
So that never came up. But
the one that shook, they did,

3050
03:08:06,391 --> 03:08:09,810
he end up putting it out and
now that one never came out. Um,

3051
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:14,220
but for two days it was pretty hairy
and I was like, I had to say no to him.

3052
03:08:14,221 --> 03:08:18,420
I couldn't get involved with them.
Oscar, I want to wait to write.

3053
03:08:18,780 --> 03:08:22,060
Oscar de la Hoya has had three
different things. Shop does it? Yeah.

3054
03:08:22,150 --> 03:08:24,810
Shit out there. He's got shit out
there. But the first couple of things,

3055
03:08:24,811 --> 03:08:29,640
he was in a women's leggings and stuff.
I've seen that photo upside down and oh,

3056
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:31,680
that was in that photo.
Yeah. Well the last thing,

3057
03:08:31,681 --> 03:08:33,600
I got the wedding dress thing with the,
yeah,

3058
03:08:33,601 --> 03:08:36,900
he was at a wedding dress the second time,
but this third time,

3059
03:08:36,990 --> 03:08:38,100
a couple of months back,

3060
03:08:38,220 --> 03:08:41,250
somebody came to me of the tape and
he was running around his apartment in

3061
03:08:41,251 --> 03:08:44,160
Pasadena and he's got, um, he's got a way,

3062
03:08:44,161 --> 03:08:48,480
not a location because the hookers said
that they came off a seeking arrangement

3063
03:08:48,481 --> 03:08:53,481
to his place and he was out of
his mind and po hit a big problem.

3064
03:08:53,880 --> 03:08:58,860
Huge problem. He's running around
and he's got a whisk in his rectum.

3065
03:08:59,670 --> 03:09:04,510
Okay. Yeah. And they have an idea
with a whisk is, oh, it's because

3066
03:09:07,730 --> 03:09:11,940
he's got the handle of it and he's running
around out of his mind and the girls

3067
03:09:11,941 --> 03:09:16,770
are videotaping this. And I'm like, oh
my God, this poor guy. Granted, you know,

3068
03:09:16,771 --> 03:09:17,850
whatever.
And then he puts a,

3069
03:09:18,300 --> 03:09:21,710
another like a spatula handle up there
and they're playing and rough it.

3070
03:09:21,711 --> 03:09:26,380
And I'm like, oh my God, devil.
And all I'm thinking is I,

3071
03:09:26,870 --> 03:09:30,840
if I'm some chick, I'd be
more worried about sleeping
over at us. Can still fight.

3072
03:09:30,841 --> 03:09:35,310
Right. Yeah. I know. And he's got a
lot of money. Any from La Program,

3073
03:09:35,940 --> 03:09:38,700
I'm more afraid of that mother fucker
cooking me breakfast in the morning cause

3074
03:09:38,701 --> 03:09:43,350
I don't wanna get pink guy, you
know? But uh, yeah. That was, um,

3075
03:09:44,160 --> 03:09:46,260
it was an extortion
attempt. Oh, it was? Yeah.

3076
03:09:46,261 --> 03:09:50,100
Side of the hose by the hose and the
FBI got involved and I ended up meeting

3077
03:09:50,101 --> 03:09:51,310
with the FBI and the,

3078
03:09:51,790 --> 03:09:55,330
the writer was from rolling stone was
with me when I showed up to meet with the

3079
03:09:55,331 --> 03:09:57,640
feds.
And the feds flipped the fuck out there.

3080
03:09:57,640 --> 03:10:00,250
Like what are you doing bringing in
a writer with you? I'm like, well,

They prosecuted the girls
attracted down by Florida.

3084
03:10:09,220 --> 03:10:12,880
Sometimes I get involved with
law enforcement of serious
shit. I like to turn my,

3085
03:10:12,881 --> 03:10:17,140
uh, my powers towards the good.

3093
03:10:44,980 --> 03:10:48,700
There's a lot of girls that actually
have legitimate gripes. You know,

3094
03:10:48,701 --> 03:10:49,810

to Jenner ration. Well, but it's,

3096
03:10:53,680 --> 03:10:56,200

British lady and she claims that she,

3132
03:13:08,330 --> 03:13:12,230
I had a great life and I
became a prostitute and it
was great and blah blah blah.

3133
03:13:12,290 --> 03:13:16,160
Ivy League escorts have Ivy
League degrees. No Shit.

3134
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:21,220
And you got to pay them money to fucking

3137
03:13:30,410 --> 03:13:34,010
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

3138
03:13:35,120 --> 03:13:38,120
You can get into that and you
have to go lunch. Can't be a hoe.

3139
03:13:38,121 --> 03:13:39,570
It's not in me man.

3140

websites where you can like go find these

3141
03:13:45,231 --> 03:13:48,290

I released escorting and skip the games.

3142
03:13:50,620 --> 03:13:55,230
Escort Ivy League companion, skipped
the Games. Scabs the games guys.

3143
03:13:55,460 --> 03:14:00,140
She can get it. What she
wants. She doesn't look like
fucking Ivy League whore.

3144
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:02,030
I'm going to say, how do
you know? Did they have,

3145
03:14:02,380 --> 03:14:05,900
did they have to bring their
transcripts to the date? Yeah,

3146
03:14:07,170 --> 03:14:09,990
in spring term papers, if you're
looking for an intellectual experience,

3147
03:14:09,991 --> 03:14:14,530
it should be instantaneous. You should
know like near a night. You better.

3148
03:14:14,780 --> 03:14:16,760
No Way. Real Ivy legally if she goes. No,

3149

03:14:26,750 --> 03:14:27,583
shit.

3152
03:14:28,150 --> 03:14:32,840
This became popular during 10 or
so years ago during a recession.

3153
03:14:33,140 --> 03:14:37,580
Oh really? Yeah. You and let you

Yeah, makes sense. Oh rich motherfucker
need somebody to go to Greece with him.

3155
03:14:43,420 --> 03:14:47,300
That's right. Yeah. You would never do it.

3156
03:14:47,390 --> 03:14:52,310
Now I'd rather be broken a gutter probably
wouldn't even have like good. Okay.

3157
03:14:52,790 --> 03:14:56,410
Let's just say you had a Tuesday
boyfriend. It's Tuesday today. Sue there

3158
03:14:58,910 --> 03:15:02,140
every Tuesday you come to his office.
Okay.

3159
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:04,360
And he's still on his desk.
Okay.

3160
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:07,970
I mean fucking eat your pussy
or something. I don't know.

3161
03:15:07,971 --> 03:15:10,440
He's like old executive dude.
Okay.

3162
03:15:10,970 --> 03:15:14,980
Every first of the month he
wears you like 25 grand. Come on,

3163
03:15:17,060 --> 03:15:19,890
let me ask you this. Is
there a business? Let's talk.

3164
03:15:20,600 --> 03:15:24,800
Is there a business where I can just
fart in his face or kick him in the nuts

3165
03:15:24,801 --> 03:15:29,270
and I don't have to let him
touch me? Yes, there is actually.

3166
03:15:30,140 --> 03:15:33,550
That's the kind of shit, that's what
I was nine to five dominant trends.

3167
03:15:33,551 --> 03:15:36,690
You can go right down the street
somewhere. Me Mother fuckers part time,

3168
03:15:37,170 --> 03:15:40,040
part time. Tom would be okay
with that. That's fine with me.

3169
03:15:45,710 --> 03:15:49,140
You forgot to say I want
to see them checks? Yeah.

3170
03:15:49,320 --> 03:15:52,980
Could you teach him to teach him
how to get the pimp hand strong?

3171
03:15:53,050 --> 03:15:57,890
Teach him some sayings. Pimps always
had them give me some sayings. I get.

3172
03:15:57,900 --> 03:16:00,840
What do you, how do you motivate?
Let's say I don't want to work tonight.

3173
03:16:00,900 --> 03:16:05,320
I don't care right tonight.
Oh,

3174
03:16:08,370 --> 03:16:13,210
I liked that. I liked that a lot on the
right train you on the wrong track. Ooh.

3175
03:16:13,310 --> 03:16:15,030
If you knew better,
you'd do better.

3176
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:20,520
Is that what you say I want to do
was I don't do fancy Saint Barts. No,

3177
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:25,110
no. I just do logic. He's like, in
Memphis, my approach is mathematics.

3178
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:30,250
I'm tired. I don't want to work
tonight. I, I'm real tired. Okay.

3179
03:16:30,330 --> 03:16:34,050
Just work Christmas. We'll take tonight.
I've worked, they work Christmas though.

3180
03:16:34,710 --> 03:16:39,590
While you're saying it's good
logic, you got it all right.

3181
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:43,960
One day or another. You know
you want Christmas off. You
want to take tonight off.

3182
03:16:43,970 --> 03:16:46,560
I'm not, I'm not taking you
to the pip and whole ball,

3183
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:49,950
but I've been looking
forward to that all year.

3184
03:16:53,940 --> 03:16:58,320
Hey, calms the girl bitch, Bitch,

3185
03:17:00,690 --> 03:17:03,750
bitch. They like that or do they
get offended or they get upset?

3186
03:17:05,610 --> 03:17:09,300
You can't say bitch.
You can call the girls.

3187
03:17:09,560 --> 03:17:11,390
You can't say my name.

3188
03:17:13,980 --> 03:17:17,780
I remember those documentaries taught
me his daddy about bottom bitches and

3189
03:17:18,230 --> 03:17:20,850
who's your bottom? But do you have a
bottom? But did you have a bottom bitch?

3190
03:17:21,300 --> 03:17:25,090
I never got into it like that.
I'm giving you scenarios. I never,

3191
03:17:25,170 --> 03:17:28,490
I never had to make so much
fucking money. I wrap. I hear Ya.

3192
03:17:29,970 --> 03:17:34,410
When I did dabble and I
dabbled because it came to me,

3193
03:17:34,411 --> 03:17:37,020
I didn't go looking forward
and I'm like, okay, somebody,

3194
03:17:37,021 --> 03:17:39,360
somebody says I'm going to give you all
this money every day. You don't say no.

3195
03:17:39,570 --> 03:17:41,820
You realize how,
how strong it has to be,

3196
03:17:42,020 --> 03:17:45,990
but like you're not trying
to get into pimping hoes.
Like here's money. Thank you.

3197
03:17:45,991 --> 03:17:50,860
I know babies too short though.
Alright.

3198
03:17:50,940 --> 03:17:54,870
Imitates life cycle. Never ending.
You put it out there, right?

3199
03:17:54,871 --> 03:17:57,480
You put it out there and it comes back.
So player born American,

3200
03:17:57,560 --> 03:18:01,050
your bottom bitches, your
favorite, the queen's favorite.

3201
03:18:02,340 --> 03:18:05,250
Hypothetically it is,
uh,

3202
03:18:05,340 --> 03:18:09,280
the most solid one and a crew
who is the most trustworthy. Ooh.

3203
03:18:09,300 --> 03:18:12,740
Sometimes has seniority and who you know,

3204
03:18:12,840 --> 03:18:17,840
either has the temperament and
the skills to cope hemp with you.

3205
03:18:20,820 --> 03:18:25,590
Oh Wow. So she's even elevated above.
She kind of helps you in business.

3206
03:18:25,660 --> 03:18:29,400
You should like three weeks and you
know, bottom bitch, hold it down.

3207
03:18:29,490 --> 03:18:33,030
You're kidding. I did not
know that. Cured the bag.

3208
03:18:33,060 --> 03:18:37,340
The money's there and damn,
everybody's still happy.

3209
03:18:37,770 --> 03:18:40,760
And I'm telling you, we should
really get into it. Get into process.

3210
03:18:41,280 --> 03:18:45,030
Here's the thing, Joe Movies about that
and it doesn't end good. Oh, I know.

3211
03:18:45,710 --> 03:18:47,530
Now is the best thing going.

3212
03:18:49,450 --> 03:18:51,310
And this might be a stupid question,

3213
03:18:51,940 --> 03:18:55,170
but I'm assuming I'll be live on this

3214
03:18:58,850 --> 03:19:03,090
hypothetical. Okay. So,

3215
03:19:04,870 --> 03:19:08,210
so I'm assuming you, it's a cash business.
You don't take a fucking credit card.

3216
03:19:11,050 --> 03:19:14,640
Wait, Twitter. I've been
seeing documentaries about
this shit. We'll watch the,

3217
03:19:14,641 --> 03:19:19,110
the p four watch the budget's Keith
a terrible at, I'm a hole lock.

3218
03:19:19,300 --> 03:19:22,030
It sounds got to it.
Is it hardest fight?

3219
03:19:22,031 --> 03:19:25,510
So I don't understand why everyone
was a fucking stuck. Okay. Okay.

3220
03:19:25,690 --> 03:19:29,740
So Lipski cause Jetski so, so you
get up ski, it's a cash business.

3221
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:33,820
You appeasing Sam's has
Europe, pimps, pimps, Getsky,

3222
03:19:35,390 --> 03:19:39,280
Penske, Penske, MC. So you
get, it's a cash business,

3223
03:19:39,670 --> 03:19:42,690
but you can't put the fucking
cash in the bank. What do you,

3224
03:19:42,691 --> 03:19:43,840
you know what I'm saying?
Where do you,

3225
03:19:43,841 --> 03:19:47,120
where do pimps put the cash
in the mattress? Credit Union.

3226
03:19:48,670 --> 03:19:52,030
What do you mean credit unions
take that kind of money. Oh, okay.

3227
03:19:52,060 --> 03:19:56,390
But pibs that's in the mattress.
Yeah. Yeah. Come on. It's like, ah,

3228
03:19:57,100 --> 03:20:00,480
I got to figure that part
out. See, everybody knows, but
he's like, I'm not telling,

3229
03:20:00,490 --> 03:20:05,140
yeah, I saw him get real uncomfortable.
You can have that conversation.

3230
03:20:05,290 --> 03:20:09,610
Camera's going, hey, so
where's, where's your cash?

3231
03:20:09,690 --> 03:20:13,060
[inaudible] not you.
I see a hybrid.

3232
03:20:16,920 --> 03:20:21,900
So it ended the lining of
jackets and shit like that. Um,

3233
03:20:22,710 --> 03:20:25,500
I don't know what you would do. I really
don't. Hey, can we do a show together?

3234
03:20:26,590 --> 03:20:30,720
You might live on stage. Yeah. Like
I'll do a set and then you do a set.

3235
03:20:31,080 --> 03:20:34,440
You close it out. That'd be amazing. You
stay on the show and then you come out,

3236
03:20:34,770 --> 03:20:38,490
blow the doors off with some,
you know with the hits man.
We'll do blowjob, Betty.

3237
03:20:38,610 --> 03:20:42,810
Yeah. Oh, the wait. We got
to do it without the dissolve
part. I'll fucking do.

3238
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:48,900
What was that line again?
I said bus left and up right now in a job.

3239
03:20:48,990 --> 03:20:53,500
Spur him on the cheeks. It's all dissolved
instead of all she saw. I fucked it up.

3240
03:20:53,620 --> 03:20:57,880
It's all dissolved salt. Oh no man. She
rubbed it in. It would never dissolve.

3241
03:20:57,900 --> 03:21:00,290
We should thought that. Yeah, I
know. I should have thought about it.

3242
03:21:01,420 --> 03:21:05,670
She gets sticky. It's still, you still
see it. It's still there. Is that right?

3243
03:21:06,510 --> 03:21:08,120
Is there like years
later it's still there,

3244
03:21:11,690 --> 03:21:16,290
but the thing is still in her dead
ass. Fucking Betty's throat. Mike,

3245
03:21:16,980 --> 03:21:18,880
what does she look like?
Can you describe her?

3246
03:21:18,881 --> 03:21:21,960
I always picked her like Betty
rebel from the Flintstones,

3247
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:22,990
but that's not accurate.

3248
03:21:25,740 --> 03:21:29,180
Just loosely all the have Elizabeth.

3249
03:21:30,010 --> 03:21:34,290
What does that mean? Just he's just
a girl next door. Yeah, just a girl,

3250
03:21:34,291 --> 03:21:35,124
but she brunette.

3251
03:21:36,250 --> 03:21:39,910
I haven't really dealt with a lot
of hookers that look like hookers,

3252
03:21:39,911 --> 03:21:44,770
you know what I mean? Oh, okay. Like
literally like gate girls turn bet. Yeah.

3253
03:21:44,860 --> 03:21:48,380
Ooh, she's a good girl. Good look
at hose. Okay. All right. Let's, um,

3254
03:21:48,710 --> 03:21:50,090
let's say it again,
the show.

3255
03:21:50,120 --> 03:21:55,120
You guys are doing a blow the whistle
dash radio dash radio and the new album,

3256
03:21:56,050 --> 03:21:59,840
it's called the pimp tape. Pimp
tape. And it is everywhere.

3257
03:21:59,841 --> 03:22:02,750
You want to look for it. It's
everywhere. Very educational.

3258
03:22:02,751 --> 03:22:07,751
He's got a huge rappers and he just
maybe not contemplating doing a g rating,

3259
03:22:08,360 --> 03:22:13,210
educational and music. Really? Why? Just
because that music is so infectious. Yeah.

3260
03:22:13,400 --> 03:22:18,400
That I'm thinking we're in a time and
day now where different learning tactics,

3261
03:22:19,430 --> 03:22:21,650
you know, I like it. I'd be an experiment,

3262
03:22:21,680 --> 03:22:24,770
but what do you rap about though when
you're g rated? Just like anything.

3263
03:22:25,190 --> 03:22:29,500
Just Electric Company Shit. Yeah. Okay.
Sesame Street Shit, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

3264
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:30,680
We love sesame street.

3265
03:22:30,681 --> 03:22:33,830
Did you guys have to hear some titles of
songs off the new album lab? Definitely.

3266
03:22:34,520 --> 03:22:38,450
It starts off with go short dog.
Yeah. It goes into break a bitch.

3267
03:22:39,020 --> 03:22:42,500
That's the second track and then
tables featuring snoop dog bring bitch.

3268
03:22:42,520 --> 03:22:46,730
The Hook is, are you a pimp or a Hoe?
I'm like that. Which one are you?

3269
03:22:46,850 --> 03:22:47,760
Ain't my girlfriend.

3270
03:22:48,590 --> 03:22:51,650
My girlfriend is my favorite track and
this is the best music video that you'll

3271
03:22:51,651 --> 03:22:54,510
ever see. By the way, you'll have to
Google that one. The videos for him.

3272
03:22:54,511 --> 03:22:57,410
Funny track number five is
give her some money. Hey,

3273
03:22:57,411 --> 03:23:01,160
I like that you're talking about
strippers, strippers. It's still,

3274
03:23:01,161 --> 03:23:03,910
they're getting money. No,
strippers is around money.

3275
03:23:04,190 --> 03:23:06,830
Truck six is save all that love.
He goes,

3276
03:23:06,831 --> 03:23:10,610
well you work for your boyfriend for the
boyfriend because daddy don't need it.

3277
03:23:11,350 --> 03:23:16,180
How to be a player, how to be
a player with the 40 Yup. Anti.

3278
03:23:16,240 --> 03:23:20,150
We've got pull your trophies out.
Don't shoot.

3279
03:23:20,600 --> 03:23:22,310
Which I'm assuming is not a gun.

3280
03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:25,790
It's kind of a black lives matter.

3281
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:28,810
Then we have a Dr Dre interlude.

3282
03:23:28,920 --> 03:23:33,530
I give me back my eyes only
dimes is the track number 13.

3283
03:23:33,531 --> 03:23:35,970
That's what Ge z and
then torque the drain.

3284
03:23:35,971 --> 03:23:39,080
The dream was on there also twerk trains
and other good when there's a lot of

3285
03:23:39,081 --> 03:23:43,230
cuts on this girl. Chanel, west coast or
Chanel west coast. Oh Shit. And then uh,

3286
03:23:43,250 --> 03:23:47,140
my favorite, uh, is pop that
pussy. That's a trend I see.

3287
03:23:47,230 --> 03:23:51,560
Oh that's the one my mom likes the
most of course. Is that what you think?

3288
03:23:51,820 --> 03:23:55,100
That's also a very socially
conscious song about,

3289
03:23:55,850 --> 03:23:59,690
about a victim of
prostitution. Not, Oh really?

3290
03:23:59,750 --> 03:24:03,260
Who in the end of the song she triumphs.
There you go.

3291
03:24:04,020 --> 03:24:06,880
And she pops that pussy,
the pimp and the end.

3292
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:13,130
That's what songs sad for the pimp.
I mean he was doing stupid shit.

3293
03:24:15,190 --> 03:24:19,370
Guerrilla pimp. He was being very
strong, too strong. Beat her.

3294
03:24:19,371 --> 03:24:20,750
And she ran away and he ran.

3295
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:23,750
He came across her like when I came
across bloods that Betty, yeah,

3296
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:27,860
I killed it with the nut here. He
really tried to fight. Let me mark.

3297
03:24:27,861 --> 03:24:31,400
That would be my, that'd be on my app and
be like, get the shot, get the shovel up.

3298
03:24:31,760 --> 03:24:34,880
Sang. I love it. You guys
are too short science course.

3299
03:24:35,180 --> 03:24:38,150
That was the best part of this whole
thing. It doesn't have super exciting

3300
03:24:39,790 --> 03:24:43,830
scary with those eyes
open like, oh yeah, yeah.

3301
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:48,270
There's people who like to wear that stuff
and then they wear harnesses and butt

3302
03:24:48,271 --> 03:24:51,840
plugs with like, you know, dog tails
on them. We make fun of that stuff.

3303
03:24:51,841 --> 03:24:56,100
Fuck what a dog. Yeah. Yeah. Most of
them have unicorn heads though. Yeah. No.

3304
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:59,370
Ask Your hose. I'm sure they can tell
you some stories. Some pup play stories.

3305
03:24:59,371 --> 03:25:03,120
Yeah. Yeah. Pony play. But this was
a thrill. Thank you guys very much.

short, short dog. Thanks for coming, man.
