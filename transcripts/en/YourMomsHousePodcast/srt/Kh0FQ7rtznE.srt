40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,890
we have so much to talk about. So much
to talk about. How much to get into gene.

41
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:09,100
So much to get into.
Gene,

42
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,150
let's do this.
Here we go.

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,180
Where is my phone?

44
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,283
Hey,

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,660
well we have time.

46
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,980
Hey,
here it is.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,820
Ah Huh. Take me out
African style. Here we go.

48
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,550
[inaudible]

49
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,580
oh is Randy.
Don't bring anyone in loving.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
Well go to your mom's house.

51
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,600
Someone didn't get the right
order there, Huh? Well, you know,

52
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:03,510
we've been talking about people who are
so rude when they make their phone calls

53
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:07,530
on speakerphone and public. Probably my
greatest pet peeve, it is mine to only,

54
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,270
I've, I've gotten a new one. I'm going to
tell you about in a minute here. It's a,

55
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,610
it's in my act now. It's
bothering me. It bothers me too.

56
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,550
But it proves,
I think a theory that we might be having,

57
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,090
that people that are doing their phone
calls in public on speakerphone are

58
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:25,920
either mentally ill or on drugs.
Um, do you know what's funny?

59
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,540
What you haven't seen? Obviously you
don't see these folders, even the files.

60
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,720
Right, right, right. Uh,

61
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,210
one of these clips of this lady
has called drugs or mentally. Yeah,

62
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,150
that's a new game. We're
gonna play on the shot. Yeah.

63
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,240
And I'm gonna have Dr drew come in
and then he's gonna verify from that.

64
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,610
I'm going to put this on the drew list
before we go even further on this.

65
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:48,760
I want to, don't forget what
your pet peeve is. Yeah. I
want to congratulate my, uh,

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,720
friend, uh, last week's
guest finesse Mitchell,

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,700
a an alum of the University
of Miami on his teams, nausea,

68
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:59,970
getting wind this past week. They
at the semen halls. I lost the bet.

69
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:03,300
So I'm wearing his shirt. I'm
wearing his shirt. Congratulations.

70
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,930
Finesse and congratulations
to the biggest piece of shit.

71
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,110
Fan Base in all of sports. The University
of Miami Hurricanes. Oh, you're, oh,

72
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,950
you're saying the fans or even pos,
they're the worst.

73
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,030
They're such garbage people. Seriously,
I've spent so much time down there.

74
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,130
I used to go to the orange bowl, their
animals to the biggest piece of this.

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,540
And now I don't know much about sports,
so I can't really,

76
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,850
but I've heard that Raiders
fans are pieces of shit too.

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,820
That probably be a fair thing to say
now I,

78
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,370
but only because their behavior is bad
from, that's what we're talking about.

79
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,200
Yeah. Okay. Well here's
the thing too about,

80
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,150
because I know you don't have 12 words.
Every,

81
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,190
every single fan base has garbage
people in it. Sure. Every single one.

82
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,230
And people when they,
people act like that,

83
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,200
their team doesn't and they're
full of shit. You know,

84
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:53,040
especially when you're talking about
a sizable fan base, right? I mean,

85
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,960
maybe if you're like, I, you know,

86
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:59,961
I go to the University of Northern Idaho
or some shit where there's like 800

87
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,550
people enrolled. Okay, maybe
you're fucking fan base doesn't.

88
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,370
But once you're talking about like a
national fan base, of course it has every,

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,210
you know,
you told me about tailgating parties.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,330
This is where people just get together
and drink and parking lots. Well,

91
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,140
of course you're going to act
like a holes. Some do, some
don't. I mean, I've been,

92
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,940
I've been in tailgates where people were
really decent and like welcoming and

93
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,910
nice. Um, sure. And look,

94
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,530
I mean some of my best friends
are Emmy graduates alarms.

95
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,400
Uh, I have friends, good friends that live
in Miami. It's not an anti Miami thing.

96
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:38,110
I'm just, first of all, I know you
do, it's a, it's a sports writer,

97
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,670
but you're supposed to talk shit about
your rivals was supposed to say that

98
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:45,320
they're garbage. Um, that was a
really good burp. I was pretty good.

99
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,220
Sound was good. It was crisp. Here's
the cheap thing that I did not,

100
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,130
I thought that was good burp.

101
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,160
The thing that was super lame
about sia talking shit about Miami.

102
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,510
I talked shit about them online after,
you know, on Twitter, just after the loss.

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,100
And they're like, I had people who
obviously don't know anything about me.

104
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:07,190
They were like, why don't you say
what you really mean? I was like,

105
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,120
what do I really mean?

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,740
And then they implied that
I'm talking shit about Miami,

107
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,790
calling them garbage people because
I'm racist. Like, oh, interesting.

108
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,820
One Guy and one guy implied that I
was racist against a Latino people.

109
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh, sure. Sigora yeah.

110
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,090
I didn't even have to answer him because
everybody just like your mom's Peruvian.

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,110
Yeah. People attacked him
for me. Stupid. It's just,

112
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,120
I think that's one of the cheapest,
laziest,

113
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,360
most idiotic takes on criticism
is that you can spin it to that.

114
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,280
It's like a cop out to, to
talking shit, Talk Shit.

115
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,170
But also I'll also say it right. It's
like, I know you guys are garbage people.

116
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:52,240
And then to be like you're saying
that because we're like Latin, it's a,

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,340
not only is it cheap and lazy and idiotic,

118
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,930
which are three traits you find very
often with Miami fans. Sure. But,

119
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,430
uh, it really takes, it
takes the banter out of it.

120
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,190
It takes all the fun away from talk
some shit. You know what it is?

121
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,050
It's because the social justice warriors,
uh,

122
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,890
they're just no fun and they're out
policing all the fun in the world. Uh,

123
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,410
these are the new puritans.

124
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,620
They want to make sure that whenever
there's a whiff of a fun and levity and

125
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:25,910
busting balls, we're going to stop all
that good time because it's an prout.

126
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
Bring it out.

127
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,210
They're the same thing in November,
dammit.

128
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,670
Also something in November about
gator fans because it's a rivalry.

129
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:37,270
You hate the gator fans.
That's the fun of sports.

130
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:41,060
You talk some shit.
Those gators I know nothing about.

131
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,860
I grew up around surrounded
by gator and hurricane fence,

132
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:48,560
so I talk shit about them because of shit.
That's the fun of sport.

133
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,990
Who's dumber?
The gator fans or the Miami hurricanes.

134
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,080
They're people.
There's just

135
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,660
garbage people. I mean, you know who's
worse a Mussolini or Hitler, you know?

136
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,440
It's like they're bad guys.
Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah.

137
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,430
Should be fun for you when you do your
shows in Miami. I have nothing lined up.

138
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,440
All right, so let's go.
No, but seriously, um,

139
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,210
there was, it was ridiculous game.
It was so crazy and a finesse.

140
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,450
I will say, obviously wearing a
shirt smells really good, by the way.

141
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,800
You got to smell this shirt.
I've never smelled that bad on finesse.

142
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:29,640
And we spent quite some time with him in
a very hot country and he never smelled

143
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,460
bad. Um, and also, congrats.

144
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,460
Don't forget finesses special.
The spirit told me, right?

145
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,220
The spirit told me to say comes
out October 19th. I'll cover 19th.

146
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,280
I saw him on Instagram. He's aboriginal
thing I'm going to do for him anyway.

147
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,030
What's that?

148
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,540
I think I'm going to have a promo
cut to the seminal war chant for him,

149
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:53,280
for his best idea. Just to
like get the word out. Sure.
You know what I mean? Sure.

150
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,800
Just to help them out.
Help the right people like his stuff.

151
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,000
So I'll just a dumb the denim,
I'll plug it for him. I'll,

152
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,810
I'll send this kit for him and
then that way you know, it'll be,

153
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,680
it's like a promo and black. Yeah. Um,
so this lady, do you want to talk? Wait,

154
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,610
tell me what you know.
Here's the deal guys.

155
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,970
This one's really horrifying.
I like, first of all,

156
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,820
I like where our fans are going.
I like where this show is going.

157
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:20,760
Every now and then we pick up a meme,
a swell,

158
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,920
and right now we're policing
asshole behavior in public.

159
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:28,020
And I think this is a
public service we're doing.

160
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,410
So I went to Bark Williams and I was
getting ready for my mass asage and they

161
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:38,280
encourage you to use their facilities,
right? You get your steam room,

162
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,820
you got your, your fucking Jacuzzi
full of disgusting coach Broth.

163
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,610
I won't even go in the fucking Jacuzzi,
get your life.

164
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,940
I saw a woman with really hanging
tits hanger than mine or Nay.

165
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,700
Like I w in there just baking. I
was like, no, I'm not doing that.

166
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,460
But I go on to the steam room
cause I can sit on a towel.

167
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:57,840
So it separates my vagina from
other people's Shit. Right? Yeah.

168
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,350
I'm in the steam room.
I look fucking over.

169
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,800
There is a woman with shaving cream and
a razor and this nasty bitch is shaving,

170
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,680
fully shaving her legs in the
steam room at and that's that.

171
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,610
It's right. What is she doing
with each? Like I'm users swipe,

172
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,810
flicking it onto the floor.
I'll know this isn't your house.

173
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,420
I cannot believe it. I was, I almost
vomited right there. I literally went,

174
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,740
Oh hell no. Like I saw her, I sat
down, I looked over, I went, Hell No.

175
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,250
And I got up and I told one of
the staff, I was like, dude,

176
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,200
there's a lady fully shaving her legs.

177
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,910
I don't know what she's
going to shave next.

178
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:46,650
Can somebody like educate
her on etiquette? This is
completely inappropriate.

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,580
Discuss. So I got to, I waited, dude,

180
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,380
like I'm fucking waited outside and I
waited for the manager to, Oh my God,

181
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,350
you guys are so disgusting. And I
waited for the manager and I was like,

182
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,490
are you gonna go talk to her right
now? Like, I got all excited. You know,

183
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:00,640
like I just told I tattle tale.
And then she came out and I was like,

184
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,570
how crazy is that woman? How
crazy is that? When she's
like, well, we get all kinds.

185
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,360
And I'm like, did you tell her?
She's like, yes, she's been,

186
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,080
she's been told not to do such as, I'm
like, yeah, it's nasty. It's so nasty.

187
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,110
Why would you even need someone to tell
you not to do that in a public steam

188
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:20,560
room? Flick your hair. It's so disgusting.

189
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Well now I'm totally turned off to using
any birth boys' facility or any spa

190
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,390
facility now cause I'm like,

191
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,540
oh imagine what this nasty persons
doing before you got there.

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,980
And then I had someone else tell me
their day. A acquaintance of mine go,

193
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,130
you know when I'm sick with
a cold or a sinus infection,

194
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,030
I go to Burke Williams and I use the
steam room and I feel better and I'll like

195
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:43,864
what?

196
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Well this way too that can see my germs
leave my mouth and my face and I watched

197
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:54,070
them enter other people and I can
ruin everyone else's week basically.

198
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,900
I was like,
get the fuck.

199
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,470
I mean you think you try not to think
about that stuff when you use spas,

200
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:04,260
like how many people are clean and
it's not, I know it's disgusting.

201
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,310
I'm going to a clean,
sterile, no sanitary, no safe,

202
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:13,860
relaxing, wonderful place. Now, how many
dudes are peeing in the Jacuzzi to oh,

203
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,050
every two piece in that she cozy or
jacks off in there and yeah. Yeah.

204
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,810
And there's a sign in the bathroom at
the spa that's like you have to shower

205
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,670
before you gave,
you take a shit.

206
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,830
Basically you have to shower
before you use the spar.

207
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,420
The facilities know who's doing
that. Nobody. Nobody being gross.

208
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,720
Everyone's being growth. We also have
that thing in those spots by the way,

209
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,780
where they'll go. Some of them will
be like, it's European style here.

210
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,860
And you're like, what that means?
Um, trunks are optional. Yeah.

211
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,450
But basically most American
dudes are like, no,

212
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:51,450
we're trunks. But then you'll see guys
who are like, they'll give you the,

213
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,950
the San Francisco,

214
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,400
the San Francisco treat eyes and
they'll let you know that like,

215
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,730
I'm not really in the trunks.
Are you? And they I bank serious.

216
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,880
They give you a signal and the Jacuzzi
or some no, that'll give you a signal.

217
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm just saying that there's
people that own it, you know,

218
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,410
it's like the guy that goes in the
steam room and, and does towel. I mean,

219
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:15,070
everyone would go in with a towel and
then there's the guy that opens the towel.

220
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,690
Like I just feel comfortable. Like I
just, I'm just comfortable like this.

221
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,980
And then there's the towel closed,
which is like, it's not necessary.

222
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:28,120
I wouldn't say it's necessarily
etiquette, but it's just, you know,

223
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,060
are you and wants you to see
what he's doing. Of course,

224
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,180
when he wants you to see now Europeans
don't give a rip obviously different

225
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,680
though here it's just more modest here.

226
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,970
Americans don't show their junk
unless they will not inviting you in.

227
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,840
Yeah. Or, or, I mean there's, there's
different guys that show their junk.

228
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,860
There's inviting you in.
There's truly, I don't care.

229
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,880
Like,

230
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,880
and you'll see it sometimes with
like a really disgusting body.

231
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,010
They'll give be like, yeah, I don't give
a shit. They're, you know, they're like,

232
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,230
everything's gross on the, which is the
most, I like the most, the one rating.

233
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,210
It's the most liberal.

234
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,210
It's actually the guy that has like zero
self conscious kind of shit going on

235
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,580
with them, which is great. Yeah. And then,

236
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,770
and then there's also the
proud buck where it's like, if,

237
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,370
if you're, you know,
six, five totally ripped.

238
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,730
You've got a 10 inch hawking. Yeah.
It's peacocking where it's like,

239
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,480
it's like they're not necessarily
inviting you there. Just being like,

240
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:33,050
I'm a specimen, so shit. Yeah. My
shits. Nice. Now what do you do?

241
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,800
I think I'm fair. I'm not like
hiding. Right. You know? Um,

242
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm fairly modest wear. Like
I don't, I don't, I mean, I,

243
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,480
I'm kind of like the guy
who's like, I'm gross. Yeah.

244
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,260
I know no one wants to see it,
but I'm aging so I'm getting more into,

245
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:55,970
I don't care.
So I kind of hide my body and everything,

246
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:00,620
but I'm also like, I'm fucking gross.
Yeah. I'm a dad. I'm, you know,

247
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:01,454
I'm like,
I don't know.

248
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,290
See, I think you and I are
the same way. And the spa,
because I'm kind of, I'm like,

249
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,840
yeah, two babies. This is
racks. This is all fun. Yeah.

250
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,170
Like I'm never going to be able to be
single again and beyond the market.

251
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,170
Like nobody's gonna,
no one's gonna want this.

252
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,180
So I wear a towel like in the steam
room or the song, like I'll, I'll,

253
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,140
I'll be naked under the towel and
then all kind of sit in the towel.

254
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,550
Maybe unraveling a little kind
of thing. But I'll go, you know,

255
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,640
before this last encounter, I
would go in the Jacuzzi nude. Yeah.

256
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,510
But you're quickly, quickly, like I'm,

257
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,890
you protect the robot
just quickly go in there.

258
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,890
Yeah. I mean know I've done it.
I've done it before. I wasn't like,

259
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,800
I dunno,
it wasn't a big,

260
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,380
you made a brown and then they know
there's brown probably all over the,

261
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,690
remind me, remind me of that.
Especially dudes. They're fucking nasty.

262
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:56,310
Dee Brown dudes who's are nasty,
nasty. Brown's. Yeah, I know.

263
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,780
So there was that nastiness and then,
um,

264
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,680
there's like a waiting area where you
go to the spa and then you wait for your

265
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:04,960
misuse to come out. And
they're like, Christina,

266
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,870
like they're supposed to kind of whisper
your name. It's very quiet environment.

267
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:12,760
Yeah. And next to me, I hear
this older couple, just like,

268
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,970
what time is our appointment? Like
full volume. Horrible too. That ruins,

269
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,060
ruins it. Yeah. And that's, I can excuse
that. Cause the wife did go, Oh shit,

270
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,560
I think this is the quiet waiting area.
And then the husband, he goes, oh okay.

271
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,360
And then he gets on his phone.
Yeah. Tick, tick, tick, tick,

272
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,630
tick, tick, tick, tick whoop.
I'm like are you fucking joking?

273
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:39,520
And then the phone rings and it's
extra loud cause he's, hello, hello.

274
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,890
And he's, it's extra loud cause they're
old as fuck. Yeah. And um, yeah.

275
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:48,030
And then the phone call,
we're at the spa like are you serious?

276
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,864
We're in the quiet,

277
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,750
we're in the quiet room,
the quiet room. God,

278
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,620
I know what is wrong with people
gets your life. He's just like,

279
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:02,490
you just want an assassin on board who
just watches it and immediately fills

280
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,500
those people.
Can I tell you,

281
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,880
cause I've been to the Gaylord
hotel and Hungary and Budapest,

282
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,881
which is like the most
premier beautiful spa and you,

283
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,250
you know, you get naked. Yes. You go
on the thermal baths and this and that.

284
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,750
You would never fucking see
like a Hungarian like Oh God,

285
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,530
I like talking rudely. It's just,
they don't do it. You will be will be.

286
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,440
Somebody would fucking slit your throat.
That's what I'm telling you.

287
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,440
There's no way dude, like this is a
perfect time. Like what this full clip is.

288
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,610
I love it.
In the context of this here,

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
this video was recording in a Starbucks
employee asked the woman has stopped

290
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,580
having her call on speaker phone.
She loses it.

291
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,490
Craig crazy hoof man,
this, this, this gets heat.

292
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,650
We just showed you a frat show.
Here's where it started. Kind of.

293
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,403
Oh my God.

294
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,410
First of all, the audacity to
sit and I've been in a, um,

295
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,000
before I had, we had, there was
somewhere we didn't have internet when,

296
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:14,120
I mean it was like more than a,
maybe we weren't even living together.

297
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:17,180
It was like there's areas in your
life where you don't have Internet for

298
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:21,750
whatever reason. I think it
was in Hollywood. He had no,
I don't even think of it.

299
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,613
We were dating,

300
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,160
I didn't have a computer and I
went to a Kinko's or old, you know,

301
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:32,390
old FedEx Kinko's, I'm sorry, where
they have the Fedex and they have the,

302
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
they had like the internet
room and a lady like,

303
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,330
and then we were all sitting at
computers doing different things.

304
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,200
This lady who was on answering the
phone like she was at the office,

305
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,230
like her office having full
fucking conversations and
you see everybody turning

306
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:52,310
around with their bitch. Are you out of
your mind? Like this isn't your sweet,

307
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,500
it's just a public space. No, this is
her world. She's the, her Starbucks.

308
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,423
Oh Shit.

309
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,650
This may, she may not
be stable. I'm thinking,

310
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,860
I'm thinking anybody that
makes phone calls on speaker
phone in public, isn't it?

311
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,300
Look at this woman here,
not even looking at

312
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,340
gives the first time anyone's
told her to hang up the phone

313
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,730
or do you think this is something
that happens every day in her life

314
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,473
time.

315
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,830
She goes here, take your shit and leave.
Go get the forgotten you. Help you out.

316
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,271
You know?

317
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:20,060
I know Starbucks has this policy where
they call Starbucks your third place.

318
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,400
You got your home, you've
got your, what does it work?

319
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,170
And then Starbucks is your third place.

320
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,190
I think they should really discontinue
this logic of like come and hang out for

321
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:32,050
hours and surfing and do your fucking
office work here and waste to be like you.

322
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,660
You can come here to have a
drink and take your shit. Shit.

323
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,100
That's all we're here to do.

324
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,000
Take away all of this extra desk
space and put more toilets in.

325
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,790
They should change.
Let's just say we're not your third home,

326
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,020
but you can shit here. That should be
the well, cause that's a flaw of mania.

327
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:48,831
Starbucks is,

328
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:53,780
there's often just one toilet for
the entire is Starbucks lately.

329
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:57,080
It's inhumane.
It's wrong.

330
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:01,190
We're giving you [inaudible] juice and
we're giving it to all of you and we make

331
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:05,540
one too. Cups of bowel torture and
they're like, Nah, go shit somewhere else.

332
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,090
It's completely wrong. It's completely
wrong. Completely wrong. I know

333
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,150
I got it.

334
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,890
Yeah, lock it up. Good. Good idea

335
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,240
about things like this. No. Aftermath,

336
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,440
like not knowing what happened.
What happened next in the cops come,

337
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,620
she come back and throw a
fucking brick through the door.

338
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,430
Like what happened that
somebody that's worked?

339
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,190
I've worked a lot with the
public. I've had many, many jobs.

340
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:49,520
I've worked at Starbucks and the summer
of [inaudible] 97 we've gone over this.

341
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,690
The point is,
and I've waitressed many times,

342
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,510
there's like once a day there's
something like this. It happens.

343
00:22:56,511 --> 00:23:00,740
Some person freaks out or if gets crazy,
the manager comes out, throws them out.

344
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,320
They might yell back at
you a few more times.

345
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:06,230
They might throw something
Majia and usually that's it.

346
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,430
And by the time the cops come,

347
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,590
they've they're long gone or maybe they
get a talking to from the cops. Yeah.

348
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,620
I mean there was a guy that jerked off
every day next to the retail store.

349
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,180
I worked out on Melrose every day.

350
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,190
We called the cops on him every day
and he'd show up in jerk off every day.

351
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,520
The cops would come every,
it was like this routine.

352
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,690
She's like a working professional
though. You know this lady. Scary, Huh?

353
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,820
Kind of job is, she's not like
a vagrant, you know. No, no, no.

354
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:34,070
A lot of times it's not vagrants.
It can be,

355
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,020
but just people who are just having
a day, she's having a day, who knows?

356
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,310
She's having a drag. Good
day could be like, you know,
we said it could be the dog,

357
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,980
could be as little guys. Yeah.
She's off her meds. Um, by the way,

358
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,310
it's October 9th when we
record this right now.

359
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,300
How's your a sober October cause there
were October. Um, well, you know,

360
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,980
silver October affects people differently
and there's different challenges for

361
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,070
different people. Yeah. Um,
I mean, let's go through it.

362
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,680
Well for like for instance,
and by the way,

363
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:08,681
I highly encourage anybody to take part
in this in whatever capacity they want

364
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:13,220
to take part in. It's just
a great exercise. Meaning
like some people go like,

365
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,870
I just want to give up drinking for the
month, but I don't want to do that. Uh,

366
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:21,600
or some people go like, I'm just
going to not smoke pot. Just do that.

367
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,790
There's no set of rules.
The rules are yours to make.

368
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:31,060
I just think it's good sometimes in life
to engage in an exercise of discipline.

369
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,770
This is your lent, so to speak. It's
sort of our law and it's just, it's good.

370
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,900
It's like, hey man, once a year,

371
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,930
it's something to mentally focus on and
there's just rewards mostly for yourself

372
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:49,130
to see what you're capable of,
you know? So for me, for instance,

373
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,160
I'd be lying if I said the sobriety part.

374
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,950
Was it challenged because I'm just
not a big drinking drug guy. Right.

375
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,300
I mean, I enjoy them, I
enjoy it, but I enjoy it.

376
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:07,110
Usually in mild doses.
Right. You know, like I'll,

377
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,150
I'll sometimes go two weeks without
anything without thinking or trying.

378
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,470
When I was pregnant,

379
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,950
I don't think you drank alcohol once
and that wasn't just because I wasn't

380
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:21,110
taking around you rank but see
dinners. Yeah, stuff like that. I mean,

381
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:24,560
on the road, honestly,
I'm usually, I'll pick,

382
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,970
if I'm doing a three nights out, I'll
have drinks, maybe one night get wrapped.

383
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,670
I just drank like normally what?
What's your, if it's at dinner,

384
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,240
if it's at dinner and like the night's
over, there's nothing, you know,

385
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:42,410
it's not pregames done.
Depends if sometimes you want,

386
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,940
I like wine with dinner. Red
Or white usually read. Um,

387
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,830
peanut, peanut, peanut.
Sometimes. Sometimes if it's
like a steak, I'll have a cab.

388
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,700
Sometimes I'll do a mall
Beck. Sometimes I'll do, yeah.

389
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,620
Pinot noir. But yeah, I
like wine with dinners. Um,

390
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,780
sometimes if I'm like, ah man, just
nice as weekends over I'll have bourbon.

391
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,890
Oh shit son. But I do, I'm saying it's
not, it's not that frequent, you know,

392
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,270
I just don't have the, I like, I like
beer with Sushi. That's outstanding. Yeah,

393
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,120
it's kind of rough. The older
you get. I just farting, I dunno.

394
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,710
And then as far as getting
high, I like weed, but I like,

395
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,770
I've discovered over life now
that I just like mild doses.

396
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,090
I like being able to function
and not have like paranoia.

397
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,910
And for me that means getting
paranoid well for me. Yeah.

398
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,710
I think that I have a low tolerance.
Like I've just, I know that I do.

399
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,030
So for me it's like,

400
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,990
it's not a fun endeavor if I go
over the line because then I'm like,

401
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,100
I just gotta get in my room
and cry alone so can, yeah.

402
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:54,120
So I like a mild dose, so I'm saying
the challenge for me isn't that part.

403
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,890
I work out separate from,
so Rocktober regularly.

404
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,190
Every week I do a couple of sessions with
the trainer. I do some stuff at home,

405
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,330
but so far we're on the ninth year.
I've worked out every day.

406
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,250
You're doing no days off, like on three
days off. You bragging about that.

407
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:14,340
Why aren't you bragging about
your new date? I'm doing so far.

408
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,670
On six of the nine days I
did two workouts a day. Yeah.

409
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,370
So that is the,
for me,

410
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:24,330
the fun or the challenge and the
part that's rewarding is to go,

411
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:28,260
can you actually do that?
Can you work out every day for a month?

412
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,690
Because that's a departure for me.
That's not something I would normally do,

413
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,000
you know? Right. For me, a busy,

414
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,380
like a heavy workout week
would be definitely probably
five days. So I'd be like,

415
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,980
Holy Shit, I worked out five days this
week. I'm doing every day right now.

416
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,530
It's a lot. Here's the
current standings. Got Ahead.

417
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,570
Now this changes and this
is just standings according
to our point system that

418
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:53,250
this app awards us.
Um, for people curious,

419
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,810
it's the Maya zone APP.

420
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,870
It's a attached to a heart monitor and
it basically gives you points based on

421
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:05,610
the percentage of your Max.
That's basically like a cardio reward.

422
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,370
As of right now,
as we're recording this,

423
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:12,210
I'm in first guide for you have
gene Ari's in second. Okay.

424
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,700
Burnt is in third and Joe's in fourth now.
Well I'll tell you,

425
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,800
this is like, he's gonna make that
shit up today. He could make up today.

426
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,310
He is annoyed by basically the fact that
I got this thing at the gym and that's

427
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,000
why I suggested it to these guys.

428
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,780
And when you go to the gym and you see
your points and you want to move up,

429
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,680
you work out to get your points.
Well,

430
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,470
the sort of shortcut,
it's not really a shortcut,

431
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,140
but the thing we figured out is that well,

432
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,530
you can just get your heart
rate up by doing cardio,

433
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,560
like elliptical bike ride.

434
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,980
And it wasn't the intent.
The intention originally was go workout,

435
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,790
get your points to rate a workout,
meaning cheat you guys. Well,

436
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,120
you know,

437
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,490
you still have to put in the time and
you still have to get your heart rate up,

438
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,200
but it just seems like a, a way
to get points. So he's like,

439
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:13,860
whatever. I'm, he's like,
you know, I could smash. Like
I said, we were like, yeah,

440
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,750
he was, um, you know,

441
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:20,751
he was like doing two hours of
cardio when we started this.

442
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,320
He was like, this is just
easy. Like I, it's not,

443
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,900
I'm just annoyed at how much time I'm
having to put in doing this time consumer.

444
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,150
So I think what, what, what
he's going to end up doing,

445
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:31,040
because we've talked about it,

446
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:35,730
is that he'll just go back to doing his
regular workout and get his points that

447
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:39,750
way. And then, because he basically
just wants to work out like that.

448
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,250
And we will do whatever we can

449
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,800
to be in points.
By the way,

450
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:47,650
we're all very close when I
just did that order there.

451
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,530
It's all within a couple of
hundred points of each other. Well,

452
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:51,970
Joe works out a lot.

453
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:56,770
He normally normal normal routine
is five days a week. Oh my goodness.

454
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,830
All of those five days, uh, I dunno.
Most of them are like brutal, intense.

455
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,370
I've seen it. Yeah. But he doesn't do no
days off. Now that's a special kind of,

456
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,240
yeah, no lunacy. No days off.
People really hurt themselves. Uh,

457
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,810
this is, this is no days off, no days off.

458
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,670
Oh, Jesus Christ. Last Day of
shooting skyscraper here in Vancouver.

459
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:22,880
It's been an incredible experience of
this city. It's the Rock, by the way.

460
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,800
Thank you so much for
opening your home to me.

461
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,240
Treating me like your one of your sons.

462
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,280
This is his, uh, traveling Jim. Oh Man.
This is his gym. He goes to every set.

463
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,090
The anchors that makes the experience
so special is every morning at 5:00 AM I

464
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:39,810
get up and I come here to my high on
paradise. This is my traveling carnival.

465
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:40,770
The traveling circus.

466
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,320
There's only 40,000 pounds of twisted
steel sex appeal and heartache.

467
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,163
A lot of harvest.

468
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,170
Mainly my own message of gratitude to
the small group who sets this gym up.

469
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,480
Every location I go to the next location
will be Hawaii when we shoot jungle

470
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:57,000
cruise. But this is a lot of
shit to move around and stuff.

471
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,100
Plus I'm a pain in the
ass because I'm like,

472
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:02,430
the energies has got to flow this way
and you can't keep your head that way.

473
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,240
Big Pain in the ass for guys.
Thank you so much. It's my anchor.

474
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,020
Plus traveling in a gym
like this eliminates all the
bullshit excuses not to get

475
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:13,140
the job done and get to work and so
I think you the studios. Thank you.

476
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,750
You guys are the best. My anchor.
Much love. Thank you guys.

477
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,290
You know what I liked about
a Miami graduate? Oh Wow.

478
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,760
You know what I like is that
he's got those rhymes down. Yeah.

479
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:26,470
That people have in the gen like teamwork
makes the dream work or whatever.

480
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,800
Like yeah, yeah. He's got his rhymes
down. Madeline's steel. Keeps it real.

481
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,390
That's right. You got a pump. If you
don't want to be a dump or wa he's got it.

482
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,760
He's got the right.
It's definitely got it.

483
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,960
So for those of you who aren't
watching the show on Youtube,

484
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:41,360

485

can also watch us on, uh, we stream it on,

486
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:49,020

Which we do at switch. Um,

487
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,110
we do a twitch now on Wednesdays.

488
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,430
It's usually like around five
twitch.tv/your mom's house podcast.

489
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,020
And then a few hours later it's
on youtube, but on the twitch,

490
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,100
on the twitcher. And when you switch
with us, you can watch it with us.

491
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,140
We jump in and jump in. Yes, I'm Dj Dad
Mouth One. I'm queen genes one. Yeah.

492
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,310
And we'll be laying in bed and I'm
in the Blue Band will notify us. Oh,

493
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:14,570
you're going up and
then we'll come say hi.

494
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,320
So also totally did not want not watching.
That was the rock.

495
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,000
And he travels with a gym. I, it's
a full gym. It's, it's like a gym.

496
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:27,110
You would get a membership to. It's not
like, oh, you one or two or three things,

497
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,030
a 40,000 pound gem. I mean, that's
bananas. That's his life, man.

498
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,600
He's the biggest movie star in the world
too. He certainly is. And He, you know,

499
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,500
he's also a former wrestler,
right? What is it? What is
he? Yeah, yeah, he was time.

500
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,700
So he's got to keep that shit up. He's
completely fucking yoked. It's crazy.

501
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:46,760
A mess. No days off, no
days off. No days off.

502
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,800
I have to tell the most disgusting thing
that's happened to us where you work

503
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:55,220
out or the elliptical
machine is in our home. Uh,

504
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,590
I come to find out there's been a little
friend who's living in our AC unit.

505
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,310
Yeah. There's a, there's a
separate a sea, it's like a wall.

506
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,050
It's a wall thing that has its own,
um,

507
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,370
condenser outside of the house.

508
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,230
And it's just for this room because the
room was an add on to the house. Yeah.

509
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,710
So we'd been smelling something
I think for like a week,

510
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:22,490
maybe kind of in denial, like, oh wow,
that's a smell. That's interesting.

511
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,400
And then uh,
yeah,

512
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,000
come to find that there's little
droppings around the AC unit.

513
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,290
Little shredding of stuff

514
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,720
like chewed up bits of air conditioning
falling out of the air conditioning unit.

515
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,203
And uh,

516
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,400
turns out we've got a little rat just
eating through the wire is living.

517
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:47,280
What we did was cocked up
every motherfucking hall.

518
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,430
Now it's fucking dead in there.
And also it smells much worse.

519
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,983
Well here's the thing,

520
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,070
here's the cool thing we have to
replace absolutely everything course.

521
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:02,190
It's at fortune tire unit, a whole new
condenser. It's really fucking hard.

522
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,690
That's all you do is the joy
of home ownership. So yeah.

523
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,410
Well first fucking so I'm, I wake
up at, you know, six in the morning,

524
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,230
find that this rat is in there.
First thing I do, cause you're,

525
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,830
you're not in town yet. I text our
rat guy because we have a rat guy.

526
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:20,831
Cause we live in an area where there's
lots of shit and he shows up an hour

527
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,800
later and he and I go around with
the cocking gun and just seal it up.

528
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,940
He puts poison and the AC unit did all,
there's so much poison in there.

529
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,950
If that thing's not dead by now, that's
like a bionic rat. I mean he just,

530
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,880
he loaded it. He broke it up into
pieces and if I can throw it,

531
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:40,070
I mean we killed that fucker.

532
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,450
I can't wait to see it's fucking carcass
to nasty rat is going to be really fell

533
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,660
by the time you see it.
Thank God it's not so hot.

534
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,310
I was kinda worried if it was old.

535
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,050
I think it's going to stick to this.
Dear Tom.

536
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,590
I tried to see if my wife was ride or
die chick. She is not without blinking.

537
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:00,920
She said she would turn it in
to protect our kids. So I girl,

538
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,720
what if our son committed the murder?

539
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,400
I saw her eyes start to twitch and her
brain fucking exploded cause she said she

540
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:09,650
would help cover it up.
What the fuck?

541
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,750
She said she would still
turn me in immediately,

542
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,950
but no way in hell she would turn it on.
This is your wife as terrible as mine.

543
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:20,540
Jared, I think you have your
answer already. I kind of agree.

544
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:21,760
I kind of,
why don't you think?

545
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,670
Why wouldn't he tries to
kill his mother is very rare.

546
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,640
How many serial killers killed her
mommy's? I know they need their moms,

547
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:33,110
but how it happens for sure.
Listen, to protect your child,

548
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:36,830
I would do anything. I
really would. You're an awful
person. I would protect him.

549
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,040
Awful.
Both of them.

550
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,150
Hey Todd and Krista,

551
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,480
last night I had a very strange
dream that I met Tom in the airport.

552
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,470
I was very excited to meet my favorite
comedian whenever said, hey Tom,

553
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:47,730
just wanting, you know, I'm a big fan.

554
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,330
Tom and sat down in a chair next to me
and asked me to sit down in the chair

555
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:54,060
beside me. He's put his arm around and
show up my shoulder and simply said,

556
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,990
go fuck yourself buddy. It sounds about
right. Quickly stood up, walked off.

557
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,850
My question is, are you as huge a
dickhead in real life? Thomas also,

558
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,930
have either of you had strange dreams
recently? Keep those jeans high and tight.

559
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,120
Bird is as fat as he is.
Racist. Austin. I like,

560
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,470
I love this new racist to me with his
comments are full of them and there's

561
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:18,600
basically every other person is
what did he do? What did he say?

562
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,010
Ah, it's so fun. So much
fun. First of all. No,

563
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:29,850
I'm a sweetheart. You can ask anybody
that walks up to me in public anywhere.

564
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,920
I always take time. I always talk.
Yeah. I always do pictures, whatever.

565
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,620
Anybody wants to sign anything.
Um,

566
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,630
but I do think your dream
is highly amusing and I love
that I was a shit deck to

567
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:45,320
you and your dream, but in real
life it wouldn't go like that. No,

568
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:49,020
you wouldn't do that. No. Hell No. I
could see you being a bigger deck. Yes.

569
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,890
The fuck out of here. I am so nice to
people when I meet them. Are you crazy?

570
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,070
Really? I am so nice to any,
if anyone goes, hey mommy,

571
00:36:57,071 --> 00:37:01,150
and I'm out in public or yeah, I'm so
thankful anybody even listens to our,

572
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,880
our nonsense. Are you kidding me? No,

573
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:08,410
I'm never have any crazy dreams lately
without them. Yeah, you have. Well,

574
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,120
I'll tell you one weird.
I don't know if I mentioned this the,

575
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:14,440
the night that Anthony Bordain died,
I dropped about him.

576
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,730
You told me that already.
Yeah.

577
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,700
I don't know if I told him on the show
and this is before I heard about it.

578
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:23,050
I'm saying simultaneously as
he was in France, you know,

579
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:27,670
and I woke up, I just dreamt about him
and my friend texted me that he had died.

580
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:31,840
I was like, well that's Kinda,
that's a crazy one. Why?
What is this a setup for? No,

581
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:33,800
no, no. That person just said
they had a crazy dream. They ass.

582
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,490
I always have crazy dreams. What
I'm saying? You always do. Yeah.

583
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,440
What I dreamt about something I dreamt
about tailgating and I woke up thinking

584
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,950
how stupid it was. The
people do this thing. Yeah. I
don't like tailgating. Yeah.

585
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:45,770
I jumped about,
yeah.

586
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:50,470
I don't like crowds. All right. Um,

587
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,410
one here before we got to take it.
We have a guest. We have two guests.

588
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,890
Okay. We have to, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

589
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,290
There's a few topics I want to get to
before we break because they're very

590
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,050
important.

591
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,570
Uh, hello shitless. I got a little
insight into the be whole munching.

592
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:07,080
My old lady always wants to eat this
grim and I always say no, Jesus,

593
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,100
I'm not a prude. And I do actually
quite enjoy it just like the gays,

594
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,620
but couldn't figure out
why I didn't want her to.

595
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,690
So with some long hard thought while
Browning I came to the conclusion that I

596
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:23,640
respected her too much as my
wife. Yeah. No, she's a dirty Ho.

597
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,730
I don't need her to spread
open the swamp for my pleasure.

598
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,140
She has no fucking idea what
she's getting into. Thanks.

599
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,760
I love you guys.

600
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,360
Isaac.
Yeah.

601
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,340
Cause he and loves his wife and would
never want to subject her to the horrors

602
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:44,300
of his Biehle piss on me. Beat me. Try it
out. Try it out. Yeah. What does it fit?

603
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,890
It's a foreign. Yeah. I don't,
I don't feel that way. I um, no,

604
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,240
you're just mean.
Not Mean I'm making a request.

605
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,590
You take advantage of my admiration
of you. I love you. I admire you.

606
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,970
Yeah. Like FIFO admires, get
in there. No, get in there.

607
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:05,200
Can I bring up one topic before we break
very quickly. Very important by the way,

608
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,910
that's important. Yeah. Okay.

609
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,130
So Tom and I are about to celebrate
our 10 year wedding anniversary.

610
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:15,460
Come November 8th that's isn't that crazy.
10 years already.

611
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,000
I knew Yaz Anus and,

612
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,150
but we've been together 14 cause
we dated for four. That's right.

613
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,240
And the other night you go,
hey,

614
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:29,320
I wonder how many farts
we've had together. How many,

615
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,730
how many fights have we shared as a
couple over the course of 14 years? Yeah.

616
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,590
And I thought what an interesting topic.
We should save it for the show.

617
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,940
Clearly our listeners would be very
curious to know, let's do the math.

618
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,070
How many times do you def,
here's your farting.

619
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,350
I'm going to do you're farting
average. I'm gonna calculate. Okay,

620
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,840
I'll pull up the calculator here. Okay.
You fart every morning. Every morning.

621
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,360
And I fought every morning too.
So let's rack up.

622
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:01,780
It's one in the morning and then you
definitely do a nighttime fort where you,

623
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,810
oh no. Yeah, there's a foreign in
bed. There's a Fart when you pee. Oh,

624
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,450
he's always talking about how many times
did we fart in front of each other in

625
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:11,440
14 years. Yeah. But in front of you? Yes.
That we participated in each other for,

626
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,970
I would say let's go
through your daily for,

627
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,990
I would say that like on average there's
probably a just woke up fart and far

628
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,470
that you do.
Right.

629
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,730
So then maybe like I would say
like two in the bedroom area,

630
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,990
maybe one in the kitchen. And this
is, are we still in the morning? Yeah,

631
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,780
we're still in the morning.
Coffee break. Yeah. Yeah.

632
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,720
You fart at breakfast and then I would
say there's a mid day fart for sure.

633
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,900
And then the lunch for the,
again,

634
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,740
I would say a two day is
probably on average. Okay.
Let me go through my morning.

635
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,590
Okay. So I started in the morning and
there's a morning for when I get up.

636
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,490
There might be a fart slips out
as I'm browning or peeing. Okay.

637
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,210
There's definitely, if we're
together, it's an after lunch fart.

638
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,470
Yeah. Especially on this Paleo Diet. Yeah.

639
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:14,760
And then I'm going to go for like an
in bed or watching our bravo. Sure.

640
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,970
You'd ever,
they don't hold back there.

641
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,450
I'm going to go for like half year daily
war ever time at four. You're at eight.

642
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,190
Let's do the math on that please.
Okay.

643
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,470
365 but we're not together through
65 but we're just going to act.

644
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,410
What's average?
What's,

645
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:30,740
what's a three 60 let's say doctor.
I would say the date.

646
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,070
Sorry, 350300300 days a year. But

647
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,060
let's say it together. Okay,
let's, let's do that. So,
okay, well that's easy for you.

648
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,740
So that's 1200 parts a year for you.

649
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,880
And then 14 years.

650
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:48,260
16,804 yeah. Wait a
minute. Wait, hunt. Well,

651
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,160
I'm 1200 a year of farts. And then
what are you, you're double that.

652
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,720
You're 2,400 yeah. Okay. So
this is a yearly you fart.

653
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,600
This is how many times I've
probably far right? Yeah.

654
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,480
33,600

655
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,350
Oh,
did you?

656
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,980
Okay. So you did 2,400 times
14 yeah. And that's how much?

657
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:14,660
33,600 and what's mine?
I'm half of that.

658
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,740
Yeah, right. Yeah. Well,

659
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,200
it's half of that 16,800
I farted in front of you.

660
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:26,230
Approximately 16 can we redo our vows
and then incorporate this knowledge into

661
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:32,450
our wedding vows? It's very
possible. It's a lot of farts.

662
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,613
A lot of farms.

663
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:34,883
Yes.

664
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,650
Can you believe there are couples who
don't Fart in front of me? General.

665
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:40,240
We're just talking to somebody about it.

666
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,670
Just talking to somebody who's in a
similar, I mean, two kids married. Yeah.

667
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,760
And he was like, no. And I go, well
yeah, I just hold it and yeah. And I,

668
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,380
and he's like, it's happened. But then
we asked like, what about your wife?

669
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:55,270
He's like, never, not once,

670
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,630
but think of all the fun you're missing
out on if you're not farting in front of

671
00:42:58,631 --> 00:43:00,310
each other. Yeah. But maybe,

672
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,460
maybe because of that they're eating
each other's scrum or something. No,

673
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,290
they're not.
You don't know what about burps?

674
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,950
That's the next tally we got to
go to. Yeah. But he's real decent.

675
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:12,900
You can tell he's way more mattered.
Yeah. He's real deep. Yeah. He,

676
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,640
he saw Hamilton and he likes Hamilton.

677
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,120
I'll never fucking see that dumb
shit rapping, you know, like rap.

678
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:24,350
Like let's go get our guests are
our first yet got to get this going.

679
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,630
Okay, Mommy. Okay. Now
joining us is somebody who,

680
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:33,280
if you saw me last year
on the, uh, the no teeth,

681
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:38,260
no entry tour and a number of cities,
this young fine young man was with me.

682
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,570
Um, to a lot of those, you saw
me a tape to special in Denver.

683
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,270
This young man was with me,
young man and a,

684
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,280
if you saw me in New Orleans
or most recently in Eugene,

685
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,060
Boise and Sacramento this past weekend,

686
00:43:55,061 --> 00:44:00,061
this was the opener who were very happy
to say we'll also be helping us a lot

687
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:05,260
more on the podcast with some
production stuff. And uh,

688
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,990
he's just an absolutely hilarious
guy. It's Josh pottery. Hey Josh.

689
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,030
Oh,
she was

690
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,500
such a good song.
This part's redundant by the way.

691
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,360
Oh yeah. She was.

692
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,110
Oh,

693
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,450
what course are getting muddied by the
whole damage once you do find Derek,

694
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,880
how you doing? Hey, that shit true.

695
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,290
It sounds like you've been
really analyzing the song.
Well, mudded is a gang. Bang.

696
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,840
I didn't know. I didn't know
that either. Yeah, it's an
other songs too. Really? Yes.

697
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,760
Little Troy talks about mountain
girls. Wow. Yeah. So you can't,

698
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,770
you can't Mutt a woman without
the whole damn crew. Right.

699
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,760
For those of you wondering why do
they have Josh around? There you go.

700
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,630
That's exactly why we bring Joshua. It's
redundant. Yeah, I heard you saying,

701
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,503
is it

702
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:17,250
t e d o Oh, interesting.
Another layer. Not mud and like,

703
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,880
no, I, that's what I thought too.
I was like, oh, it's anal sex.

704
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,120
But no,

705
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,680
when I was in Florida as a kid was just
a big tires driving through the mud.

706
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:32,590
Like you want to go mud and go Medan yeah.
That's also like hog in or what?

707
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,710
I'll pick up like a gross.

708
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,730
Uh, but this is, so you're
telling us it's mutton. Mutton.

709
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,930
We might ease go mutton with the cause.

710
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,160
I don't know what it was either. At
first. I want people to know how we met.

711
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,600
I think like they're owed a little
backstory. I met Josh in Buffalo,

712
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,610
Buffalo in Buffalo doing uh,
a club week,

713
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,810
a few years ago, and then we
did a bunch of gigs sense. Um,

714
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,180
you were on the radio there too?
I was.

715
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,420
And so you know a lot about these mics
if you don't have a lot of talking to him

716
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:15,550
and stuff. The tall, that's deep,
bro. We did an episode of that deeper.

717
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,320
That's right. Yup.
Right when I moved here,

718
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,320
that was like three weeks into living
here. Oh my God. How nervous were you?

719
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,190
Big Time. Nervous to let to live
somewhere new. But now you're here.

720
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,280
So how's it been? It's been like a,
has it been a year? It's been a year.

721
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,570
A little over a year. And how has
your experience been? It's been quick.

722
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,410
It went by way faster than I thought
it would go. Yeah. You took the leap,

723
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,610
take the leap. You took the leap. Yeah.
It's been a lot of back and forth.

724
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:45,720
Ups and downs, the whole
roller coaster. I'm not mutton.

725
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,250
We almost, we almost muddy this weekend,
Bro. We talking about right. That's why,

726
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,360
that's why I go on the road.
What's up with that sex life?

727
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,330
Are you getting your stick wet?
Not In la, no, not yet. Yeah.

728
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,520
Fenny any seventh for crew
ladies are out there. We'll stop.

729
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,310
I live on the first
floor I lived on first.

730
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,270
What is your Twitter handle
at j underscore potter?

731
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,390
Will you take or do you accept
nudes? Fuck yeah. Okay. Okay.

732
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,680
Checking. I think a regular, um,

733
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,370
nude recap. I think a nude and a sex
report on how your sex life. Well,

734
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,240
I don't want people to think if they send
me nudes that I'm going to expose them.

735
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,090
No, of course not. No. No. So you
send me nudes and you'll have full,

736
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,500
you know, discrepancy,
confidentiality, confidentiality.

737
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:39,160
That's the word I was looking for. That's
right. Yeah. And I don't send Dick Pics.

738
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,630
There you go. No, I don't know.
I do if I get requested them.

739
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,460
But you have to send five
first five nudes first. Jesus.

740
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,950
How is this going?
How does fee,

741
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,140
if you aren't worried about their
dicks ending up on the Internet,

742
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,280
like you're not afraid.

743
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,310
Like one day you become like a
huge comedian and they're like, oh,

744
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:01,420
here's Josh potters cock back in 2000
part of my brand could be part of your

745
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:04,350
brow. I'm the Dick Guy. So now I would,

746
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,830
cause I was never the single guy out
there on the road. Do you ever, I mean,

747
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,880
sometimes you know, we'll,
we'll do our shows. We part
ways. I'll be like, all right.

748
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,000
I mean,
do you ever go out there and you know,

749
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,310
try to hit the bar that people
might've been at? I wish, I mean, I go,

750
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,540
it's so weird when you're
alone in a place I don't have,

751
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,960
like, I don't put off good
vibes being alone in a bar.

752
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,780
So it's really difficult to, you
know, like who's coming up to me?

753
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,850
So when you're in a city all
alone, it gets weird. I don't know.

754
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,990
It's not feel lazy,
you know what I mean?

755
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:42,070
Just thinking about it probably is better.

756
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:47,050
Even though the statistically the
numbers are less, probably is better.

757
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,530
You better odds at Club after
club clubs are insurmountable.

758
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,000
Easier to music though, because your
intimate days. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

759
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,300
you're drinking in the lobby after
they're like, you can run right into them,

760
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:02,410
right. Theaters. You're like,
you kind of, it's really,

761
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,770
it's like the Gazelle are all
in the lobby in the bar area.

762
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,550
And if it's like a Friday, you could be
like, Hey, I'm got two more tomorrow.

763
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:14,440
Can we drink or something, you know? Oh,
right. You can hit them up multiple days.

764
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,300
So have you been,
are you a somebody that scores on road?

765
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,050
We go, I wish, I mean, I,

766
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,060
it's not for lack of effort. Uh,
I just haven't, there are times,

767
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:31,780
I mean, don't get me wrong, the only time
I've ever gotten laid was from comedy.

768
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,170
I didn't lose my virginity until I
started doing comedy. That's hilarious.

769
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,490
Isn't that wild? Like a killer? Like
how long ago was this by the way?

770
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,420
I was 22 when I lost my for, yeah.
Now he's like, after the Eugene,

771
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:49,570
you're 20, you're 22 and j like a
really good set that night. Um, no,

772
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:52,510
it was, I had to lay the
groundwork like I always do.

773
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,700
They probably had to see multiple sets,

774
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,620
really get a feeling for how
I was not on stage too. So,

775
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,410
but crushing in front of a
girl is like my favorite thing.

776
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,790
That's got to be great. It is dude.
It's the best. So is it the best?

777
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:10,560
What's the best? Is the best if you
kind of meet someone before and,

778
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,950
and you have no, no, that's the worst. No,
I'm saying, and then you blow him away.

779
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,170
Is that you at that it depends.

780
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:20,620
I mean if you meet someone before they
have preconceived notions about you and

781
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:25,090
then if you have a set where
you're talking about wild
shit, they're like, Ooh,

782
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,460
you know, they might get kind of
freaked out by the best scenario

783
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,800
is just killer set. Meet somebody. Yes.

784
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,500
And then they come up to you afterwards
and they're like, you were really funny.

785
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:37,880
And like, hi, Tom z did a girl,

786
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,180
Josh, I saw you up there and
you're really funny. We'll assess.

787
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,220
What are you doing later?
What's up? Uh, nothing. Uh, my,

788
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,740
I left my panties in my car. Oh really?
Let's go. See we're going to find

789
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,260
now she'd have like drunk girlfriends
and stuff too. Yeah. Oh definitely.

790
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,730
He's probably had, she's like,
have you had like the uh,

791
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:02,420
the deal got fucking
sidetracked by the Bachelorette?

792
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,390
Yeah. Sometimes. Well also
like Tiffany, no, he's crazy.

793
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,490
Obviously you went last time
when you and I do shows together,

794
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:14,290
it's a different vibe than like say if
I did a show with a single comic, right.

795
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,140
Whose only purpose is like
I got to get laid to yes.

796
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,000
And then I'm usually the guy that has
to play the defense for those friends.

797
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:22,780
You know,

798
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,780
he picks the target and then I'm the
one who like taking out the bogeys,

799
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:32,050
you know, that feels like it's a
skill though in and of itself, right?

800
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,390
I guess so. I mean, you
just have to distract them.

801
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,030
You really just have to lower your,
your own standards for yourself.

802
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:43,270
And he's not in terms of like the like
how they are just like in terms of like

803
00:51:43,271 --> 00:51:47,890
not having any, any sort of
preconceived things going in, you know?

804
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,190
Yeah.
So you actually,

805
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:54,191
what you're saying is you will
actually spend time doing,

806
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,260
speaking to someone. You have no
interest speaking. Exactly. Yeah.

807
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,540
She's such a sweet guy.
Yeah.

808
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:03,170
You're so nice that when I'm out
there looking at it for a second wife,

809
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:05,790
number two, we're going to
have it. We're going to be,

810
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,620
I'm just saying you're going
to meet her on the road.

811
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,410
She's probably anybody's plan.
That's the best place.

812
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,110
Me and my friends think you're
totally, hi, me and my friends.

813
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,450
They always say it wrong. Yeah.
Growing up, how would you,

814
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,790
you would have a wife number two as
opposed to just having hoes in different

815
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:30,530
area codes. Smash city for a
run right away. You're no, Josh,

816
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:34,230
you're asking, uh Oh, I'm
dead. I'm gone. Yes. Oh yeah.

817
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,420
I have hoes in different
area codes. Wife, a mom. No,

818
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,610
I'm not going to wife up immediately.
It's smashed city for a while. Yeah.

819
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,860
And then the one who's like,
I'll eat your, but I put the
ring. Oh, stop it. Stop it.

820
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,070
Don't you dare bring those hose near
my children. Is that a sticking point?

821
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,690
Fuck you. You want it. And you
won't give a, it's constant.

822
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,320
Yeah. But it's also we just learned
from an email or a listener email,

823
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,030
it's a sign of immense disrespect
to ask your spouse. It basically,

824
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:06,850
this guy was like, my wife wants
to and I respect her too much. Wow.

825
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,980
This animal like,

826
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,520
I mean, that's true. Actually. That's
a good point. It's gotta be tough.

827
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,600
You're his wife,

828
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,760
but you get to a certain point where
you're so close that it's like,

829
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,870
who cares? Yeah. Nope. Right there
yet. You have to get to that point.

830
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:24,890
And that's what Josh, the
problem is, is that I,

831
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,340
I have intimate knowledge

832
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,950
of his dumps and his farts
and what he's capable of.

833
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,730
And I hear it every morning through
the wall. And it sounds horrendous,

834
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,970
but would you be deterred
if you hadn't had that?

835
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:39,510
Like wouldn't you still not do it
if I didn't, if I didn't hear what?

836
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,060
You didn't have any of that
knowledge? No, I would not do it.

837
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,070
It's just like nothing you would
ever, it's not, it's not for me,

838
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:49,140
but it will say Ryan Gosling's like eat
this booty from scrum and I floss with

839
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:52,710
his fucking pubes. Yeah. So you're not
against the act. It's just kidding.

840
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,060
I want to lane, but he looks
cleaner than, you know,

841
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,940
if he was like on all fours
and he was like, hurry up

842
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,160
and reach under and do the

843
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,600
yeah,
yeah,

844
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,403
yeah.

845
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,290
Gosling. Gosh, I do like him
so much now. One of the things,

846
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,980
I mean I, I love about
Josh. He's a great comic.

847
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:23,750
Everything about he's great, he's great,
but we always have like, you're not here.

848
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,400
We always will like laugh at, uh,
you know, just fucked up clips,

849
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,600
things that, that we, you know,
we'll show each other things,

850
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,880
sending each other videos.

851
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,260
He's like your friend that's ground
zero for all the weird shit that man.

852
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,580
So I go look man.
So,

853
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:45,320
so to give people more information,
we've been working on a,

854
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:50,360
uh, transition to expand our show.
Um, there's, there's a transition.

855
00:54:50,361 --> 00:54:53,420
I thought you're talking about your own.
I am. I am transitioning into a man,

856
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,420
but I do think like,
I grew this hair this weekend.

857
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,310
I'm looking more and more mail every week,
but congratulations.

858
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,180
Thank you very much. Um, but you
know, we're trying to expand the show.

859
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,720
We have a studio space that
were outfittings to, uh,

860
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,940
to start doing the show
from hopefully without dogs.

861
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,060
Dogs are part of the show, but, uh,
she's going crazy over there anyway.

862
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,580
We want Josh to,
uh,

863
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,290
to work with us in this new
space and pumped, so pumped.

864
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,260
And so basically, um, I need that to stop.
Can you please do something about that?

865
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:35,190
Hey, I know she's off of it. Uh,

866
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,450
she was going to go back just giving
him, how about we just pick it up? Do

867
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,330
you mean, how about you? How
about you picking? I'm asking you

868
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,050
so stupid.

869
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:54,350
In order to introduce you to the show,

870
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:59,270
the idea was that you would pull
some of your, pull some clips,

871
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:04,220
whatever you want to, you know, introduce
it to the audience. And I thought,

872
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:06,050
why not start with something?

873
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:10,250
I'm very well versed in pornography.
Okay.

874
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,200
Um,
here's all I know.

875
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,600
All I know is that I have four files.
Okay.

876
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,950
These are separated into four
files for us to genre genre's.

877
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,993
Okay.

878
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,610
Um, I'll let you direct.
I haven't seen anything.

879
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,790
I just knew that like we're
going to introduce Josh to
the audience that Josh is

880
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:34,570
going to introduce clips to us.
Is there anything I can, should I,

881
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,030
should I just play them at random?
I'm not at rent.

882
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,900
Maybe an order in the order that they're,
so the first one I see is died.

883
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:46,750
I did I do that. We can start there
because I mean, here's the thing. Yeah.

884
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,430
I mean maybe you don't
remember this because you're
married now and yeah. Got It.

885
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,790
You got to do all your business calls,

886
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:56,500
but most of the day I am in a hotel room

887
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:02,140
and this isn't stuff that
I TJ's to necessarily,

888
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,970
but when you just,

889
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:08,230
you have a lot of time after that
to kill and there's so much stuff.

890
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,360
These websites are like target.

891
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,500
It's one of the most interesting
things is like there's,

892
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,730
there's stuff that you like and
then there's the curious stuff. Yes.

893
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,310
It makes you go like is
that really a thing? Right,
exactly. And all these sites,

894
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:24,100
they put them there for you.
Like I said, they're like target.

895
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:27,730
You go in getting what you need and you
come out with a whole bunch of other

896
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:31,110
shit that you didn't even know existed.
It's pretty amazing. All right,

897
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,390
so I will start,
I'll play this.

898
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:38,050
I have a feeling that a lot of this
is going to be blurred out. Yeah.

899
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:42,310
Well this one is a pretty self
explanatory. Let's see what it says.

900
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,780
Let's see what we got here.
Uh, Josh Potter. Target. Yeah,

901
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,110
no,
that accent sounds familiar by the way.

902
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:59,170
And then she does see what's
this over here? That's a,

903
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,460
that looks like a Binky, right? I
mean, I'm not familiar with baby toys,

904
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,880
but I think that's what
she's using it for. Yeah.

905
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,040
So in case you didn't know
that she was going, uh,

906
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,410
he or she is showing you a better angle
to know that she is definitely gone

907
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:19,840
100%. This isn't just a
pomp and circumstances for
people not watching this,

908
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:23,970
showing you too. There is a pretty
attractive blonde Chang. Rub It in there.

909
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:28,540
She's wearing and she
just peed in the die,

910
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:31,060
die and she's showing us just making sure,
you know,

911
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,790
she also rubbed her at
her anus specifically.

912
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,990
She's getting the pee all around
there. Yeah. So important.

913
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,070
And in case you really didn't know,

914
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:43,570
so you really needed like definitive
proof that she really could. I don't know.

915
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,100
I don't know if I believe that she
writes. It can all be acting. Yeah.

916
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,410
And I don't like acting. I
want the real thing. Oh. Oh,

917
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,830
oh,
uh,

918
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:59,070
accent is very familiar to me. It sounds
like my old step mom sound like her.

919
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,990
Yeah. Yeah. It does. A vet. A vet
diaper. She would do that. Uh,

920
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:08,440
do you think she would do that? Yeah. No
I would. How much money you think that

921
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,990
I don't understand why every girl doesn't
have an Instagram account for their

922
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:18,370
feet. By the way. That's something
that's easy to get that money.

923
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,420
Do you think they get money? Just,
no, not just for posting them. Sure.

924
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,520
You get the build the followers, it's
like, oh, I'm going to start selling.

925
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,890
And you put like a bottle of tide next to
your feet or something. Product places.

926
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,150
Yeah. But whatever they, whatever's
selling ads out there. That's right. Like,

927
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:40,760
so then Ford's like, Hey,
we've got a new f one 50,

928
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:43,460
or will you put your feet on the
steering wheel? Yeah. She was like, yeah,

929
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:47,810
of course. Hey guys, you want to come in
a Ford? Yeah. I think you're right Josh.

930
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:50,700
I think every woman should
have of feed account, uh,

931
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,230
pissing in the diaper account. I
Dunno. I think it's a big leap.

932
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:00,170
You got to really jump to
peeing in the diaper. That's
more than feet. I mean, Hey,

933
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:02,660
if you can do it, do it.
But yeah, if he can do it,

934
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,580
I would do farming and paying in the
diaper easy. Yeah, no problem. Easy, easy.

935
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,830
There was some things in between those.
I would love Josh,

936
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:14,180
if you were a hot check and see this
stuff pull off with your knowledge now.

937
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:18,350
Yeah. Um, yeah. So that now
are, just out of curiosity,

938
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,940
are you into p I am not
into p this is this.

939
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,720
The thing that's weird about that is that
they're appropriating paraphilia. Oh,

940
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,560
oh, oh, right. It was like I went potty.

941
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:35,930
It's weird. Right. And the only thing
more evil than pedophilia is the n word.

942
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,090
Oh, okay. Okay. Good segue one up
here. I might be, because that next,

943
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,520
there's no video. That's okay. Okay.
There's probably a reason for that.

944
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,850
Let's see. Okay. Oh dear.

945
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,440
So I have a funny
question to ask you guys.

946
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:03,130
Is it cool if I say the n word?
It turns me on.

947
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,610
Just say the n word.
I'm young Nigga

948
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:11,780
and nigger day. Oh, okay.

949
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,010
What's she doing?
She's not showing her love.

950
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,580
I just see audio file. Yeah, there.

951
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,190
There's a lot of loving
going on in those lessons

952
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,603
right

953
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,233
now.

954
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:37,980
My favorite thing, by the
way, genre, it's a genre.

955
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,880
There are two facets of it.
Easy.

956
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,040
There are the women who enjoy saying it,

957
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:49,590
and then there are the men who enjoy
getting the women to say it. Oh,

958
01:01:49,591 --> 01:01:54,120
fascinating. Yeah. So, so there's
basically the reluctant woman.

959
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,170
Yes. This woman. That's why she's like,
are you have any questions? Oh, right.

960
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:03,390
I have a funny one. Yeah, it was a silly
question. What's hilarious question.

961
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,670
Fuck you, nigger. Hello.

962
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,260
So what category is she?
She's,

963
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,730
she's the one who loves them and loves
saying it. That's what turns her on.

964
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,940
It's saying that word.
That's what we've done to the word.

965
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,220
We've made it so evil that it's now so
taboo that it's turning people onto stuff.

966
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,200
Genre. Like I wonder how many
people really are into that one.

967
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,330
I don't know. What do you think? What's
bigger demographic? Bigger audience.

968
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,710
The pissing in the die die or the
n word saying probably pissing.

969
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:39,643
Yeah.

970
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:44,260
Oh, you're the expert, Josh.

971
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,630
It's a brand of cause that's
something to be decent links.

972
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,330
Oh my gosh. Yeah. Accents

973
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,240
foreign. No, I think it's like that
accent is like Jersey isn't, yeah.

974
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:08,020
Yeah. Just whore. Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

975
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,710
Shit.
Oh Man.

976
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:17,950
I just love nigger juice.
Geez. Wow. Dark Shit.

977
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:21,280
Pretty physical by, uh, say the n word.

978
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:24,940
That cool.

979
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,450
Dumb like that. I didn't really read
a lot growing up. Oh yeah. Creation.

980
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,810
No worries. Where she says, uh,

981
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:35,350
is it called by say the n word

982
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:40,400
that that Dan Lauer the defense.
You can't see her in that moment.

983
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:42,890
She is skewered.
So

984
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:49,760
there is a, wow, just one fella there.

985
01:03:49,761 --> 01:03:51,740
There's a couple of them. Oh really? Yeah.

986
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,410
She's a pretty bold to
ask such a question.

987
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,000
I think it was cleared
before they record it.

988
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:02,210
That's the fun part though is when you
don't know. Yeah. I have a funny question.

989
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,360
I have a silly, funny, quite
frivolous thing to know.

990
01:04:05,361 --> 01:04:10,361
There are some that are like God that
are just like urine and word and then

991
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:12,620
they're like, oh shit. You know,

992
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:16,960
like they get mad but it's
ultimate reparations cause
then they punish the girl

993
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:17,794
for sure.

994
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:22,960
That's also the fun of the
video. Yes. Gotcha. Wow. Wow.

995
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:26,900
There's so much shit. Really
Nasty, nasty, nasty. Um,

996
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,230
she talks just like you're dumb girl.
Impression.

997
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,200
Do that as I have a five a class done

998
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:38,050
that I'm wired

999
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,300
and then you have to go up on every,

1000
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:44,350
the out of fun to you are now I smile.

1001
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,070
You smile ear to ear when I
come across those for sure.

1002
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,620
Not because of them saying
the n word was just special.

1003
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:55,270
Do you know what I'm seeing here? Oh
yes, this is a gentleman who is a real,

1004
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,870
you know, these people that go around to
homes. And so what happened by the way,

1005
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:03,610
is blue bear of a blue van prep these
so that he didn't have to blur them

1006
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:08,230
afterwards cause this is all I have in
this is just a single shot. Well that's,

1007
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:12,250
this one was pretty rough
according to hit him. So,

1008
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,820
um, according to him, you know,

1009
01:05:15,821 --> 01:05:20,560
there are angels in world who go
home to home their caretakers.

1010
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:23,560
They take care of people who are in need.

1011
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,870
This gentleman takes it to
another level as you can see,

1012
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,510
servicing a woman who is
a disable the disabled,

1013
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,870
disabled,
extraordinarily disabled I would say.

1014
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,560
And uh,
he is just,

1015
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,910
I mean if you got to see this video,
you wouldn't know.

1016
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:46,590
It would be like he was servicing, uh, uh,

1017
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,950
a supermodel the way he is,
his vim and vigor, you know,

1018
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:55,540
he really gets in there. Yes.
Which is just pure. I mean,

1019
01:05:55,541 --> 01:06:00,100
his heart must be so big. I wish we
had some audio from it. So is it, um,

1020
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:06,220
you can imagine there's really not
much dialogue happened. And she's,

1021
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,420
I mean she's, it's obviously like
a, an advanced chair that she,

1022
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:15,550
it is some wild apparatus that is
difficult to understand how it exactly

1023
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:20,290
operates being a layman
but incapable of movement,

1024
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:24,160
incapable of her,
her lower body movement yet.

1025
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,720
Do you think she, I don't know,
deserve Eugene at work work?

1026
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:33,130
I think she's feeling something.
Does she make noises?

1027
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,180
Yes.

1028
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:39,340
That are conducive to
enjoying something like that?

1029
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:43,700
Yes.
I'm surprised you didn't have any video.

1030
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:48,330
I thought there would be a little bit,
but it is is great.

1031
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,250
Gray. The blue band, it didn't put
anything in here. This is all shot clear.

1032
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,840
That's all he cleared.
He told me it's a bit rough.

1033
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,900
Wow.
And that guy sees everything.

1034
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:07,750
So is this, by the way, in your churches,

1035
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,310
did this all, was this a genre,
did you find it was, I mean people,

1036
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:17,340
there are so many different
varieties of disabled porn really.

1037
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,340
There are people with limbs missing
in my life, things like that.

1038
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,470
Like the ones that the limbs missing,
they,

1039
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:28,480
I think they really found their lane
because a lot of them use tools that they

1040
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:31,930
then screw on to their stumps,

1041
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,270
for lack of a better word for it.

1042
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,270
And then they can have sex
better with these tools,

1043
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,870
if you will. But yeah, there are all
sorts of, and I think those people,

1044
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:46,360
if you have a fetish for disabled people,

1045
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,640
you shouldn't be looked at as a monster.

1046
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,230
You should be looked at as a hero because
who else is sex and those people up,

1047
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:54,760
right? For sure. What do you do it?

1048
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:00,340
I don't think I have the
bone or stamina to, uh,

1049
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,940
maintain something like that.
Not like that superhero that we just saw.

1050
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:07,410
That guy was real full
boar. He was, God bless him.

1051
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,100
I Dunno. I really don't know. I
haven't been put into that scenario.

1052
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,710
I wonder if women feel that way when
they sleep with me. They're like, oh,

1053
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:18,380
there's a man. You're sleeping with a
blind boy. For people that don't know,

1054
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:21,800
Josh has very poor vision. Yes. I'm
sure they can see, well, I dunno.

1055
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,850
He can't hear that.
I'm blind. But yes. No,

1056
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:28,820
I always wondered that if the women
feel like they're doing it a service,

1057
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:29,780
when they sleep with me,

1058
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:34,160
does it bother you to know what the
whatever they need to get through it.

1059
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,980
You know? And I've had the
same thoughts. So charity work,

1060
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,700
I'm like, I'll take the mercy. I don't
care. Yeah. Hell yeah. People listening,

1061
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:46,940
Josh isn't as in totally blind.
We're not saying that.

1062
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,910
So explain your cause he has
to be able to see these clips.

1063
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:54,100
He's wonderful clips that
he's bringing it. Yeah, I can
see right there. Yeah. Yeah.

1064
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:59,050
But also to be clear, he's well on
his way. I'm not flying a jet anytime.

1065
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,560
Okay.
Um,

1066
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:05,130
so that leaves us with one last clip was,

1067
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,390
is this the save the best for
last kind of scenario? I think so.

1068
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:13,070
I thought that one was going to
be last. Gosh. Well this is the,

1069
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:15,770
this is all I have.
I have a couple of clips here at the end.

1070
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,330
One is the n words pretty big. Which
one is the most wild too? So far?

1071
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,310
The diaper stuff. I'm like, all right.

1072
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:25,280
I think the n word stuff
is just bizarre to me.

1073
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:29,930
Like I get some that toll sex thing,
like it's mental stimulation.

1074
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:33,680
It's weird, right? It's taboo.
So maybe that's why there's some,

1075
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:38,080
but I guess it's connected to hate.
Yeah.

1076
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,980
I don't know what the connection is there.

1077
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:43,910
Dad clearly didn't love and words.

1078
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:49,120
I think the PA get cause it's all
the infantilism or whatever it is.

1079
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,640
You get that one. That's the one
I least understand. You know why?

1080
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:56,570
Because I changed diapers every day and
I maybe there's some connection to your

1081
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:59,510
mom or your dad lovingly
taking care of you as you,

1082
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:03,080
as you were if you were a baby.
So maybe they want to be cared for,

1083
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:06,200
like they're small babies or
something. I don't know. Uh, yeah,

1084
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:09,050
I mean I think the p one I
just kind of go like, Nah,

1085
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:13,280
Piss the disabled one makes me think like,
well actually,

1086
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,410
you know, everybody wants
some love and so, yeah, right.

1087
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:21,950
Everyone needs something impressive
that the guy can do it like this.

1088
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:25,600
Because I saw an interview with a porn
guy once and they asked him something,

1089
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,550
they would ask him about this, but they're
like, what happens if like you, uh,

1090
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,420
I don't know, don't like the girl
or something, something like that.

1091
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:33,171
And he was like,
oh,

1092
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:38,171
I always try to think about something
else to get me through the scenes.

1093
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:42,620
I see. So there are different
place. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, but,

1094
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,850
but to be able to do that, I want to
know that Santa is not real in this case.

1095
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,090
I like to hope that one's homemade and
that guy's just a hero that goes around

1096
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:53,870
the community. The n word one to
think about that is that, you know,

1097
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:54,920
it's very taboo,

1098
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:59,900
which may be for everyone in that room
adds to the excitement of the situation.

1099
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:04,790
Like makes the Adrenalin kind of pump.
I feel like if I was the white camera guy,

1100
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:05,624
I'd be like,

1101
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:11,030
he needs to chill the fuck out girl.
Be like,

1102
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,760
because like I said, some of it is
because obviously this is a white woman,

1103
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,080
some of it is the African
American gentlemen telling
her, I want you to say that.

1104
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:24,180
Oh, right. Right. And then,
but my favorite is when
she is like out of nowhere.

1105
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:28,590
I don't know where like, hey can I
asked some of them don't do that.

1106
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,420
That's interesting.
The one that's down ass,

1107
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,720
that's when we know they're
all like what the fuck?

1108
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:40,680
But then they deliver a punishment.
Punishment. Yeah. That may make it,

1109
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,620
yeah.
This last one I think is just fun.

1110
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:48,760
It's just what happens here. This is the
last one here. It's everyone's scariest,

1111
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:50,670
uh,
scenario.

1112
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:55,740
US military forces are on their
way from what I understand. And

1113
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,083
um,

1114
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,260
we plant our seed in the
belly of the infidels the way,

1115
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,850
although we'll grow with it
within, so this is like, this is,

1116
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
this is nine 11 porn baby that is supposed
to be Osama bin Ladin is running out

1117
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:16,530
for us. So some people don't,
they can't see right there.

1118
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,560
It was like a summer look alike.

1119
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,630
And another guy indicated in a cave
delivering one of those, you know,

1120
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:26,370
anti-American message,

1121
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,690
like look in the production is great on
it because it's all grainy and they did

1122
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:35,691
it in a Web Cam and then Veronica
cane is live from Afghanistan.

1123
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,750
I can't believe she got
that assignment so crazy.

1124
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:46,650
So she's reporting back about it.
Um,

1125
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,660
he'll fall into the hands of the
Northern Alliance and the special forces.

1126
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:57,240
I don't think so. Veronica.
So Veronica says that,

1127
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:02,020
uh, well she's just reporting on this live
store. She's just in Afghanistan. Yeah.

1128
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,060
Covering the news,

1129
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,980
covering the hunt for Osama female
newscasters have long hooker nails.

1130
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,280
I'll tell you right now. I'm going
to ask you for the link to this one.

1131
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:18,480
Let's see. Oh, they got, oh no.

1132
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,890
First Daniel Pearl now her.
Oh,

1133
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:28,860
touching our woman's boobs. Yeah. Uh,

1134
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,690
I like how they speak.

1135
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,750
I wonder if that's actual
three quarters of the,

1136
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,580
what's going on,
a whole bunch of stuff.

1137
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,850
I wonder if this is the
diligent lane birch. They are,

1138
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:48,120
they've captured or they're torturing
her for answers. Most likely.

1139
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:55,980
Do you think that's the real life?
That wasn't really blurred out. Well,

1140
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:07,700
hovered three quarters of the screen
and left just a vagina and a dildo.

1141
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,620
Do you think that was the proper
translations for the language? Think so.

1142
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:14,540
I think they were like,
we're looking for authentic speaker.

1143
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:18,190
Must speak Arabic and it's true.
It did sound just like,

1144
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:24,670
wow, I wonder if they let Ronica
go after that. I don't know.

1145
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:27,640
I mean what's worse?
Getting beheaded by them or

1146
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:34,210
that's the, I'm all spitting
on her. That's the torture.
Who got off better though,

1147
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:39,100
right? Man? That's gotta
be a fun scene to shoot

1148
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,780
that one. Oh yeah. Really Fun.

1149
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:50,380
I think I'd rather get John Mccain,
John Mccain.

1150
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:53,800
Do you'd rather be like John Mccain like,
uh, I, I think, you know, I didn't check.

1151
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:58,890
He got a w I'll have to dub him that.
Yeah, get captured by the VC. Oh,

1152
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,960
they torture this shit.
Seriously.

1153
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:04,400
Then be raped by a bunch
of terrorists like that.

1154
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,360
I don't know which one I would prefer.

1155
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:12,000
You want bamboo under
your fingernails or Dixon?

1156
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,210
You don't want the Dixon? Me. Okay. How
about this scenario? Would you rather,

1157
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:21,910
you're going to be with the VC and
they're gonna beat the fuck out of you.

1158
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:25,810
Break your arm, fuck up your
shoulder, break your ribs,

1159
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:31,050
knock you out a few times and keep you
for a year and then you're freed or three

1160
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:36,520
guys spit on.
You stick Dick's and Dildos in your hon,

1161
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:40,210
but then they let you go when
they're done. One instance. Yeah.

1162
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:44,680
How often are you getting beaten?
You're getting beaten once every,

1163
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,690
you get some form of beating every week.
Okay.

1164
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,610
How would take the Dix from
the Arabs? Yeah, for sure.

1165
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,580
100% over a year of beat down.
You get to leave after? Yeah,

1166
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:59,850
but I feel like I'd be more
traumatized sex. Really?

1167
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,270
Man,
I need to rough you up a little bit.

1168
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,850
What would you take all the dicks one day?

1169
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,970
A beat down every week for a
year where they shit on you.

1170
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,960
I'm just getting beaten today.
It's a year,

1171
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:21,250
but then I wouldn't be able to be intimate
with somebody after something like,

1172
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,570
well you just go to therapy.

1173
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:26,960
That's like how long is
their dildo session on?

1174
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:31,750
It's like three and a half hours. I
could do it. They spit in your face,

1175
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:36,660
you know, they call you an
infidel. I can't do it. And
then they go, this is like,

1176
01:16:36,661 --> 01:16:40,310
this is a message from my law,
and they look unloading.

1177
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,220
You really ended up

1178
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,850
three of them. Okay, here's the
bad part. The three of them,

1179
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:52,800
they want to empty their balls
multiple times. Here's the thing,

1180
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,080
what if they empty their balls and then
they liked liked America afterwards?

1181
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,500
Your country is saying,

1182
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:03,610
I can single handedly stop the conflict
in the middle of the sacrifice myself.

1183
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,610
Yes. They're like, oh, blonde haired
woman, and then they're like, oh,

1184
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:10,100
America's pretty dope actually. Yes. Okay.

1185
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,240
I would sacrifice myself for America.
Yes. Oh, well I want greater good.

1186
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,580
I would for the grant. Yes. I
didn't realize you had that in you.

1187
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,180
I would. Would you? Are you taking
for fun anyways? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1188
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:26,450
For Saturday night for you to
answer sounded fun. Hell yeah.

1189
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:30,320
I'll look at you two pigs spitting on me
and they're like American and for that

1190
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:34,070
I'm like, yeah, what's up man? I'd
be like, I have a funny question now.

1191
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:34,923
What would be,

1192
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,240
do you think it be?
Yeah.

1193
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,880
Worse that if all those guys um,

1194
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,540
empty themselves in you rectally.

1195
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:51,770
I have a good one too or in the throat.
Ooh Damn.

1196
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,370
I would prefer a rectally proud I yeah,

1197
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:58,020
because you can fart all
that shit out of you. Right?

1198
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,730
You can basically shit ges out of you.
You can't get it out of your,

1199
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:05,360
I have to check with a
doctor friend of mine weight.

1200
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,060
But here's the thing that can give you,
like I say that.

1201
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,370
Here's the thing though, they can
give you like, but herpes and stuff.

1202
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,670
Do you know what I mean? Like he
knows better than mouth herpes. Yeah.

1203
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:20,310
I would rather get the in my, but
then in my mouth. What about, yeah.

1204
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:24,160
So I have a funny
question to ask you guys.

1205
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,740
I would rather have, but herpes and
mouth herpes. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

1206
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,570
Cause at least you can
kind of hide it from peeps.

1207
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,160
You can really hide it
and I kind of hide it.

1208
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,770
That's probably the best place to have
herpes is your, but I know is it, uh,

1209
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,990
I mean, uh, as if you had to have
herpes anywhere, where would you,

1210
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,980
where would you prefer other
than a doctor? A doctor friend,

1211
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:50,320
uh, told me that, you know, he treats
all this stuff and he said that, um,

1212
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:56,170
a lot of times guys are embarrassed or
just ignore to course all of this stuff

1213
01:18:56,721 --> 01:19:01,550
and we'll wait until it is like
a raging inflammation. Yes,

1214
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:06,380
of course. What do they
ignore? A genital wart.

1215
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:07,800
All the signs.

1216
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,850
What are they like, oh, there's a
wart on my dick, but that's okay.

1217
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,000
Going by the time they go, they,
by the time that he sees them,

1218
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,890
it is completely covered. There's
a stench. It's like, it looks like,

1219
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,920
it looks like, um, like,

1220
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:26,480
like a feature film
Fx, like for, you know,

1221
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:29,870
an alien on there, Dick Shot. And
then they're like, is this something?

1222
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,720
And then they go to him like, this
feels like this should be looked at it.

1223
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:36,870
This is why girls need to, where you need
you to not have sex with dirty dudes.

1224
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,440
Yeah. I, uh, I did my fantasy
football draft a couple of
weeks ago. I know you like,

1225
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:43,620
would you rather is my, uh,

1226
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,980
high school friend posed one to me
that I thought was very interesting.

1227
01:19:46,981 --> 01:19:51,060
I think you'd particularly
enjoy this one. Ah, okay.

1228
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:52,050
So I'll pose it to you.

1229
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:56,550
If you had to sleep with Tom,

1230
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
but it was your father's brain
next whatever the other one is.

1231
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,170
Well then it would be Tom's
brain in your father's.

1232
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,980
Ah, then that, oh

1233
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,150
gosh. At least I could close my
eyes. Tom's brand, my dad's body,

1234
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:17,570
unfortunately inside of the
shell. And I would, yes,

1235
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,180
I would just block out in the
vessel and just thinking of Tom,

1236
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,090
people would think you were crazy.
Some people don't choose that one,

1237
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:28,030
isn't it weird? Fucked up, right.
Wait, what would you guys choose? Yeah,

1238
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,580
I would try to choose the vehicle
over the brain. Oh, you would choose,

1239
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,920
I would choose the brain over the vessel.
I think you have to choose the,

1240
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,730
the brain. But that's
your mom. Exactly. Talk

1241
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:47,460
to me, Dude. I'm about to come to know
because you have to start talking.

1242
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:51,340
You'd have to keep reassuring me. Like,
don't worry that it's these voice me.

1243
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:59,280
I'd be like, oh, shut up. I will
leave if I keep talking. No,

1244
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:06,510
that's fucked up potter. Oh, sorry.
That's so hard. Are you today

1245
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:13,200
are pouring discussion?
Both of you guys,

1246
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:17,820
would you rather do the porno Middle
Eastern thing that we just saw?

1247
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:22,290
You're just an actor. You're
the girl. Okay. And all those
guys fucking jet on you.

1248
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:27,291
And it's just like what we have workday
or you do the n word scenario thing.

1249
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,300
You're the girl,
but you're doing it in real life.

1250
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,200
Like you're with two black dudes and
you're a blonde girl and it's real life.

1251
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:35,970
And you're like, excuse me,
I have a funny question.

1252
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,960
And you just kind of roll the dice and
layers to that one because I think a

1253
01:21:40,961 --> 01:21:45,870
pretty girl could get away with doing
that and I don't know. I really do.

1254
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:49,000
They would be like, oh, you
want to say some shit? Huh?

1255
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,030
Take care of it the same way.

1256
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,110
I feel like it wouldn't be very
different than the porno Sydney.

1257
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:00,540
Right. Am I wrong? It would, uh, a
switch it and let's turn the tables.

1258
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,680
You're a white guy with a black
girl. Okay. Yeah, that was,

1259
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:09,030
I have a question for you. Yeah. Do
you mind if I call you the n word?

1260
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,760
Here's the thing though,
because this, this,

1261
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,970
this applies to every time
the scenario was brought up.

1262
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,850
What type of person are we dealing with?

1263
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:22,440
Because if you're talking to talking about
this as a straight up animalistic sex

1264
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:22,641
act,

1265
01:22:22,641 --> 01:22:27,180
like there's nothing that sexy thing I
think you can get away with a lot more

1266
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:31,620
crazy. But if you're talking about like,
I went on a date or dinner and were like,

1267
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,730
I got a silly little questions. I you,
yeah, I don't think that would fly.

1268
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:37,743
Uh,

1269
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:43,580
I know this might turn you off to
keep this one for third day. Yeah.

1270
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,410
That's a scenario. It's this nice
girl. Like you take everything

1271
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:52,410
you want to call her that and
you gotta ask, man, if it's
really your kink, I mean,

1272
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,740
it's a bad one to volunteer.
I think you would,

1273
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,240
what you would do is you'd probably,
you try to find a way there.

1274
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,720
You'd have to with uh, without being,
you can't just be like out of the gate.

1275
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:08,060
Say it. Yeah. You got to start like
playing music and get her take, you know,

1276
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:13,260
maybe you watch something that you watch
some w Kamau bell show and be like,

1277
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:17,440
what do you think about all this?
Where do you stand? Where do you stand?

1278
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:22,150
And she's like, I mean, it's cool.
And you're like, cool. Who are you?

1279
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:26,920
Like an activist? Cool. So
what you're telling me is
you, what would you rather do?

1280
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,600
The Porno, Middle Eastern thing.
You're a girl or a real life.

1281
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:35,140
Well, I need to ask this check if you
can say the end. It'd be terribly,

1282
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,540
you've got one day,

1283
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:43,150
it'd be terribly embarrassing for it to
go wrong. Obviously horrible, horrible.

1284
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:48,070
But even that shame is not as bad as
being spit on and filled up by like in a

1285
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:51,120
porno world, a bunch of terrorists.
Your job. Now this is just your,

1286
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:52,960
and the other scenario of
the Middle Eastern scenario.

1287
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:56,440
You're quite literally just like
the actress that day. So I get paid.

1288
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,240
You get paid 50 old dollars,

1289
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,870
so you get paid to do the
the porno version of that,

1290
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,170
what you saw or a girl that's
your life or in real life,

1291
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:07,120
you take the girl out and ask her.
Correct.

1292
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:12,450
I think I would still take the real
girl and and risk being humiliated.

1293
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:17,680
I'll take the payday. 50
bucks. 50 bucks. That's it.

1294
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:21,760
Ah. Now you're making me
think about it. Realistically,

1295
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:25,330
what do you think a girl gets for
that fit that 1500 bucks? I'd take it.

1296
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:30,520
It's like 1500 bucks.
I'm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:35,350
I would take the real life scenario and
risk just because I don't want to be in

1298
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:37,590
and be like on this
date with this nice guy.

1299
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,600
I've got to ask you a silly question.
Side question.

1300
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,760
I think a lot of guys would be,
would tolerate it.

1301
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,790
I think it would fare better for you than
it would for us. Get Away with, we can,

1302
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,320
we can talk some shit. He can say some
crazy shit. Yeah. You can be like, can I,

1303
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,690
can I call Your Dad Fag?
And he'd be like, all right.

1304
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,090
He might think he might be like,
it's kind of hot guys think everything.

1305
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,540
And also what happens to
a guy who was a woman?

1306
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,480
Like if you go on and ask a guy,
can I ask you a silly question?

1307
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,240
Can I call you the n word?
No matter what,

1308
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:13,300
unless he is really like his whole
life is doing the right thing.

1309
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,210
He's going to be like,

1310
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:21,240
this bitch is going to be the freakiest
of all time just for asking me that.

1311
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,210
She's going to be such an animal that
probably most I think it would be like,

1312
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:26,044
yeah,
sure.

1313
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:29,800
And then they might even take a thrill
in like you were saying those things

1314
01:25:29,801 --> 01:25:33,610
where like they just didn't
punish you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1315
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:36,640
Now saying it as a guy to a woman,

1316
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:39,370
that brings up an interesting
different scenario.

1317
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:42,580
I might have to look up that kind
of see if that porn exists. Yeah.

1318
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,590
That would be a totally
different dynamic though.

1319
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:48,100
How unbelievably different scary dynamic.

1320
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,393
Now what if,
uh,

1321
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,260
what if you went out with
an African American woman
and then she asked you to do

1322
01:25:56,261 --> 01:26:00,910
that? I would. I would do it,
but I would be hesitant still.

1323
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:04,940
It would take a lot. I'd have to maybe
have a few glasses of wine, you know,

1324
01:26:04,941 --> 01:26:08,960
it's so loosen me up a little bit.
Yeah. I don't know if I could be like,

1325
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,710
and she's like louder.
Louder. You Bitch. I'm like,

1326
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,270
I don't think I'd have that Alpha
in me to be able to do that.

1327
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,030
Yeah.
Good stuff.

1328
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,480
Thanks Josh. Really good
work track. That's why,

1329
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:28,930
why we around really troubling.

1330
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:32,750
You're ready? They are ready
for lunch. Yeah, let's go eat.

1331
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:36,110
Let's go have some lunch and
we'll be back with another guest.

1332
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:41,600
All right. So now the, the finally
the a, the moment of truth here.

1333
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:44,870
This has been in the works for a while.
We've had to reschedule,

1334
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,190
but now it's official.
Um,

1335
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,890
I'm super excited to
bring in a great comic,

1336
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:57,270
an La Native Felipe Esparza.
Yay.

1337
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:03,800
Um, this is pretty crazy
because you pull from the, uh,

1338
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:09,380
from those stem as a, as we learned.
Is that better? Yeah. Good. All right.

1339
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:16,220
Um, it's pretty crazy, dude. Like,

1340
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:20,390
one of the things I respect the
most about you is, I mean, you know,

1341
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:22,280
every comic obviously respect,

1342
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:27,110
but like your ride has to be,
it's like a,

1343
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:30,380
it's really a fairytale. It's a
miracle. Do you ever stop and go like,

1344
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:34,820
Holy Shit because like to go
from you from Boyle heights,

1345
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,830
like for people that don't know,

1346
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:41,750
tell it like tell him where
Boyle heights it when you pass,

1347
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,440
when you leave downtown and you go
east and you see the first neighborhood

1348
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:46,161
that's Boyle heights,

1349
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:48,980
Boyle heights yet then once you
get to like a street code Indiana,

1350
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:51,650
that's where easterly brigance.
Okay. So Boyle Heights.

1351
01:27:51,651 --> 01:27:52,940
So it's a rough neighborhood.

1352
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:57,020
But I grew up in like in the intersection
where most of the housing projects

1353
01:27:57,021 --> 01:28:00,620
were in Boyle heights. Yeah,
because there's projects.

1354
01:28:00,621 --> 01:28:03,920
What kind of like a straight accords?
Pico Gardens,

1355
01:28:03,921 --> 01:28:08,320
Aliso village and Grando Vista
and all these ones where um,

1356
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:13,220
I guess hazard. Yeah. Projects.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hazard projects.

1357
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:18,680
Um, I actually, if you see my
special, uh, mostly stories,

1358
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,800
it opens with a sequence shot around
La and we went to the hazard projects,

1359
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:29,150
non permitted to shoot this part.
Dude,

1360
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:33,770
these guys like found us and
basically we're cool to us.

1361
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:36,500
But they were at first they're like,
what the fuck are you doing here?

1362
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:39,980
Because we were just with a camera crew
shooting all that footage, you know,

1363
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,930
and then you can see some of them cause
I'm standing on that bridge that like

1364
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,400
the overpass over there.

1365
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:51,110
But I'm saying like it's great like when
you look back to where you came from,

1366
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,110
like do you ever go like, Whoa, Holy
Shit. How far you've made it. You've been,

1367
01:28:56,190 --> 01:29:00,350
it's amazing. Yeah. I still
like damn that when I go visit,

1368
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,100
go visit too much.

1369
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,370
But like um, homeboy industries. Yeah.

1370
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,800
Every once in a while when
I would go there a lot,

1371
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:12,060
I will drop by sometimes just say hello
to father Greg and I will see like,

1372
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:16,170
so when I grew up with, Yup. Who got luck
though? No, the kidney barely coming out.

1373
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:19,680
Wow. And for people that don't
know, man, homeboy industries,

1374
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:24,810
it was started as like a an
outreach program to give you know,

1375
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:30,540
joggers and stuff. Jobs and tattoo
removal. It's pretty wild man.

1376
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:34,930
And you come from that. I mean if, if
I would tell him Philippe at, you know,

1377
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:38,160
13 that you'd have the life you have now,
you'd probably be like,

1378
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:40,860
what the fuck out? And
I believe the man. Yeah.

1379
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:46,050
I started going like acting like a fool.

like a gangster. Yeah.

1409
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:48,340
So it was completely bald and I believe
that I'm probably like uncle fester.

1410
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:49,663
Oh my gosh.

1411

but see golf girls is a cousin of
the Chola look, it's very similar.

1417

eyebrows, red lips, Pale skin.

1418

1426
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,020

it's like a hundred pounds
of water per second.

1472
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:40,550
Somebody pulled that shit.
Yeah. Not in front of them,
but like it was after hours.

1473
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:44,930
Oh Shit. Huge flood. Yeah. Yeah. It's
fun. It was great. I took drafting,

1474
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:49,460

boring. Boring and hard. It's hard.

1475
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:53,360
It's almost like it's, sorry. It's like
a more like you got a bunch of lines,

1476
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:55,940
right? Yeah. Do you, but it's like
a millimeter or quarter range.

1477
01:35:55,941 --> 01:36:00,630
Like you had to learn the ruler for super
jealous of being able to draw me too.

1478
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:04,520
I can't do that. She would have
drafted a generic business cards. No,

1479
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:08,640

you got graded on whether or not you

1481
01:36:11,721 --> 01:36:12,470

I think that's where you can use it for.

1484
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,720
But we went to seventh grade.
You know what?

1485
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:27,800
The only class where that shit was looking

01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:16,340
I would read in Spanish.
And um,

1516
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:21,030
there's other rehabs, so they were like
a bunch of men, heroin addicts, everyone.

1517
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,750
And this guy named Tim for the
separately and low value mission.

1518
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,680
He was like a Catholic priest?
No, no. A brother, like naturally.

1519
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:33,730
Then he did like the sad work
for the priest missionary.

1520
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:40,680
So he will talk and come up with crazy
games. And then he asked everybody,

1521
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:43,950
write down your dreams in life.
So I wrote down, you know,

1522
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:48,770
I have a dream where I wake
up with no money, but I have
money whenever, you know,

1523
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:52,770
or a nicotine class, he'll know. Not
those kind of dreams, your goals.

1524
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:55,290
So we wrote, okay, I
want to be a comedian.

1525
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,690
I want to go to Italy because I love
olive garden. Three, four, and five.

1526
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:01,524
I don't know.

1527
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:08,160
I love all the garden plan I know for to
get the bread and salad. That's awesome.

1528
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,460
Until you really, you really, at
that time though, you're like,

1529
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:15,210
I want to be a standard.
That dream.

1530
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:17,580
Like I know you said you
first heard delirious,

1531
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,430
but from then did you get into standup
a lot more after that? Yes. Um,

1532
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:22,381
it was like during,

1533
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:27,381
like we had a VCR and in the back of the
days of your borrow movie for somebody,

1534
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,520
there's like six movie attached
to it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um,

1535
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:38,340
someone loaned me a standup comedy and
it had everybody's HBO special as a young

1536
01:39:38,341 --> 01:39:40,370
comedian was Rodney Dangerfield insurance,

1537
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:46,320

specialists and that Robin Williams,

1538
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:50,520

1539
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:55,380

he was a Latin guy. No, we know,

1540
01:39:55,381 --> 01:39:57,750
we know who we'd like to
hear more because we leave,

1541
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:02,220
we related to him or his drugs
were silly, you know, funny for us.

1542
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:07,070
We couldn't remember. I'm better like
kind of like Richard Pryor. Like I'm like,

1543
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:11,170
I never heard of these jokes, but
my friends were, I remember, um,

1544
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:15,240
poetry. You were performed at
Beverly at a Belvedere Park,

1545
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:18,570
at this annual Latino,
first of all,

1546
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:21,150
for Mexican Independence
Day during the 80s.

1547
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,550
Like it was deep man. Like,
like if you went there,

1548
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:31,390
you knew what gang was there and it was
mine or via mobile via projects because

1549
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:35,550
of the fair was in the minor be a projects
bothered you ever connected to the

1550
01:40:35,551 --> 01:40:39,150
project so that we're Columbus
here grew up those projects really,

1551
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:42,630
but their gang is deep Monrovia projects,
right? Like, I'm going to be a gang,

1552
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:48,150
but it was like a clash of so many
gangs there. There was always a fight,

1553
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,640
but I would never there I was too young
to go. But my friend will tell me, yeah,

1554
01:40:51,641 --> 01:40:54,250
Paul [inaudible] was there.
He throw it to tear the everybody

1555
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:03,010
can do to control it,
but he goes up to tears.

1556
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,690
It was true.
Or the audience would do it.

1557
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:07,410
The fight come are backed
up by the Mexican frisbee.

1558
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,590
That's hilarious man.
So that's,

1559
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:15,010
I saw and then they shop boy
needs to lay in my neighborhood.

1560
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:24,440
Were you tempted to get in gang shit at
all? Like being exposed to it? I got,

1561
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:29,050
I wasn't like I got a job.
You did? Yeah, without,

1562
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,020
cause I used to hang around with these
kids that were break dancers. Yeah.

1563
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:36,190
They became gangs and we started selling
crack and that was where the heck is

1564
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:37,930
wrong with him.
And what's that?

1565
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:41,730
We were jumping a bunch of people
because they were doing bad and I started

1566
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:44,860
jumping over to somebody say,
man, we do a jump your ses.

1567
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:49,810
So then they got jumped in. Oh Shit.
So then you were in, yeah. Which gang?

1568
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,000
Gang of the projects.

1569
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,960
So they do run with them after that
for a little while to attach with a big

1570
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,920
fight with my neighbor,

1571
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,630
one of my neighbors when neighbors
called because whatever, I was like,

1572
01:42:04,631 --> 01:42:09,390
I'm out of here man.
Like I was on PCP. Wow.

1573
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:12,120
No,

1574
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:16,930
that's the most popular
drug in my neighborhood.

1575
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:22,070
Who would drive up and um,

1576
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:27,520
the goal at this 15 [inaudible] a little
vial and dip like a new new port or a

1577
01:42:28,271 --> 01:42:32,200
coup cigarette and they had their
own pores and they'll be like, okay,

1578
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:36,910
here's $15 all day long.
Get Wet.

1579
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:41,470
Yeah. Yeah. So what does it feel like to,

1580
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:45,700
let's say incredible whole cable?
Don't grade

1581
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,730
like a woman,
like lift a car.

1582
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:53,680
The parents,
you know,

1583
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:57,130
if you're like already crazy and
you're mad when you're doing it,

1584
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:59,200
you're going to go and do crazy stuff.

1585
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:04,300
What if you're in a chill state of mind
and you do it? What does my friend Eli,

1586
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:07,750
that guy was a guy that he fixed
everyone's card, the neighborhood,

1587
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:11,700
he'll start smoking PCP,
PCP.

1588
01:43:11,701 --> 01:43:14,950
So I was fixing somebody Volkswagen
and he'll stay like, you know,

1589
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:19,510
holding the wrench for like two
hours straight without moving.

1590
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,660
But what happened to me was I just put it,

1591
01:43:22,661 --> 01:43:27,661
watch it terminated to oh
shows pumped up the APP man.

1592
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:31,870
Shit, I was cheeky. One of those sports
bottles, you know those sports bottles,

1593
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,190
NPM.
But I fill it up with long island ice tea.

1594
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:41,230
So I was ready when it got
to the neighborhood. This
guy picked a fight with me.

1595
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:46,110
He had just came out of prison. I was
like, I was like, because his old man,

1596
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:50,860
what do you want to fight me? He was like
30, I was 22. Why you want to fight me?

1597
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,883
Did you ask him?

1598
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,210
You got into a fight with him?

1599
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,660
Yeah.
And um,

1600
01:43:55,220 --> 01:44:00,220
because they call me Batman but he'll
call you be like fat man or Whack Matt or

1601
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,700
Huh? Hello? Just, yeah, bad
names. What are they ignoring him?

1602
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:08,270
But he started pushing me and
they're like, I'll take chuck away.

1603
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:12,650
Then he pushed me, then I went for
the sucker punch I have missed.

1604
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:18,130
Oh, how'd that end up? Oh bad cause out.

1605
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:20,240
He caught a punch, be it, I'll paste,

1606
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:25,310
my notes are bleeding and my mother
immediately punch me again. I

1607
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:31,580
but then I started like, I don't
know, he was killing me. You know,

1608
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:33,830
he'll fucking be up.
But oh he got,

1609
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,360
he got rid of just like in a choke hold
one of those holes, you know? Yeah.

1610
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:41,240
I guess a UFC hold they will
call him now to hold. Yeah. Yeah.

1611
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:45,050
But you know people was talking about,
you know, this is what you good move.

1612
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,800
This is what you do if you are
going to do is move, not matter.

1613
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:51,890
This is what you do. You bite them off
earlier off, go left, go right away. Yeah.

1614
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:54,510
For good about whatever they
touch you anywhere else. Yeah.

1615
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,850
You buy through her off they let go man.
Yeah.

1616
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:01,370
I've been happy with can you
let go ahead right there.

1617
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:04,150
She started crying like a little girl.
Whoa.

1618
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:08,810
Cause it's always pinging
him up and you don't matter.

1619
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:12,560
That's one of the, I want to see that
quarter of Carter fight. And though,

1620
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:17,090
you know what happened afterwards and how
it, what led to it, that's a real fight.

1621
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:21,230
Even ever been pudge. You don't, you
don't know what I'm talking about. Yeah.

1622
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:24,320
So the adrenaline was going
and PCP was in my head.

1623
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:28,550
Is it a full bottle?
It took me about it.

1624
01:45:28,551 --> 01:45:32,560
I thought a whipping him look up like
an idle board with a belt. Yeah. Wow.

1625
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:35,600
It's when meg who call
on his face. Yeah. Nice.

1626
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:40,440
But I blacked out after that
other than no anything have a,

1627
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:41,670
but they told me that,
um,

1628
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:46,870
his brother's jumped in and I felt both
of them and they beat me up because I

1629
01:45:46,961 --> 01:45:50,090
knew I had more helicopter
blood on my tee shirt. Whoa.

1630
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:56,180
He paid his fucking ear off. Yeah.
The tip. Did you taste the blood?

1631
01:45:56,240 --> 01:46:00,670
It was, I don't remember better.
What's the, is the feeling in PC?

1632
01:46:00,671 --> 01:46:04,130
Is it body high? Your
whole body? Like you feel

1633
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:09,860
very slow. Very slow.
Hmm. But, uh, but uh,

1634
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:14,360
I guess the anger triggers it. Yeah.
Well, they say sometimes, you know,

1635
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:18,680
talk to cops about, you know, uh,

1636
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:23,710
fights they've been in and how like a
guy who's really amped up on PCP can,

1637
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:27,720
they can have like 10 guys
trying to take them down. Yeah.

1638
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:29,720
We'll fucking keep it.

1639
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:30,860
Correct me if I'm wrong,

1640
01:46:30,861 --> 01:46:35,690
but isn't this one LAPD started using
Taser guns choke holds because of like

1641
01:46:35,691 --> 01:46:39,260
PCP, PCPs. I want to say no, I'm
serious. I think you might be right.

1642
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:43,040
They couldn't like restrain people and
they had to start shooting them with the

1643
01:46:43,041 --> 01:46:45,170
Taser guns.
They might be,

1644
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:48,980
you might be right and if you even got
shot with a Taser on a PCP, you'd be like,

1645
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:51,090
wow, like you was like
your favorite drug. Then

1646
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:55,690
the, the last time I did it was
then. Yeah. Oh Wow. Okay. Well, yeah,

1647
01:46:55,691 --> 01:46:59,350
you put some guys you're off. It's
pretty wild. Yeah. But it's funny,

1648
01:46:59,351 --> 01:47:03,670
like people would just pop
out a PCP joy anywhere.

1649
01:47:03,671 --> 01:47:07,060
Like birthday parties. What? Yeah, man,

1650
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:11,470
I was at a birthday party, like,
come holy the goats, you know,

1651
01:47:11,471 --> 01:47:15,940
like behavior gold with rice and beans,
tortillas and birthday cake.

1652
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,330
They, somebody got a Batman
that it goes to poke a PCP,

1653
01:47:19,331 --> 01:47:22,110
joy over there that's
said, all right. So I,

1654
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:26,530
my foot two bites and a
little of their red smoke,

1655
01:47:26,531 --> 01:47:30,640
the smoke with it and dirty with
it later through in the car.

1656
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:36,990
Ah.
They're like,

1657
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:43,400
Holy Shit. What about,
did you ever do math

1658
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:48,110
crystal meth? Not like,
um, everybody, you know,

1659
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:51,640
when there was some old dead yeah,
I didn't know how to do that.

1660
01:47:51,641 --> 01:47:54,130
Like I thought it was for losers.

1661
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:57,630
Yeah. Well math was popular in the
90s if I recall everyone highs.

1662
01:47:57,631 --> 01:48:02,350
It was cold ice, right? Yeah. Or, yeah.
And you're a stepsister. Yes. Yes,

1663
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,750
that's right. Had a little
problem with it. Yeah.

1664
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:08,680
It was pretty popular in the 90s and
it was always in the clubs when I was a

1665
01:48:08,681 --> 01:48:12,040
goth girl. Ever. All the goths are doing,
you can get into that. No, I didn't.

1666
01:48:12,041 --> 01:48:16,180
I was afraid of it. I was afraid of
it from the stories are what I just,

1667
01:48:16,181 --> 01:48:21,040
I from Nancy Reagan, the dare
program yet, but I did other stuff.

1668
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:25,930
I did LSD. I did, you know, pot, other
shit. I just thought it was nasty.

1669
01:48:25,931 --> 01:48:29,740
I just knew it was synthetic, you know?
Yeah. I didn't know how it was made.

1670
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,800
That's what scared me about math.

1671
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:35,320
It's like just some dude in a basement
or whatever about mushrooms. Yeah.

1672
01:48:35,321 --> 01:48:36,340
Well that's, yeah. You know,

1673
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:41,720
the material for the first time, like
three years ago, really as an adult,

1674
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:45,230
I've never done it before. I wish I
would've done it earlier. Yeah, it's hard.

1675
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:49,490
[inaudible] earlier, they don't know the
drugs because you enjoyed it that much.

1676
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:50,324
Yeah.
Yeah.

1677
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:55,580
I was watching the other watching clothing
culture the first time for the first

1678
01:48:55,581 --> 01:49:00,050
time I'd ever seen him
before. And you would do it on
mushrooms. Yeah. I loved it.

1679
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:01,090
It was awesome,
man.

1680
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:05,000
It went numb when he's building that
mountain out of play with my kneecap.

1681
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,613
No.
Um,

1682
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,040
we've had this ongoing debate going on
here about ride or die for God's sake.

1683
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:18,220
This one, the weigh in on it. Yeah. Well,
here's my scenario. Even married before.

1684
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:21,250
Let's start there and married now
know you, man. Okay. So, yeah. Okay.

1685
01:49:21,251 --> 01:49:25,480
There you go through and
you've got children, so
you're, you've got, yeah. Yeah.

1686
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:30,040
You're fully an adult. Okay. Perfectly.
He's a grown ass man. Go ahead.

1687
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:33,730
So am I asking him if he's going
to tell no, but just whatever.

1688
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:39,050
All right, let's say ask him if
he thinks I'm right or wrong,

1689
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:42,920
but what his life would, yeah, it's a good
idea. How about that? Well, I'll say this.

1690
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:45,470
Let's say,
um,

1691
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,220
tomorrow you're hanging out at the house.

1692
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,170
Your wife has some things to take care of.

1693
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:55,390
She comes back home and she goes,
what's up babe? And you're like,

1694
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:59,020
ah, I gotta tell you something
while you were out today,

1695
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,563
um,

1696
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:05,790
Amazon [inaudible] dropped
off a package and you know,

1697
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:10,450
the, the box was all torn open
and uh, it was all broken,

1698
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:15,070
so I ended up killing the
driver. Um, so anyway,

1699
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:19,900
he's in the trunk of my car. I
just need to go like, handle this.

1700
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:24,901
Now do you think your wife calls the
authorities on you or does she help you

1701
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:27,610
hide the body?

1702
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:28,981
Super.

1703
01:50:28,981 --> 01:50:33,660
Call the authorities really damn oh two.

1704
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:38,390
And what it would put out to kill it
too. You'd have to kill her too. Well,

1705
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:41,390
why is that? Philippe? Walk us
through the logic. Go ahead. Yeah.

1706
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:45,390
Tell us why you think she would tell it.
Turn you in. Because of the murder, man.

1707
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:47,550
You know what have you killed her?

1708
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:51,010
Ooh, that's what I've
been saying. That's magic.

1709
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:54,610
Because if he's going to turn on
the Amazon delivery guy for nothing,

1710
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:57,670
he's going to turn on me. He didn't turn
on the Amazon delivery guy for nothing.

1711
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:00,640
The package was torn open and got it.
Everything was broken.

1712
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:04,390
So he's going to say it, but now you think
he's going to get me next and my kids,

1713
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:05,560
I got to protect the children.

1714
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:09,200
Yeah. Yeah, man. Look at that. You
don't know what's going to happen next.

1715
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:13,600
Oh,
all our time

1716
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:19,110
was two of them. Yeah.
Yeah. And what did you learn

1717
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:23,000
man, when you were up a carpet?
He's got a bird. The floor.

1718
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,333
Yeah.

1719
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:30,950
Have a buddy. The carpet isn't a burden
of the Lord man. Fibers behind. Yeah.

1720
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,180
Little hairs.
Especially the project has curly hair.

1721
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:35,280
They were still unfortunately curly hair.

1722
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:42,500
That is the quote quote of his show is
never kill a person with curly hair.

1723
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:49,400
Uh,
this says that Diaz

1724
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:53,020
his ride or die. Let's see what
this is in a file, Joey. Yeah,

1725
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:56,740
this is
rather die.

1726
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,770
I love you motherfuckers. All
right. Have a phenomenal day.

1727
01:52:00,771 --> 01:52:02,960
Don't let nobody fuck with
you and it's your world,

1728
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:05,700
these motherfuckers and visiting.
All right. If you don't want to eat,

1729
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:10,820
you don't eat it. Don't do it. Just
because, well, my baggy. Fuck. Fuck them.

1730
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:12,170
Fuck them and get rid of them.

1731
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,110
You got to get good people in
your fucking solid fucking savage.

1732
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:17,270
Don't give a fuck.

1733
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,600
If you stab that mother fucker at
three in the morning and you call them,

1734
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,100
they say,
fuck it.

1735
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:24,740
I'm going down to the belly out
and I'm going to stab him again.

1736
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,050
Those were the fucking people you want.
If you don't have those people,

1737
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:31,190
they just fucking acquaintances. You know
what I'm saying? I love you. Stay black.

1738
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:36,750
Boy, that didn't come up
McCullough. Bingo. Bingo.

1739
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:43,760
Bingo.
I love you motherfuckers.

1740
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:49,340
How much do you love Joey
Diaz is the best, but I'm
gladly, but he sides with me.

1741
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:52,190
You're the first guest we've had. So I
don't know that flip his sides with you.

1742
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:56,480
He does, but Phillipa has said that he
thinks his wife would side with you.

1743
01:52:56,660 --> 01:53:00,530
Well, well, but, but he said
that he has, she has to turn.

1744
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:02,540
Oh yeah.
But he's always,

1745
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:06,110
he's going to fucking kill her next
hit when she doesn't know that. Yeah.

1746
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:07,580
He said I got to kill her too.

1747
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,420
I think she wouldn't have turned me in
or getting me at a two hour to get away.

1748
01:53:11,421 --> 01:53:16,400
At least that's the nice thing. Now here's
the thing that's a ride or die move.

1749
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:20,510
Totally right. I would give you a two hour
head start. And that's what writer guy,

1750
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:25,930
sorry, tire up. Wait a
minute. Don't get my yes.

1751
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:28,310
I wouldn't say what'll cause
that'd be kidnapping right there.

1752
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:33,200
But you're already a murderer in.
So now let's flip the scenario.

1753
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:37,190
You get home, you're like, hey, I
got some pastries. And she's like,

1754
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:40,880
I got to tell you something
really bad while you were out. Uh,

1755
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:45,260
I kill the air conditioning guy. Do you,
uh, do you call the authorities on her?

1756
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:49,530
It's your wife who's going to
take care of the kids all around.

1757
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:54,350
I'm asking how was that for the
air conditioning guy is she goes,

1758
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:56,390
I stuffed his body in the closet,

1759
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,280
so are you going to help
me get rid of this or what?

1760
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:06,300
Nah, man, no, let me make
an accomplice. Right. Wow.

1761
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:09,760
So He's thinking he really is
realistic. Turnberry. Really? I like it.

1762
01:54:09,761 --> 01:54:12,640
He's actually putting thought into
it. Yeah. Being very grounded.

1763
01:54:12,641 --> 01:54:15,730
Is that what we call it? Calling
the Popo or why? I was like, oh no,

1764
01:54:15,731 --> 01:54:20,450
we'll call it lawyer first and sort
of what to high. What's we'll do.

1765
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:24,220
Oh, get to the heads. Oh,
smart. Then call the cops.

1766
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:29,410
Then I called the cop cop that I know on
Facebook and then I'm asking what would

1767
01:54:31,421 --> 01:54:34,030
you do?
We just give them a hypothetical.

1768
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:38,430
Imagine if your wife just have
a funny question for Fred here.

1769
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:43,070
What would you do? He'd be like, Philippe,
what are you asking me this for? I Dunno.

1770
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,970
I'm just curious. No, I liked
the way he thinks. Lawyer up.

1771
01:54:45,971 --> 01:54:50,860
Number one call a lawyer. That's actually
the smartest one we've heard. Yeah,

1772
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:53,170
I might do that first and
then give you a two hour.

1773
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,890
I think that's a problem at all. You're
right at the lawyer where he wants to do.

1774
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:02,200
I say, you know, we know where to go out
there and go eat what you want to eat.

1775
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:06,370
Right. To solve it in
an hour. Right. Yeah.

1776
01:55:06,371 --> 01:55:08,290
He probably wouldn't tell
you to go get that last meal.

1777
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:11,530
I never thought of that part. Yeah.
The food ain't too good in prison.

1778
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:17,150
A real like a tried through and through
lawyer with experience would be like get

1779
01:55:17,591 --> 01:55:21,660
laid. Yeah. Get laid, get paid, get.
Yeah, get something to eat and uh,

1780
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:23,470
we'll go,
we'll go after that.

1781
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:26,530
It's kind of stuff I was going
like that if I was gone like that,

1782
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:28,330
even though I'm Vegan now.
Yeah.

1783
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:31,930
I will fucking just eat like three
fucking big males. Yeah. Yeah.

1784
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,940
Are you Vegan? Really? Yeah. No Shit. How
long have you been Vegan? So like 2012.

1785
01:55:37,090 --> 01:55:41,830
That's how long ago was this a
were you prompted by your wife? No,

1786
01:55:41,831 --> 01:55:42,730
I was,
I was,

1787
01:55:42,731 --> 01:55:47,660
I'm doing the Atkins Diet and I was
just eating cheese and meat, but it,

1788
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:49,530
those shit over the Gig or no water.

1789
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:55,080
He'll just soda cheese and meat
that I was constipated because they,

1790
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:59,790
the shit sure. Went to the
mosque class and they're like,

1791
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:04,320
fuck a rip. I will play a lot of shit
lab blood really owe to the people.

1792
01:56:04,321 --> 01:56:05,730
I felt like I was raped by a goes.

1793
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:11,820
So you're saying that the Adkins Diet,
you couldn't take a shit so then yeah.

1794
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:15,280
You were like, I should probably go
to Bama. I will do the vegetables now,

1795
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,210
so I want to be in a,
um,

1796
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:21,250
I started eating just of bishop
shoppers with no more meat. Yeah.

1797
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,430
Yeah, man. Yeah. I guess which door to
our Vegan. Wow. Well, good for you now.

1798
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,920
You feel better now? I feel
better. Yeah, you got it.

1799
01:56:30,921 --> 01:56:34,050
Like nothing but Greens in you.
It's great. How are those dumps now?

1800
01:56:35,210 --> 01:56:39,210
Stick you. Yeah, but easier. Easier. Yeah.

1801
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,850
That's good. Um, so somebody
messaged us the, they said,

1802
01:56:42,851 --> 01:56:46,150
I've been reflecting about your
studies of gender transitions.

1803
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,200
I was especially intrigued a couple
episodes ago when Ari was a guest.

1804
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:54,370
Christina asked who would make the
prettier woman between Ari and Tom.

1805
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:57,640
And then again on the episode
with, uh, Christine Hazel Decker,

1806
01:56:57,641 --> 01:57:01,060
when Christina wondered if town would
make a beautiful woman after transitioning

1807
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:05,530
attached as a graphic I created that
help you better visualize what the

1808
01:57:05,531 --> 01:57:08,740
transitions of some of your favorite
comedy pals might look like. Okay.

1809
01:57:09,070 --> 01:57:12,450
Definitely some handsome ladies
in this bunch. Uh, enjoy.

1810
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:16,090
Thanks for making me laugh. Genes, Chloe.
All right. Here's what Chloe made up here.

1811
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,110
Oh my God.

1812
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:20,860
Oh, whoa. There you aren't Tommy.

1813
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:24,020
I looked like such a slut
with no facial hair though.

1814
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:28,750
I know your eyebrows are not on
fleek. I mean, Ari does. He does.

1815
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,150
Joey, Joey's aerify, Frito Flintstone.

1816
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:36,460
Burt looks just like a fat southern
lady, right? He looks like the, um,

1817
01:57:36,490 --> 01:57:41,290
the ghost whisperer or wait, no,
the second theme. Yeah. Yeah.

1818
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,840
I was kind of something. Yeah.
Let's also kind of like the,

1819
01:57:43,841 --> 01:57:48,841
what's the fat racist holiday
holiday kind of that race a chef.

1820
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:54,250
Yeah. I could see him being like, I
gotta tell y'all something really medium.

1821
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:58,840
Yeah. Medium. That's right.
Um, and then Joe. Oh,

1822
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:03,070
Joe kind of looks like a slot. Who's
been through some shit, right? Yeah.

1823
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:07,750
She definitely only knows to blow you
on a first date. That's what she said.

1824
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:11,030
That's her compromised. Yeah. She's
like, I had a good time. I blew him. You.

1825
01:58:11,070 --> 01:58:15,530
I also think it has to do with the
highlights. They made her look sluttier.

1826
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:20,890
Yeah. Your makeup. All your
makeup's terrible. Ari is
like made to be a woman. Yeah.

1827
01:58:20,891 --> 01:58:24,820
He looks way better than you guys.
Joey actually looks like some Cuban women.

1828
01:58:24,821 --> 01:58:29,590
I've seen it and has heard that lady
that a booklet party show called how many

1829
01:58:29,591 --> 01:58:34,180
soda you drink?
That was soda to drag already

1830
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:43,480
a man. You look terrible. I look
like I've been through some shit,

1831
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:48,670
I think Bible where people, yeah,
let's rank them on the ugliest Joey.

1832
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:52,570
I'm sorry Joey. I love you, but not a good
woman. He's number one. I'm the ugliest.

1833
01:58:52,820 --> 01:58:56,380
Then probably now I'm going to
go to birds. Terrible. Yeah.

1834
01:58:56,740 --> 01:59:00,010
I think because of the fillings. You
know what this looks like to skin tones.

1835
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:02,350
You know what this woman looks
like to me? The, the Burt woman,

1836
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:07,720
like a really sad woman who
puts out a positive vibe. Yeah,

1837
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:08,760
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1838
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:14,700
More like GCF for the manager
everywhere she goes. Definitely. Yeah.

1839
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:17,230
She like she asked for the manager,
which is also like,

1840
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:19,870
I just feel like she's
like, oh, y'all, uh, how,

1841
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,670
how are things with you
all doing right now?

1842
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:26,710
And then you find out who filed for
bankruptcy. The inside is chaos. It's all,

1843
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:30,760
it's all fucked up. Yeah. Yeah.
Um, and I are pretty tight.

1844
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,350
Pretty. You're number one for the ugliest,
ugliest, first place. Joe Eds. Okay.

1845
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:40,420
Second place. Bert Kreischer.
Yeah. Burnt Chrysler. Sorry, Tommy.

1846
01:59:40,421 --> 01:59:44,770
I'm going to give you third place for
the ugliest welcome for us Joe Rogan.

1847
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:48,590
And then the prettiest is Ari. So
Ari was right. She's the prettiest,

1848
01:59:48,591 --> 01:59:53,050
prettiest transitioned woman. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. You feel like it?

1849
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:57,010
Yeah, go ahead. Would you rank them for
leaping ahead? Exactly like that? Yeah.

1850
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:02,050
Tommy, what do you think?
Yeah, I mean I will go like,

1851
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:07,320
I will go wah, like prettiest
one, two, three, four, five.

1852
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:12,530
Who is the other one is here. One
is Ari to his top three. Yeah.

1853
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:17,080
Three store Forzberg five five,
five. Yeah. That's the order. Yeah,

1854
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:21,010
yeah, yeah. Joey's looks amazing.

1855
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:28,360
Yeah. Some Shit, Huh? Yeah, she was,

1856
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:32,360
she was rode hard, you know, in
her, in her younger days, messy.

1857
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:35,110
You are kind of like a girl,

1858
02:00:35,190 --> 02:00:37,930
but I also looked at it a little bit like
a burn victim because they had to like

1859
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:42,220
pencil off my beard. Makeup's not
great for any of you guys. Yeah.

1860
02:00:42,221 --> 02:00:45,790
But they are able to find a
hairless photos of the other guy.

1861
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:49,250
You look like no bullshit though. You
know what I mean? You're kind of a means.

1862
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:51,200
I've been hurt. I've been hurt. Yeah.

1863
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:54,580
This woman's been hurt a lot
and you know what? I'm not,

1864
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:58,260
I'm not going to get hurt again. You're in
law school too, you know, fucking shows.

1865
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,970
Oh yeah. Yeah. I learned
to read as an adult. Yeah.

1866
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:06,700
I'm teaching myself the law. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. You're no nonsense.

1867
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:10,660
You're a single mom, so, oh, this is total
single. You're single mom. Yeah. Yeah.

1868
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:15,070
Ari is just that college slut.
I'm like, don't you feel like he,

1869
02:01:15,071 --> 02:01:16,900
this is a women's studies he gets,

1870
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:22,060
he gets muddied by the whole seven
cruise up. Yeah. The whole crew's there,

1871
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:24,310
but on the download. Oh
yeah. But he's a fan. Yes.

1872
02:01:24,311 --> 02:01:28,440
He's in feminine style or women's
Studies. Yeah. Everything's okay.

1873
02:01:30,090 --> 02:01:33,990
I'm not going to his dorm or holes,
bounce of that ass all over our floor.

1874
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:38,900
Nick new tico modest in the seventh
floor. Seven train. All of them.

1875
02:01:38,901 --> 02:01:40,230
You so don't bring on

1876
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:45,110
lasers. We're gonna run a seven man
train up all in you. All up in you. Yeah.

1877
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:49,910
Jeez. You ever heard of that damn
seven floor crew? He sees some shit.

1878
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,690
I seen some shit. Some Shit, man. Yeah.

1879
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:56,900
I went to a swingers
bar and um, Phoenix. Oh,

1880
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,940
I didn't know they had that many,
that many.

1881
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:02,540
I feel like Arizona is a lot of swinging
a lot of shit out there if he makes man.

1882
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:05,600
Yeah. Florida clovers shit. Yeah.

1883
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,750
Uh, the PR, one of the,

1884
02:02:06,751 --> 02:02:11,070
a friend of mine told me
that he was hanging out at
a club one I comedy club and

1885
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:12,000
place shut down.

1886
02:02:12,001 --> 02:02:16,820
So it was just like a green room hang
out and an orgy busted off. No. Wow.

1887
02:02:16,860 --> 02:02:17,470
Yeah,

1888
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:20,140
the happened or that
happened when the orgy,

1889
02:02:20,141 --> 02:02:23,370
but people get a lap dance after the
comedy show at some place. Some show.

1890
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:28,000
I didn't think Scottsdale Low Scottsdale
here in la somewhere. Oh here.

1891
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:28,873
My promoter.

1892
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,733
Hmm.

1893
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:33,040
And it just kind of went from there a
little while to get our lab lap dances.

1894
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:34,690
We haven't even got paid.

1895
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:41,290
I left a show one time and Ontario and
the next day that the guys were like,

1896
02:02:41,291 --> 02:02:43,850
why'd you leave last night man?
She got really crazy to hear that.

1897
02:02:43,851 --> 02:02:48,850
And I suppose I'm saying that Shit.
No, it was, the staff was like, yeah,

1898
02:02:48,851 --> 02:02:49,180
I got,

1899
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:54,180
we had to forcibly ask people to leave
because they were doing some not so legal

1900
02:02:55,061 --> 02:02:59,110
things in our green room. I was like, Oh
shit. Couple of our friends were there.

1901
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:02,570
Wow. Okay. People we know like
not going to say anymore on that.

1902
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:06,220
I think I should probably not. It was
a long time ago. I'll tell you off

1903
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:10,010
Florida is fucking weird. I've
been Hartford, you know. Hey,

1904
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:13,370
there's a hot tub back at our house
like by the owner and his wife.

1905
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:16,580
If you want to join us in the hot tub.
A lot of swingers in Florida.

1906
02:03:16,581 --> 02:03:17,414
A lot of swingers.
Yeah.

1907
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:21,190
Hot Tub is always the move. That's how
you get people to fuck thankful for,

1908
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:24,650
for people that want to fuck more
as I got hot tub. Yeah. Yeah.

1909
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,760
It's that by like, oh, doing a
show. And that's the city by sure.

1910
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:32,180
There'll be a lady with three.
Terry's

1911
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:38,540
their prosthetic, I guess. Yeah,
but she just put a fake TV. Why?

1912
02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:41,660
But they'll tell you what she's going to,
she might go to the show.

1913
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:44,840
She didn't go to the show.
Whatever. I got to see her

1914
02:03:45,090 --> 02:03:49,620
like in what movie was that? Total
recall exactly that. That, yeah,

1915
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:54,210
but the third teddy
damn. Unreal. Unreal man.

1916
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:58,720
Be Great for breastfeeding.
I know. Right? Um,

1917
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:00,840
and then you also, by the way,
I didn't want to forget this.

1918
02:04:00,841 --> 02:04:04,290
You're one of the few guys I would
feel like, I feel like there was like,

1919
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:08,610
I'm probably underscoring it,
but you did last comic. Yeah.

1920
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:10,640
And I dunno,

1921
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:15,680
I feel like there's probably five or
six people that that show was actually

1922
02:04:16,621 --> 02:04:18,360
designed for.
In other words,

1923
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:22,770
good comic gets great exposure
and then capitalize on it.

1924
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:28,080
And you're one of those like five or 6:00
PM because a lot of people in the like,

1925
02:04:28,081 --> 02:04:30,720
you know, in the execution of the
show you realize you're like, oh,

1926
02:04:30,721 --> 02:04:34,120
they weren't ready for this show. Yeah,
they were just on the show. But it,

1927
02:04:34,121 --> 02:04:38,100
but it had 30 minutes. Yeah. But
you're one of the people was able to

1928
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,730
make, was that a fun thing to
do? Yeah, I thought it was fine.

1929
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:45,210
Like a lot of the top five comedians,

1930
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:48,990
they already been the real headline
before there had been a Letterman,

1931
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,930
they'd been on stuff that didn't
have it. They even had what, six,

1932
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:55,380
seven and who like who was
in like your final few?

1933
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:59,850
And my final one was Roy was jr,

1934
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:03,330
he's a very funny Mike Kaplan.
Yeah.

1935
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:07,710
I know my homies from Mike Destefano.
He, he died rest in peace and um,

1936
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:13,890
Tommy John Again. Yeah. Good
comics in your final five.

1937
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,230
But the people that were
like at the top 20, top 40,

1938
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:19,360
they were also did well like
Christian alone. So she got up,

1939
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:25,430
she got her show and Tiffany Haddish
and no rail and they were all on your

1940
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:30,690
episode. Yeah, that's a good lineup.
There's some, there's like over the years,

1941
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:34,770
I mean it always stood out to me
like people who were ready for it.

1942
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:39,840
I think Ralph, he was obviously
somebody who was perfect for him.

1943
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:43,950
Uh, Bowden was really ready for it. Um,

1944
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,150
uh, you, I didn't realize him. Rod, man,

1945
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:51,860
he's ready. He's been
doing it forever. Yeah.

1946
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:56,910
I can't name him after that.
The last winter wasn't even
announced on television.

1947
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,170
Seriously. That's true. Who else do
we know of us? We sit in my email

1948
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:06,740
was a bunch of claps emojis.
It's pretty good.

1949
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:12,000
I didn't know like TV so thorough.
You know, they check everything,

1950
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:16,750
the background check I was going
to get into the show because, um,

1951
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:20,440
they found out that I had a bench warrant.
I didn't go to,

1952
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:24,870
I think I failed to appear
at court three times. Ooh.

1953
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:29,220
So that they're looking for me still.
But it wasn't me. I told the cop,

1954
02:06:29,221 --> 02:06:32,220
I told him private investigator for
NBC and the lawyer looks at Man,

1955
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:36,280
I got arrested one time and the only
person who knows about that as Canada when

1956
02:06:36,281 --> 02:06:39,530
they go together, then you got to
rest in Canada? No, but it all,

1957
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:41,730
it only shows I got to the
outright. Right, right.

1958
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,470
That's the only one that it comes up.

1959
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:47,700
So it was my brother and my brother
committed those crimes, not me.

1960
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:53,000
So I have to go find a photo of my brother
and then they compared the first one,

1961
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:56,730
I lucked up with a person who didn't
get locked up. They let me go,

1962
02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:01,650
no shit. But there was a comedian
on a show that I know personally,

1963
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:05,730
they cut him out of the photo because
they were going to kick him out of the

1964
02:07:05,731 --> 02:07:10,320
show anyways because of a criminal or
something. So when they took the photo,

1965
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:15,980
I saw that they grabbed him and put him
on the left side and they cut him on a

1966
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:18,870
other shit. That's fucked up, huh?

1967
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:25,490
So what I want $250,000 back by
son's mom filed for child support.

1968
02:07:27,370 --> 02:07:31,800
Go light material.
She be,

1969
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:35,710
she be killed. The lab baby mama
standing, he followed next day,

1970
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:40,420
the next day she got
like $140,000 tax on that

1971
02:07:42,330 --> 02:07:47,110
plus the after like 10% of all that I
felt like in that movie with Tina Turner,

1972
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:48,700
I just walked by name.

1973
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:57,410
So we may have a $250,000 winning prize.
Yeah,

1974
02:07:57,450 --> 02:07:58,620
two kids.
And um,

1975
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:04,980
that's what I don't understand how like
you could all just $25,000 in child

1976
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:08,550
support, but um, every
month you don't pay,

1977
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:12,990
they add another 300 and it keeps adding
up and if he's adding what you keep up

1978
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,640
the two 50 you, you kept like, like a
hundred or something. You got ID at 90.

1979
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:21,610
It's all good. All right man. Well yeah,
but here's the thing though, for you,

1980
02:08:21,611 --> 02:08:23,710
that wasn't like the,
that's what I'm saying.

1981
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:25,660
It wasn't like the one off
you want and then you're done.

1982
02:08:25,661 --> 02:08:29,740
You were able to like parlay it and we
went on a tour on a 85 city tour and I

1983
02:08:29,741 --> 02:08:33,990
got paid like extra more than the
contestants who did it win. Yeah.

1984
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:37,660
And I got paid more than them,
so I got 85 serious.

1985
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:40,360
It was like an extra chunk of money.
That's awesome.

1986
02:08:40,361 --> 02:08:43,580
But I mean you've also since then,
just never stopped working.

1987
02:08:43,581 --> 02:08:47,080
I never stopped working. I'm very
busy. Yeah, it's great. It's awesome.

1988
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:51,520
But then my special ed data on showtime,
it did well showtime.

1989
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:55,090
But then when the people saw it,
but then they sold it to a,

1990
02:08:55,170 --> 02:09:00,000
to Netflix and that did really well.
And then you also did an HBO one. Yeah.

1991
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:01,660
Yeah.
And um,

1992
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:07,780
I got to think the Netflix or the
new president, he is the guy from,

1993
02:09:07,781 --> 02:09:11,140
I think Montreal comedy festival.
So that guy,

1994
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:15,870
when he joined [inaudible] he put my
special backup on Netflix. That's awesome.

1995
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:19,810
I have, I explored and
athletics. So congratulations.

1996
02:09:19,811 --> 02:09:22,180
I'm working on doing another
one, man. I'm going to do a,

1997
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:24,820
hopefully I'll do a half
hour special and Spanish.

1998
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:27,520
Do you performance the Hell No.

1999
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:30,940
So when I learned how to speak
English at four years old,

2000
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:36,510
so he spoke fluent Spanish for four
years and now and now I'm not fluent in

2001
02:09:36,941 --> 02:09:39,580
Spanish so I don't know all the words.
Can I ask you this?

2002
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:43,510
If you were going to do a half
hour special, would you do,

2003
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:49,030
um, you, would you work your act out
in English and then just translate it?

2004
02:09:49,230 --> 02:09:51,030
Yeah. That's how you do it. Yeah.

2005
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:55,720
I've thought about trying to do a set
in Spanish or thinking of doing the set

2006
02:09:55,721 --> 02:10:00,270
from my old special cause easier, but then
now I just want to do it all new. Yeah.

2007
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:02,500
But he's going to be tough
man because I don't know what,

2008
02:10:02,501 --> 02:10:06,310
I didn't even know what they like
or what's going to be offensive.

2009
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:09,170
I think it was, was his, who's Trey Hill?

2010
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:12,040
And I just Google the other.

2011
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:17,130
I just wrote down my bits and have Google
translate it. Oh and you had the uh,

2012
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:20,500
yeah. Did you do it? Yeah,
I did it. How'd it go?

2013
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:25,500
Did it went okay?
I got to look at word like Hermaphrodite

2014
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:31,420
I'm intimidated by it. I'll be honest.
Cause I just feel like it's not the, uh,

2015
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:33,980
the language of it,
which I definitely

2016
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,830
would have to, you know,
practice. But I always feel,

2017
02:10:36,831 --> 02:10:39,710
I feel like is the way that I do stand up.

2018
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:43,970
So in tune with American culture that,
that,

2019
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:48,150
you know, like then I'll
say it and there'll be like,
this is fucking weird bands.

2020
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:49,223
It's not about that.

2021
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,190
Yeah. I mean standup is all
about cultural contexts,

2022
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:54,730
old knowing the boundaries
and knowing it really well.

2023
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:58,850
That's why it's such a miracle.
Understand that sensibility. Right?

2024
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:03,790
Cs a non native English speaker do
stand up in America and you're like,

2025
02:11:03,791 --> 02:11:08,200
how the fuck did you, there's
this Japanese girl, um, I
ego, I think her name is.

2026
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:12,640
Anyway, she does Sam. She's
hilarious. Yeah. Is that, do
you know, I'm telling you,

2027
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:17,030
I go right. Hey, cool. Yeah, she's great.
And I'm like, how the fuck are you doing?

2028
02:11:17,050 --> 02:11:20,860
She's a, came over as an
adult, I'm assuming. So, yeah.

2029
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:25,390
Then how do you figure out what, what I
gotta do it? Are you going to do the I,

2030
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:29,880
they asked me, hey, Susan asked me, uh,
uh, what's his name? Francisco Ramos.

2031
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:34,320
Oh yeah. They've told me that they
both do like to all Spanish shows.

2032
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:35,423
I got to try it.

2033
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:36,360
I did Spanish.

2034
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:41,200
I'll put together like a seven minute
set once for us by the television show.

2035
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:44,270
They went well nice. But it was
all my joyful in the first measure.

2036
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:47,420
So last set of punch line.
Yeah. I don't know what you call

2037
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:52,240
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2038
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:56,690
[inaudible] [inaudible] per day,
Huh?

2039
02:11:57,730 --> 02:12:00,070
Oh Man. It saves the team
but won't have sex with you.

2040
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:05,000
I met the woman that I have stayed
asleep with bootcamp and he sex,

2041
02:12:05,710 --> 02:12:06,680
he'll write it tomorrow morning

2042
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:09,310
cause you're getting no food.
Yeah.

2043
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:13,850
I think your style will actually
is better for translating. Yes.

2044
02:12:13,851 --> 02:12:16,550
Because you are very clear cut,
set up joke.

2045
02:12:16,551 --> 02:12:21,551
Right where like I ramble and like my
joke might be here in a three minute long

2046
02:12:22,851 --> 02:12:25,940
thing. You might be able to pull off
joke, joke, joke, joke, joke. Yeah.

2047
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:29,010
But I want to do the special,
like if I get a chance to do this better,

2048
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:33,130
I want to do it just for like
American and Spanish speakers. Yeah.

2049
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:34,910
I don't want to go to
Mexico. Dude. Over there.

2050
02:12:34,911 --> 02:12:38,900
You know I'm to Telemundo style
balance, right. I'm getting old Spanish.

2051
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:44,200
So if you get a ghetto ghetto Spanish
people who barely speaks English like you

2052
02:12:44,271 --> 02:12:47,120
know like the people that
we see all the time. Yeah.

2053
02:12:47,150 --> 02:12:51,020
Those guys like the people who sell
the bootlegs, those guys. Yeah.

2054
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:52,543
Yeah,

2055
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:55,400
yeah. Cause there's such a
different, the Latin culture,

2056
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:59,930
what's a show we watch that's, it's not
called Sabado Domingo, but I love it.

2057
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:03,640
Come on man. When we were in Florida
and Miami, we were in the hotel room.

2058
02:13:03,650 --> 02:13:08,390
We were sick. Nah, still been
Domingo. Which one? I like Domingo.

2059
02:13:08,391 --> 02:13:10,150
It's on for like six hours.
And that guy,

2060
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:11,363
yes.

2061
02:13:13,530 --> 02:13:17,480
Right. See that sense of humor.
Like I kind of, I could kind of,

2062
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:22,070
it doesn't translate. I forget his name.
What's his name? He's been a forever.

2063
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:25,560
Yeah,
he's German.

2064
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:30,800
He's German but raised in Chile and got
caught by the way guys worth like $4

2065
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:35,580
million cause yes, I know that show
and he's been doing it forever. But he,

2066
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:36,720
I'll go on,

2067
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:41,520
I'll turn that on and literally feel
like I don't understand Spanish.

2068
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:45,710
Like he can be too. Half of his, why?
Why is that? Because of his accent.

2069
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:50,520
His references is also like, like what
he's like, where is it? Show films,

2070
02:13:50,521 --> 02:13:54,510
where is their building? Miami I think,
but he's to lay in. But it's like,

2071
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:57,960
it's so ingrained in like,
you know,

2072
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:03,000
in the now of what's funny and also,
you know,

2073
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:07,720
you can joke with expressions
and terms that it's,

2074
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:12,600
it's that are kind of on the out outlying,
you know,

2075
02:14:12,601 --> 02:14:17,130
border of, of the lexicon. Right?
So if you start saying like,

2076
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:20,680
even something like, you know what
I'm saying, you know that that's,

2077
02:14:20,681 --> 02:14:24,300
that's not how you would learn English,
but that's how people speak English.

2078
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:29,400
So he's doing the equivalent in Spanish
and like making reference to, uh,

2079
02:14:29,401 --> 02:14:31,560
you know, maybe a, a soccer star,

2080
02:14:31,561 --> 02:14:36,150
his wife that everybody knows
in Mexico and like a politician.

2081
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,610
It's specific. Yeah. Is
references you don't get.

2082
02:14:38,611 --> 02:14:43,590
And it's also phrases that I'm like
completely out of touch with. Right. So,

2083
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:48,030
because even the slang varies just
like here and in, and in Britain,

2084
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:52,140
the English slang varies.
And you have to remember in Spanish,

2085
02:14:52,290 --> 02:14:55,410
the slang varies from country to country.
From Mexico,

2086
02:14:55,411 --> 02:15:00,320
Guatemala to Columbia to
Peru and Argentina. All the
slang is different things.

2087
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:03,990
Yeah. Town to town, man.
So I dunno, I, I watched,

2088
02:15:03,991 --> 02:15:08,991
I've watched that guy for an hour before
and picked up on like two jokes of a

2089
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:14,010
hundred. I bet. And you know,
it's cool that that show is it,

2090
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:19,070
they'll do like comedy sketches and
then they'll do like a paternity test.

2091
02:15:19,790 --> 02:15:21,870
Yeah. Yeah. It'll be
like super serious. Yeah.

2092
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:25,670
Then the next segment, then the
glow light, the new glow, like

2093
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:32,500
Maria [inaudible], most dual mama,

2094
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:38,810
like I'll quiet Medea Mama.
And they both are at the moment,

2095
02:15:38,811 --> 02:15:40,970
35 years.
They'll tell you that she left,

2096
02:15:40,971 --> 02:15:44,840
her daughter hears Oprah adoption
to be wonderful. Her mom was,

2097
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:48,710
and then there's little patchy
look bar comes up poor as hell.

2098
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:54,250
Like the girls like rich, now that
we well, okay. That was really good.

2099
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:56,720
Okay, man. She, she's, she has
to give her her daughter, man.

2100
02:15:56,721 --> 02:15:59,180
She don't want to be like this.
Yeah, yeah. It, it was dusk.

2101
02:15:59,181 --> 02:16:03,800
Dads would I choose here on television?
Funny Man.

2102
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:08,030
Yeah. Pour the tears and he's, he's a kid.

2103
02:16:08,031 --> 02:16:12,930
Gloves where product placement. Yeah, he's
a smart thing is for sale in Nashville.

2104
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:17,790
I didn't, did you do, have
you done that show that I did?
Um, yeah, that's worth it.

2105
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:21,010
My step. Me, I think it was Joe Diaz,
you guys did that show together.

2106
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:25,540
Maybe you look at the video, he's talking
real fast. If Georgia has forwarding,

2107
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:30,570
is piracy. Wow. Deep two top
poppy. Yeah, that's a Ito, Papi.

2108
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:34,180
That's like him. Say it over
and over. He's fast too. Yeah.

2109
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:38,380
Well you that you play dude, here's
the other thing. They put you aside,

2110
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:44,370
pull you aside and they go, Hey,
uh, this is a Latino television.

2111
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:49,410
Like yeah, no, no shit. Yeah.
He's like, so you have to
do everything bigger, right?

2112
02:16:49,411 --> 02:16:50,490
You have to do everything bigger.

2113
02:16:50,491 --> 02:16:55,491
Which also by the way plays against
my instinct for comedy in English,

2114
02:16:57,271 --> 02:16:59,610
which is to play everything smaller.
Right.

2115
02:16:59,611 --> 02:17:02,790
And you let the small stand out.
Right?

2116
02:17:02,791 --> 02:17:06,600
So it's like saying something
and you're not showing it, right?

2117
02:17:06,601 --> 02:17:09,330
Like that's kind of your instinct.
So you know,

2118
02:17:09,331 --> 02:17:12,240
they had did this thing where we played
this game and then they pour beer down

2119
02:17:12,241 --> 02:17:16,110
my pants. Yes. And so
when they like they go,

2120
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:19,980
the first time I reacted, the guys
like react bigger. He's like, Yo,

2121
02:17:20,010 --> 02:17:23,760
it's for Latinos, like you have to.
So, so then I did it like jokey.

2122
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:25,013
So they poured down

2123
02:17:25,410 --> 02:17:29,640
like Hawaii and they were
like, that's perfect.

2124
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:30,773
Like keep doing it.

2125
02:17:31,380 --> 02:17:36,060
Or they did a, we did a game where they
bring out like a beautiful girl in a, uh,

2126
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:40,920
in a zip up in a, like a gold. One
piece is zip up and they're like,

2127
02:17:41,330 --> 02:17:44,580
uh, we're going to put
items hidden on her body,

2128
02:17:44,610 --> 02:17:49,610
inside her zip up and you put your hands
on her and you guessed what the item is

2129
02:17:50,190 --> 02:17:54,150
and they tell you ahead of time, we're
going to swap her out and put a guy there.

2130
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:58,560
That's the joke is that you think
you're touching a girl. But again,

2131
02:17:58,561 --> 02:18:01,140
they were like, but
overplay it, overplay it.

2132
02:18:01,141 --> 02:18:03,060
So like you put your hand in and I'm like,
yeah,

2133
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:06,140
oh cool.

2134
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:10,160
Deanna, like that stuff.
And they were like, so,

2135
02:18:10,161 --> 02:18:13,310
and then of course when you find
out they don't want you to go,

2136
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:15,530
it's a guy you have to go like

2137
02:18:15,650 --> 02:18:17,020
hi.

2138
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:20,430
So it was,
it was,

2139
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:26,490
that's what I learned in Spanish class
in high school. Okay. Lasting mark.

2140
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:29,320
It was like no one says that shit crazy.
That's,

2141
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:32,720
it's hard to do all those stuff because
you go in and tell you something,

2142
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:34,140
I don't do none of this shit.
Yeah.

2143
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:38,050
And I did one love his show,

2144
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:42,290
but a of another show
that could test and I was,

2145
02:18:42,291 --> 02:18:46,830
it was these two, like these two girls,
they were actresses who were real pretty.

2146
02:18:46,831 --> 02:18:51,831
There would a kiss sitting next to me
and our heads were sticking out of this

2147
02:18:52,051 --> 02:18:56,910
little cage. And then I guess dumb stuff
on top of us if somebody gets it wrong.

2148
02:18:57,770 --> 02:19:00,300
So there's the w the pretty
one of was both pretty,

2149
02:19:00,301 --> 02:19:03,570
but they thought she was alive.
Expected.

2150
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:08,160
She's like makeup Dodd looking all cute.
They dump dirt on her

2151
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:10,853
fucking dirt,

2152
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:17,780
bunch of fertilizer at grass and then
they put a bucket of crickets down.

2153
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:24,400
Damn right there. The other
growth that what the hell she is.

2154
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:29,390
They dumped like hot sauce
is beginning songs. Chips.

2155
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:32,910
They must have been so pissed
about the directly. Okay.

2156
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:34,340
It can't be that bad for me.

2157
02:19:34,860 --> 02:19:39,740
Mad the tub like all like teen
dirt that we're it. Goggles,

2158
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:41,630
fuck this.
I don't want to eat none of this shit.

2159
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:46,960
I closed my mouth and I looked down
and there were like 30 scorpions.

2160
02:19:47,830 --> 02:19:50,810
Why hasn't even started
looking for this bad fuck.

2161
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:52,980
I'll do it for 300 bucks though.
So a

2162
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:59,740
real fucking scorpions and I don't even
know like a Scorpion will have their own

2163
02:20:00,441 --> 02:20:01,910
agenda, you know? Yeah.

2164
02:20:01,970 --> 02:20:06,620
Cause they said fuck for Lipez eyes
this night that this book is Cobra was

2165
02:20:06,621 --> 02:20:10,850
talking Shit to me. Left
bucket bucket toward students.

2166
02:20:11,630 --> 02:20:16,630
They go free these fucking like they would
add each other bad like it was like a

2167
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:18,110
prison.

2168
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:23,060
Inmates getting let out of the hole
is the only chance to fight hold.

2169
02:20:23,070 --> 02:20:26,030
So those go, it went out and
they left me alone. Oh my God.

2170
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:29,900
You thought is screaming like you
did. I went big Bro. Ah, they love it.

2171
02:20:29,901 --> 02:20:34,370
It has been one of my mouth.
You Scorpions crazy,

2172
02:20:34,430 --> 02:20:37,490
I guess are the ones you eat. I guess. I
don't know what fucking show is is again,

2173
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:40,880

2174
02:20:41,430 --> 02:20:45,050
10. That's brutal though. Yeah. I
didn't realize I got that wrong.

2175
02:20:45,430 --> 02:20:49,680
They're the blindfold you and they slap
you with a Burrito. Is it again? What,

2176
02:20:49,681 --> 02:20:52,170
what type it is? I saw that. Yeah,

2177
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:54,620
but that seems funnier.
Like lighthearted. Yeah.

2178
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:59,540
Not Putting Scorpions on poor
guys. Hey, crickets crisis. We get,

2179
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:01,650
he saw that.
Sue them for something like that.

2180
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,800
It's pretty crazy money to sign
something before you did that shit.

2181
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:09,620
No, that was coming, ma'am. Liberte
asking me back and go listen man,

2182
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:14,630
because I don't want to get slapped by
loaf parish. I, it would've put out,

2183
02:21:14,631 --> 02:21:18,530
I don't want to put my face in the
quarry of foot of lobsters. No Way, man.

2184
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:24,800
And they're like, [inaudible]
it up. You're like, I got
it. Yeah. I don't want a boy.

2185
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:29,150
I don't want to be thrown
at me. Unreal. Mosquitoes,

2186
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:31,220
mosquitoes,
caterpillars.

2187
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:36,660
Um, somebody asked here, they
said, uh, can Tom point out
where this guy went wrong?

2188
02:21:37,090 --> 02:21:40,230
What should he have done differently?
How would Tom go about this?

2189
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:43,290
Let me show you what this is. Gene, maybe
you have an opinion on this too. Okay.

2190
02:21:43,650 --> 02:21:47,370
We'll leave a shocking case of a
customer behaving badly at a fast food

2191
02:21:47,371 --> 02:21:51,450
restaurant. New West police are searching
for a Sass back to got way out of hand,

2192
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:52,201
throwing a drink,

2193
02:21:52,201 --> 02:21:56,540
allegedly assaulting a
customer and damaging retail
equipment apparently. Okay.

2194
02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:01,460
Over a frozen beverage. Is that
you Tommy? It doesn't shock me.

2195
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:07,200
I have very strict guidelines for my
drinks. You know, at coffee shops.

2196
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:10,680
This guy, I think when the men
in pink is about to lose it,

2197
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:11,970
when words are exchanged,

2198
02:22:12,030 --> 02:22:15,180
fingers are pointed and that
glass that just got cleaned,

2199
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:17,040
it's about to get really dirty.

2200
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:21,210
This September six fast food restaurant
assault or the peers should be sparked

2201
02:22:21,211 --> 02:22:25,500
by a Tim Horton's ice camp. I guess the
order was wrong. It was incorrect. Oh,

2202
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:25,990
you think

2203
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:28,850
you're the only coffee blended
drink over the counter.

2204
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:31,750
This irate individual
begins kicking and yelling,

2205
02:22:31,810 --> 02:22:36,250
stopping briefly to check his phone
before moving off screen to let off even

2206
02:22:36,251 --> 02:22:37,084
more steam.

2207
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:40,860
The reportedly punched and kicked somebody
who tried to intervene after he was

2208
02:22:40,861 --> 02:22:44,070
insulting and degrading the staff.

2209
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:47,690
This guy, he's cute. He's got it together.

2210
02:22:47,691 --> 02:22:49,430
It looks like he's got PCP that works out

2211
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:52,970
PCP. Yeah man. Good steroids, eyes,

2212
02:22:56,870 --> 02:23:01,490
five foot six man wasn't computer
printer and gift cards. Go Fly.

2213
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:03,770
Police want to id him

2214
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:04,261
to us.

2215
02:23:04,261 --> 02:23:09,261
It's concerning that somebody could
become this I rate and this upset over

2216
02:23:09,550 --> 02:23:10,383
workout

2217
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:14,340
over incorrect order.
I think it makes a lot of

2218
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:17,860
Tim Horton's employees have had
to deal with a lot lately in May.

2219
02:23:17,890 --> 02:23:21,070
A woman desiccated and tossed
the mess inside of Langley.

2220
02:23:21,071 --> 02:23:24,760
Tim Horton's now the newest Smith's g
man eventually took off leaving one heck

2221
02:23:24,761 --> 02:23:27,460
of a mess.
You know what they say about the customer?

2222
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:32,410
A little lazy and he just told her totally
Sinjun Alexandra, CTV news Vancouver.

2223
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,450
What's that?
Lazy that they lady right there

2224
02:23:37,370 --> 02:23:41,670
doing there now did you be filling
it up with food or something?

2225
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:46,780
The Lazy like pretty sure
that guy probably tired of
her lazy ass. There you go.

2226
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:49,960
You probably goes into it all the
time. They keep fucking that up. Yeah.

2227
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:54,700
They have a personal gripe with him and
he went to go too far, but I can see it.

2228
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:58,510
They don't make lazy employees.
Thank you. I tend to agree with you.

2229
02:23:58,511 --> 02:24:02,830
I mean it's like I've asked for extra
ice every time you're going to come from

2230
02:24:02,831 --> 02:24:07,240
Burger King and you, you, you got your
soda like four ice. I hate that shit.

2231
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:09,480
Like [inaudible] where he could feel it

2232
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:13,790
swishing in there. He could just tell how
lazy, what to just grab. Yeah, exactly.

2233
02:24:13,791 --> 02:24:16,860
He just tapped it. I do that thing
where they go like, uh, they're,

2234
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:19,520
they're kind of dicks about it.
Sometimes when you go,

2235
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:22,850
I always ask for extra ice in my car,
my ice coffee.

2236
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:28,070
So they'll either put five cubes and
where I go, hey man, is this extra eyes?

2237
02:24:28,071 --> 02:24:32,900
And they're like, yeah. I'm like, okay. Or
the person goes, oh, you want extra eyes?

2238
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:33,793
Okay.

2239
02:24:33,890 --> 02:24:38,750
And they pack it so full of ice
that you can't put a straw in rude.

2240
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:42,080
So I have to actually remove some.
And they're like,

2241
02:24:42,081 --> 02:24:43,310
I thought you want an extra ice.
I'm like,

2242
02:24:43,311 --> 02:24:46,670
you know exactly what I'm fucking asking
for. I'm asking for two scoops. Size.

2243
02:24:46,970 --> 02:24:49,880
It's a little extra ice anyways.
I could totally see.

2244
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:52,820
Got a Tim Horton's.
I think they should.

2245
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:56,720
They should find that guy to give him
whatever the highest award as you give to

2246
02:24:56,721 --> 02:25:01,220
a citizen. Like hey, thanks for straighten
out these people at Tim Horton's.

2247
02:25:01,490 --> 02:25:04,370
So tell you know like if
you're like at a restaurant,

2248
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:07,600
he took it out on the waiter was not
really his fault because he was going to

2249
02:25:07,610 --> 02:25:10,810
grab the food from the loser
as cook. Right, right, right.

2250
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:12,280
So you really can't take
it on her weight or,

2251
02:25:12,290 --> 02:25:14,150
but right here the latest was
standing right next to the,

2252
02:25:14,230 --> 02:25:16,000
the middle or drink or soft,
you know this,

2253
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,800
she is responsible for that drink through,

2254
02:25:19,660 --> 02:25:24,010
no, I always side with the
employees. I've had never do that to

2255
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,240
an employee. I worked there. I had a new
tire man. I take care of that of people.

2256
02:25:28,370 --> 02:25:33,350
So I used to work at a restaurant
and this guy came. Yeah.

2257
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:38,370
Adding that the hot dog was under cook
overcoat on the cook and then I saw the

2258
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:42,840
hot dog cook, actually kicking the
hot dog playing soccer with they,

2259
02:25:42,841 --> 02:25:46,550
with the other cook. What I did,
he picked it up and they, they,

2260
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:49,710
they put it back on the grill and then,
um,

2261
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:54,580
it got the little bird and they give it
back to the guy and that guy gave him a

2262
02:25:54,581 --> 02:25:56,770
$5 tip for having an extra burden.

2263
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:58,850
But then we'll kick it now other
than a floor earlier. Yeah.

2264
02:26:00,650 --> 02:26:04,780
Never actually witnessed that
kind of, you know, revenge.

2265
02:26:05,310 --> 02:26:09,440
I don't know. I've never done that.
I've never done it. I, you know,

2266
02:26:09,990 --> 02:26:10,970
I've shortchanged people,

2267
02:26:10,971 --> 02:26:14,000
but I never done that though right
there I've kept extra change.

2268
02:26:14,030 --> 02:26:17,120
Like if I get extra change and like,
fuck yeah, dude, that's your problem.

2269
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:19,450
That's a wipey not an MP,
but those are mistaken.

2270
02:26:19,451 --> 02:26:22,700
I will tell him to give this guy less
money and they're looking at his 20 and

2271
02:26:22,701 --> 02:26:24,740
that's it. Well, he took it.

2272
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:32,130
Um, what are you looking at? I'm trying
to find the, uh, I have to pee really bad.

2273
02:26:32,131 --> 02:26:36,960
Excuse me. I'm trying to find the, Oh,

2274
02:26:36,961 --> 02:26:40,860
I know he's got to go. You
got it? Cool. Yeah. Got a big
thing today. Oh, you do? Okay.

2275
02:26:40,890 --> 02:26:43,010
Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Oh, yeah. Here. Yeah.

2276
02:26:43,390 --> 02:26:46,380

follow up on a, hey, Julia.

2277

Okay. All right. One second.

thing and we'll get you outta here.

2279

don't want to get influenced
by the common got watching.

2310
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:02,960
So why don't in 10 minutes and
if there's 12 hot, it's hot.

I showed it to my son,
my step son, he's 14.

2318
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:33,020
He died and he went to go
show it to a stepbrother.

2319
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:35,140
He does this bit about uh,

2320
02:29:36,110 --> 02:29:40,820
how they show like people are
prices, right? And who, who livers.

2321
02:29:41,110 --> 02:29:43,520
So they show you shit they
never see before their lives.

2322
02:29:46,090 --> 02:29:50,420
So he does. He goes long.
It does like every question.

2323
02:29:50,421 --> 02:29:53,630
They're both funny man. He's so funny.
We were just watching him last night.

2324
02:29:54,850 --> 02:29:58,020
Better Call Saul. He's great on that.
Yeah. He's so skinny now. He lost,

2325
02:29:58,450 --> 02:30:01,680
yeah, the picture. He
was like after a joke.

2326
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:07,610
Yeah, he's great. He's so funny.
Um, okay, so just set it up.

2327
02:30:07,611 --> 02:30:10,550
Just so you have reference for this.
This is the guy.

2328
02:30:10,730 --> 02:30:15,110
So the story is that a guy met a girl.
Um,

2329
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:19,820
maybe the the night before. Okay.
And the, the girl is like painful.

2330
02:30:19,850 --> 02:30:21,320
I know the girl is like 18,

2331
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:26,720
19 in college and this guy is obviously
much older and she wakes up to this

2332
02:30:26,721 --> 02:30:31,490
video on her phone. This guy sent her
this video, the next good morning,

2333
02:30:31,491 --> 02:30:35,630
Julia. Meet Gel. Just wanted it to say hi.

2334
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:37,460
Wish you a great day.

2335
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:42,890
Tell you that meeting you yesterday and
getting a look at you was probably one

2336
02:30:42,891 --> 02:30:45,110
of the greatest moments of my life.
He's in her house.

2337
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:52,520
This guy.
Okay,

2338
02:30:52,530 --> 02:30:54,650
we'll do this.
How'd you get a message is hilarious.

2339
02:30:55,190 --> 02:31:00,080
This guy just met this girl who was like
20 years younger than I am at least.

2340
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:03,790
And then it was one of those things
where that she probably like,

2341
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:08,450
we're going to find out the details, but
like met at a bar somehow, probably hour.

2342
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:10,880
Everyone was drinking and then he fucking,

2343
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:15,960
instead of texting maybe like nice
meeting you made a video or like where he

2344
02:31:15,961 --> 02:31:20,130
like so embarrassed and it goes on
and on and he's like, you'll find love

2345
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,510
you like you never been loved before.
You know they'll cherish you. Yeah,

2346
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:29,030
I'll make you look good.
90 Day fiance please me.

2347
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:33,810
But it's like, it's cringy right? You're
like bad. Yeah, it's bad. So anyways,

2348
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:37,800
we got this message today. We've
been playing this, this video.

2349
02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:43,470
So a rich Vos. Yeah, that's
hilarious. So somebody said that.

2350
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:48,030
First of all, congrats on the new baby.
My boyfriend and I are longtime listeners.

2351
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:50,250
Living in San Diego is listen
to your mom's house to the day.

2352
02:31:50,251 --> 02:31:54,000
Almost spit out the water.
I was drinking when you started to play.

2353
02:31:54,001 --> 02:31:58,110
None other than goatee.
Joe's full trato monologue to Julia.

2354
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:02,000
If video during which Jude York
titties man. That's right. Yeah.

2355
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:05,580
That professors his love for his one and
only Julia with multiple shots of his

2356
02:32:05,581 --> 02:32:07,130
many ceiling fans in the background.

2357
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:12,570
I've had this exact video saved and
favorited in my phone. Oh my God.

2358
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:16,520
It was sent to Julia the morning after
she and Joe met briefly at a bar when

2359
02:32:16,830 --> 02:32:19,380
were city naturally upon receiving it,

2360
02:32:19,381 --> 02:32:21,600
Julia sent the video
to everyone she knows,

2361
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:24,240
including my best friend who
I was living with at the time.

2362
02:32:24,241 --> 02:32:28,050
I have laughed for hours and hours over
this video as it is quite honestly one

2363
02:32:28,051 --> 02:32:31,740
of the most unreal things I've
ever witnessed a grown man do.

2364
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:35,970
After knowing someone for less than 24
hours after getting over the excitement

2365
02:32:35,971 --> 02:32:38,940
that my own world just collided
with the world of your mom's house,

2366
02:32:38,941 --> 02:32:43,120
I knew what I had to do. There
is a follow up video. Wow.

2367
02:32:44,270 --> 02:32:49,140
Surprised after she did not respond to
Joe's initial video. He sent another.

2368
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:53,760
I have attached to it in this email.
He really does seem like a decent guy,

2369
02:32:53,761 --> 02:32:58,020
but I do believe the followup video was
a mistake. His on me and beat me Kelsey.

2370
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:02,400
Hey Kelsey, come see me in San Diego.
Added a second. Show the blues.

2371
02:33:02,430 --> 02:33:06,690
This is number 24 here's the
real story. Oh Wow. So, okay.

2372
02:33:06,691 --> 02:33:08,980
Here's the real story of how they,
the Good Morning Julia is.

2373
02:33:08,981 --> 02:33:11,580
Jim requires you to sign your
name before going tanning.

2374
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:13,710
Joe saw her going to sign in.

2375
02:33:13,711 --> 02:33:17,310
He then looked at her name when she
went to the tanning room on the way out,

2376
02:33:17,311 --> 02:33:22,020
he followed her out, yelling, Julia, wait.
She stopped thinking she may know him.

2377
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:26,010
He then started hitting on her and Julie
explained she was attempting to get

2378
02:33:26,011 --> 02:33:27,720
back with her ex show.

2379
02:33:27,721 --> 02:33:32,430
Then called himself from her phone and
the next morning he sent the video.

2380
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:36,150
They never dated, never seen each other
since. That ain't no Uber story? No.

2381
02:33:36,270 --> 02:33:39,300
Barstow. How did he get her
phone? Yeah, that part does,

2382
02:33:39,301 --> 02:33:43,290
that part doesn't really add up, so
that's what somebody's saying. But anyway,

2383
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:46,140
here is the followup video.
Oh Christ.

2384
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:52,850
Just want to say good morning Julia.
I flower.

2385
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:57,290
Oh my precious.
My soon to be my everything.

2386
02:33:58,650 --> 02:33:59,780
Have a great day.
Love.

2387
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:07,980
That's it. That's creepy. As
fuck though. I don't like to,

2388
02:34:07,981 --> 02:34:11,280
I don't like when people do videos when
they're driving. It's very dangerous.

2389
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:14,610
Very dangerous. That's what
stands out to you. It's not good.

2390
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,740
This guy is going to hit me.
Wow.

2391
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,320
What do you think? Have you ever done a
video like that when you were younger?

2392
02:34:20,370 --> 02:34:22,100
A younger man?
No.

2393
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:26,650
You never do anything super
embarrassing when you're like,

2394
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:31,680
so in La stripper on the way to a Bachelor
Party and I live my company card or a

2395
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:35,250
car that's

2396
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:45,570
really are aligned us. No, we are.

2397
02:34:45,810 --> 02:34:50,570
We're just as damaged if not
worst and strippers, man.

2398
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:55,330
Damn noon. Oh fuck your heart
to make in your arm to me.

2399
02:34:56,770 --> 02:34:57,910
Let's go full throttle

2400
02:35:02,020 --> 02:35:06,370
north Bergen. George, let's
go full throttle. Full travel.

2401
02:35:06,490 --> 02:35:10,500
Full sweat.
Yeah.

2402
02:35:10,690 --> 02:35:15,610
He's trying to say throttle
throttle. Yeah. Got that full travel

2403
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:20,560
cops or you could

2404
02:35:25,790 --> 02:35:28,180
still,
he's talking basically.

2405
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:36,880
He's really, he's really crazy. I mean,
here's the thing. Every guy knows,

2406
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:40,510
every guy has done a mini version of this.
In other words,

2407
02:35:40,511 --> 02:35:45,190
you say that you are embarrassed
by, you know, maybe you send a text,

2408
02:35:45,191 --> 02:35:49,960
maybe it's something in person,
but the degree to which he went is,

2409
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:54,990
that's the part that's crazy to go
that deep on a video on a video too.

2410
02:35:56,290 --> 02:36:00,040
So you're like, oh, they can just watch
this over and over. That's incriminating.

2411
02:36:00,041 --> 02:36:04,870
It's like sending your day. It makes me
shiver inside to watch. I'm like dammit.

2412
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:06,640
Because I feel that humiliation,

2413
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:12,280
it's hard for me to watch because I
felt that way for people to, you know,

2414
02:36:12,790 --> 02:36:15,190
I've left a voicemail as a comedian,

2415
02:36:15,191 --> 02:36:18,670
you're watching the whole thing going
is this whole thing is just bombing.

2416
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:22,320
It's bombing. Exactly. That's
exactly, exactly, yeah.

2417
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:24,370
Still doing it.

2418
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:29,980
That's the common to be doing the same
open 20 years at the Alex Dies House on

2419
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:31,333
Saturdays.

2420
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:37,390
You not shouldn't do it.
And he keeps hitting those videos,

2421
02:36:38,650 --> 02:36:40,900
but he'll keep sending them.
Right. So he gets thrown in jail.

2422
02:36:40,901 --> 02:36:45,550
I guess probably this is the kind of guy
that would re he would actually use our

2423
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:49,890
love together. I think he's delusional
enough where if she goes, uh,

2424
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:55,000
the thing is I just, um, I'm
just, I don't want to date you.

2425
02:36:55,001 --> 02:36:57,910
And he'd be like, he'd
be like, you know what?

2426
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:02,140
It doesn't matter who you are seeing
right now because the love that I have for

2427
02:37:02,141 --> 02:37:06,370
you, it's unparalleled. And she would be
like, no, I just don't want to see you.

2428
02:37:06,371 --> 02:37:08,710
And he's like, I'll wait
for you. That's sad.

2429
02:37:08,711 --> 02:37:10,430
I want to be says one for every holiday.

2430
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:16,080
Merry Christmas. Yo. Full throttle.

2431
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:21,090
I, let me tell you, I'm not looking
for know how get your body, oh,

2432
02:37:24,130 --> 02:37:27,230
Christmas as Mother's Day.
He could be my mommy.

2433
02:37:28,910 --> 02:37:33,270
He's so fucked up. I mean, thanksgiving,

2434
02:37:34,010 --> 02:37:36,360
I've had a few jet. There's,
what's his name? Joey. Yeah.

2435
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:39,770
I've had a few of these guys in college.
This is before the video era.

2436
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:41,920
They don't take no for an answer.

2437
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:45,830
You have to be so explicit
over and over and over.

2438
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:49,850
Like you have to be really like Julia.
She needs to just say no very loudly.

2439
02:37:49,870 --> 02:37:52,910
I think these guys ever responded
or have a male friend be like,

2440
02:37:52,911 --> 02:37:55,790
if you fucking do this again, I'm going
to break your legs and how you do it.

2441
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,620
He doesn't love you the way I love you.

2442
02:37:58,050 --> 02:38:02,500
Oh he's, he's real crazy.
He's got, he's got to up.

2443
02:38:02,940 --> 02:38:04,660
So let me let, let me wrap this up. Uh,

2444
02:38:04,890 --> 02:38:09,420
