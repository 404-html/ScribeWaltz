00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,620
prefer not to comment.

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,040

82
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,950
You know why I want to

83
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,690
not like pick her brain.
Just have, you know, yeah.

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,820
As I want to ask her questions
about and you know what?

85
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,370
I'd let you give her the d babe. It's
easier. You're free. That's my hall pass.

Smart attracted her. You just, you just
told her that I'm allowed to fuck her.

88
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,720
That's what she did when she heard that.

89
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,660
You know what I like about her too
is that she's got old school teeth.

90
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,500
She's got his old world teeth.
Like she didn't,

91
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:19,280
she didn't Jack them up with veneers.
Boy Do we have a dental update?

92
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,400
Oh my God, there's so much to cover.
First of all, we have to tell people,

93
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:29,130
and this is all on me,
I got,

94
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:34,131
we get emails every day and messages
everyday about people asking for access to

95
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:41,190
old episodes and a long time ago,
I don't remember why,

96
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,510
but we put like a lock limit
for iTunes to I think the past,

97
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,140
the the most recent 100 and
really didn't think much of it.

98
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,460
We just go like, okay, that's what
it is. But every day people go,

99
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,350
how can I get other episodes? And I see
that so much that today I was like, Hey,

100
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,470
will you unlock? Just put no limit
on them. And you're like, okay,

101
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,160
sure dude, I don't know if you've
checked your feet, have not. Oh,

102
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,660
it's been like Holy Shit.

103
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,660
Why did I just get 150 episodes died?
The subscribers,

104
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,010
I want people to know that
the intentions were to say,

105
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,870
here you go. Yeah, I'm trying to,

106
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:23,130
we're trying to give them for
free for free and easy access.

107
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,810
Yeah. I didn't consider it. I thought it
was like a cool thing that you'd be like,

108
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,540
oh great,
I can sit anywhere.

109
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,390
Because it would show up in the
subscriber feeds like their,

110
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,280
so like their phones are full
pick and choose the ones you like.

111
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:41,910
But anyways, now once you
situate that, it's uh,

112
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,390
it's so that you can listen
to them at anytime. Yeah.

113
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,600
So the back catalog starts at episode 40.
The reason being,

114
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:53,310
the first 39 we did with the original
red band. Yeah. In his studio.

115
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:56,250
And then we moved the studio
to our own home. Yeah.

116
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,910
And so it started to
episode 40. So that's, but,

117
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,930
and then I don't know if they're
in chronological order on,

118
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,650
on the Lipson feed for some reason. I
don't know how to control that, but yeah.

119
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,840
I don't know either or not
chronologically ordered,

120
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,790
but they're all there now and
they're on our, uh, libsin page. Uh,

121
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,470
if you want to go, go just Google
your mom's house RSS. Yeah.

122
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,760
And it'll come up all the back
catalog anyways. It's, um,

123
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,450
that is so funny. Yeah.
Sorry guys. It's so annoying.

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,780
It's really annoying to you.
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,530
There's so many pushes around
your presidential campaign
on both sides that they

126
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,000
prefer not to comment.

127
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,580
Lick Kublai Khan.

128
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,040
I hate that woman. Yeah. She's
really aggressive. She's really,

129
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,120
really sad about this woman. Oh yeah,
them, I wasn't talking to you now.

130
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,900
That's positive. Grab 'em
by the Pussy. Oh yeah.

131
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,750
Grab 'em by the Pussy.
Or there's this Ding Dong floating around.

132
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,530
This woman who's like it, Donald
Trump, he forced himself on me.

133
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:01,370
I was a contestant for Miss Universe and
I liked it. Oh, I liked it. We seen her.

134
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:05,410
She's, no, she said bud there.
That does also have to exist. Yeah.

135
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,070
Because the reason that a guy in a power
thinks he can do that is because he's

136
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:14,600
done it a few times. Yeah. And a few
times it was reciprocated as like,

137
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:18,800
that's awesome. No pushback. So then they
go like, oh, just do that to everybody.

138
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,970
And that's usually from dump dummies.
Yeah. But I'm just saying maybe she does.

139
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,780
That might be the highlight of her life.
She,

140
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,710
she could be a star fucker who's like,
that was amazing. This is actually heard.

141
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,280
This is the girl from seeing it.
Oh yeah. It was a shocking thing.

142
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:35,360
And now there you go. Is that Christiana?
Um, important. Yeah. I love it.

143
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,630
This guy doesn't know exactly like he's
Rad. He's like, trying to say is like,

144
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,510
there's a lot of pussies everywhere.
It's Rad.

145
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,390
That is your dad was essential dumping.

146
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,530
I've heard him say sentences like that.

147
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,410
You realize the Russians think we're
just the ultimate, oh yeah. Sissy.

148
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:54,080
Nancy boys. Oh, you were so weak to that.

149
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:58,490
I think Obama is so weird to them.
You know what,

150
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,110
smiling and last month. Yeah.
Joy. Joyous. Smiling. Okay.

151
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,053
Money.

152
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,750
Yeah. For pussies. Yeah, that's true. Oh,

153
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,760
relatives would think you're a
dope if you smiled. Cause a reason,

154
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,240
another thing to point out before we go,

155
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,400
that was a burp in my throat because,
does that sound horrible? Yeah.

156
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,610
It was like one of those things. And
you're like the, the bubble bursts here.

157
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,970
I know.
I've had that happen.

158
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,700
I missed that.

159
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,570
If you're new to the show,
big announcements only happen.

160
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,760
Major announcements after chips
have been poured into a bowl. Right.

161
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,570
And we got that from the morning
radio shows that they usually play.

162
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,520
Bugles you know, like, I've never heard,

163
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,120
I've never heard it referred to as abuse.

164
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,120
I think a horn horn.

165
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,093
Yes.

166
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,930
Stupid. No, it's so dumb.
Fucking dumbest thing. So down.

167
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,120
So our version of the morning radio
show his chips in a bowl. Yeah. Uh,

168
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,120
chips in a bowl.
Cat's eating kibble.

169
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,830
I like the cat and this is a big
chips in a bowl announcement. Okay.

170
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,150
Okay. Are you ready? Jeans? I'm ready.

171
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,720
It's official. It's official. No teeth.

172
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,830
No entry.

173
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,790

182
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,700
cities I will not add shows.

183
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,380
Some of the venues are big and I'm just
trying to get them, but if they fill up,

184
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,030
they're gone. So I'm really excited.
I've never done a theater tour.

185
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,160
Most of these are our theaters. There's
only a couple clubs. Uh, and by the way,

186
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,730
I also wanted to do this during
the episode and explain this part.

187
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,650
I know I'm going to get hit up for
cities that aren't there and I'm there.

188
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,170
You're not being left out.

189
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,880
It's just not part of the initial
frame of marketing for the tour.

190
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,880
For instance, Denver, you
know, I love Denver. Um,

191
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,840
it's just not going to happen
in those first few months.

192
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:02,650
But Denver is definitely going to
happen in 2017, uh, things like that.

193
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,030
So I just wanted to point that out. Um,
and also still get the tweets though.

194
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,390
I know Joe Coming Hawaiian.
I'm definitely going to Hawaii.

195
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,280
A cone to there.

196
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,540
Are they all deaf or these are the hearing
impaired and there's always going to

197
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,860
be some international stuff.
So there's going to be Canadia um,

198
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,850
I'm working on a u UK thing and
working on mom's strail. Yeah.

199
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,000
So these are all things I'm trying
to do anyways. We'll move on,

200
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,460
but I wanted to tell everybody that's
a big, that's a big deal for me.

201
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,870
Big Announcement and a that's why you
got so many chips in your bowl jeans.

202
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,290
I thought you were going to announce
that you're lactose intolerant. My God,

203
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,190
I'm shrimp and tolerant. Can I, I think,
can I tell you what it might be? Hmm.

204
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,420
Cause didn't you eat some of my
cheese before? Yeah, the shrimps.

205
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,020
So maybe the,
the cheese was pushed out by the shrimp.

206
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,680
I got tested though. I actually
don't have a food allergy. Um,

207
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,990
I got negative on everything they said.
Maybe a food set sensitivity,

208
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:04,610
which is different. Okay. Um, and
I also have to push my colonoscopy.

209
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,670
We didn't turn that light on that
light. Oh, that's a problem, huh?

210
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,300
I'll turn it off. Is it plugged in?
Yeah. Oh, I dunno. It's Kinda important.

211
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:19,900
No anything. Just do it. Okay.
Don't pause. Keep talking, talking.

212
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,050
Oh, you'll do that and I'll do that. Oh,

213
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,360
here's my theory with you because we
both just had shrimp that I made at home.

214
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,250
Yeah. So I feel fine. And then
you shoot your brains out.

215
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,590
And I heard it through the bathroom

216
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,270
door. What's wrong booboo? Wow.

217
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,190
But then we had that
Starbucks, uh, protein plate.

218
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,580
But you don't think that's better?
That's better.

219
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,320
You don't think you're lactose at all?
I'm saying they tested me that for that.

220
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,550
And you're not? Yeah. Oh, now I
know I'm not fun. I don't like milk.

221
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,140
I hate no god. If I drank
milk, I'll feel sick.

222
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,610
But I don't actually have

223
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,460
that 23 and me shit that we did or
whatever the fuck that genetic thing was,

224
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:10,790
says that we are both
lactose dollar. I Dunno, man.

225
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,310
Here's why I'm not going on the 27th
because I have to fly to New York now. Oh,

226
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:20,870
look at that excuse after I'm doing Ron
Bennington. Unmask. If you're in New York,

227
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:25,240
it's free to go to the 27th I think so.
Is that,

228
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,900
do we know?
I don't know yet.

229
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,070
They made an announcement so I
know I can talk about it. Anyway,

230
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,900
the lactose thing, that's,
you know, genetic. Yeah.

231
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,810
Why are you shitting after shrimp? That's
a term sensitivity. That's so weird.

232
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,220
I don't know something's wrong. Why is
that dog barking so crazy. Retarded.

233
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,170
She's so fucking retarded. So
stupid. She got diarrhea again.

234
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,820
So our baby got sick for the first
time ever. I mean 10 months old.

235
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,860
Our baby got his first fever.

236
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,350
It was a fucking nightmare because
of course you were out of town,

237
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,420
so I deal with this all alone as usual,

238
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,870
and then the fucking dog gets diarrhea
on top of the kid being sick. I'm like,

239
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,910
God, I wanted to blow my brains out.
This new dog doesn't stop barking though.

240
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:12,530
It really makes me want to blow my brains
out and they continue to bark. Yeah.

241
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,170
And then you go and see what they're
looking at and there there's nothing.

242
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,790
It really makes sure she barks
it. Absolutely not. I know.

243
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,760
Like right now she's so fired up. What
could that be? The squirrel outside.

244
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:24,020
It could be someone.

245
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,740
It's, it's gonna. It's
gonna make me go get her.

246
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,890
The only other option is to
have her in the room with you.

247
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,523
Yeah.

248
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,740
To go get her. Okay. Keep talking. Oh, for
fuck sake. I have to vamp now. Yeah. Oh,

249
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,710
for crying out loud. So, okay, fine.

250
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,130
The kid was sick for the
first time in 10 months.

251
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,040
That's the

252
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,840
story.
This is our life at your mom's house.

253
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,070
I can't wait to get a new studio that's
separate from the house and the place

254
00:17:56,071 --> 00:18:00,120
we're moving to. It's going to be
way different than this. Anyways,

255
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,380
I the kids sick. I'm in a fucking
lather. I don't know if you have babies,

256
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:09,250
but the first time your baby gets sick,
at least for me, put me in a full panic.

257
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,560
A full lather. I mean I was having
like severe anxiety attacks.

258
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,850
Fee's been shitting in my closet
this week. Hi. Um, so yeah,

259
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:25,080
I wake up at two in the morning and bitsy
has diarrhea. 4:00 AM she has diarrhea.

260
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:25,711
It was a nightmare.

261
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:30,210
I had to shove Imodium down her throat
because the vet told us we could and then

262
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:33,990
it stopped. But man, what
a fun week at Casa Segora.

263
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,340
Baby's sick dogs sick. Everybody's
sick except you and me. Thank God.

264
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,360
Now you got sick. You just shit.
What, what was she barking at?

265
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,920
She was just at the gate just barking
at it. At the gate from the kitchen.

266
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,200
The kitchen get,
where's the cluster?

267
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,920
I think she's in there,
but she was just barking at the gate

268
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,870
we need in the baby gate. Yeah. Yeah.
The dog just barks it. Nothing nonsense.

269
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,980
And she was really intensely barking yet.

270
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,530
I think it's her way of saying I
want to come up there with you.

271
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,080
She got her wish and then Fifo
has shit in my closet twice.

272
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,260
Two Times in the last 48
hours. Not Cool. Not Cool.

273
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,190
Because he's sending a very direct
message though my feet. What is it?

274
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,860
I love you still. I can't let you up
right now. I'm working. Okay. Come on.

275
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,790
Come sit in my lap.

276
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,760
So he knows that something's been up
in the house with the baby and he needs

277
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:36,440
attention. Look at this.
This is hilarious. Me.

278
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,280
Okay. FIFA. Roney okay. Pepper.
Tony. Okay. Can't alone.

279
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,210
So the new national
translation has come through.

280
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,073
If I sat on it.

281
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,773
My name

282
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,230
is [inaudible] needs a bit of a bitch.

283
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,390
[inaudible] [inaudible] money
cause I need your money.

284
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,830
You have to have me get on me first.

285
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,460
And last time I turned the sound
and of course for two sooner,

286
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,800
so I'm going to have a holiday.

289
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,890

294
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,403
Thanks.

295
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,210
You don't think when I'm older last year,

296
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,240

She's due back,
so we got multiple people wrote in a,

298
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,380
I have my buddy slay Monae who uh,
translated from me on Instagram,

299
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:08,100
but you have this one? Yeah, in the
sheet here. I'll just read it from here.

300
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,790
It says, um, hello. Hi.
Hello. Hi. How are you?

301
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,550
I went and got that
picture is with that woman.

302
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,360
I just wanted to tell you this whore
that sells her body and is using heroin.

303
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,560
This crazy, miserable bitch that
wants to strive me to pieces.

304
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,860
She wants to destroy me.
This lady just wants to destroy me.

305
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,140
I just wanted to save her money.
I said,

306
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:30,930
I have a friend who is single here
and he can send it in just a week.

307
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,550
I went and got the pictures
and the passport and the
ID cards are ready whenever

308
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:36,120
you can.

309
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,960
I'll come and give you the money to
take this fucking whore out of my life.

310
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,100
Please saw them.
I please this low life for miserable.

311
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,190
Tell her you're paying for your actions.
You pour idiot.

312
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,120
So may tell her you're paying for your
actions. Anybody that does you any good,

313
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,170
you want to shred them to pieces. You do
this and you keep having to pay for it.

314
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:59,850
Mother fucker. Salamay dear, I'm so
sorry to bother you about these things.

315
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,480
I couldn't sleep last night
and my brain yesterday. Anyway,

316
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,610
I know you have your own things.
We all have our own.

317
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,870
They think we're just living in a castle
and all happy. Anyways, talk to you soon.

318
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,360
Talk to you soon. Bye. Wow, it's
Ali, uh, Shabani. Thank you.

319
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,020
Um, I wrote this, I go, man, this is
unbelievable to slay him. And he said,

320
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,990
of course she doesn't really complete
her thoughts there. So choppy.

321
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,650
What is most shocking is she
uses a really vulgar language,

322
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,570
especially for an older person.

323
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,530
And while the curse words
translate literally to whore
bitch the words in Farsi

324
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:34,400
or really vulgar, like
she says, cost cast,

325
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:37,680
which you guys caught onto
it. It was a bad word. It,

326
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,310
it literally translates to
pussy stretcher. Hey, k a whore.

327
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,880
I'm just curious who is ripping her off?
Last time was about real estate.

328
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:51,570
The time passport in pictures.
She is nuts. Interesting.

329
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,640
Yeah. Anyways, thank you guys for
the translations. Salah Amaze.

330
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,910
Pretty stoked that she's not
getting all of these voicemails.

331
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,360
I hope I want Sallie Mae to
get a bank of voicemails.

332
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,120
Like everybody just got our
downloaded episode, you know,

333
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,660
I want to sell him on his phone to get
them at once and she gets 40 fucking

334
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:12,690
voicemail and that's your really
gets to know her friend. You know,

335
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,560
I don't think it's her friend. I think
solo may is a family member. Yeah.

336
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,620
At this older woman or a
daughter or it's somebody.

337
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,390
It's a family. Yeah.
Hmm. Yeah. I Dunno man.

338
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm, I'm upset. She called
my phone the other day,

339
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:33,990
the Persian lady and then didn't leave
a voicemail and I was so excited for the

340
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:37,680
voicemail. Yeah. Sometimes
she doesn't leave one.

341
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,390
Yeah, she doesn't. I know that
that was really rare though.

342
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,260
When you told me that she was calling,
I go, oh, is so excited. Yeah.

343
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,040
What are you looking at?
Me? Just what you sent.

344
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,310
I'm been trying to figure
out what the play, um,

345
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,990
because you said some great stuff.
Oh, I also wanted to point this out.

346
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,700
I was talking to you about this.

347
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,210
I did a Burt cast with Bert Bertrand,
yeah.

348
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,000
And Wilfred Burr. And we were, you know,

349
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,890
just regular podcast talking.

350
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,600
I told this story about this lady I
know a friend of mine knows works with

351
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:17,260
someone who blew the Wu Tang clan
and she's not happy about it now,

352
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,580
but at the time she voluntarily did it.
Anyways,

353
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:23,830
I tell the story and to summarize,

354
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,490
my friend works at a music venue and one
time when the Wu Tang clan came to play

355
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:34,720
there, a lady he was working with was
like, I'm going to get on that bus.

356
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:39,480
I'm going to like suck and fuck
some Wu Tang. She vault. She goes,

357
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,740
she announced it. I would love
to blow everybody in the Wu Tang.

358
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,290
And um, he was like, are you sure
you want to do that? You know?

359
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:53,490
And she goes, gosh, that's like a
perfect idea. And she was like, yeah,

360
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:57,780
I want to do it. And he goes, you know,
it's like, it's Kinda like that, um,

361
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,610
that's how he was being a protective
friend, but a woman's, yeah.

362
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,000
Killed Square, but a woman's
choice, you know, she, he
was, he was being supportive.

363
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,020
You're sure live right. You're
supposed to be a slide. So anyways,

364
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,460
she says yes.
She goes on the bus,

365
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,200
she's in there for a while, comes
back, and pretty soon thereafter,

366
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,740
you know, she's, uh, she's gets emotional.

367
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,150
And then she goes, you know, that
was pretty terrible. He's like, well,

368
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:31,560
what happened? She's like, you know,
I blew all of them. And, and uh,

369
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,320
and she, she said, and he goes like,
you know, they hurt you or you,

370
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:39,590
and she was like, no, it was just, they
were just so mean, you know? Oh yeah.

371
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:45,000
You think that the members of the Wu
Tang clan would be savages. That's weird.

372
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,360
I know. So anyways, she was,
she thought she was blowing,

373
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,920
I think she was going to blow Joe
to see or something, you know,

374
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,440
the grateful dead night.
Nice guys, hippie guys.

375
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:00,090
If she had blown the Tom Tang clan
totally different because I'm the type of

376
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,180
person that would be just like, thank
you. Thank you. Thank you. Of course,

377
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:05,610
that's my philosophy.
Of course you're talking about,

378
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:10,611
don't forget on the groundbreaking
first we'd hang out and through the 36

379
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:15,480
chambers, there's a sketch and
interstitial between songs that goes, uh,

380
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,820
you know, I'm a cut your eyelids off and
feed you nothing but sleeping pills. Uh,

381
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,470
I'll show your asshole close and keep
feeding you and feeding and feeding.

382
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,663
And that's between.

383
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,900
So guys that improvise that I imagined
when they're getting their dick suck can

384
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:33,960
also improvise some things, a couple
of lines here and there. You know,

385
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,101
I got your back,

386
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:38,040
but your best to watch your front
because it's the Niggas who front,

387
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,400
that'd be polling
stations. Wow. That's very,

388
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:46,230
very accurate and very, and that's also,
that's a Jesus album. That's like that.

389
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,850
That's great advice.
Now those guys,

390
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,970
like you pointed out,
also talk about blasting the whole head.

391
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,440
Fucking blown out on it. Yeah.
Right. So there's also nine of them.

392
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,340
I mean recipes,
uh,

393
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,130
14 nine's the original
number. So, you know,

394
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,620
sweet baby Jesus. I made a couple jokes
telling that story to Burt and Burger.

395
00:27:09,621 --> 00:27:12,960
I told him, I was like, she was
probably like, Oh man, even you got,

396
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,640
and like I got a blow Kappa Donna too.
Like you know, it's like almost, you know,

397
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,970
caps not even original, but you know what
I mean, like the not as famous members.

398
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,330
Anyways,
that's the story.

399
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,690
She got really emotional
because they were real mean.

400
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,280
And then later on she was kind of,
I think the next day like, I dunno,

401
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,650
inconsolable, right to the point where
my friend asked like, do I need to call?

402
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,060
Like do I need to, I think I told
them too like that in the story,

403
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,080
but I need to call the
authorities implying it was
there a crime committed and

404
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,350
she was the one that said,
oh,

405
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,670
I volunteered for this.
But it was awful.

406
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,020
I could, if I could have told
her that before. Well anyways,

407
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,490
I think this is hilarious.
Okay.

408
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
And I laughed a lot telling the story
because it makes me laugh to think of how

409
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,040
mean they could have been like,

410
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,990
I imagine ghost face killer can
say some really fucked up shit.

411
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,340
I Bet Ray Quan was probably eating as
he was getting his dick sucked and then

412
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:21,700
like food felt like he was
probably eating. Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,920
Or like a McFlurry and then it fell on
her head and he was like dancing for you.

414
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,310
Like you eat dick juice,
no ice cream.

415
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,310
Ice Cream off of her forehead and
eats it still. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

416
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,860
So shit like that. You know, let's
go sit right there. You know,

417
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,150
he probably suck my Dick. You don't
want me, you know? Well, like I said,

418
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,080
this isn't like, um, you
know, this isn't a Yani,

419
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,890
you're not blowing a full
band. No Man, they're,

420
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,520
they're known to be savage and sure.

421
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,580
I mean like even if I made that offer
to like modest mouse or something that's

422
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:02,970
going to be like, oh thanks for a second.
Our dicks, you know, they weren't, they,

423
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:07,750
I think they would be the 12 year
old

424
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,780
picture. That guy again, his
dick sucked. Right. So anyways,

425
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,530
this shit made me laugh. I tell a story.
This made it to the front page of Reddit.

426
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:24,531
My Buddy [inaudible] Greg pointed out to
me and then I was reading it and it has

427
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,690
the full variety, but some
people were like, sorry,

428
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,070
I don't think sexual assault is funny.
It's not a salt if it's consensual.

429
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,660
Of course it was consensual to the point.

430
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:37,500
And also it just shows you people
are always looking to, you know,

431
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,190
get their agenda out there.
That even in the story,

432
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,650
like I'm telling the story with notes now,

433
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,620
but when I told the story originally,

434
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,870
I told that with the details of this
person volunteering and making it clear

435
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:57,160
that it was consensual, but there's
still people saying like, no, no, no.

436
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,580
The only reason they're saying that
stuff is because of this Trump thing and

437
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:05,050
it's in the air and it's,
it's like a topic hot topic or whatever.

438
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,170
Yes, please. It's so
dumb. It is dumb stupid.

439
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,000
Let's say if you're stupid enough to want
to blow the Wu Tang clan in the first

440
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:16,150
place. I mean, of course it's
going to feel bad, sweetie. Yeah.

441
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,520
You think you think it absolutely
is going to feel bad? Yeah.

442
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,160
Cause there's like tape there and
there's no duck tape and the Lutein,

443
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,490
is that the, the last member duck tape.
That's the guy he hasn't gotten out yet.

444
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,670
Hurry drives cabs now. Anyways.
Um, just to make it clear,

445
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,170
there was not even,

446
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,260
there was such a clear point
made that this wasn't, um,

447
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,610
sexual assault, obviously. I know,
but I just feel like stupid. And Look,

448
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,770
I've known you for a million years.

449
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,630
You're the least sexual pro sexual
assault. Personally. God Love Planet.

450
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,210
I guarantee it wasn't intended that
way. Of course, look dumb. You know,

451
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,970
people get their panties in a bunch over
Trump and now they're transferring all

452
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,990
that energy to you. Yeah,
it's stupid. Anyways,

453
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,420
which band would you
blow? Hmm, good question.

454
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:13,390
That's a new game. I mean, first of all,

455
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,530
I would look for a band that has
less than nine members. I mean,

456
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,000
she went for a week, highest
amount of decks. Awesome.

457
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,510
Now that's a really interesting
point. Topic. You think about it.

458
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,040
Would you want nine different
guys to not in your mouth period.

459
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,860
No one sitting.

460
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,660
I think this was somebody too much come.

461
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,590
I think also that that this lady was
thinking about it was too much because

462
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,770
that's a really good point too.
I think she, it's too much.

463
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,290
Do you think she underestimated the,

464
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,260
the number of members in the band
and that's why it was such a bummer.

465
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,030
I think she may have been watching
honestly some videos and been like, oh,

466
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:56,230
this will be like, like look at, look at
all the fun people are having, you know,

467
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,090
that's the porno. Like, like
she's watching like, oh,

468
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:03,190
everyone's like the affection.
Yeah.

469
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,590
Like this is what a thrill
this is for everybody. Yeah.

470
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,610
And then you get in there and
you're playing with the big boys,

471
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:14,611
you're playing the major league ball and
then all of a sudden it's like some a

472
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,900
rapper sitting on your face.

473
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,540
Blake. My ass, my ass.

474
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,580
And,

475
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,090
and, and in all sincerity
as a woman, I don't,

476
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,010
I don't think I could think of a band.

477
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,610
I would least want to blow all the
movers up when you, first of all,

478
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:35,310
there's nine guys minimum
mine minimum. No. Yeah.

479
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,213
Yes.

480
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,733
And

481
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,900
it's not like it's not the peace
and love music party. It's,

482
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,380
it's, it's the Blue
Tang. It's pretty much,

483
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,550
I'm trying to think if
there's ever a modest mouse.

484
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,960
They'd be a good choice.

485
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,870
Maybe like a depressive band play
radio head. They be great to blow.

486
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,340
Maybe like a solo act,

487
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,530
folk singer and just a guy
in a guitar. Adele. Hello?

488
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,580
One singer sting. He's all
tantric though. He'd be like,

489
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:21,110
you're gonna blow me for 16 that's
where he's the, he's a master.

490
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,340
He does yoga. Did you know that
Mick Jagger or we talked about this,

491
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:28,310
didn't we on Joe Rogan
show that he does yoga too.

492
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,560
He's in such good shape. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. You want to blow up.

493
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,080
You don't want to blow the older
guys. That takes forever. Forget it.

494
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,870
Just to get the blood down there.
That's what I'm saying.

495
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,430
You want to blow the young buck,
the 20 the Biebers of the world.

496
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:49,070
What are the quick one of those guys?
The boy band one direction.

497
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,160
One direction. How many are in
that spit on those little dicks?

498
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,350
I think there are four.
But like they're going to come quick.

499
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,150
That's the whole point. You're
going to come to many guys and what?

500
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,820
You're going to touch their dicks and
as you grab him, you're going to go,

501
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,920
you know it's going to be fast.

502
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,760
I wouldn't want to blow
like a heavy metal,

503
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,040
like Metallica guys stink.
Right?

504
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,720
Dick smell bad on the balls would be,
that's the name. Now, some of those bands,

505
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,810
they started off as like the stinky dicks.
Right.

506
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,310
And then later on when they got signed,
they change it to Metallica, you know?

507
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,720
But they're their first band names.
Like I never wash my ass.

508
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:32,500
Got to be so nasty, so nasty
all the time. Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,740
But I wouldn't,
yeah,

510
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:38,660
I wouldn't blow a metal band and I
would not do a blue Tang for sure. Not,

511
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,480
not a good choice.
No.

512
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,350
That's an intense move to
start off doing that. You know,

513
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,090
for your first, is that
called a blow bang? Yeah.

514
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:53,060
And I mean like even for a group, you're
like a girl who was like, you know what,

515
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:57,140
I want to like more power to you.
But to start with the Wu Tang clan,

516
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,940
that's a really aggressive varsity move.
You want to start off slow.

517
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,970
Maybe you start with a solo
artist, you know, Wiz Khalifa.

518
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,690
Just go somebody who just,
he's alone, you know,

519
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:13,300
maybe him and a Dj would have been
a good one. Hmm. Hanson Hansen.

520
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,170
Yeah. Two teenage brothers,
Jonas brothers. And they were
brothers. One of them now.

521
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:20,720
So though, right? This isn't one of
them still perform or something back in,

522
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,950
who knows? But yeah, to be like, let
me start off with these nine dudes.

523
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,170
These nine hardcore rappers sing
about murder or rap about murder.

524
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,100
That's why he makes me laugh. It's
really funny. I think it's funny.

525
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,780
I agree with you a man. Anyways,
also, thank you. Many thanks.

526
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,260
Can I tell you that Charlotte,
North Carolina,

527
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,980
some of the most fun shows I have
all year, they don't know this,

528
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,050
but they helped me build about a new
10 minutes this weekend. Great. Um,

529
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,880
which was really,
really fun.

530
00:35:56,881 --> 00:36:01,881
And also Carlos Valencia
was my opening act there.

531
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,050
Really great guy.
And um,

532
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,050
he's a Columbian.

533
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,720
I don't know if you know what I'm drinking
out of my own personalized main mommy

534
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,610
water container. I see that. Yeah.

535
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,880
It's embarrassing that you
have that. Um, it's good.

536
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:24,990
It's refreshing. Where's your
water? Smooth. Refreshing
drink. Where's your water?

537
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,250
It's not water. That is a sparkling
water essence drink called liquid.

538
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,430
No sodium,
no sugars by sailor water.

539
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,950
Do you know that Kevin Christie hates
those [inaudible] he said at the,

540
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:45,510
it sounds exciting and then you drink it
and it, it does taste like nothing. Well,

541
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,960
Kevin Christie, um, is,

542
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,460
is talking like a person who
eats and drinks what he wants.

543
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,710
And honestly,

544
00:36:55,711 --> 00:37:00,711
if you had the choice of a
liquid or something with sugar,

545
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,740
you probably do want the sugar.
But when you cut sugar out of your life,

546
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,260
this is the best it can be. Or you're
40 and you can't have soda anymore. No,

547
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,000
that's what I'm saying, man. Yeah, you
can't do it. Yeah, I can't do it, man.

548
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,510
You shouldn't do it.
I can't do it.

549
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,790
So I a blue band, as you guys
know, he's still with us,

550
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,040
but he's not here.
He's doing,

551
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,810
he's building nests and
all these different trees
across the city and I asked

552
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:32,040
him to pull these for us. Jeans. Yeah. Um,

553
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,430
some great pss.
I love always loved Psa.

554
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,530
Some of these are really amazing.
I haven't seen them all.

555
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:44,670
I've only seen a couple, but I wanted
to show you how they from the 80s.

556
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,400
Those were my favorite ones. The
old ones are the best. The old ones,

557
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,910
you know why they don't pull any
punches. That's wow. Yeah. Did you stop?

558
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,410
Drop and roll also? I remember
just making an observation to our,

559
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,160
our youtube viewers.
You're still seeing the old board.

560
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,560
I ordered an actual another board.

561
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,060
That's why it hasn't been replaced because
people message me things I thought of.

562
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,400
You've got a new board. Oh, I did get
a new board and I got another board.

563
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,810
I got to send back the second
board. That's the story.
Okay. All right. Here we go.

564
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,963
Jeans.

565
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,770
[inaudible]

566
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,893

567
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,060

568
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,360

So

569
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:33,370
a Frisbee has gone flying into some power
lines and then the little British boy

570
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,070
was like,
I kind of go in there and then the little

571

Yeah.

574
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,910
Kind of like a,
you realize how today's commercials,

575
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,280
even p essays are 15 seconds.

576
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,480
They've actually given a him screentime
of getting stuck to get into.

577
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,900
I'm fucking bored already. I know
it's so long. This is like in real,

578

580
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,270
It said danger.
You missed it said danger.

581
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,433
Yeah.

582
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,320
Now he's running to get a spray.
Can I tell you the genius

583
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,730
is that the girl never
does the dumb thing. Yeah.

584
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,990
The girl's like hey you go do that
dummy dummy, you would do that.

585
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:28,700
And the guy's like okay
cause he's thinking about all
the pussy getting blown by

586
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:29,540
the Wu Tang.
Yeah.

587
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,490
Don't do it.
Dummy the first

588
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,290

589
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,380
Yeah. Dead. Oh my God. That's that
PSA you'll die. Did he tell you?

590
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:53,550
I talk about this in my act, how they
had to like tell us cause we didn't,

591
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:57,540
we raised ourselves in the
80s. Sure. I talk about this.
How much these were great.

592
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,450
They're effective.
They scare the shit out of you as a kid.

593
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,830
He didn't do anything dumb

594
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,600
[inaudible] shit
to keep away from substation.

595
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,200
Lemme try to get toys back yourself.

596
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,840
Otherwise you may not live
to play with them again.

597
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,430
Fantastic. Right. But I'll tell you
what, you saw that as a kid. Yeah.

598
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,850
I bet you didn't fuck with them.
Power lines. No, no. Hell No. Wow,

599
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,800
that's great. Yeah.
Mcgruff the crime dog, uh,

600
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,420
that, I dunno, stop.

601
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:34,470
Drop and roll member they showed with the
manual was you got to beat that into a

602
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:38,190
kid's head. Obviously you gotta to
tell kids from the age of four, hey,

603
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,180
drugs are bad. Don't get set on fire.
Don't touch the fucking power lines.

604
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,940
They don't know. They don't. Yeah,

605
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,550
you got to give them extreme
examples that's running that kid.

606
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,420
But that's what sticks in the kid's brain
that you realize that that aired like

607
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:55,170
between like shows you were watching.
Right, of course. Thank you. I like, ah,

608
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,680
family times, whatever family size
is over. Of course. [inaudible]

609
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,540
and you're like,
can we watch the other show out?

610
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,020
Hello? Sorry. Is Rabies right?

611
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,320
We're just pushing in
on a sweet little dog.

612
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,870
How much is that
so far?

613
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:24,680
We're just seeing a sweet dog,
sweet dog music.

614
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,540
We'll have to pull the trigger.
Oh my

615
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,330
God. Oh my God. So they put a
gun to the dog's head and said,

616
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,240
please give us a pound or
I'll have to pull the trigger.

617
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:43,790
Meaning give us money or this
dog dies. Yeah. Holy Shit.

618
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,710
That's a fundraising tactic. I gotta
donate immediately. Yeah. A dog. Oh,

619
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,240
look at this dog.
Beautiful Dog.

620
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,630
And then all of a sudden a handgun comes
into frame pointed at the dog's face.

621
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,170
Yeah, of course. He's like, what
the fuck is that? And then they go,

622
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:04,730
please give us a power. Pull the
trigger. We'll have to pull the trigger.

623
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,140
That's brutal.
I'm traumatized,

624
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,940
man. God, all right. The Brits don't
fuck around. Are these all Brits?

625
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,010
Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. They do
things a little harsher. Yeah.

626
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:21,620
They don't fuck around.
Little bit more direct.

627
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,060
I remember there was a campaign about um,

628
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,160
like loose lips sink ships during the
war and just those like posters they tell

629
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,170
you like basically if you blab secrets,
you're murdering your countrymen. Sure.

630
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,210
That, well I know that the, you know,

631
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:40,580
they don't like stuff
like a have a nice day.

632
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:45,590
I've heard that a bunch of English people.
Yeah. They, they think that that's so,

633
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,720
um, condescending. Definitely Eastern
blockers don't like that shit. Oh, I know.

634
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,050
I know a certain person in your
life was not a fan of that at all.

635
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,170
My step mom hated.
Have a nice day.

636
00:42:57,171 --> 00:43:01,260
Or how you doing phone Edith to my mother
really hated having nice. Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,180
Yeah. It's really funny to me
cause you know what, to me,

638
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,380
I never thought one way or the other
about it. Like I never said it.

639
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:13,120
It's not my partying way
of, you know, I don't,

640
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,940
it's not an expression I part with,
but it also never really registered.

641
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,280
But it's really funny to me to
think about it bothering somebody.

642
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,420
You know what infuriates me? Mm.
And this is totally irrational,

643
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,650
but good morning. Good
morning. I absolutely,

644
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,120
I don't know why I've made cause I'm
grumpy when I wake up. I fucking hate it.

645
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,960
Good morning. Oh fuck off. It's that stop.

646
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,940
You know we actually had um,
a drop. Do you remember Carla?

647
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,850
My name's Carla. 24. Seven.
Carla haven't good fucking day.

648
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,730
She said you have a good fucking night.
Yeah.

649
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,950
I don't know where that is.
My mother would say that to people.

650
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,990
You'll have that good fucking day.

651
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,370
How did you know that one?
Did you hear her say that? Um,

652
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,450
I think you told me that once and I
left for an entire day straight because

653
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,700
cause we were just talking about like
the wild shit. She would say. Yeah.

654
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,260
Cause your mom, the first time
I met your mom was that a lunch?

655
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,740
And she said the first thing she talked
about was a content Bloomingdale's.

656
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,470
Yeah. She said this fucking content
Bloomingdale's. And I was like, whoa.

657
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,280
And I just, I mean, I was ear
to ear smiles, but I was also

658
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,720
like, she just opened up
with, there was a context.

659
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't,
shouldn't build up to it. You know,

660
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:44,430
she reminds me of actually this
last voicemail from Persian lady.

661
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,840
Very similar to the email. The voicemails
I would receive like the conspiracies.

662
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:53,500
The so-and-so's out to fuck me. I got
to get this person back. Yeah. Super,

663
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,540
super normal stuff. Yeah.
You have a good [inaudible].

664
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,680
You'll have a nice fucking day.
No, she wrote that to me. Yeah,

665
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:02,970
she did my mother.

666
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,920
That's why I wrote it to you
in an in a letter in the mail.

667
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,390
This was how crazy. Now
that she's dead. Sorry.

668
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:17,340
So hard because it's outrageous. Can
I tell a story? Why are so of course,

669
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,800
so my parent, my mother remarried
to this nice. My Stepdad,

670
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,980
this nice Indian guy,
right?

671
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,190
They divorce and I decided to write my
former stepfather an email just to say,

672
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,430
you know, hey, I know things
went south with you and my mom.

673
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:36,060
I just want to say thanks for being
a cool step dad. For 17 years.

674
00:45:36,061 --> 00:45:39,130
You were in my life and uh,
thanks for being you keep,

675
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,170
you could have been a Douche
bag and you weren't right.

676
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:45,960
She checked his emails,
found the email,

677
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,120
printed it out, and then on the
letter, the printed email wrote,

678
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,710
have a nice fucking day and
mailed it to me in the mail.

679
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,360
Like I caught you. I caught you.
Caught me being nice to the man.

680
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:04,840
That was my stepdad for 17 it was
not a normal reaction. Oh, really?

681
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,060
Know what part wasn't
normal of that has changed.

682
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,640
That's when she loves, it's
horrible. It's real crazy.

683
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,360
Oh yeah. Super Fun to be on the
receiving end of that from your own mom.

684
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,370
No,
you'll have,

685
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,940
this is burger king.

686
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,170

693
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,670
favorite major jobs. Yeah,
I know. There's so many.

704
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,450
I don't think you've talked about
on the show, but um, yeah, I heard,

705
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,160
I heard that at that
first, first, first lunch.

706
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,360
Like she didn't even do that. Like, let
me gauge how you feel about it. She just,

707
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,480
she just went for it to,
that lunch was really like,

708
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,470
it was very eye opening and interesting.
Interesting is a good way.

709
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,330
Isn't that crazy that you still married
me despite my dad the first time you

710
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:48,164
meet him

711
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,223
[inaudible]

712
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,350
drops some, some embalm. Yeah.
Back in the day he was not,

713
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:58,550
he didn't pull any punches. And then
your mom was a different level though.

714
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,900
Your Dad was just more like shooting the
shit. And I could tell that, you know,

715
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:07,970
he was like, he was old world just
like it's just a old school guy.

716
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,660
I was like, okay, I knew I knew
what I was getting with him.

717
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,760
Your mom was much more unpredictable.

718
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,070
What like you like you would know
because she is unpredictable, you know,

719
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:22,800
like that. Yeah. So, but I
did not know what was not.

720
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,860
I didn't know really
what was happening there.

721
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,920
But in a weird way I kind of understood,

722
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,280
I thought I understood your mother as
being this eccentric foreign person that

723
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:39,200
has like a kind of big bold personality.
My mom is kind of like that.

724
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:42,920
Especially sometimes I've seen people
meet my mother and not know what just

725
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:44,750
happened. Like I've
seen them be like, what?

726
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:49,730
And I have to kind of go like, oh,
this is what she meant by that.

727
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,490
And this is what she meant by
that. And No, no, no, no. That's,

728
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,150
that's how she is especially is to
somebody really American, you know,

729
00:49:56,151 --> 00:50:01,151
like with two American parents and they
grew up in the suburbs and like the,

730
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,530
and they don't,
they don't meet foreigners.

731
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,550
So I kind of thought that
your mom was like, you know,

732
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,740
your mother is like a fun foreign mom,
kind of,

733
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,470
she may say a word and correctly or
it has an emotional reaction also.

734
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:21,290
She's also much more
expressive and animated.

735
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,380
There's also a thing that I related
to with your mother and mother's very

736
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:28,580
animated. So your mother, I saw her
as well. My mother does not curse.

737
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,640
So that part's, what was it really amusing
to me that you're like this fucking,

738
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,300
she was like, this can't at
Bloomingdale's. And I was like, whoa.

739
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,970
And then she was taught, she goes,
I thought they fucking bitch.

740
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,710
Fuck you announced it.
Like that is intense.

741
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:45,170
So really it's a real, real,
she was convinced it's, it's,

742
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,730
I'm so glad she's dead now. I can
talk about this stuff. But yeah,

743
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,630
she was always convinced that
someone's out to get her,

744
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,440
the woman at Bloomingdale's.
And one time, I never forget,

745
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,250
we went to a Sushi bar and the waitress,
excuse me,

746
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:03,251
sat us near the restroom and my mother
took that personally and she called her.

747
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:09,050
She goes, you're fucking gook bitch.
Don't fucking sit me next to the toilet.

748
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:12,470
You're fucking gook bitch. And I was like,
all right, we gotta go. Yeah, you got,

749
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:16,040
you can't, you can't even, and I
made her leave. I was so mortified.

750
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,620
We can't be served. It's
a lot, lot of that. Yeah.

751
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,460
And I remember someone
cut her off in traffic.

752
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:24,500
I remember one time when I
was a little little girl,

753
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,810
someone cut her off in traffic and the
woman gave a look to my mom. Some look.

754
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:33,770
My mom was like, oh, you're going
to fucking cry. Like she was.

755
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,860
She would a fight with people for
parking spaces. Like we weren't,

756
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:46,730
we were in a parking lot in San
Diego. Oh, you're gonna fucking cry.

757
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,080
Like she was so crazy.

758
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,970
And My mother was fighting for a spot
once in San Diego and part of the yelling

759
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:55,550
at people with Dean or,
no, this is before dean.

760
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,370
This is when I was just a
little girl and she would itch.

761
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:01,040
I remember they had like a fight
where the two of them were inching,

762
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:05,000
inching into the one parking
spot and my mother won that one.

763
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,300
And then later my Stepdad came in.
Yeah.

764
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,000
That was the, I got to
tell you this. Yeah.

765
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,110
I don't know if I ever tell you that
stuff first time I really felt like I wrap

766
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:16,420
my head around what you grew up with.

767
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,100
Right when you told me that
parking lot story where,

768
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:22,450
because a lot of times people speak,
you know,

769
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:27,180
hyperbole with like exaggerations
and, Oh, you know, my Stepdad,

770
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,300
he was a crazy guy.

771
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:31,470
Yeah. I don't even throw that word
around. Yeah. Loosely around me. Yeah.

772
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,420
Oh, you know, he was like, he talked a
lot of shit and you're like, yeah, okay.

773
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,180
Like I, he had a big
personalities, what you're saying,

774
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,460
but you told me a story.
You Go, yeah. You know, my,

775
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,520
my mom, I stubbed out, they there,
they were nuts. And I'm like, yeah.

776
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,060
And you go like, you know, in parking
lots, like he would talk, you know,

777
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:54,440
Talk Shit to people. Yeah. And I
go, yeah, okay. And you go one time,

778
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:59,180
this guy, like they fought over a parking
spot and I guess the other guy got it.

779
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,150
And so then my Stepdad stabbed his tires.

780
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,600
Okay. Yes. Not that. Not at that moment.

781
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,910
So what we did was later he goes,
oh,

782
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,300
there's Indian. Let's go for some
ice cream, pistachio ice cream.

783
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,310
And because we used to go to the rite aid,
they're now called rite aids, whatever.

784
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,160
Thrifty. And that was flavor. So

785
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,470
I didn't know I was a teenager.
I get in the car,

786
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,490
we'd go to the Thrifty's for
the ice cream. He goes, hold on,

787
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,520
I got to do something, gets
out of the car, stab, stab,

788
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:39,730
stab this guy's tires back in the car.
And we'd go, got, we got pistachio.

789
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:46,590
So that's really when I go
like, oh, as other level,

790
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,560
other levels.
I mean,

791
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:55,260
I can see a being someone's story
from, they were in college, right?

792
00:53:55,261 --> 00:54:00,090
I was fucking nuts and go,
but this was a 40 something,

793
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:01,650
maybe 50 something year old man.

794
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,870
And there's a lot that was going on
and he pulled over the car and stabbed

795
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,750
someone is tired and then we went off
and got ice cream. Ice Cream. That's not,

796
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,930
it's so,
it's so outrageous.

797
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,190
That actually was one of the first
stories where I was like, oh, she's,

798
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,650
she really did grow up with some not
normal shit at all. Lunacy, lunacy.

799
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:27,510
And I also didn't want you to know the
extent of it cause I wanted to marry

800
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:31,710
normal. I'll tell you, I've thought about
that story for a minute. I was like,

801
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:36,690
what in the fuck? He used to fight
with people in movie theaters.

802
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,770
Um, somebody we talking in the theater
and he'd turn around and tell him shut up.

803
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,170
And one time one guy was like, you
shut up. And then he stood out.

804
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,460
You fucking shut up. You want to take it
outside. Like it was one of those things.

805
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:52,830
And then one time in the grocery store,

806
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,860
some kid was crying and my mother told
the kid to shut up and told me that

807
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,590
Stepdad came in. I was like,
they were, they were a good pair,

808
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:04,970
believe it or not does too. I think
they found each other. That was,

809
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,150
it was like fire and kerosene and the two
of them together. That's the other one.

810
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:13,120
I remember 10 years ago, you told me the
story. You're like, this kid was crying.

811
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,290
My mom told the kid to shut
up and then the mother, right,

812
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:21,450
wasn't the mom got upset, they weren't
Gilson horse. And the mom was like,

813
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,280
don't talk to my kid like that obviously.

814
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,190
And then escalated into
take to the parking lot.

815
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:31,020
I would lose my mind if somebody said that
to me. Of course. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

816
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:32,880
It's a lot, man. I talk
about it on that. See Bro,

817
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,100
because you know what I found though?

818
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:39,510
A lot of people have wacky
parents more than have,

819
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:44,130
oh my God, I don't know. I don't think
I'm in that much of a minority. Who knows?

820
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,030
It's embarrassing. I gotta be
it. Definitely relate to that.

821
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:51,000
But what I'm saying is all of them,

822
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:55,470
and you should know that that's not okay.

823
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,000
And that's not, I mean, that becomes
your example. If you're seeing,

824
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,150
if you're a parent is like, I'm
a stab, someone's tires out.

825
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:08,460
It's not a good thing to do so bad.
And I knew it was wrong then,

826
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,070
you know, even when I grew up
in it and you grew up in it,

827
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:12,120
you think that's the norm.

828
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,410
But I remember being like
10 years old and thinking,

829
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,080
surely I was adopted.
I swear to God,

830
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:23,070
I had the thought that one day someone's
going to knock on the door and tell

831
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,560
that I was actually of another family
and they're going to take me away.

832
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,260
I really knew at an early
age that I did not belong.

833
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,230
And it's taken years of therapy
to reprogram, like to, to um,

834
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,560
to unlearn the bad learning. Sure.
All that stuff. A lot of it, you know.

835
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,750
See the thing is you're lucky that you
don't see that as the way to be because

836
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:45,940
there's people that get raised
like that and then they go,

837
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,280
I'm going to go stab some
times. Absolutely. Cause it's
cause it's what, you know,

838
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,470
learned behavior. Yeah. That's
a thing. If that's all you,

839
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,070
but I knew and I was like,
this is not,

840
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,370
this doesn't feel good to me
because I knew that the people,

841
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:01,150
like I go to school and I
go to my friends' houses and
I knew that their parents

842
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:04,240
weren't the same way. Right. And
I knew that something was amiss.

843
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:08,670
Oh this is really kind of holding
it together here. Yeah. And it's,

844
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,740
it's not just the immigrant thing cause
that's one layer of difference in your

845
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:12,790
home,
but it was like,

846
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:17,970
oh somebody mentally ill and somebody is
a bit of a sociopath and that level of

847
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:23,680
a short fuse as a real short fuse.
Something else. Yeah. Yeah. Some special.

848
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,700
Yeah.
Wow.

849
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,290
Sunday there will be a book about this.

850
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:33,580
I'm sure there will be or something cause
my God and that's just the tip of the

851
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:37,480
iceberg. Yeah. That's a
crazy time. Anyway. Yeah.

852
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,290
That's the one I'm one I never
got to know is your stuff.

853
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:43,030
Probably never made her step father.
That's too bad. I think he's still around.

854
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,610
Yeah, there's still time.
Good. You want me to,

855
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:49,540
you want me to tell him where we
live by them over. See if, uh,

856
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,790
let's see if he would, maybe this is
something he would relate to here. Oh No.

857
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:01,180
Hi. We'll stop. Hello.

858
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,840
Close. My efficient is not on a card
that she stopped school tomorrow.

859
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,410
That we were still big alive
by any money until the flood.

860
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:19,180
The show
what the occasion?

861
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:23,730
Half of it. Christine's, my
mum always finds a good thing.

862
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,840
You might never come because was a
big hype thing. Darn about last night

863
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,260
we, everybody is sitting around the
breakfast table. It looks like, right.

864
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,460
Having a conversation that we can decipher
4% of jibberish and then the mother

865
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:41,300
walks away to another part of the kitchen

866
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,080
and it grabs the competencies of
big hats in don about us Nazi.

867
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:47,770
That's why I like younger brothers
and sisters. I stay in dorms.

868
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,450
What a beef stays outside.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

869
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,600
The screen goes to black

870
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,560
and it says hi.
Yay.

871
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,160
You keep quiet about gun crime. It's
like pulling the trigger yourself. Well,

872
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:20,970
I should say that right before that she
shot the youngest child in the head,

873
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,950
the kitchen table.

874
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,390
So what part of this was funny for you?
What do you mean? I haven't seen this. Oh,

875
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,210
okay. I haven't seen this. I was like,
I thought you'd selected this for no,

876
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,020
no, my God. No. She shot a
young child in the head at,

877
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,520
at breakfast.
Okay.

878
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,790
And then it says if you keep quiet
about gun crime site pulling the trigger

879
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,110
yourself through that.

880
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,110
And they're not really not fucking
around in the UK with these, this,

881
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:52,270
that's not even that old.
It's 2006 good God, great at,

882
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:57,050
I remember in the 90s if you bought
a pack of cigarettes, it was way,

883
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,510
but it wasn't like these bullshit
surgeon general warnings.

884
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,990
If there are pictures of like black
lungs and most of the world does that,

885
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,910
we're the only place it doesn't
do that best because this,

886
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:09,030
the tobacco lobby stronger. Yes. And we,

887
01:00:09,031 --> 01:00:12,110
we don't do well with reality in
the United States. That's also true.

888
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,290
We live in a childish reality.
This is the play it safe. Oh,

889
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,000
this is another power lines.
How I remember this one. You do

890
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,670
kids
in the power line.

891
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,950
He's going to get the electric
heater that had been electrocuted

892
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:39,160
spot. You'd never knew about claims.
Fucking power lines like that.

893
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,650
Oh my God,
don't do it.

894
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,180
It just jumped.
Climbing pilots can kill.

895
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,790
Don't take a chance with electricity.
Oh

896
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,280
Dude. So far. By the way, the
gun one is by far the worst shit.

897
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,670
It was really terrible. Who's climbing? I
mean apparently it's a problem. I guess.

898
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:10,860
So Psa,
I'll make a deal with you.

899
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,630
If your kite gets stuck in a
power line. Eat Dog food. No,

900
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:20,070
I'll get you a new kite.
You don't have to climb up the power line.

901
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:24,540
I think everybody should tell their
kid that. Uh, by you two new kites.

902
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:28,600
Don't worry about it. Yeah,
let's tell Ellis that. Yeah.

903
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,380
If anything's ever been a power line,
you get more of them.

904
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:37,610
Never go get wrap our son in bubble wrap
and make sure he never gets sick again

905
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,090
and never hurts himself.

906
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:43,320
Ever put them in the basement
that we don't have train him up.

907
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,400
I don't know that that
created an alternate world.

908
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:49,590
It's totally safe that he
can just play in. No, I know.

909
01:01:49,591 --> 01:01:54,150
It's what you want to do when you have
a little jeans. Uh, here's one for you.

910
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,733
Thanks.

911
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,713
Nice Lady.

912
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,530
They're just showing
that everyone can get vd

913
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:25,710
pregnant lady is bt? Sure. The butcher
clearly as Vt. That guy looks sick.

914
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:30,750
Yeah, totally. As a cloud. Not that lady.

915
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:35,150
She looks sweet. Scott
Flowers. She's got to smell it.

916
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,070
When you think so these guys
gave him and his kid had,

917
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,470
that old man has meetings.
Well God,

918
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,640
the baby is feeding no horse.

919
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,120
The horse has BD course.

920
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:53,121
If you're curious or confused or get
information or a pamphlet for BD,

921
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,320
that's the beauty of it.
Helps your doctor

922
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,500
from getting its tech sucked.

923
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,260
Yeah.

924
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,400
So baby deck side. Yeah man. The
babies don't get vd. Of course.

925
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,443
Stupid.

926
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:05,630
Okay.

927
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,540
It's commercial is a little,
the horse doesn't have BD either.

928
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:13,500
Does that lady riding it?
Does Doug. Doug. Doug. Huh?

929
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:18,280
Look at me busy as a bee.
Where did I get all this?

930
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,030
Oh Man.
I remember this.

931
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,660
This is good sleep and I don't need,

932
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,760
but I've got the cleanest
house on the street.

933
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,720
I like it.
These bugs all

934
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,583
meth.

935
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,130
Let's see. The thing is they
made it sound fun, right? It was.

936
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,820
It was like you can get a clean house.
Yeah. Your toilets will be scrubbed.

937
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:54,000
You'll be nice and
skinny. Actually, what he,

938
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:57,580
I think most people would probably go is
like, oh, I seen the dial it back. Right.

939
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,020
There's this lady just a too much math.

940
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,220
She just doesn't know how to start
it off. She's just cleaning. You Go.

941
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:03,910
I want to clean. I wouldn't,
yeah. I don't want it, but I mean,

942
01:04:03,911 --> 01:04:07,480
I'll do it like I wouldn't clean
and get high. I do other things.

943
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,130
Yeah. Fun Things. Fun Things. Yeah.

944
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,930
See this cute little vile here.
It's crack rock cocaine.

945
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,310
The most addictive for you. Think it's
the glamour drug of the eighties well,

946
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:22,050
that's the point of this front.
That little reminder, hey,

947
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:24,980
can kill you if you've
got to die for something.

948
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,440
This sure as hell ain't yet.

949
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,860
It's not effective. That was
terrible. That was stupid.

950
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:35,590
Like that wasn't even cautionary.
No.

951
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:39,910
Who wants to listen to him about that and
he slid have flavor flave do that shit.

952
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,290
And they'll be like, oh
no, I love him. Pee Wee.

953
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:47,920
This is crack rock cocaine.
Okay.

954
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:52,000
It isn't glamorous or a cool hook.
Kids stuff.

955
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,410
It's the most addictive kind
of cocaine and it can kill you.

956
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,580
What's really bad is nobody
knows how much it takes.

957
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:05,950
So every time you use it, you
risk dying. It isn't worth it.

958
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,053
All right,

959
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:11,170
well that's about what number we saw
how we watched his new movie and we were

960
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:14,730
trying to guess his age.
Yeah. And he's like 70 yeah,

961
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,310
I thought he was 48 yeah,
we start 70

962
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:23,260
he's way older than we
thought. It's 50 no, no,

963
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,770
no, no, no. I got a double.

964
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:31,660
He must have been 31 at the height of his
fame. And that was what, 20 years ago?

965
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:35,740
So it was 50 he's 64 get out of here.

966
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,213
Yeah.

967
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,560
Yep.
Paul Rodriguez.

968
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,610
Rubinfeld Aka Paul Reubens.

969
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:51,610
Yeah, 64 man. But they computer generated.

970
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,280
I didn't know that. Well, they did some,

971
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,710
some computer stuff on it.

972
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,010
Oh, the latest. Yeah. [inaudible]
64 I don't care with that.

973
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:06,120
He still looks incredible.
A Mace. Yeah. What is,

974
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:11,390
can I read this email from a listener
about the dog shit food [inaudible] so

975
01:06:12,571 --> 01:06:14,620
last week,
um,

976
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:19,920
I ate a little bit of dog food just to
see if my poo would smell as bad as dog

977
01:06:19,921 --> 01:06:24,921
shit because someone wrote in
and asked us if we ate dog food.

978
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:29,730
What are shit smell like it. Anyway,
this guy writes in, Hey Hitler's.

979
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:33,210
I thought I'd try him in here and say
that most of the unique smell of dog shit

980
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,040
does not come from dog food,
but in fact comes from the dogs.

981
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,860
Anal scent glands door.

982
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,410
There are two of these on either side
of a dog's. How'd he say ass? Hell yeah.

983
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,480
They helped the dog markets territory.
No Shit.

984
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,960
The problem is that with modern dog
food made of cow brains and maggots.

985
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,310
Fuck, is that, oh no. Oh Shit.
I should grab this. Okay.

986
01:06:58,850 --> 01:06:59,790
Right in the middle of an email.

987
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:05,220
Sorry. Sorry, I was in the middle. I
know, but I thought I, I had to get that.

988
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,500
Now, the problem is that modern dog
food made of cow brains and magnets,

989
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:15,501
there often isn't enough fiber in a dog's
diet to push all that smelly goop out

990
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:19,920
of their scent glands
and they become impacted.

991
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,920
This is what causes dogs drag
your ass is across the carpet.

992
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:23,760
If that doesn't work,

993
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:26,100
you might have to stick a finger in
there and squeeze all that doubt.

994
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,180
We don't do that.

995
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:31,730
We take our dog to the vet and they do
anal gland expression cause if he dad

996
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,270
could do it by the groomers, they don't
really get in there the way the vet does.

997
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,600
Just a little tip. If you guys
have dogs, take him to the vet.

998
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,520
Bitsy needs to have that done
once a month. Is it once a month?

999
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,760
Because she's like a pure bred Dum Dum.
Yeah.

1000
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:51,390
And you know they're genetically
defective. Yeah. So That's interesting.

1001
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:54,810
I didn't know that.
Their anal glands make it smell bad.

1002
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:59,530
[inaudible] interesting. I didn't know
that either. Interesting. I didn't know.

1003
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,300
Does that look familiar to you or no?

1004
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,640
What's a photo of two bottles
of water post show in Portland.

1005
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,280
You got a full bottle here,

1006
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,710
basically a half bottle of water there.

1007
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,210
That's after you.
That's after you perform.

1008
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:24,740
The email says Tom. Christina put
on a great show in PDX last week.

1009
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:26,810
I was front and center.
Yes,

1010
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,750
she did have two bottles
of water with her.

1011
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,050
Attaches a photo of what they
look like at the end of the show.

1012
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:37,910
One completely full one, perhaps half
empty. Oh, and on the podcast this week,

1013
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:42,170
she conveniently didn't mention that
she dropped the open one during the set

1014
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,690
where she probably lost at
least four to five ounces.

1015
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:46,820
So based on the visual evidence,

1016
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:50,480
it looks like she your kid about
three ounces through a 90 minute set.

1017
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,410
She was horse at the end.
You just can't help some people.

1018
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:59,030
It's no wonder why you're
the true water champ.

1019
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,560
Thank you for your thoughts. First of
all, Blake, thank you Blake. Blake,

1020
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,090
how do I know those two waters are in
fact my waters? Those are your waters.

1021
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:13,130
He had them tested for my saliva
to make it genetically, please,

1022
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:16,460
clearly decoy water.

1023
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,350
A lot of pussies in this argument
right now. It's just not happening.

1024
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,970
That's Blake bullshit.
I've been getting reports about you,

1025
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,750
your lack of hydration in South Carolina.
Yeah.

1026
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:36,230
I wasn't in South Carolina, North
Carolina. I was not lacking.

1027
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:38,160
I was so hydrated. I don't, I didn't,

1028
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:41,660
I heard lots of reports that you
didn't take any sips during your show.

1029
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:46,310
He didn't bring any water up on stage.
Things of that nature. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1030
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,740
I did drink a lot there.
People were talking about it.

1031
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,950
Nobody's talking about your hydration.
There was on the news.

1032
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:57,100
Um, hello. Mommies can't help but
notice that over the past few months,

1033
01:09:57,101 --> 01:10:00,310
Tom has continuously postpone,
is required. Colonoscopy,

1034
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,940
how we just addressed this,
but we did a few episodes back.

1035
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:06,340
I was a static to discover
the Tom rescheduled the date,

1036
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,730
the same as my birthday on
the 27th I thought, wow.

1037
01:10:09,731 --> 01:10:12,460
Tom's colon and health is
one of my best birthday.

1038
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,600
A birthday presents a guy could
receive however I am now distraught.

1039
01:10:16,601 --> 01:10:19,240
Find out he was going to
postpone again. Beg of you, Tom,

1040
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:23,170
please give me yourself and
your, your gift, your family.

1041
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:27,720
The gift of a perfect colon health on
the 21st birthday on my 21st birthday of

1042
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:31,840
October 27th I'll drink one for you.
It doesn't say who that's from.

1043
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,630
Um,
but thank you and I will,

1044
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,450
I will not do it on the 27th
because I will not be here,

1045
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,340
but I will reschedule it again.

1046
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,310
Why are you showing me?

1047
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:46,110
I made you read that because I want to
shame you into making that appointment.

1048
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:50,880
You just had violent diarrhea.
That's true. And I care about you.

1049
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:55,110
Dumb dumb. Can I read this
email? Yeah. I love this. Hi.

1050
01:10:55,111 --> 01:10:56,730
Zim Genes and surge jeans.

1051
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,980
I wanted to trim it on the shower debate.
That isn't really a debate, Thomas.

1052
01:11:01,981 --> 01:11:03,730
Correct.
Uh,

1053
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,950
that for showers that are shower slash
Tub combos with shower curtains as

1054
01:11:07,951 --> 01:11:09,720
opposed to shower doors,
you enter from the rear.

1055
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:14,100
Also glad that Christina quickly
realized how it was. She did

1056
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,650
the opposite for so many years.
However,

1057
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,850
I wanted to quickly point out that in
most bathrooms with this type of shower

1058
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:21,780
tub deal,

1059
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,820
the toilet is parallel to the tub on
the same bathroom wall as a showerhead.

1060
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,110
Meaning that in order to enter the shower
at via the wrong slash psychotic way,

1061
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,890
you would actually have to shimmy between
the tub and the toilet in order to

1062
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:35,724
enter that way.

1063
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,200
Just think to all your many experiences
and hotel bathrooms to know what I'm

1064
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:41,034
talking about.

1065
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:45,510
But the average bathroom is literally set
up to naturally allow you to enter the

1066
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:50,100
shower from the rear stop fighting the
natural architecture of the bathroom

1067
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:54,780
floor pan plan. This madness
must end love the pod. Huge Fan.

1068
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,560
Thanks Rick.

1069
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,880
So they're saying that you're entering
incorrectly doing that are our old

1070
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:04,860
bathroom. The toilet was directly
parallel to the shower. Right?

1071
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:09,861
So I would get off the toilet and then
squeeze my way in between the toilet and

1072
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,100
the shower because it was
so small and our old place.

1073
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:18,480
Of course then I would force the
issue to do it. And you such a dummy.

1074
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,140
Oh, you're not a dummy, but I think
you understand that there's a better,

1075
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:23,303
there's a better way.

1076
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:28,470
Yeah. I really made an effort
to, to do it that way. So funny.

1077
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:30,030
That seemed more intuitive to me.

1078
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,670
Nothing back. And now,
you know. No, I know. Um,

1079
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,870
don't worry this, this is too long.
This dental update, sorry. Okay.

1080
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:43,510
In retrospect is too long. Well, I thought
we could play the other thing please.

1081
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,980
Um,
let me see.

1082
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,540
You posted right on the cheat sheet

1083
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,380
first lane.
Oh yeah.

1084
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:12,470
We're still, by the way, you lowered
the seat. No, I didn't. Yeah, it is.

1085
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,820
It's definitely, I didn't lower it. Not
Manually. It must be lowering over time.

1086
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,380
Really.
I didn't do it myself.

1087
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,680
Like I didn't do it intentionally,
so I'm trying to,

1088
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,470
okay. There you go. Oh my
gosh. Yeah. We need new chairs

1089
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:37,710
so our teeth are still not,
that's embarrassing that we do this.

1090
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:41,880
It's just too much going on after we
move. We need to find new dentists. Yeah,

1091
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,960
it's been months. Uh, but it's time to,

1092
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:52,890
to show people.
This is one of your greatest discoveries.

1093
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:57,900
Was this sent in or do you
10 sentence less credible.

1094
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,730
Incredible discovery. I'm really
stoked about this one. Yeah. Let's, uh,

1095
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:03,740
let's see.

1096
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,320
It's my be the favorite thing
I've seen in a long time.

1097
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,453
Yeah.

1098
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,040
Are you embarrassed about your
broken crooked and teeth? Do you

1099
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,090
hide your smile because you're
ashamed of unsightly gaps and cracks?

1100
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,520
Would you like to have
big smile confidence,

1101
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:21,130
but just can't afford the expensive work?

1102
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,950
Introducing million dollar
smile by perfect smile.

1103
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,690
The amazing removable reusable veneer
that instantly gives you the look of

1104
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:29,470
perfect teeth.

1105
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:33,040
You'll be proud to smile about million
dollar smile fits right over your

1106
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,960
existing teeth so you can always put

1107
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:38,780
best face forward.

1108
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,190
The secret is the super comfortable Mike
growth in polypropylene veneer Sibley's

1109
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:44,240
soak it in hot water.

1110
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:48,260
Press it on your top layer of teeth and
it custom conforms right over your teeth.

1111
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:51,290
Instantly.
You can show off $1 million smile.

1112
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:56,350
It kind of looks like you
got an a on a $10 million.

1113
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,580
Yeah, the $10 smile over the phone. Uh,

1114
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:04,780
what's it called? Made to order.
Done. Look at shopping TV.

1115
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,370
That looks better actually. That site.
Yeah, and the gums rec extra red.

1116
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,880
If you'll notice they're reading,
you're looking,

1117
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,060
obviously they're not going to
match your bottoms to, well, no.

1118
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:18,920
Kind of look like Rudy Giuliani.
Yeah,

1119
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,510
these are the Rudy's hair.
He's a Giuliani's. You need.

1120
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:25,930
That guy's a multimillionaire. He has
now, no excuse. He's wearing what? He's,

1121
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:30,750
he's got his million dollar smiling.
Maybe that's what he's doing. Yeah.

1122
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,680
Maybe that's what he's doing.
He a boy.

1123
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:39,440
No boy. They are like, how does that work?

1124
01:15:39,441 --> 01:15:42,960
Cause they everyone's million
dollar smile looks identical. Yeah.

1125
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:47,420
It's not custom made because everybody's,
and that's a gap.

1126
01:15:47,421 --> 01:15:49,970
That's not a knocked out too.
They had the same problem.

1127
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:55,070
So then how does that makes no
sense man. Well, keep playing it.

1128
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:59,960
Well, I know, but I just
wanted to show no, Rudy,

1129
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:04,540
that's not looking at, and you know
are smaller. Right? Look at the top.

1130
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:09,090
We've got the million dollar smile on top
and then the eight dial.

1131
01:16:09,091 --> 01:16:13,260
A dollar smile on the bottom. Yeah,
the Julian, what's his name? Fellows.

1132
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:17,510
Downton Abbey smiles is, no, no, no. Ah,

1133
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,160
Jesus Christ.
All right.

1134
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,840
A million dollar smile.
One to

1135
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,390
show off your million dollar smile.

1136
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:32,480
See everybody who puts
in those flippers, they,

1137
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:36,680
they don't smile normal. They
go, yeah, they get fairly open.

1138
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:40,970
They're like barely show them.
They,

1139
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:43,800
they look real clunky too.
Oof.

1140
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:47,800
Dollar smile. Easily. Most
for job interviews. We're done

1141
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:52,100
and that guy went, hm hm hm. Oh,
these are going to look great.

1142
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,410
They look great.

1143
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,880
Go on dates when you need to look great
and when the camera comes out. Okay.

1144
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:02,620
Crazy moms look as too crazy, man. That's
a good friend of mine, mother. Actually,

1145
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,440
she's really crazy.
Hmm.

1146
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:08,960
You'll be proud to say cheese
with a bright white smile. Oh yes.

1147
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:13,460
For dental coverage. This gives me $1
million smile. Oh wait, I'm in love.

1148
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,370
Everyone's like, oh, here for
death cover. I know the nine laws.

1149
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:22,140
My mind, you can't talk with
the million dollar smile. Oh,

1150
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,140
I got the million dollar smile.

1151
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,160
My new smile. See my smile. I look great
when I go out on a date. Nobody can talk.

1152
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:33,360
I'm going out when I'm hanging out.
It's just fun to smile again. Big Smile.

1153
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:37,440
Catherine. Million while
fishing. Big Smile. Confidence.

1154
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,640
Nobody can talk.
Is a custom fit guaranteed or your money?

1155
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,960
Look at her bunny size teeth.

1156
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:47,520
Every fifth is a custom fit guaranteed
or your money back instantly.

1157
01:17:47,521 --> 01:17:50,000
You can have the look and
here's like good teeth.

1158
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:54,440
Just snap them on in the
morning with a smile. Oh my God.

1159
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,590
Can't afford terrible.
And this is a great, yeah,

1160
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,930
no. Listen, listen,

1161
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:06,270
I don't want to hear about how you
can't afford cosmetic dentistry.

1162
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:10,200
I want to hear about you
have debt because you went,

1163
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:14,970
you had cosmetic dentistry. That's
the right answer. Yeah, I have that.

1164
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:19,030
But I fixed my teeth. Yes.
Just like I fixed my hair. Yes.

1165
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:22,140
And I fixed my eyes and I fixed my face.

1166
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,450
Anything on your body is a priority.

1167
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,620
Things that people see with their
eyes when they look at, you know,

1168
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:32,190
I would venture to say anything on
your body that needs addressing.

1169
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:36,930
That's a priority. Yeah, but mouth is
a big in your life. You can't come on,

1170
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,280
look at her. Look at
her. Look at this Dennis.

1171
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,980
Cause you look like a dentist.
No, he looks like he's dying.

1172
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,330
He looks like he backs up the,

1173
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:49,320
the forklift that drops off the
million dollar smile pallets. You know,

1174
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,570
definitely.
He's,

1175
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:54,120
I got a bunch of million dollars
files on the back of this truck.

1176
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:59,820
Fred van Curran. See his teeth actually
look fine. He doesn't need 2 million.

1177
01:18:59,821 --> 01:19:02,700
He's already got $1 million
smile. Yeah, he has minor.

1178
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,150
Well they did is they show you the
three levels. His, his real minor. Oh,

1179
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:09,270
she's got it. Yeah. And then she's like,
I don't even have any fucking teeth. See,

1180
01:19:09,271 --> 01:19:13,860
for her that's an okay investment. But
for him, all you need is some bonding.

1181
01:19:13,861 --> 01:19:16,140
What did this lady do
here on top to get those?

1182
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:20,190
She didn't go to the dentist for
like 20 years now or worse than that.

1183
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:21,540
Now you got the million dollar smile.

1184
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,100
We still don't know how much the
million dollar smile is. Is it? Oh,

1185
01:19:26,101 --> 01:19:30,720
let's find out $100,000 is it?
What are you guys, wait, wait,

1186
01:19:30,721 --> 01:19:34,110
I don't know how much it,
yeah, let's guys, well there
I think they were showing,

1187
01:19:34,111 --> 01:19:38,470
they were trying to show an extreme at
the beginning and the head multi-tiered

1188
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,590
prices of cosmetic work done.

1189
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,420
So it's gotta be just infinitely less.
I'm going with $40.

1190
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:46,501
Yeah,

1191
01:19:46,501 --> 01:19:51,501
I'm going to go with three easy payments
of 1999 so that's 60 bucks basically.

1192
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,600
Okay. So, and they're trying to tell you,

1193
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:59,730
do that for your mouth.
Do that in replacement of teeth.

1194
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:04,350
Spend 40 or $60. No, man,

1195
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,720
you make it happen. You make
it happen. You go to, yeah,
you go to a dental college,

1196
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,330
go to the Philippines, they
have teeth. Go get it there.

1197
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:16,200
Get a boat and sail over
there. Yeah, take out,

1198
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,520
take out credit from the
borrow against your house.

1199
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:24,190
You sell whatever it is you got to do.
And don't forget the cash thing I taught,

1200
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,630
a buddy of mine did this
with a pregnant wife.

1201
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,170
He let his health insurance lapse,
horrible.

1202
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:35,550
Finds out his wife's pregnant with twins.
Guy has no car. He's in a full panic.

1203
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:40,260
He goes to these different doctors with
cash and it goes, I don't have insurance,

1204
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:44,900
but if I pay you cash, right, will you do
x, Y, and z? And they all said yes. Yeah,

1205
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,250
he paid a fraction,
but he offered cash.

1206
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,970
Can I say two dental insurances we've
discussed is horse shit anyways.

1207
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:55,530
Oh fuck down. Just go fucking go. Do it.

1208
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,140
Just go do it. Look, if
you're like, dude, I'm broke.

1209
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:02,490
And I understand that we're speaking from
a very ablest ablest. Yes, thank you.

1210
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:08,030
But I always like when I
was a broke ass opening act.

1211
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,500
Yeah, still had dental work
done. Put it off all the time.

1212
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:17,220
You don't want to say, I know what he's
done and we paid for it newly no money.

1213
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,570
You know what's trash? A discover
card. It's for your down years.

1214
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,220
So when you,
if you're in,

1215
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:28,221
you're broke years now you go ahead and
you get a discover card and you throw a

1216
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:32,100
couple of grand on it and you'll pay it
off eventually and you don't have nice

1217
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:36,450
teeth. You know what I would do
what? I blow the Wu Tang clan. Jesus.

1218
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:40,610
What if they offered that we're going to
fix your teeth? Absolutely. All night.

1219
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:45,420
That lady can give a Bj.
Huh? The head fits real nice.

1220
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:50,390
Right in there. You're your best blowjob
years. Yeah. She knows how to do it right.

1221
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,450
The price tag is on.

1222
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:57,330
I said 40 you said 66 this was like
prices right here. Okay. Yup. Yup.

1223
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,970
[inaudible] is terrible.

1224
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:06,971
It kind of read the gums are look like
have periodontal it didn't find out.

1225
01:22:07,641 --> 01:22:11,070
Yeah, let's, let's see. But that
the gums are are, first of all,

1226
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:15,560
they got a match and not everybody has
the same color gums I know. Or the teeth.

1227
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,930
Terrible. You have to be shaped
to fit your teeth and your mouth.

1228
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,750
That's why veneers are so expensive.

1229
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:26,340
Cause somebody custom crafts them
to match your everything else.

1230
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:30,660
Yeah. The length of the, the width,
the shape has to go with your,

1231
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,950
what you have already.

1232
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:38,100
Just one size fits all veneers.
Damn.

1233
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:41,280
Catch your life.
The smile.

1234
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:46,250
It was like a smile system here.
The million dollar smile. But that,

1235
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,570
that's funny because I,

1236
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,440
I just clicked on that
and it didn't even say,

1237
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,890
um,
let's see.

1238
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:00,030
I went to $1 million smile
and it was for a teeth.

1239
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:04,290
Whitener it's like a different
by perfect smile veneers. Okay,

1240
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:09,250
let me try it again. Million
dollar smile. Perfect.

1241
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,450
Smile veneers.

1242
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:15,560
Okay,
let's see.

1243
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:23,010
Um, perfect smile. Okay. It's
called, it's perfect. Smile teeth.

1244
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:27,210
Wow. Buy One, get one 1499

1245
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,840
99,
1515 buy one get one.

1246
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,230
Buy One get one. Only go. I just
pulled the same thing. Yeah.

1247
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:42,230
Oh, Ooh. What was that fifth? It's our,

1248
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:45,750
our nanny putting our kid down.
That's how she puts him down.

1249
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:50,190
She just throws him in the crib.
No, she knocked over the desk.

1250
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,080
[inaudible] I know that sounds very well.

1251
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:57,120
You get two for 15
[inaudible] 15 so I went,

1252
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:02,190
I was guessing 40 oh.
Oh she looks terrible.

1253
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,410
She looks slutty.
Of course she does.

1254
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,890
Do you think she became slightly
because her teeth, in other words,

1255
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:12,330
did you overcompensate for how she
felt about this by being slutty?

1256
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:17,460
Cause she has like a slutty slutty.
Right. There's no low lights.

1257
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:20,520
When you bleach your hair blond,
you got to have low lights.

1258
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:24,660
You can't just do one white.
He's a good friend. He's sweet.

1259
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,730
He's like, I'll watch your house. I'll
make sure your mom gets home safe. Yeah.

1260
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:33,720
Like I want, I like him. I like
her. I feel like she's like a,

1261
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,550
like a working mom. This lady, she
works at the bank. Yeah. She's nice.

1262
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:43,520
This one where I've got trust issues.
I don't like her at all. Yeah. Yeah,

1263
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,080
I see there is that sled again.
She blondie,

1264
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:49,490
she's doing like some real paid.

1265
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:54,690
You know what that looks like? They
look like fake. Um, Halloween teeth,

1266
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,630
like Dracula teeth do not wear
perfect smile when eating,

1267
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:03,450
but yet they plug it that you wear it
on a date. Oh right. Multiple Times.

1268
01:25:03,451 --> 01:25:05,090
Even showed someone on a date.
Wait,

1269
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,400
can you even sleep while wearing the
perfect to not wear it when sleeping.

1270
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,490
You can't do shit with your perfect smile.

1271
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,670
Can I wear it more than this
is the biggest red flag.

1272
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,740
I mean it's obvious it's 15 bucks,

1273
01:25:16,741 --> 01:25:20,700
but they like weird on a date and
then I just want to just donate.

1274
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:23,820
You're on a diet.
It's designed to be worn frequently.

1275
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,670
Remember to take it out at night when,

1276
01:25:25,671 --> 01:25:28,530
when eating that of
where it all over again.

1277
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,040
It's one size fits all for your mouth.
Can we order when?

1278
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:36,210
Let's order it just to see what it's
like. Oh Man. I'm dying to see how,

1279
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,980
let's order it and I'll try
it. Okay, well I don't know.

1280
01:25:40,981 --> 01:25:41,850
Maybe I should try it.

1281
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,030
You want to try it cause I got real
veneers but they get stuck to those and

1282
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:49,800
ripped off. That'd be bad as far. No,

1283
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,200
I'm doing select one.

1284
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:59,760
Okay. Not right now around. I know. I
want to make sure that I don't forget.

1285
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:03,260
So I'm putting this thing in there. I'll
make a note of it. The perfect smile,

1286
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,880
dude.
Guess what?

1287
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:10,450
Shipping and handling is 1398 and the
the thing is 1499 that's bullshit.

1288
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:17,180
There's, there's no reason it's $13
for shipping and handling says seven,

1289
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:21,830
but I think it's because there's an
additional one in there. It goes up.

1290
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:26,820
That's stupid. Yeah. We ship things from
stamps.com it doesn't cost that much,

1291
01:26:26,821 --> 01:26:29,270
you know?
But do you want to have nice teeth or not?

1292
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,850
Sometimes you got to pay the price. All
right. I just started in the [inaudible].

1293
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:36,050
You Ready? Yeah. Perfect.

1294
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:39,110
Or can't talk.

1295
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:43,370
Wearing perfect smile is a perfect smile.

1296
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:47,420
Don't eat, don't sleep and don't try to
talk with your perfect smile day though.

1297
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:51,140
I feel bad for these people,
man. Of course. Yeah. If you're,

1298
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:54,480
if you're getting the perfect smile,
things have not gone well for you. Yeah,

1299
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:57,260
you're me. You're making bad
decisions. Yeah, that's true.

1300
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,440
And I'm telling you don't do it
and encourage this, but now I do.

1301
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,340
Uh,
it's,

1302
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:08,660
it's okay to spend the money man on
teeth. Yeah. It's a priority. Yeah.

1303
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:12,350
You really got to, we've been saying
that on the show for years. Yeah.

1304
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,720
I do it every 10 years. I rap and I
have to get two new front teeth. Yeah.

1305
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,170
And we had a, it costs a fortune a
lot of that when you did it then.

1306
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,860
And I still did it. Yeah. Cause it's
a priority. I know. And I'd actually,

1307
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:28,130
I didn't even blink and you're like, I
got to get my teeth. And I was like, yeah,

1308
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:32,570
of course. Of course. Of course.

1309
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:36,290
You do. Some people let
it go. Let it go. Oh yeah.

1310
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,130
Let's see.
Ready?

1311
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,133
Hmm.

1312
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:47,683
Stupid Bitch.

1313
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,940
If the driver of this car had
kept his speed to a hundred k,

1314
01:27:56,430 --> 01:28:01,160
he is where he would have stopped if
he'd stopped here. His wife wouldn't

1315
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,420
take the full impact of the
crash and die instantly.

1316
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:06,340
If he'd stopped here.

1317
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:10,240
The last thing Sally will ever hear
wouldn't be the sound of our own neck

1318
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:12,570
breaking. All right. I gotta like Nikki.

1319
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:17,350
Can we stop [inaudible] ribs
and her collarbone? As for Jim,

1320
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:22,180
well, Jim could have avoided
broken bones and a broken heart,

1321
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:27,700
but anyway, it's too late for all that
now because this isn't where it stops.

1322
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,010
It's where it all day.

1323
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,843
Okay.

1324
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,233
Wow.

1325
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:44,170
Ah,
Aussies that seem,

1326
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:48,730
can we stop or we done?
This is terrible.

1327
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,013
Okay.

1328
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:55,510
Wow. All right. Okay. All right. Jeans.

1329
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:58,500
Um,
anything else

1330
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:06,240
we can't close on that. Let's see
what's up with pastor manning. Okay,

1331
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,120
pastor meeting. Here we go.
I haven't seen him in awhile.

1332
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:16,320
He's really, you know the pastor man,
and we played him before. He's, um,

1333
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,600
what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with y'all?

1334
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:22,620
Right.
That's pastor James David Madigan.

1335
01:29:22,621 --> 01:29:26,210
I'm the Lord's servant. I'm the
sodomites. Slay on the Solo. Satan,

1336
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:30,140
the son of a sacco white trash.
If you thought that aids was bad,

1337
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:35,210
you ain't seen nothing yet. You
ain't seen nothing yet. Yeah.

1338
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,760
Well,
you ain't seen nothing my friend,

1339
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:41,870
until you have a flame coming out of
your butthole and you live in as best as

1340
01:29:41,871 --> 01:29:46,220
diaper the baby. But to keep that flame
from burning a hole in your pants,

1341
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,050
you ain't seen nothing yet.

1342
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:51,500
I got a penis injected and the Butthole,

1343
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,810
a penis injected in a
butthole of every Saturday.

1344
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:01,360
Every Saturday night for a sodomite
has a penis injected in my butthole.

1345
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:03,950
I got a burning man.

1346
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,030
The only thing that's like out,

1347
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:10,770
really outrageous cause this
guy's such a, uh, a hateful,

1348
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,180
homophobic lunatic.

1349
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:17,450
The only thing that always blows my mind
is that he has actual followers. Tons.

1350
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:21,150
Yeah. I mean, I don't know about tons,
but he definitely has Brooklyn. Right?

1351
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:24,150
Does he have, uh, uh, I think he's,
I don't know if it's Brooklyn. It's,

1352
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:27,120
it's in New York for sure.
But he,

1353
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,280
he has people that far,

1354
01:30:30,281 --> 01:30:35,250
like he is the lead pastor at a lot
of, you know, for a lot of people.

1355
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:39,540
And it's, I dunno man.
It's a really, really,

1356
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:43,800
really nuts that, that this is
their, this is the guy they look to,

1357
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:49,170
to teach, you know, he's a
teacher essentially. Yup.
Shows you the impact, right?

1358
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:53,860
Yeah. I mean this guy is
teaching people. Yeah.

1359
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:59,580
Why don't we got a plane
coming out of my butt? Oh God.

1360
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:03,870
I'm going to become a sodomized.
Got of cutting out of the butthole.

1361
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:07,320
Jesus.
Come into my bud TD Jakes.

1362
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:10,950
Creflo dollar Barack Hussein Obama.
The come into my bud.

1363
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:15,180
You better go and pray to God and
ask God to come into, in my blood.

1364
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,880
When that penis comes out the frame, we'll
start writing. Yeah. I'm not the worst,

1365
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,923
but butthole.

1366
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:26,040
Uh, yeah. I think maybe he's
in Harlem. Harlem, right?

1367
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,560
There we go. That law organization. Yeah.

1368
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:31,800
Healing word in my butt hole and
got the wide and mountain pothole.

1369
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:36,540
Right now somebody's
on Harlem Nights.

1370
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:42,160
Oh,

1371
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,290
Thank you. Going to be in the midst
of the swamps of South Carolina.

1372
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:50,890
All of a sudden Harlem's going to
be lit up. What? Faggots. Okay.

1373
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:51,950
And Mark.

1374
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:56,710
Okay. Thank you for making me play
that pain. That's really cool.

1375
01:31:56,711 --> 01:32:01,690
Thank you for putting that on the
list. Really Neat. And that was a nice,

1376
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:05,460
definitely funnier than the
horrifying PSA we just saw. Yeah.

1377
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:09,320
And snakes and stuff.
Cut that together. Um,

1378
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:15,170
very, very well done to I
to cut him together. Um,

1379
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,050
all right. Genes. Um,

Absolutely bombarded your feeds.

1383
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,990
We did it with,
with good intentions in our hearts.

1384
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:37,420
And my 2017 tore no teeth.

1385
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,470
No entry will begin in January.

1386
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:45,190
Tickets go on sale this Friday.
The 21st.

1387
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:49,300
It's too bad you can't get sponsored by
the million dollar smile. Now. They won't.

1388
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,010
Maybe I could. Maybe I
had a shot. Um, and uh,

1389
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:57,490
I think that's, that's that. That's
it. Guys. Thank you for listening.

1390
01:32:57,491 --> 01:33:02,110
Thank you for watching us on Youtube and

1392
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,360
Cincinnati and Indianapolis
tits starting Sunday.

1393
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:11,100
Indianapolis had Sunday death.
That's why. That's right.

1394
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:17,200
Are you saying that with your
million dollar smile in Indianapolis?

1395
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,760
I'm fire the [inaudible].

1396
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,100
You didn't want it was supposed to do. I
was supposed to get robbed. You're fine.

1397
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,870
Arts can not in cake.
I won't say what tells the pain.

1398
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:33,250
These are from Mickey Esposito.
Everybody's panties in a
wad. When I come up here,

1399
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:36,070
she'll send them to her.
Okay. Now these here,

1400
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:40,090
they can't even spit on my ankle.
Did you see me in a book?

1401
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,660
What am I stupid?

1402
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:47,710
I have,
I have

1403
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:20,710
no idea. Who knows me? You
have no idea. Who knows me?

01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:22,320
Women are stupid.

1405
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,560
I have to

1406
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:27,923
by half

1407
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
and get what

1408
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,520
you want to go

1409
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:57,950
stupid.
