1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house.

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,540
We're rolling. And it's, it's
funny that you mentioned that, uh,

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,870
our very special guest today is the
delightful and I'm tremendously help you

4
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:34,870
still feel that way. Okay, go. I'm done by
four. And um, just, just as an absolutely.

5
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,990
Uh,
I would say tremendously tempting torso.

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,360
Dr Drew the body Penske
many years ago,

7
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:48,361
we got a peek behind the curtain of your
upper body and I gotta say I was the

8
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,390
long time ago. You mask that. You
deliberately do that, don't you?

9
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,950
On on TV,
like not anymore.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,490
Seen Him. And I was like, what?
Because I'd seen you for a while on TV.

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,990
Then I see you shirtless, uh, at a
pool and I'm like, what the fuck?

12
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,360
This guy must have had a towel
around my waist or something.

13
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,700
I just had my provider.
I mean,

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,910
was that something that you got into
a long time ago? Weightlifting? Yeah,

15
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,410
long time ago when I was 14. And you'd
say you did have almost never stopped.

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,620
It's weird, but now it's become
my, my, like my meditation now.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,410
Now I get weight lifting. I do. Well,

18
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:26,690
it's not even when it barely weight
lifting anymore, but it's, it's I lift.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,380
I listened to a podcast
and I just sit and I just,

20
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,180
I go into it like a meditative state.

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,690
And does your wife talk
during this podcast?

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,710
Just he mesmerized by his body.

23
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,870
And O eight Tom and I were
living in the rampart division.

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,320
We were engaged in a
one bedroom apartment,

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,860
but celebrity rehab was
the glue to our marriage.

26
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,010
When you say like we're huge fans,
they seen every episode.

27
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,000
We were obsessed with you.

28
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,790
I've listened to you since love
lions since the poor man days.

29
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,270
That's kind of weird.
CHARAC crazy boy.

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,390
I can we go back to his body?
I want to know.

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,910
So one thing that stood out the
most is that it really felt like a,

32
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,500
nobody would know that you
were this in shape dude,

33
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,130
which is kind of like
an interesting thing.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,280
A lot of people that are really into
fitness would like make an effort to go.

35
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:21,040
Like,

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm going to show everybody and I'm
going to show him because I've earned it.

37
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,080
Which then you go like, oh
yeah, that's a good point.

38
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,260
But I feel like none of the clothes you
wear on celebrity rehab or any need to

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,243
flaunt

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,190
it takes away from you.
Took credibility as you'll be aware.

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,340
Early on in my career as a physician,
I always thought that be kind of weird.

42
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,860
I remember I used to wear green
sometimes when people, where did you,

43
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:48,550
where did you have to shop for?
Like oversized shirts?

44
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,740
Is that what was that party?
No,

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,740
but I always had problem with
shoulder and arm fit. I've always had,

46
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,200
it's just how I'm constructed and if I
weight lift, this stuff gets big here.

47
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,410
Yeah. And I remember nurse coming to
goes, that's that doctor arms thought,

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,460
oh that's weird to cover that
all up. Okay, so you wait,

49
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:07,810
you're saying you were Green Greens,
you know, surgical grains and in your,

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,450
you looked, excuse me, ripped and I
didn't look like a rest. Everybody else.

51
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:14,410
So I was like, oh, that's weird. I
feel like after, I mean I'm probably,

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm probably the one that just outdid you,

53
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,530
but I think for the audience you're going
to have to post some some thirst trap.

54
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,120
I will lose about 10 pounds first.

55
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,980
My wife's of why we were in Mexico last
week and my wife posted a picture of the

56
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:30,550
two of us in a bay that she, she's
biotic, she has some insane jeans.

57
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,820
It's all just natural with her.
And uh, God bless her and uh,

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,250
or bless her heart as they say bless.
Uh,

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,550
and she took this picture. I'm like,
for God's sake, at least make me sit up.

60
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,384
I look like,
I'm like,

61
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,540
I look like I like ms
or als and this barrier.

62
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,340
It's a longstanding thing where it's
like you take a picture of me, I'm,

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,350
I'm reviewing first
right of refusal is nice

64
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,420
outfit and make sure he doesn't look
homeless or we're good. Yeah. Yeah.

65
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,490
You need that cause the man,

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,840
you don't think about that now you
got to make sure somebody loves you.

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,260
That's what we say when we say a sad guy
out there that's dressed all fucked up.

68
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:12,790
It's got, the wife doesn't love
it. You need love in your life.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,640
Somebody who's a

70
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,060
celebrity, celebrity doctor.
But yeah, it's weird.

71
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,370
I'll tell you the off the top of
a long story, but we were not,

72
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,370
we were talking about stern
before we wrap up show, which is,

73
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,440
which is these days equally as, as
an honor, I've sat in the real seat,

74
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,900
the Howard interview. See that's
reserved now for like Gwyneth Paltrow.

75
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,490
Yeah, no one gets in there
anymore. But when I was in there,

76
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,310
I will tell you it's very interesting
seat to sit in because he,

77
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,130
it's like he hypnotizes you
like you're in a truth serum.

78
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,570
He just got to go with them.

79
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,640
It just got to become abject honesty and
he just has this amazing way of just,

80
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:59,920
just getting into such gifted
and he follows his nose.

81
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:03,400
It's from all his strongest therapy and
stuff and all his, all the tributes him.

82
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,690
But I was a, this is the story
I wanted to tell you. I was, um,

83
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,020
my mother just started recently. It
should very advanced age. No, no.

84
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,560
Certain life should be celebrated when
if they live into your 90 [inaudible] you

85
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,540
had a good life. No is
fine, everything is fine,

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,990
but I was cleaning up her basement.
I found a stack of my old mad magazines,

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,180
1960 to 1972 I'll be a whole

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,860
cache of them and I thought, oh
my God, Howard loves these things.

89
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:27,790
I bet he loved this.

90
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:32,070
So I went and I wrapped it up in butcher
paper and I went and got bought a car.

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,920
They'd wrote a handwritten note and I
gave it to him and I was just totally

92
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,860
crest fallen when,
when the next day on the radio,

93
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,220
he was just going off about why would
somebody send anyone this piece of shit is

94
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,400
crashing garbage, the spider
web. He goes, he goes,

95
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm going to wipe my ass and send him.
I use toilet paper.

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,790
He went off for 20 minutes about it
and then it came up again. Today.

97
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,860
Went off again today because
apparently I brought up with Corolla.

98
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,490
I'm the Adam [inaudible] podcast and
a, and I told him I was, you know,

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,110
I was looking forward to him hearing that,

100
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,920
hearing that he liked this gift and I
was just, just, it stung pretty bad.

101
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,010
Of course it wouldn't be good radio if
it didn't sting right. It had to be real.

102
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,610
And uh, he, he would have been a
mentioned became a 20 minute bid.

103
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,350
That's his genius. Right, right.
Uh, but it stung. It still stung.

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,020
It's so Adam called Howard
told them that I was unhappy.

105
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,660
So that came up on the radio today.
So there you go

106
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,220
and you're going and Gary was talking
about the area that sent me a note.

107
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,420
Listen to this Gary,

108
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:33,800
something that tonight he got a text from
somebody demanding an apology claiming

109
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,960
to be me. And I was like, Hey,
no, no, no, no, no. A million
miles from that. I'm fine.

110
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,480
I understand you're going to hurt
though. If it didn't hurt, I also know,

111
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,450
yes I was, I was crestfallen. I
was stung. I was disappointed.

112
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,520
But then I thought to myself,
if it didn't sting,

113
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,630
this would not have been good radio. It
just has to be that kind of truth. You,

114
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,430
you really just worried him to be like, I
wouldn't have to go. I'm like, yes, yes,

115
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,010
I thought of it. And really
20 a moment. Then again,

116
00:06:56,011 --> 00:07:00,800
it wouldn't be Howard stern if he wouldn't
take something awesome and make it a

117
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,650
neurotic. Absolutely. And
gear. And Gary just goes,

118
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:06,200
I sent him an email or your gear
goes walking to why we're all good.

119
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,920
No good deed goes unpunished right here.
And I thought that's true.

120
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,000
In 30 years he's been dealing with
that every little thing. He's like,

121
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,970
I thought you'd like that stern boss.

122
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,080
They're always talking about,

123
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:24,230
that's the only place where
if you do something good,
it gets turned into. Whoops,

124
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,910
hang. Just text me. Wow. That's from Gary.
Pertaining to be demanding an apology.

125
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,410
That's crazy. It's crazy. That's crazy.
So the long story, it is crazy talk.

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,350
Um, the, the long story
is, uh, I, let's see,

127
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,770
I think it take it all the way back.
I was a third year medical,

128
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,880
fourth year medical student and I was
here in Pasadena living less than a block

129
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:52,481
from what was then k rock k rock back
in the day when you were 13 was this

130
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:57,590
little shit hole or like a dental office.
It was really a horrible,

131
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,240
like I wish we'd taken video and
stuff of it cause it was never will be

132
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:06,380
recreated this, this kind of
an environment and um, they're,

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,960
they're kind of working on a
documentary on it right now. So yeah.

134
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,180
Then they're interviewing everybody and
Ron of course.

135
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,390
And so, so it was, I would just,

136
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:20,690
I was really getting frustrated with
music and people started talking about the

137
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,390
station and I, oh, it's up the street.
How interesting. I started listening,

138
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,040
getting gibbering got
kind of excited about it.

139
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,430
People I knew that live nearby where
it's starting to go over there and new

140
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,570
people. And this guy calls me that it was
hanging out over there and he goes, hey,

141
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,010
they've got the show in
the middle of the night.

142
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,390
Apparently two guys were just taking calls
about relationships and their program

143
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,300
director told them they need to make
it a community service show. Right.

144
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,160
They needed to make,
cause they'd had be service hours.

145
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,090
So they gave them midnight Sunday night
to 3:00 AM Monday morning. Fantastic.

146
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,690
And uh, but then they're trying to
figure out how to make community service.

147
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:54,140
And my friend, I guess suggested me or
I'm in medical school, so maybe I could,

148
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,110
and they call me and they go, Hey,
I'll tell you what I want you,

149
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,820
I want you to do a segment called
ask a surgeon. You'll use big words.

150
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:04,620
It'll be really fun. What are you talking?
You know, so they finally, long story,

151
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,530
they got me in there. I brought
my textbooks at my gynecology tax,

152
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,260
my infectious disease textbooks.
I literally carried textbooks up.

153
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,050
They're really not having any
idea what I was getting into,

154
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,500
but I was freaked out.
And, uh, Lo and behold,

155
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,660
I heard these just amazing things coming.

156
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:22,230
Being presented to was the poor man and
the Swedish Eagle in the middle of the

157
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,300
night. And Scott Mason,
they'll still around. Yeah.

158
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:29,240
It's all in the series and I thought,
uh, I should, I should come back and,

159
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,540
and what stucked out,

160
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,960
what really stunned me was I was dealing
with a lot of aids patients that and

161
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,460
continued to the next five year thing,

162
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,670
tons of aids work and no one was
talking to young people about it.

163
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,820
We'd just been to the sexual
revolution where the adults,

164
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:45,450
the perpetrator that never contemplated
that adolescents would engage the

165
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,290
sexuality. Sure. Condoms were behind the
counter yet ask the pharmacist for them.

166
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,880
Now the term safe sex hadn't been coined
yet. People were not talking to adults,

167
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,890
young adults about this at all, about
what was going on. I was like, Dude,

168
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,300
so I was 24 I was like, Hey, I
know what 19 nine year olds are up.

169
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,060
18 nine year olds are up to we
gotta we gotta talk about this.

170
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,800
And no one had ever heard,
in fact,

171
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:08,880
we just were transitioning from
calling it grids to eight. We're, yeah,

172
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,890
we're calling it aids then,
but we weren't calling it,

173
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,350
we had an identified the
virus yet. Wow. We had,

174
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,930
we had just were getting
htlv three remember that?

175
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,931
So the GLB three did you suggest talking
about this on the air is that they came

176
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:25,260
to him and so I just came in there as to
do as little segment for Amenity Eagle

177
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,300
and I was like, oh my God, this is like,

178
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,640
I got to keep coming
back and said hang out.

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,090
So it's sort of hang out in the hall
and if something came up or if I was not

180
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,720
calling and I'd stay there
for like midnight to two or
something to hang around.

181
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,450
And finally I was started sitting at the
table with them and being a part of it.

182
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:43,470
And it was, he was, became a parent to
meet early that it was a two man thing,

183
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:43,980
like yeah,

184
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,510
sort of a parent child kind of conflict
thing or funny and strange and um,

185
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,140
and I just thought it was important and
I have for 10 years I was doing what I

186
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,710
thought was one night a week
community service. We really,

187
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,690
I thought it was just interesting.
It was like my social hour,

188
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,640
I beat her sick people.
We'd have guests in there.

189
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:03,450
And it was just interesting and fun that
my wife through there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,420
And uh, and after 10 years
of doing it one night a week,

191
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,840
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
For free, for free.

192
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,520
They put it on five nights a week.
Cause I remember what happened was,

193
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,400
I remember they, they, they got to re we,

194
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,340
they moved it to like 10 to one at
that point because they kept people.

195
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,350
It's still had a buzz around. It was late
cause it was sexual conduct. Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,860
Years. I mean you had finished your
internship and residency. Yeah.

197
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,020
Oh yeah. I was on practicing and
stuff. General General Medicine.

198
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:41,430
But I was also doing at that point,
let me think about this.

199
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,720
80,
late eighties,

200
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,860
I was doing running the medical
services in a psychiatric hospital.

201
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,740
So I was also doing,
I was doing an acute care inpatient thing.

202
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,180
I was doing medical services,

203
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:54,870
a psychiatric hospital and then an
outpatient medical deal. And um,

204
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,350
but it was a lot, I was way
work on two podcasts a week. No,

205
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,770
I was away. Workoholism like sick
workaholic or like bad, bad, bad.

206
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,970
Uh, and um, in 91,

207
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,370
so now it was literally,
I guess it was eight years now.

208
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,070
So it was eight years of five nights,
10 nights, one night a week. They,

209
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,430
they got a rating book on this show.
They don't do the weightings book.

210
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:21,280
Normally I had to ask for it or pay
for it. And I'll never forget this.

211
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:24,030
We got a 28 share.
What this is like,

212
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,310
is it a market where if you get
a 0.3 are doing great. And I,

213
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,730
I remember I called the program
director, I go, look, I'm,

214
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,150
I don't really know much about this,

215
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:37,120
but I think we're all participating in
something here. I didn't really know,

216
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,880
but 20 it seems like crazy to me.
He goes, I'll never forget this.

217
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,300
It was [inaudible] who was the
general manager, Kerrick. He goes,

218
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,980
cause if I had any balls,
I put this on five nights a week,

219
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,900
that's what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna put it on five minutes a week.

220
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,560
And I thought, oh cause
I, you know, I was,

221
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,990
I was working from five in the morning
to 10 at night at that point to where

222
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,610
it's very severe and um,

223
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,980
and Susan immediately then got
pregnant with triplets, triplets.

224
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,790
And so she goes, she goes, if
you're out five nights a week,

225
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,950
it's not community service anymore.
You got to get pay.

226
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,880
So she sent me in to see somebody loved
me, sent me and I hadn't handled it.

227
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,350
Could you please, can I please get pay? I
can't even, we're having kids and stuff.

228
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,570
And that's where it all got
started from that first offer.

229
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,710
And I don't imagine it's going to be
crazy, but like was it a decent offer?

230
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,640
$50 a show

231
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,500
cause is show 91. Yeah. And but,

232
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,330
but,

233
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,690
but they sort of promised like we'll have
a real contract at this goes how long

234
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,270
does he stay at?
$50 a shot.

235
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,760
It didn't seem that long cause then it
got syndicated and seven started to get

236
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,750
paid a little bit, a
little bit of that. Uh,

237
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,760
and then in 95,

238
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,760
these television producers turned up
and I was doing with Ricky Rachman then

239
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,190
and these and they were like, what's
the TV show like? Aye. Aye. Aye.

240
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,150
Interesting. It's all, it was all
kind of an exploration for me.

241
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,270
It's like I still thought I was doing
kind of a community service cause there

242
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:07,300
was nowhere for it to talk to kids about
this stuff and I thought there was just

243
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:10,570
so much encouragement of bad,
unhealthy behavior at that. Well,

244
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:14,790
we're just going to be here and be this
advocate for decent behavior. And uh,

245
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,370
there's a long story there too. But
eventually, uh, Ricky bowed out,

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,740
he couldn't make a deal with them
and they turned to me and they go,

247
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,950
who do you want to do with this? And
I was like, I have no idea. I'm fine.

248
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,870
Just leave me alone to practice
medicine if you really want it.

249
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,110
I can do this on Friday afternoon
and Saturday afternoon and that's it.

250
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,700
Otherwise leave me alone. And I went out
running one day and I'm, I was in a spot,

251
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,170
remember the spot where
it was when I thought guy,

252
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,690
but that guy that does Mr Birch
them in the morning could do this.

253
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,990
We had met once before and I thought,
I bet that guy can do it. So they,

254
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,040
how much this many details to get into
all of this. But they brought him out,

255
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,910
they tested us, everyone seemed to like
it put us in a makeup booth and they go,

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,600
you guys work out your relationship. We'll
start filming in an hour. And I will,

257
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,240
and we filmed for like nine hours, the
pilot for love line that ended up on MTV,

258
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:59,510
which by the way at that point was
a fox show. Long story there too.

259
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,880
She got canceled and
then picked up by MTV.

260
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,630
Well Auntie Annie was I think a decent
home phone. Perfect subject matter.

261
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:09,760
I think it might have failed
the Fox. That's absolutely
right. And, uh, but, uh, one,

262
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,850
one sort of memory I have about that first
day of filming the pilot is our stage

263
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:14,301
manager,

264
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,300
Tracy came up just who she became our
stage manager that we went did it for like

265
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,250
five years.
And um,

266
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,560
and just with your partner there was
with Adam live TV knows this MTV and he

267
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:28,520
hadn't even started the radio yet. We
were just doing, doing this podcast,

268
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,070
this a pilot for the TV show.

269
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,300
And we started doing the TV show
before he came over to radio. And um,

270
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,850
and Terry, she goes, how many years
you guys were working together?

271
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:41,030
We looked at each other with a, we
met this morning and I thought, oh,

272
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,670
that must mean something significant.
Yeah.

273
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,170
I even think that probably Miss Chemistry.

274
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,210
I always wondered this
like without like knowing,

275
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,740
you know so much about the show,

276
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:52,850
but you being a doctor and having to,
you know,

277
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,850
think about the advice you're giving out,

278
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,080
whether it's being like healthy and
you know, ethically, right. Yeah.

279
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,990
Did you ever have those
moments even though,

280
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:07,991
you know it's entertainment where somebody
asks something and Adam being comedic

281
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:11,450
gives advice to your like
you cannot say constantly,

282
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,150
but yeah, I don't know what I mean.

283
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,520
Like not just in like, hey, no that's bad.

284
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,500
But I mean like where you
get serious about it. We let,

285
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,550
it was not so much without him because
he really had a pretty good instinct on

286
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,680
things, but Ricky and
format more, more of that.

287
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,180
And I actually got an almost almost in
a file and fight with Jon Favreau over

288
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,440
this. He was in fabric fabric
director, the director,

289
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,710
he had just done a swingers. Right. It
wasn't that a big breakout. That's right.

290
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:45,010
And he was the guest on Loveline the TV
show and this guy calls in and he was

291
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:49,220
clearly schizophrenia and
dangerously psychotic,

292
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,000
like in danger of self harm or
harming other people. And uh,

293
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,360
complaining about in a paranoid way about
people who are trying to make him take

294
00:16:56,361 --> 00:17:00,320
his medication and fabric
goes, don't tell, don't let
anybody tell you what to do,

295
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:04,760
do not take those medicines. And I
went, Whoa, Whoa, you got to stop.

296
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:08,330
This is dangerous. This guy is actually
sick. Who Do you think you are? I'm like,

297
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,690
oh dude, don't go there when
you're talking to a sick person.

298
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,160
And we got into it and a yeah,
see that's the shit I want to see.

299
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,950
I want to watch that.
And then I had done in the next,

300
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,460
so we would film show up to show
after show we didn't know any better.

301
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:25,550
We should have six shows a day out
of my reach changing clothes and uh,

302
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,090
and the next year I
had a panic attack and,

303
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,220
and I had to leave the
stage cause I was like,

304
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:35,221
I didn't realize because I was still
upset from this fight with John and Adam

305
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:39,950
comes into my, my dress stream. He goes,
Hey, get the fuck get back out there.

306
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,230
If I have to spend one more
minute in this goddamn studio,

307
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,650
then I have to because of you. I'm going
to kick your ass, get gas in there.

308
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,870
He was like it. Ever since
then he's like, you see,

309
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:51,450
I cured your panic attacks anyway.
Oh my God.

310
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,340
So well that show love line there.

311
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:57,710
I mean the early the radio show taught
me everything about banks have anywhere

312
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,380
else to go. Yeah. And My,

313
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,290
my idea was the same in addition to being
willing to talk about aids and things

314
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,124
like that.

315
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,390
My naive notion that 24 when I
started doing was I wish I had,

316
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,010
if I had had something like this,

317
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,430
if I knew somebody with this fund of
knowledge that I know how have no have,

318
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,720
what would I want it to know?

319
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:20,250
And I retained that sort of naive posture
for about most of the way through the

320
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:22,800
run of that.
They've got a little more involved once,

321
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,270
but towards the end of the nineties
people were kind of more sophisticated.

322
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:30,510
I think they're getting information
from different sources and things.

323
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,860
And then the Internet just,
let's see out of it in entertainment,

324
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,000
because you live out here,

325
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:40,050
you're involved in entertainment and
you also know so much about, you know,

326
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,300
mental health is,
are,

327
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,890
are there more like actors and comics
and whatnot that are prone to mental

328
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,600
health issues. So, so,

329
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,290
so I told you I ran the
psychiatric medical service.

330
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,800
We'll then I transitioned over to running
their addiction services and I really,

331
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,450
a lot of my time was spent doing running
an addiction unit for 91 to 2011,

332
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:03,380
essentially. So 20 years
I ran a drug unit. Uh,

333
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:06,330
I used to hang out there for a long
time before I started running it because

334
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:07,830
then that's how I sort of
learned about it and stuff.

335
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:11,610
So it's about 25 years in
addiction medicine. And um,

336
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,090
slub your rehab came out of just somebody,

337
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,040
a really good producer named John
Irwin just came to me and said,

338
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,180
do you want to do this? I'm
like, wow, what a great way,

339
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,860
this would be really great to teach me
about this, but this cannot be done.

340
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,830
It's just not possible and you're,
you're, you're kidding yourself.

341
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,190
And he went to the hospitals and they've
looked him like, she gotta be nuts.

342
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,550
And we finally figured out,
I figured out a way you could do it,

343
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,160
which I took my team and I put
them on a residential facility.

344
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,950
I knew the director there. And he
wanted to do it. It's a long story,

345
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,620
but in the course of all this,

346
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,190
I'm a professor at sc
and the business school,

347
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,530
he's actually a behavioral
economist specialist.

348
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,960
And I put together a questionnaire.

349
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,630
He was interested in sort of the business
of a entertainment. And I, and I,

350
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,190
he and I had a conversation when
he's my neighbor and I said,

351
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:59,010
when you really shouldn't understand
the people that are the product,

352
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:02,550
the people that are the celebrities
and the mattress, and I said,

353
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:03,300
and then they're all sick.

354
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,940
I know they are because I've talked
to him every night and they have an

355
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,930
inordinate tendency, OTF trauma and
other things. And he goes, well,

356
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,030
let's test that because it
was not published anywhere.

357
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,760
So we sort of figured
out a way to do that.

358
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,110
We use something called the narcissistic
personality inventory and everybody

359
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:23,130
that came on love when filled
one out for two years. And so we,

360
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:27,610
so we collected 250 profiles
on people and it was, you know,

361
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,280
significant celebrities and reality,

362
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:31,560
a good mix of reality and
comedians and musicians and things.

363
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,560
And we analyzed it all have
malignant personally. No,

364
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,280
like that definitely did it take to that,

365
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,400
well the Melinda was the female reality
show group. They were laughing at them,

366
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,350
a liga personality ran Tom the
politicians. We wanted to do politicians.

367
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,600
That's our next frankly, because
we know it's gonna be the same. Uh,

368
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:53,590
comics had more trauma.
Musicians had more substance

369
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,910
addiction. Yeah. Uh, and,

370
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,080
and we were able to show that overall
somebody who pursued being a celebrity was

371
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:07,180
more likely to have narcissistic
personality traits and
narcissistic injury and

372
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:09,990
trauma and substance abuse. Do we
sort of, we didn't publish that data.

373
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:13,450
We just published the narcissist and
things and it became international press.

374
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,180
He became, it was, it was
spread all over the world.

375
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,500
We ended up writing a book about it
called the mirror effect. And so, yes,

376
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,990
the point is somebody that
look up this book now,

377
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,620
it's called the mirror of fan and
someone that, I mean it's very, you know,

378
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:29,350
we wrote it in such a way that
was pumped for general consumption

379
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,900
of this industry that we're
in participate in. Yeah.

380
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,910
As in large part. Like, you know, it, it
is like the, the thing we wanted to do,

381
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,680
we do it, we do it for a
living. We enjoy doing it. Yeah.

382
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,720
But part of me always goes like this
overall might not be the healthiest well

383
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,730
business to be in.

384
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,150
We were able to show that it was
a bid to solve those traumas,

385
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,110
connection between the the,
and so,

386
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,670
so it's a bid to solve. It's, it's,
it's supposed to fill our emptiness,

387
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,200
supposed to fill what's wrong.

388
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,890
And of course it works when you're
up on stage and stuff doesn't work.

389
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,900
And then the other thing that my dad
always brings us up to me about like his,

390
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,310
his, uh, there's also college.

391
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,770
No, no, no. But he'll, you know,
his, his outside observation.
Yeah. Especially when,

392
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:25,520
like, when, what was the, here's
something when, when, when, uh,

393
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,150
there's like a suicide or, you know,
overdose or something like that.

394
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:31,800
He'll be like, you know, he
always talks about how, you know,

395
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,900
it's such a struggle to make it in this
business. Yeah. But he's like, man,

396
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:36,950
the struggle once you

397
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,610
has to be, right. So we started looking
at all that. And you've got to remember,

398
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
you know some people,
you know,

399
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:47,280
people who become actors and say have
you have no discernible skill other than

400
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,540
kind of acting. And they
put it all on this. Yes,

401
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,810
you're willing to risk
it all to be celebrity.

402
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,220
It's like that's a pretty heavy bat and
they don't back it up with any other

403
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:59,280
training or any other disciplines or
work or they just, I'm going to be this.

404
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:03,290
And that's, that sounds really dumb when
you break it to you. Right, right. Well,

405
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,380
but stupid decision.

406
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,820
There's a road and a discipline procedure
and we were also able to show that

407
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:14,130
celebrities that had skills were less
narcissistic. So like a cello player,

408
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:16,750
pianist, craft, craft,

409
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,000
professional craft journalism
salad on the street. That's right.

410
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,340
And so we were able to show that. So,
and again, the reality shows the worst.

411
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,630
Hey Matt, it's me. That's it. Just me.
You can just be the way now, right?

412
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,900
No psychological training. You can
pick that up from realities. People.

413
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,890
Hey guys,
I was on road rules

414
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,960
and the guys didn't come
up with that whole group,

415
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:46,760
came on our on Loveline of the TV show.
You were a part of that. I wish but no,

416
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,250
uh sorry. Um, but,

417
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,670
but the other thing is it doesn't fix
the emptiness and it also exposes people

418
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:56,120
to shame because there's a disconnect
between the adulation that they're getting

419
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,770
from the outside and how
they feel on the inside.

420
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,770
And then they are fearful that people
are going to see that inside stuff.

421
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,890
And then if they are really famous,

422
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,070
they have a group around them that
insulates them from consequences.

423
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,690
This all the time. Yeah. And so, so the,

424
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,200
they don't get more addiction
than anybody else will.

425
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,820
They do a little bit more but per our
data, but they are not worse addicts.

426
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,271
It's just,

427
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:20,450
it spirals out further because there's
no one there to bring them back.

428
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,350
Is there any,

429
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,350
cause I was thinking how unnatural it is
to become a really big celebrity is you

430
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,910
think especially about it. Anything else?
Think about that. They have no other job.

431
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,540
How would you have a real real,
when you see super super celebrities,

432
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:40,380
like there's almost always these weird
personality traits that you see in

433
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,490
quirks. You know like the Michael
Jacksons where you're like Jesus Christ,

434
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:47,260
but you also can't wrap your
head around how famous is,

435
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,740
I wonder if there's any healthy
way to approach prepare yourself.

436
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,720
Not really prepared because most
people aren't going to have it,

437
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:58,130
but like how to deal with that level of
celebrity. It just seems like it's so,

438
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:03,131
most people that I've met that are semi
saying had some other career before

439
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,560
really making it later. It seems
to be a health and later. Yeah.

440
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,900
I'm even thinking of like
Tom Jones and Julio Iglesias,

441
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:14,540
so when you meet them they just go,
hey man,

442
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,000
I was just a soccer player and then all
of a sudden this weird thing happened to

443
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,170
me. It's like, but I'm still that.

444
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:21,090
Just that guy like playing soccer and
I like singing and I was good and look

445
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,920
there. There's bewildered as anybody
as opposed to, hey man, this is me.

446
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,350
This is what it's all about.
Which is a different thing.

447
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,350
We talk about too with like with comedy,
really the best comics in the world,

448
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,810
um, are like at least 40
and usually late forties.

449
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,060
And I think it's a much healthier
example for comics to see that. Like,

450
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,510
cause it doesn't happen usually at
22. You know that Eddie Murphy? Yeah.

451
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:50,960
But like basically comics work for a long,
long time.

452
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,130
I think that prepares a lot
of them for that exposure.

453
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,210
A more grounded, it's a discipline.
Your bed, you've been, we're a crap.

454
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,920
And you're also treated like
shit for so many. Actually.

455
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,610
It's quite hard to get an ego from comedy.
It's very humbling.

456
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,370
But you're working on that new hour,
you're gonna eat shit after five minutes.

457
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,840
So it's this constant thing of,
of suffering really built into standup,

458
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,230
which is great.
Which is like,

459
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,320
you find it's more like blue collar
and then amongst entertainment,

460
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,880
but it's also the new rockstar in a
weird way for five years or so. Yeah.

461
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:31,040
It leads been like,
I'm very interesting.

462
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,350
I'll even though the millennials
are screwing that up,

463
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,230
I'd like to talk to you about that too.
Do you think our president is antisocial?

464
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,350
Uh, I think it's just straight
up. Narcissism isn't, well,

465
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:47,210
we have so many people we'd like
you to analyze, but I, you know,

466
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,290
it's the politics to me and,

467
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,120
and even just questions about what
are the right and wrong ways for it to

468
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:57,510
function stuff to me is so fantastically
complex. I just go, I, I don't,

469
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,960
I don't know. It's humoristic to think
I would know the right thing to do.

470
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,750
I started worrying about Trump
and I started thinking, okay,

471
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,510
this is probably where, well, where
else would we seen guys like this? Okay.

472
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:08,490
We'll Andrew Jackson for sure.
Very much.

473
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:12,360
It's a duck at Andrew Jackson was Yosemite
Sam. I mean, he was, oh, you're ready?

474
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:16,110
Think about him. He was nuts.
Yeah. I mean, it worked out okay.

475
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:16,731
And that's a good for it.

476
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:19,570
Some of the Indians and the
southern area of the United States,

477
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,670
but it worked for the country when we're
done. Okay. Uh, and I thought, oh my God,

478
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:28,620
Teddy Roosevelt was a malignant
narcissist. They and bipolars hell and,

479
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,700
Oh man,
he never took a meeting sitting down.

480
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:34,080
And you have to follow them through the
park or he marched through a park and

481
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:38,120
climb hills and stuff and everything was
outdoors and moving and shit and blah,

482
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,860
blah, blah. And I thought, well,
that he's my favorite president.

483
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:44,460
I so I don't know the narcissist bipolar
is good, bad. I have hell, I don't know.

484
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,620
That's scary. I, um, I, I didn't
consider this as a kid, you know,

485
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:53,910
as a kid, presidents are just kind of
like God's. Yeah. As I became an adult,

486
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,070
I remember one time this conversation
about presidents and personalities came up

487
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,490
and somebody said something
along the lines of,

488
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,520
can you imagine the ego
you would need just to run?

489
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,600
Yeah. Just to say, I wish to that, you
know, why did I do that? I promise.

490
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,090
I remember thinking about that and that
having that, having one of those like,

491
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,330
Aha affects where I was like,
Jesus, I've never considered that.

492
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:22,740
That they all have to be
pretty. Absolutely. Maybe Jimmy,

493
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,770
Jimmy Carter not, and he
didn't work. And it works good.

494
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,510
It didn't work so well in the office.
It's a greatest,

495
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:28,560
really think you're the shit.

496
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,260
And I have a weird preoccupation with
reading presidential biographies because I

497
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,850
just one day at a
similar kind of epiphany,

498
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:39,870
I was looking at the Pentagon had a
guy, the pennies, not just a profile.

499
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:43,590
It's a person. Yeah. And I know it's
something about how people work right now.

500
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,870
What happened to that guy?
His childhood, I need to know.

501
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,190
So I started reading and dark red like
20 Clip Lincoln biographies and I'm

502
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:54,230
reading grants biography right now, but
Chernow's new thing. So good. So, so,

503
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,250
oh my God,
what's that?

504
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:59,910
Lincoln severely depressive and well
does an interesting wrinkle in that. Yes,

505
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:04,830
he was, uh, he was sorta bipolar
maybe too, but, but he, uh,

506
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,590
really an interesting wrinkle if finally
started making sense to me, cause I,

507
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,730
yeah, all kind of fit together in my
head the way I know how people are.

508
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,110
I keep jumping out of you.

509
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,430
So, uh, a guy who wrote, uh, wrote a
book called the Lincoln marriage, uh,

510
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,190
discovered a whole trove of,

511
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,080
of letter correspondences between Abraham
Lincoln and a doctor in Springfield.

512
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,110
We started seeing before he married
Mary Todd and he found all these letters

513
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:36,030
were Lincoln was
convinced he had syphilis.

514
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,420
I think that's why he broke off
the first engage with Mary Todd.

515
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:42,070
He saw a prostitute,
became convinced there's all this syrup,

516
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,930
but he went by the river and is all this.

517
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,590
That's where the prostitutes hung out
and uh, became convinced he had syphilis,

518
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,910
dropped the marriage with Mary Todd.
This doctrine letters, reassured him,

519
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:55,710
take this mercury, you'll be fine. You
can go ahead and give it Mary Mercury's,

520
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,630
how they treat syphilis back.
They treated a lot of things well and,

521
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,420
and there's all this correspondence
going all the way into the White House.

522
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:04,690
He remains on the mercury most of
the way through his presidency.

523
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,070
Do you know what the main side effect
of Mercury is? Depression. Depression.

524
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,940
And I thought, oh, that's why he
had severe vegetative depression.

525
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,700
There's a story of him pulling a willy,

526
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:19,390
I think it was willy or tad
down the street in a wagon
down Pennsylvania Avenue.

527
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,610
And they said he,
they found him at the,

528
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:26,611
at the Capitol building still dragging
the wagon upside down with tad like a

529
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,873
mile up the street

530
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,950
and he was just going these
vegetative depression by the way,

531
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,530
that I feel like severely suicidal
at one point too. They, they uh,

532
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,970
what's acoustic? I used to sleep in
the same bed with a, I forget his name.

533
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,390
He had to go, Wah had put on
watch with him. But I'm sorry.

534
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,780
Another thing that I think you know,

535
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,600
I've always heard about and obviously
you get informed with these things,

536
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,160
you know,
little by little and more and more,

537
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,340
but especially since podcasts and
you start to hear from fans and P is,

538
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,510
I can't get over how at
least it appears to be,

539
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:05,890
how many people suffer from
depression? Oh, it's 50% of stuff.

540
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:09,220
Some sort of diagnosable. Hi, very common,

541
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,670
at least at a lifetime will
have a depressive. I had
depression, I had severe.

542
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,370
I kind of probably have
a tendency towards it.

543
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,450
I had panic and anxiety disorder and
all that bullshit and college. Terrible.

544
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,150
I'm okay. Yeah. Cause you can
go on despite these things.

545
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,680
They're treatable and they're part
of life. The thing is you got to,

546
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,070
I'm fearing now finally, and I was
a real advocate for this forever,

547
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:35,320
but now I'm thinking
we've over medicalized it.

548
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,760
We've overdone it now we're where you're
not allowed to solve these problems

549
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:44,761
through living and ordinary misery is no
longer an acceptable component of life.

550
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,970
Ordinary smile all the time.
Right. I should be happy.

551
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,220
Sigmund Freud when he arrived on
this continent was asked a question,

552
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:53,330
doctor [inaudible], what do you expect
to accomplish here in United States?

553
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:53,980
I said,
well,

554
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,370
I hope to be able to finally distinguish
between true mental illness and

555
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:01,110
ordinary misery. Then that's a great
quote because where's your misery?

556
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,640
Part of live are living.
Yeah, and we just,

557
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:07,860
we just don't tolerate that and you should
see real somber and sad. There's loss,

558
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,530
there's misery, there's anxiety. This
shit that stress. Life is stressful.

559
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:14,810
It is part of living. But I mean I, I
meant to say like when I brought it,

560
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,660
just that like the, I guess the amount
of the frequency with which it occurs,

561
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:23,530
the, the a number of people that
suffer from it, from podcasts,

562
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:26,670
I swear I see so many messages
that say like, you know,

563
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,420
I suffer from depression but like I,

564
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,810
I find some relief in listening to
podcast people. Right. All that,

565
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,530
that's great. That's it. I'd rather they
do that to take her medication. Yeah.

566
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,130
If you could do with that, that's, that's
overcoming ordinary that that's being,

567
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,910
you know, dis depressive. That's not a
major depressive episode. You know, and,

568
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,540
and again, people I think are not schooled
on the fact that they should expect,

569
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,250
feels down some,
exactly.

570
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:54,390
The life is suffering a lot and there's,
shit sounds the Hungarian,

571
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,560
but I do feel like eastern European
thing too, it's like we suffer,

572
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:05,490
we suffer, they, they take,
they take great pride.

573
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,040
I should look up Hungarian insults.
Oh creek cause of life.

574
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,121
We are,

575
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:17,121
we'll never eat and death is upon us as
their regular party and we love and we

576
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,620
make porn that is there. That's,

577
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,580
that's their main export. That's the
Paris support check, check, check.

578
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,930
Girls will come over all Hungarian honeys.
Um,

579
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,080
so we had this kind of
game we want to play. Okay.

580
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,940
So we have some classic,
we play a lot of,

581
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:46,410
usually we have a lot of quick,
we'll just play it at the top.

582
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,840
We play video, audio clips from all
over the Internet. People submit,

583
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,810
send in like you know,
watch. It's like just some,

584
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,710
some content to basically address.
Um,

585
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,200
well we were hoping that you would maybe
take a swing at is do you think the

586
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,740
person involved in the clip is a,

587
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,600
is taking drugs? Is it one a
youtube? No, it's not. Okay.

588
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,610
Or perhaps mentally ill. Perhaps both.
What do I think is going on here?

589
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,140
Why do I thinks going on here segment

590
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,850
before you have sex

591
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,580
that's going to be horny
for two or three hours.

592
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:34,080
Like you never been in your life.
Any of access to marijuana

593
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,090
too good.
We'd listen to me.

594
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,500
True. We'd alone can get you
really hornier than normal,
but it's been on drill.

595
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,110
Take about 10,
12,

596
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:51,690
Bynum girl before you want to have your
sexual fun with your partner or whatever

597
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:53,370
you do or masturbate.
All right,

598
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,110
so what do you think?
So I'm just looking at the environment.

599
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:04,050
They're out here. He's got his jacket
living in Versailles. So there's,

600
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,050
there's, there's like he's, and he's
sitting in an old, uh, sort of, uh,

601
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,990
angry grandpa recliner and he looks
like a young version of agriculture.

602
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,880
Angry grandpa.
They're younger version.

603
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,160
He has some Cop d and if you see
if you, you could see his, uh,

604
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,340
the upper chest. He was using
his accessory muscles to breathe,

605
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:28,870
which means it's got some product, lung
disease. Um, when he takes this balloon,

606
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:32,380
which I imagine is nitric oxide,
I feel like you have Steven Seagal,

607
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:36,550
a pill and it just look at it and
break it down. He does his pupils blow.

608
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,590
If you'd look at dilated pupils,
dilate, which night just can do that.

609
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,000
And he's also got stair,

610
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:45,250
which means you see the white
above the IRS come back every week.

611
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,190
So this is all when you see the
white above. But you know this, this,

612
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,370
when you see white above that's
drugs or hyperthyroidism.

613
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,210
It's about the only two things.

614
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:57,000
We'll do that with math
being them probable cause.

615
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:02,001
So this is now I'm putting and nitrous
in the same dude with the tobacco problem

616
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,510
because he's got emphysema. How does
10 to 12 Benadryl affects somebody?

617
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:10,470
Is that a good idea that
makes you agitated? That
actually goes the other way?

618
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,980
It could. It could delay ejaculation,
which is what he's talking about. Yeah.

619
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,260
I don't think he really understands his,
what he's talking about,

620
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,270
but that's what he's talking about.
You recommend somebody,

621
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,450
I would not recommend it because you
get something called anti-cholinergic

622
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:25,860
delirium from that where you
really can get very like delirious.

623
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,730
You get really well.

624
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,150
Some of the weirdest psychosis
I've seen a bit cynical and Miller

625
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,450
anti-cholinergic delirium
from drug overdoses really?
I mean they just get like,

626
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,690
they just get white and that could
be from Benadryl. I take a nap,

627
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,320
anticholinergic side effect dependent.
It's,

628
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,150
it's what anti-histamines
do in high doses.

629
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,260
The culinary check system gets plugged
in, right? So it's anticholinergic and,

630
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:52,080
and it's, it's a really
serious side effect. I mean,

631
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:56,940
you can get sick so you're get it. We
would never went to label anyone a legend.

632
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,220
I don't know this guy,
I don't know nothing about him,

633
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:01,600
but he put this video up and
I'm just analyzing when I seen,

634
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,290
I'm just guessing opinion. There's a
probability that maybe drugs are involved.

635
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,910
Yeah. There's a reason
why 10 to 12 Benadryl,

636
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:15,810
it'll make you agitated. Yeah. Which
I imagine too, which helps you.

637
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,340
Well that's what you want me to
finally have an excuse. And so

638
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,700
and, and so, uh, you know,
people think because too bad,
it just makes me more tired.

639
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,990
Maybe three it makes him for,

640
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,450
and then you got about four and
you're getting into trouble. I get,

641
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,030
I get exploding head from a two.

642
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,140
What's the 50 milligrams panics?
Floating head syndrome.

643
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,690
You've heard exploding head
exploding head is, you're, you're in,

644
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,540
you're asleep and all of a sudden
you get like this exploding sounded,

645
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,450
it wakes you up. Like somebody knocked
you on that really so weird. His thing.

646
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:49,110
Yeah. It's going to explode again. I
totally, by the way, not to be killing me.

647
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,760
Sorry. But I really thought you were
talking about your deck when you said

648
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,690
that an hour later when you fill it,
just kicking and smoke your weed, honey.

649
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,460
Wheat is the least of my concerns was like

650
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,390
millions and time. What is the,
we like billions of times better

651
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,860
from a professional standpoint. What
is the deal with weed? Like the deal?

652
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,260
Here's the thing. I mean like,
you know, we, we grew up in
this era of like, I mean,

653
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:26,280
when we were kids it was like, you know,
you better watch out the dare program.

654
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:29,580
It's still schedule one. People go to
prison. Schedule One was a bizarre,

655
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,600
it's bizarre. That's bizarre. You Go,
you know, like I'm saying like in the,

656
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:38,440
in recent years you had this whole
medical, yeah. You know, movement.

657
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,350
Unfortunately a sham, I'd rather just be
legalized. And then now recreational has,

658
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,020
has been evolved coming. Uh, so you,
so there's no medical value. Uh, no.

659
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:50,220
There's some, there's are some, but,
but that whole sham, yeah. Yeah.

660
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,760
Everybody's gotta have lights. I
never, eight years of my career,

661
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,930
I had never treated a single patient
without a marijuana prescription. So No.

662
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,850
You know, when you go in there
you and ask if you have addiction,

663
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,190
but treated for addiction before they
just, here's your marijuana prescription.

664
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,720
And so that's bad medicine. I just,
I just care that it's bad medicine.

665
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,840
I don't care that this medical marijuana,
it has some utility for some people.

666
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,870
I've recommended it for people. I just
recommended it last week for someone.

667
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,100
I'd much rather see somebody on
pot than, than opiates. Sure. Yeah.

668
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,210
And I think our laws are insane.
You know,

669
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,450
alcohol and tobacco are
good, right? Really good.

670
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,810
LSD shouldn't ever be touched
by human hands. Like what? Yeah,

671
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,500
it clearly has clinical
utility. I mean, end of life.

672
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,610
LSD may be very youthful and
cannabis is just cannabis. I mean,

673
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,350
why is that one day there'll be,

674
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,860
there will be problems and Colorado is
sort of founding and finding its way

675
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:46,690
through that. Um, but in terms of
also just significant problems,

676
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:49,390
adolescents care their hands,
people getting stroked,

677
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:53,410
getting addicted here and there. People
having an untoward side effects from it,

678
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,550
from, not very common, but
I've treated a lot of it a lot.

679
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,790
It's very difficult to treat. Is it
more, is it a psychological addiction?

680
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,760
Addiction is either you can stop
or here's what addiction is.

681
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:07,600
It's a biological disorder of the brain
where you cannot stop, you can't stop,

682
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,420
you're addicted, you can stop, you
have an addict, you're an addict.

683
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,650
If you can stop,

684
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:15,420
you're either not an addict or
earlier in your disease process we,

685
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:17,770
you still have control.
Please get control over it.

686
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,730
Don't let it get out of
control. Oh, okay. So you like,

687
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,410
you can also spot somebody in,
in,

688
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,790
during going down that path because
addiction is a spectrum disorder from,

689
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:32,500
you know, predisposed to
incipient, mild, moderate, severe
and then, and stage. Yeah,

690
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,370
cause it's interesting like with,

691
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,730
I mean I think we see it most probably
most people are familiar with like

692
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,730
alcoholism, alcohol. I think it's a little
clearer. Alcohol has the unfortunate,

693
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,440
the other category of the
binge intermittent alcoholic,

694
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:48,510
which is kind of a weird category that
Bert,

695
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,270
I'm not sure it's even a written anymore,
but he's,

696
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:55,900
he had sober October and all went well.
Yeah. I was competing with them know,

697
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,930
and he was very concerned that the
plane rides would be difficult.

698
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,650
But you know what, he, I knew he didn't
care cause he's, he and I talked about it.

699
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,370
He's in that more earlier stages of it.
He's not out of control.

700
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,910
I didn't say it earlier and it's
an early stage. I said earlier,

701
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,830
she still has some controlling. This is
what you should nip it in the bud though.

702
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,480
Yeah. You gotta be careful. Yeah. Why
did they consider alcoholism a disease?

703
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,300
Well, yeah. So,

704
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,680
so what is the disease you need to
define disease first before, you know,

705
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:30,440
I'll check the camera for you here.
So you,

706
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,440
you have to define disease
and then decide, oh, this,

707
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:39,330
this particular condition or disorder meet
criteria for disease. So have addicts.

708
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,170
It's cancer.
It's when the cells go nutty and Joe's,

709
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,590
so it's an abnormal physiology.
Cells go nuts.

710
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,770
I had no biophysiology but you
can't will yourself out of cancer,

711
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:53,430
but you can't go home early in the
stages, but later on you can't. Uh,

712
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,860
but keep going. So He'd say it's
abnormal physiology words, Everwell,

713
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,050
physiology come from, we're going to
reason our way through genetics. Genetics.

714
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,010
Is it strictly genetics,

715
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,410
genetics and environment interact to
give you an abnormal set of cell biology?

716
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:10,450
Right, right. Okay. And that cell by, how
do I know that cell biology is going on?

717
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,560
The abnormal biology,
the pathophysiology.

718
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:15,390
How do I know that happened out of I'm
a comedian combined. You can reason.

719
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,010
There's signs and symptoms.

720
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,410
There was signs and symptoms of
somebody like me comes in and goes,

721
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,090
those signs and symptoms
mean pathophysiology here
mean let's look at his jeans.

722
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:27,650
Let's look at his environment,
see how that occurred.

723
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,860
What are those signs and symptoms do
over time and breakdown or they grow,

724
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:37,310
they progress or their resolve or
they become product. They have,

725
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,260
they have a what's
called a natural history.

726
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,730
And then what does somebody like me try
to do it? Natural history. Well you,

727
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,480
you try to alter it. We tried to alter,
we tried to treat it, we do treatment.

728
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,250
So disease is a complex relationship
between the substrate and the environment

729
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,000
that results in an abnormal state of
physiology reflected in signs and symptoms

730
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:57,410
that follow a predictable pattern.

731
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,460
We call it natural history with a
predictable response to treatment. Well,

732
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:03,500
addiction fits that model perfectly.

733
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,740
I chat where people freak out is
where's the cancer? It's in your brain.

734
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:10,520
The cells are abnormally functioning in
your brain. The pathophysiology is there,

735
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,980
and we know a lot about it now and it's,

736
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:16,250
some of it's chronic so it doesn't
get better. And so it's always,

737
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:20,390
they're loaded up, ready to go if you
re expose yourself to the chemical.

738
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,690
And so it, and it goes. And
once you have real addiction,

739
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:26,600
I mean bonafide addiction,
volition has nothing to do with,

740
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:30,240
you can't choose anything
malicious, could be sideline,

741
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,500
not treatable.
At a certain point it's treatable,

742
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:37,100
but you have to get somebody in a place
where they can't use their volition,

743
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,160
where they're there, where they
start to understand that any thought,

744
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,560
any impulse and he,

745
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,800
any what we call stinking thinking
and he desire I have is my disease.

746
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,360
Cause it might the,
all the,

747
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,170
all the wonderful functions we have
rational prefrontal and all that stuff,

748
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,400
all those under the influence of distorted
motivation which is as opposed to

749
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:59,540
survive and thrive and
protect your family, it's use.

750
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,530
That becomes your sole motivation.
And that's a broken state of brain.

751
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,960
But can I get back back to,
we were talking about Bert,

752
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,030
I don't want to talk about,
let's talk about,

753
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,550
let's talk about bread but I don't want
to like you know, a bash them bash burst.

754
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,590
But my question about
someone like him is like,

755
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,860
isn't there like people will use him as
an example who like he's a late night

756
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:25,190
guy, he likes to have fun. He,
you know, he, he can party,

757
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:28,920
drink a budge but then he could
also, yes, yes. He does not have a,

758
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,400
what we would call a high biological
genetic burden. Right. Okay.

759
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:35,450
There are some people they
start and Kaboom, you go, I'm,

760
00:44:35,451 --> 00:44:39,420
I'm reading this book on grant. Grant
had real deal alcoholism. He was like,

761
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:42,360
Andy Dick, I mean real
deal. When he would drink,

762
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,630
he would just go all the way to the mat
every time, every time. And he could not,

763
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,150
he couldn't do anything about it.
There are grades to this,

764
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:51,060
there are different biologies to it and
there's grades to, it has, it has it,

765
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:51,960
but he could be,
I mean from,

766
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,880
so that you can all end up in the
same place as the bad part. Birkin go.

767
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:58,330
I'm saying Burka go south, but he
could also be fine, right? Yeah, yeah.

768
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,410
He can live his whole life like this.
Does he go,

769
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,180
he can stay at this level for his
whole life. He could just, sure.

770
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,850
It doesn't have to progress particularly
takes periods of abstinence and stuff

771
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,130
like I was doing and he felt good
during that. Abstinence. Great.

772
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,450
And it was reinforcing to him so he
might have more periods like that. Yeah.

773
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,770
He felt great. It felt great.
It was, I mean, I think it
was healthy for everybody,

774
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:17,880
but even Joe Rogan was talking about
how he felt better when not smoking pot,

775
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,320
which is like, yes, dude. Right.

776
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,450
You can't take them no mind altering or
brain affected substance every day and

777
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:28,320
not have it affect something.
Plus we thought we did a
bunch of hot yoga classes,

778
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,950
so that also made us feel good.
Good. You know, we did 15 in a month.

779
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,700
Good at 90 minute classes. Yeah. Um, yeah.

780
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:37,440
So did you go on Joe's a think tank?

781
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,480
It's sensory deprivation and sensory
deprivation, but, but I mean like it was,

782
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:47,160
it was a fun, it was, I think, uh,
exercises and discipline are just healthy.

783
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:51,540
So like, even if you're not somebody that
goes, like, let's say you don't, like,

784
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:56,090
it wasn't hard for me to not drink for
a month, but it's still an exercise in,

785
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,280
in discipline.
So I,

786
00:45:57,281 --> 00:46:01,260
I enjoy challenges and I like doing it is,

787
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:06,261
but I push back a little bit against
thinking about people or consume excess

788
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,330
alcohol is not being disciplined because
some of the most disciplined people I

789
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:13,260
know can still have a problem
over here with the alcohol. Again,

790
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,220
thinking of grant then grant stuff.
Sure. Super disciplined. But man,

791
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:20,540
if you got exposed, yeah, watch
out. Yeah. So and he would,

792
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,690
and he would spend long periods of time.

793
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,110
He was committed to the
essentially early Aa,

794
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,410
which were the temperance movements.

795
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,850
He actually signed temperates agreements
and stuff cause he knew he knew what

796
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,520
he's dealing with. Yeah. And
it's funny when people have
the real deal, alcoholism.

797
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,460
Yeah. They know. They know. They
know exactly what's going on. Yeah.

798
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,410
We think is going on here.

799
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,990
Hi Melanie. And I'm Scottio with
ecstatic hearts. Tantra. Oh,

800
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,380
I was just wanting to share that. There
are many ways to, or NASA, oh Geez.

801
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,990
You don't actually have to be having sex.

802
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,470
You can orgasm just from hugging.

803
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,100
Ah,
ah,

804
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,460
AH,

805
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,770
drugs, delusional, delusional,
mental illness. Well let's,

806
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,000
let's go three data.
We analyze the people again,

807
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,120
here's the day he was
not having an Oregon.

808
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:14,200
He was pretending she might've
been having an orgasm.

809
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,360
I don't know how she got there.

810
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:19,590
He might have been holding a vibrator
or something. Everybody knows. Um,

811
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,590
but first of all, we need to teach her
both how to look into a camera. Yeah.

812
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,210
That's a very disconcerting with,

813
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,070
I'm looking off camera like that and
it's not like they're bringing everybody,

814
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:30,340
somebody they're way off camera.
And then in a like a convention

815
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,510
center, like this has been some sort
of tantric sex meeting, which is gross.

816
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,440
It's gross. Weird. Right? It's weird, but
he looks very happy that they're there.

817
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,130
Yeah. She looks full of Shit.
Basically full of shit stare.

818
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,910
Yes. Like I, to me,
it's just full of shit.

819
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,700
He's just happy to be there.
He's like, yes. I mean, yeah,
he just wants to get laid.

820
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,060
That's right.
If you find a path to get laid and it,

821
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,230
and like you hadn't been laid in a while.
This is taking that pat, you're a male,

822
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,010
are you kidding?

823
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,130
But that's really what's happening is
she's into it and then he's just using

824
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:07,670
this coming along. So she's
delusional, right about this horseshit.

825
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,780
Is it just to get attention? Is that, is
that what we're doing at the comm? Hugs,

826
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,350
I'm guessing was called come hug
by the way. I am guessing that,

827
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:24,410
again, it's some sort of
weird gathering. The thing,

828
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,420
maybe it's her friend that runs it and
she's just a good example of how her

829
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:30,340
friends or maybe she runs it.

830
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:35,370
Maybe she's trying to commercial and the
other thing is like you draw people in,

831
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,980
you get attention, people sign up and
then they're like, I keep hugging.

832
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:40,930
I'm not coming though what's going on?
And they're like,

833
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,300
then you feel like you're not doing it
right. You've got to pay for another,

834
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:45,070
another set,
another conference,

835
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,550
or you start through the perfect scam

836
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,550
or they start blaming yourself.
Pretend that you're coming.

837
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,260
Then you are part of the delusion,

838
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,410
such bullshit. I mean, look
at this fucking coming,

839
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,840
look at his face. He's cracking up
and he's like, really? He's just,

840
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,560
and you know like he's this,
his neck muscles contractions laughing.

841
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,380
That's total bullshit.
It's total bullshit.

842
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,650
We cannot three of us kind of standard.
If somebody else's happy,

843
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,900
you can't stand it.
I don't like it either.

844
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,690
I it bothers me when people can
get joyful about things like that.

845
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,160
I'd love to hear your thoughts on this
one. I can't wait. God's love the fuck.

846
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,450
Fuck. Oh, you're a hot black
guy and you want to fuck me.

847
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,930
If you want to move then you can move.

848
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,700
Fuck the fuck the lot man.
Free Food,

849
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:47,270
free rent and everything else, man. He
hasn't GL man. Oh boy. Hold on. Hold on.

850
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:51,940
Jail, homeless or rum or
thug. Want to come move in.

851
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,350
Frankenmuth you too man. Free Rent.
You can lease in a cake. Fuck me. Piss.

852
00:49:56,351 --> 00:50:00,250
Somebody beat me. Oh Man. I know you
seen me. My come over today. Try it out.

853
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:04,330
Try it out, man. I just get sad. I mean,

854
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,950
first of all, I go dark. The
circles are run at the eyes. Look,

855
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:10,270
well it was the biggest draw.

856
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,370
Slept in a month and then I just
smell math. I can smell that.

857
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,760
Yeah. Well the first time we
play is interesting. I said,

858
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:21,310
you know the funny thing about
this play this over and over again.

859
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,080
This is a regular clip,

860
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,500
not worried about your soul's down.
Forget is we're ruined.

861
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,500
I know, I see that he really, I'm
going to bring up my questionnaire

862
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,220
but this, I was like, you know,

863
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:42,270
just us some part of every man's brain
that has wanted to like express these

864
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,220
feelings like fuck me.

865
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:50,580
But I'm saying for someone to actually
pull out a camera and going to be this

866
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:55,190
disconnected, all of it. This was somebody
who was severely beaten as a child.

867
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,100
That's just all I see is just
abuse, abuse, abuse. Again,

868
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,360
to try to solve it or whatever. Whatever
our brain does, it makes us do that.

869
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,180
What's with the ball at his head?

870
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,930
It's very dark.
It's not his spot on analysis.

871
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:19,520
It made this sad for me now and yeah,

872
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,030
that's why I could never go to strip
clubs and things cause I like all these

873
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:27,590
women are
supposed to be empowering.

874
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,740
That's what they say is
you guys don't get it

875
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,000
pissed. Let me try it out. Fuck man.

876
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,600
I'm looking at the hardcore guys want to,
Julie and I wanting to live with it.

877
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:46,120
I'm a hot white trash. Go do your five
bucks. People just send this into.

878
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,870
So that's nice.
I'm so glad I'm talking to your fans.

879
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:56,280
Very nice.
Laughter.

880
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,720
At
least a varsity level.

881
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,610
You don't have to give me college.
What do they call it?

882
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:17,110
Fort with the big level football though.
Division One Asian one.

883
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,710
Don't give me a division one varsity
highschool bar. Ready for that.

884
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,510
There's so much to show you.

885
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,030
I'm so glad you're here because we clips.
We laugh.

886
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,130
I laugh.
I'm glad

887
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,820
I get to see this. Do you know what
the door shut? Yeah, it's dead.

888
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:46,580
It's deeply troubling. I
told, I told her this before,

889
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,560
every time I go,
I've met porn stars immediately.

890
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,060
Like I don't see them as sexual beings
like you, cause you, you make it.

891
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,260
What's going on? So I go, I
mean, I totally understand.

892
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,580
Did you see the sex rehab shirt?
We did.

893
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,500
So Jenny Ketchum,
penny flame

894
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,200
flame is now just graduated from
social work as an MSW at University of

895
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:15,770
Washington. Maybe getting
a phd. She's amazing.

896
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,000
She's getting married,
pregnant. She is phenomenal.

897
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,550
I ask a only if it's like,
like a public thing.

898
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:25,980
I would say I'm trying to say about

899
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,180
the patients. Yeah. About,

900
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,070
about her or if it's not known or public,

901
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:35,390
then I'm not, I can't tell
you if it's not, but like uh,

902
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:39,090
so was she traumatized we,
he's talking about,

903
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,490
or everyone's trauma came out of the show,

904
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,150
but for some reason people either
watch it or didn't get amplify.

905
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:49,470
There were specified enough. I mean like
Jeff Conway is trauma was so profound,

906
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:52,200
so unbelievable and ritualistic
and people are like,

907
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:53,160
I wonder what's wrong with Jeff?

908
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:57,600
It's like you didn't hear him talking
about he was dragged into a child porn

909
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:01,580
ring and he was beaten.
Yeah.

910
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,150
I feel like every one
of them I don't treat.

911
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,500
I always tell people if you have bad
enough addictions that you need to see me

912
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,920
as a hundred percent probability
of childhood trauma. Really? Yeah,

913
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,560
a hundred percent now I'm not saying
that all addiction has childhood trauma.

914
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,440
I'm saying if it's bad enough that
you need to come to somebody like me,

915
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,050
it's this childhood trauma. And it's
bad Jenny and horrible stuff. Well,

916
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:24,280
that's what I learned. Watching
celebrity rehab. I think that's what I,

917
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,540
right when I started getting a
therapy is there was that trend of,

918
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,730
I mean we discussed this on your podcast.

919
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,080
Person would go in and drew and be like,
how was your childhood? It was fine. Yeah.

920
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,170
Oh yeah. Except for the part that my dad
beat the shit out of me and my mom. No, I,

921
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:41,460
I'd have to go. I'd have to
go. I'd have to go. We'll,

922
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:45,510
do you have any physical abuse? No. I go,
I go. Did anybody ever discipline you?

923
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,950
Well, like anybody, I got
this and then I go. Okay, good
discipline. So they hit you?

924
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:53,430
Yes. Oh, of course. I needed it. I
everybody like anybody. I needed it. I go,

925
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,760
did anybody ever pick up an object and
hit you buy belts and did they use the

926
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,400
buckle end? You all? Of
course. The BUCHLA. Oh yeah.

927
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:04,110
It was one time it was a bad oh
yeah. And the hatchet. Oh yeah.

928
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:04,944
And the bow and arrow.

929
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,360
And then it just starts and they think
of that is normative and they needed it.

930
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,910
That's how they get it and
they internalize it like I
was serving at that which

931
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:13,080
is,

932
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,080
which is the child feels so powerless
that they flip it into an causing this.

933
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,420
I'm making this happen to me
because I need it cause I'm bad.

934
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,670
So Ron and daddy can't be bad now
because I need them to survive.

935
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:30,180
That's right and what happens is those
unresolved feelings of trauma turn into

936
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:32,340
not like you just said,
sometimes addiction,

937
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,510
sometimes they manifest what later in
life is something but can be treated. Yes.

938
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,390
Right, right. That's the
big highlight of this.

939
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:42,630
I thought you were to tell us something
specific. I just want people to feel,

940
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,000
I don't want people to feel
hopeless listening. Oh Shit,

941
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:49,380
I was hit and am I screwed.
My fundamentally,

942
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:50,011
the way I think about,

943
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:54,510
the simplest way I look at it is that
you need closeness of other humans to

944
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:56,940
develop the mechanism
for emotional regulation.

945
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,760
That emotions if you've been
traumatized or to trow prolonged,

946
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:03,390
too intensive to negative and the way
that is healed is in closeness with

947
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:06,210
another human. Unfortunately
when you've been traumatized,

948
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,910
you don't trust other humans anymore and
you exit the frame of closeness and you

949
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:14,610
never go back until somebody in therapy
finds their way back in with you and

950
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:18,330
that person that holds that frame
and just listens to you and racks.

951
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,370
How hard is it?

952
00:56:19,371 --> 00:56:23,160
Cause this is one of the things I think
maybe I don't know that a lot of like

953
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,740
the amateur audience watching
a show like that would,

954
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,800
would have difficulty processing is the
the level of distrust from some of the

955
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:37,990
people that you're treating. All of them.
I feel like though like aren't they?

956
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:41,710
Isn't it hard to break
down? Yes. Truth from this,

957
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,700
how it turns me into a
gigantic mind reader. It does.

958
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,820
I got to the point, I'm a little
out of practice with it right now,

959
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:49,654
but where I could,

960
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,840
I could just trust whatever came out
of my mouth without thinking about it.

961
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,950
You can trust whatever comes up. When I
could, when I was really skilled at this,

962
00:56:56,951 --> 00:57:00,130
I'm a little bit rusty right now,
but, but I, I would just, I would,

963
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,680
I would do what's called,
I would listen with my whole body.

964
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,810
I would not listen to what they're saying
cause I know what they're saying is

965
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,040
all bullshit. And I was just
listening to the whole body.

966
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:09,640
If I felt something or heard
something or smelled something,

967
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,390
I would immediately go, I immediately
go, hang on. I'm just, I'm not sure if,

968
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:14,590
does this have meaning to you?
I was smelling like,

969
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:18,040
Oh that's my dad was always making bacon
when he'd fucking throw grease on me

970
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,760
and burned me out there. Okay, well
I just happen to smell some bake.

971
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:25,710
I don't know why because people, it's so,

972
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,710
it's all compartmentalized and I'm
literally picking up on disavow,

973
00:57:30,711 --> 00:57:35,350
disconnected parts of the south that
are crying out for attention but,

974
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,570
or disconnect from that human consciously.

975
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,380
But it's there all the time creating
all kinds of commercial turmoil in that

976
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,490
person. And I sort of, they sort of,

977
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,940
they pick it up like that fried
thing of your unconscious reading.

978
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:51,830
Another person. Yes, yes. That's
what it is. But I, but I think,

979
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,560
but I think it's that sort of a,

980
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,770
it's not a evolved enough
way of thinking about it.

981
00:57:56,771 --> 00:58:01,210
I really feel like there's
so much information going
back and forth between two

982
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:04,150
bodies in proximity.
It's really not just the brain,

983
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,000
it's our entire central nervous system,
including our autonomic system.

984
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,360
And we just, we just can, we send
stuff back and forth to people.

985
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,790
And if you really listen, if you
learn to really train yourself, and I,

986
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,810
and I also trained myself to be able to
know when people were not telling me the

987
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:20,230
truth and I would just go, that's
very nice, but you're full of shit.

988
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,280
Stop it please. And I could just trust
it when that would come out of my mouth.

989
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,690
And, and most of the time,
most of the time they would
go, oh, how'd you know? Yeah.

990
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,810
And they'd go, I don't even
know what to bull shit anymore,

991
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,130
but I'm glad you helped me.
I need to know what I'm,

992
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:36,160
cause I still have worked with
some master manipulator. Oh my God.

993
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:39,370
And I had been manipulated and I've been
had and whatever, but, but you, but,

994
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,870
but I can, if I do feel
it, I can just go, Eh,

995
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,790
you want to work in the or not
shut up. Reminds me of, by the way,

996
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:49,360
this I mean to say the skill set
you're talking about is watching like

997
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:52,990
detectives in um,
not a lot different.

998
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,610
And then you see like we used to watch
a lot of the first 48, uh, and um,

999
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,830
there is certain detectives that that
was the hook of like that was you get

1000
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:06,250
excited about you.
Like she is amazing.

1001
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:12,340
She would like, there was this
one, yeah, Sergeant Mason,
I think in a, in Tennessee.

1002
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,690
I still remember her name and she would
go in and the guy be like, I didn't,

1003
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,980
I didn't do anything. I wasn't there.
And she had this ability to connect.

1004
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,870
Yeah. And five minutes later you just
see. Yeah. And then they would confess.

1005
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,290
It was amazing. Did you see behind
Hutter? Yes. I'll watch the whole thing.

1006
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:33,310
You got some of that stuff came out in
that too. Oh, it's fantastic idea. Yeah.

1007
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,530
Yeah. Fantastic. I remember even when he
met that first guy, he was like, well,

1008
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:39,980
how'd you feel about it? It didn't feel
right. Well there you go. Listen to this.

1009
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,850
You're were. We're perfect instruments.
We really are. And if you've been injured,

1010
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,730
that perfection gets
expressed in crazy ways.

1011
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:49,820
You like women that repeatedly
go for abusive guys.

1012
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:54,230
If you're attracted to the guy, definitely
that's going to be an abusive guy.

1013
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,800
If you have that path,
do you have that pattern?

1014
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,760
If you were abused as a child and you
have that power as adult and you will,

1015
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,490
you think that's a great guy?
Guaranteed that guy's gonna be,

1016
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:04,640
I know he looks nothing like an ax.
Nothing like the other ones. Still.

1017
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:07,700
That's going to be some guy
guarantee like I've been, you know,

1018
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:10,760
we've all have interactions with
like bad dudes. You feel it.

1019
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:14,600
You feel site like Predator dudes. You
know what I mean? Guys? You're like,

1020
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:18,740
this doesn't feel right right away. You
feel like sometimes you can, I don't know.

1021
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:21,170
It could be out in public. You can be
introduced to someone and you'd be like,

1022
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,120
I don't want anything to 3%.
Yeah, good times, Huh? Yeah.

1023
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,540
That's what I have to watch.
Videos.

1024
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,300
Oh, the women practice on the
egg. What did the men do? Okay,

1025
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,550
the Amanda first thing,

1026
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:39,010
the have to practicing that
we call sharpening the knife.

1027
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,480
Okay.
The whole key.

1028
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,280
So we caught a egg,

1029
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,420
the baby oil oil and you put the in and
now put up eat peanuts to warm up in the

1030
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:55,020
cold winter. You warm them
up, you get a hot power, okay?

1031
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,850
And you'll make it a one.
The what?

1032
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,900
The hand you put your hands and then
make sure order blood flow on your penis.

1033
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:06,100
Okay, now you'd get the penis out.
You pull the skin. A lot of people,

1034
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:07,170
they never succumb.

1035
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:12,410
The horse had skin to skin and you get
the oil in the hand and your hand going

1036
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:15,610
ids to rob, rob, rob, rob,

1037
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,870
especially on the Klan Penis,
50 time Ras,

1038
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:26,770
because you make them strong
and not sensitive to the time.

1039
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,520
Once a [inaudible] 50 times left side.

1040
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,680
Phil town from 50 times,

1041
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,870
50 times I three feet. Okay.
How often am I doing this?

1042
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:42,730
You have to do every day until you
can control every day time consuming.

1043
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,640
Extremely sharp knife. Okay. All right.

1044
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:51,250
You're done traveling at night.
There's the number one. Number two,

1045
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,960
you have to learn how to
contracting the prostate gland.

1046
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:57,811
When men,

1047
01:01:57,811 --> 01:02:02,620
it's accolation the pressure of the
circulation if from the prospect and

1048
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:04,180
contracting.
Okay.

1049
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:10,010
Exercising exercise one and four people
have positive land stolen up a problem.

1050
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,910
This one who solved the problem and now
you do it until you feel okay. Awesome.

1051
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:20,670
Oh really? Yes. Okay. I call orgasm
without ejaculation, right? Yeah.

1052
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:25,020
So you feel, so you see when
you do, when, when you get it,

1053
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,550
it's very quick to two times.
You can

1054
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,573
yep.

1055
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,460
When you squeeze it all
guests, I'm coming up. Oh good.

1056
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:38,390
So what's happening here with him?
He's a teacher. He's a tantric guy.

1057
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:42,920
A D two pieces, a lot of things
actually. What else? Well, he,

1058
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:46,270
he also teaches women, um, you know,

1059
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:51,200
to rub their nipples and um, and
I think it puts an egg, well,

1060
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,080
he size up your vagina,
muscles are loose,

1061
01:02:54,081 --> 01:02:59,081
then your door is open and all the
energy leaks out of your vagina.

1062
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,170
So you need reminds.
Is he a yoga guy?

1063
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:05,780
A tantric guy that's been around
for a minute. Like we, we, after we,

1064
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,470
this was the first thing we were exposed
to about him and then we found what's

1065
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:13,990
his at this, I can't figure
out what you guys think. He's
ty. Ty. Yeah. And then um,

1066
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,890
then he did like a female one in the
same interview and then somebody found a

1067
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,210
like a 25, 35 year old clip
of him and he's been doing,

1068
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,990
this is like your kidneys are Tega do
testicles. You got rubbed your back. Like,

1069
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,850
oh my God.
So wait,

1070
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:31,880
you said that's not right when you
said the orgasm is in the prostate,

1071
01:03:31,881 --> 01:03:35,330
prostate doesn't move. He did the, the
pelvic floor musculature contracts.

1072
01:03:35,331 --> 01:03:36,560
But that's not through your prostate.

1073
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:40,910
The seminal vesicles are what are holding
the semen, the prostate, just to gland.

1074
01:03:40,911 --> 01:03:44,400
That's sort of slowly producing fluid
and story at the seminal vascular. It's,

1075
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:48,050
it's not really any other activity. Mm
hmm. And what about sharpening the knife?

1076
01:03:48,051 --> 01:03:51,430
Is that an effective feel
about times? Rob, Rob, rob?

1077
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,650
I think the whole point of this
was about control. Yes. Yes.

1078
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:56,670
And that's why it sounds
her a tantric life. Yeah.

1079
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,300
But then like 300 times 300 strokes a day.

1080
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,660
All I kept thinking was 300
times two seconds, the chart,

1081
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:08,510
because it's about 600 seconds or so. Who
the fuck has time to do this every day?

1082
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:12,110
And I'm worried about that person's soul.
Again,

1083
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,930
I'm worried about the souls of all these
people that you're showing me because

1084
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,640
their priorities don't seem right.

1085
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,480
If that's what the practice by with doing
every day there's better mindfulness

1086
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:24,980
then sharpening the knife. So
I'm saying okay, not a priority.

1087
01:04:24,981 --> 01:04:26,520
Seen better mindful practices.

1088
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,940
There's a possibility that
this guy is a bit delusional.

1089
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:35,150
Although as a no, I don't think this
guy is mentally ill. I don't think.

1090
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:36,020
You don't think he has? No, no.

1091
01:04:36,021 --> 01:04:39,720
I just think he's a Weirdo facing
straight up here though. That's the thing.

1092
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:44,840
There's a thing as evil, bad weirdo
that they exist. Oh, I'll raise you one.

1093
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:48,350
Oh Jesus.
And when we got to Varsity,

1094
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,930
uh oh no.

1095
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,143
Oh,

1096
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:59,510
I just want to let you know there
is really the two my dex or release,

1097
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,840
yet they're on a shrimp
Scampi boat and uh,

1098
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,290
like they are like getting
turned into Lasagna. So, um,

1099
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:14,710
I need your help getting a
rescue boat over there and,

1100
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:20,470
and a day they really need your help
getting rescued. So could you, uh,

1101
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,540
please,
please say yes.

1102
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,420
What did she say? She's talking to talking
to Hillary. She's blogging to Hitler.

1103
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,420
He's asking for the fear.
She's asking him for a rescue boat.

1104
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,940
Two friends that were returned
to the Scampi. Gabby boat.

1105
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,760
They're trying to get into
the zone yet. Okay. So,

1106
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:42,600
but Hitler is the guy she's talking to
that she sings happy birthday to again,

1107
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,100
I always leader of the third one.

1108
01:05:44,101 --> 01:05:49,101
I always like to look at the environment
and I look at all that stuff,

1109
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,400
but she's a really big fan of
that. A one direction. Yeah.

1110
01:05:53,401 --> 01:05:57,240
Reminds me of people that
set up, you know, sort of
shrines and things to people.

1111
01:05:57,241 --> 01:05:59,580
They go and try to murder them. It
looks like that kind of thing. Yeah.

1112
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,220
And when you, if you close your eyes and
they'll look at a radio listener voice,

1113
01:06:02,221 --> 01:06:03,780
she sounds like she's about six years old,

1114
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,370
which is an interesting thing that happens
in severe trauma survivors is they've,

1115
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:13,160
their voice stops, talks about this
on a and the sex stuff. Second,

1116
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,740
maybe we should, uh, have
a new title for our cash

1117
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,710
and if, um, no laughing matter now if,

1118
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:27,420
and if she's not just sort of being
bullshitting, she's severely psychotic.

1119
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:33,960
When you close your eyes for a
second, close your eyes and that what

1120
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,250
he's wanted of you to hear, Hey Hitler.
So I pushed that. Hey Healer. No. Oh No.

1121
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:44,960
Hey Him. So severely psychotic.
Yeah, because of the eyes and no,

1122
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,360
I don't see it in their face. Right.
It's just what she's talking about. Oh,

1123
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,960
so disorganized and almost,

1124
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:53,520
it almost sounds delirious.
Like she's like, well,

1125
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:57,180
why don't we lighten things up a little
bit. Good. Yeah. Um, varsity, low

1126
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,550
old. Are Your thoughts on this?

1127
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:06,380
Not Somebody talking,
but just to see like what you find funny,

1128
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:10,820
what you don't find funny and steel
reaction. And then maybe you can,

1129
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:22,850
he's going to zoom right through
there. No, he's just sent me

1130
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:23,763
car.

1131
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,300
Oh No.

1132
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:39,450
Okay. Why? Except I know
what that injury is.

1133
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,293
That's bad.

1134
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:47,020
That kind of a correction really bad.
I mean it's funny,

1135
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,750
but it's not funny.
Could be dealt with in a few minutes.

1136
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:54,630
Thank you. Okay, so let us clue
you in on what the debate is.

1137
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:58,440
Crush injuries like that. Those are common
and they, they ungloved they'll, oh,

1138
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,930
it's just the worst.
Worst.

1139
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,490
Often the leg will just split
open and ungloved and Tara,

1140
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:08,160
the skin comes off entirely.
And then depending on how
bad the crushes, you know,

1141
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:10,950
whether or not their kidneys fail because
their muscles crushed and going into

1142
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:13,500
their blood system and how bad the
blood supply is cut off and how much

1143
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:16,010
orthopedic injury there is
there. Yeah. It's just those

1144
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:20,510
are catastrophes. People often amputees.
Yeah. Right. And that's really funny,

1145
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:23,960
right Tom? No, but let me be fair.
Let's be fair about something.

1146
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,480
So I've always had and
I've admitted to it.

1147
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:31,430
I think the way I deal with with
physical injuries to people should laugh.

1148
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,010
I laugh. Yeah, and I've,
and I've done it for 30

1149
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:41,480
well she thinks I'm psychotic. No, I
think it's a red flag too. I had a nurse,

1150
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,463
remember Sasha.

1151
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:46,880
Sasha would laugh in the
most horrible situation.

1152
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:48,080
She was all of a sudden started giggling.

1153
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,940
There's nothing she could
do about it and she was,

1154
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,710
she's a great nurse and
really compassionate,

1155
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,360
but she had this weird nervous thing when
when things got really rough and said

1156
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,040
terrible things start happening,
she break out like full laughter.

1157
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,870
I was like socially and find that clip.
So funny when people are like,

1158
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,930
he's a second path later,

1159
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,280
we see it in front of him because I've
watched the clip several times and we've

1160
01:09:13,281 --> 01:09:17,120
had other guests on and I can't laugh
because I have left, said how funny it is.

1161
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:21,320
What's called empathy.
It's funny if it were the three stooges,

1162
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,500
the whole,
the whole problem is,

1163
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:27,570
it's one thing that bothers me about
physical slapstick humor is you.

1164
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,620
You believe that that's just funny.
Or if somebody gets hit in the head.

1165
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:35,170
It's just funny, funny, mild
head injuries. Fuck people
up for six months. Yeah.

1166
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,480
Yeah. One of Moe's or just
the fingers in the eyes.

1167
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,670
Of course one of Mo's box
on the head would would be
six months of trouble and I,

1168
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:47,480
and it's, it is funny when it's
the three stooges, Laurel and hardy

1169
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,820
in this case.
What's funny also is that his reaction,

1170
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:56,600
I think also because it's foreign, like
you don't understand what he's saying.

1171
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:59,420
Yeah, you can. You can be, there's
some distance you can get from it.

1172
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:02,740
You get distance from it. It's a,
it's an almost comical reaction.

1173
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,200
So there was a quality of the reaction
that was like, oh my God, that's funny.

1174
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,360
And that was like, oh my
God, that was really a pin.

1175
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:12,770
A pending pending against the wall.
I remember when I worked,

1176
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:17,830
I worked a construction one summer in
high school and this guy had a sewn in a

1177
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:23,870
like morphine drip pack for
his neck and I was like worst.

1178
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:28,010
I go like, why do you have that? And he
started telling me like very seriously,

1179
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:32,920
he was on this site and they were removing
a bathtub from the third floor and it,

1180
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:36,500
it fell out from the, the, the
lift and it crushed his neck.

1181
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,100
I laughed so, so hard,
les. I love that. Well,

1182
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:42,170
he was just looking at me and then he got,

1183
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,710
he realized that he started telling me
all these other injuries stories and then

1184
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,590
he got to the point where he'd be like,
ah,

1185
01:10:47,591 --> 01:10:50,300
I just remember you're going to love this
one. So he would do it to entertain me.

1186
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,390
Like one time it was on the site
and I broke my arm doing this.

1187
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:57,080
And I've always found
that's how I process.

1188
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:01,040
How can we bring the guy around with you
all the time? I mean, it just, it just,

1189
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:05,100
I don't know why you should become an
orthopedist. He would never stop laughing.

1190
01:11:05,101 --> 01:11:08,150
I laugh all the time.
Wait, so why do we do that?

1191
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:11,350
Because I laugh at things that
are inappropriate as well. Well,

1192
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,010
you're now you're asking me
what's the nature of humor

1193
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,250
and laughter, which is a really
complicated question, but his,

1194
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:21,390
his reaction to that man hurting,
being harmed and possibly dying is,

1195
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:24,900
is laughter.
Um,

1196
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,960
and that is numbers that evil exists

1197
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,280
on the spectrum of EOP on mind hunter,
is that what you're saying?

1198
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,420
I'm not sure it's that kind of problem,
but, oh, and what about this drew on?

1199
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,640
Something's really wrong with me. Oh
yes. He's dark, dark sided. Dark side.

1200
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:46,430
What about the fact that my husband
Paul, incredibly compassionate. Okay.

1201
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:50,730
When I'm falling asleep at night, he'll
watch TV and he'll watch. It's all,

1202
01:11:50,731 --> 01:11:55,230
if you look at his Netflix Queue, it's
murder, murder, murder, psychopath,

1203
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:59,510
serial killer, drew. They make all those
shows just for me. Yeah. Isn't that neat?

1204
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:03,190
Yeah. They go like really deep into post
production for me. We'll talk later. Yeah.

1205
01:12:03,191 --> 01:12:06,990
Yeah. What's going on? So just for
you, it's just me. I've talked to them.

1206
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:10,500
They've said it was just
for you on orders, just for
meeting all that starts 48.

1207
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:15,190
It's just all me likes that. Should I
be concerned? I think I got to go down,

1208
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,980
but he's such a gentle, yeah. The
thing is he would never hurt a fly.

1209
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,410
Yeah, exactly. What'd you do as a kid?
Were you twisting rabbits next and

1210
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:34,170
all the people, I do it now. Let's
see if I can really stock, you know,

1211
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:38,910
God, pick someone and I
go fallen you. Oh my God.

1212
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,310
You gotta get to know their habits when I
go to work. Okay. Anyways, anyways, yeah.

1213
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,010
Here's another one that's not
like those other ones. I swear.

1214
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,390
But I really want your opinion
on this and then, yeah,

1215
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:54,020
he didn't want my opinion. All the
other ones. No, no, no. I'm saying like,

1216
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,250
this is interesting one,
I think seriously. Okay.

1217
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:00,100
Sweden is the most food thinking
country in the world when it comes to

1218
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:01,060
questioning gender.

1219
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:05,470
The gender neutral Pronoun Hen is
now commonly used by most Swedes,

1220
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:09,700
so that's just a little intel beginning,
beginning.

1221
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,130
This is Nikos Drum on how this Nico,
Nico is two and a half,

1222
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,740
almost five and a half.

1223
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,550
Mika and Nico were both assigned
male at birth and this family,

1224
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,940
the sex you were born with does
not dictate your gender identity.

1225
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:28,710
So then, so we're giving you
just a little context for this.

1226
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,300
We use key for them.

1227
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,720
Sometimes it's next and it depends,
you know,

1228
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:39,070
because in Sweden we have hen the
gender neutral pronoun in Swedish.

1229
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:44,130
I think Mika has always said when
I've asked it's been she or Ken,

1230
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:44,980
uh,

1231
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:49,840
changing pronouns in book
instead of it always being mama,

1232
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,560
we say Mama and mark par.

1233
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:56,740
What's the matter Sweetie
Yak [inaudible] it's so dark.

1234
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,490
So just to give you the full thing,
what,

1235
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:01,620
what did the next clip is also
what I want you to weigh in on.

1236
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,090
There's this family there in
Sweden. Um, you understand that,

1237
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:10,830
that they were talking about the pronouns
here and then these very young kids

1238
01:14:10,831 --> 01:14:11,664
are,

1239
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:16,720
uh, how they're getting
different, um, hormones.

1240
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,200
No,

1241
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,200
they're just daily being given the option
to choose pronouns and it switching

1242
01:14:23,641 --> 01:14:26,680
over to a half and five year
olds or they're being asked, hey,

1243
01:14:26,681 --> 01:14:28,210
what would you like me to call you?

1244
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:33,230
Okay, that's a pond. And they ended up,

1245
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,700
that's not something I always have to say,

1246
01:14:35,701 --> 01:14:38,550
but it would be good to
note to Dave for the film,

1247
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,900
The Sky Hone Ella him. Just Mika. Okay.

1248
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:46,280
So the kid answered,
um, just by name. Yes.

1249
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,130
Do you think that there's anything,
uh,

1250
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:54,920
odd to asking?
Very small children their gender pronouns?

1251
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:01,460
I don't know, cause it was, it's
unusual. We're not used to that,

1252
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:04,440
but you would have to be really studied,
have to see what the outcomes are. Right.

1253
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,800
I'm a little concerned with the
biological reassignments. Uh,

1254
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:13,160
the crazy American Academy of Pediatrics
just came out strongly against it.

1255
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,170
Um, is that being done? Oh
yeah. Wait, what do you mean
reassignments? They're born,

1256
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:22,260
they're being, if they say, I feel
like a girl today around, I've,

1257
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,900
even though a boy,
you better get on those hormones.

1258
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,690
We're right away keep the
three year old and uh,

1259
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:30,850
the j the concerning and we don't even
know the full medical consequences of

1260
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:34,940
that either yet. So it's all, but people
are doing that. Oh yeah. My crazy butt.

1261
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:39,500
But I, this part I, I'm sort of
agnostic about. Yeah. It's like,

1262
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,280
it's like maybe it'll be, I dunno.
Maybe would be good. Okay. I,

1263
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,710
I'm more worried with the way
this guy's treating his children.

1264
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,640
It does not feel very
connected or empathic. Yeah.

1265
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,750
It feels very,

1266
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:52,320
yeah.

1267
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,110
Tutorial.
Everything's very like weird and formal.

1268
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,470
I mean babies just because
the camera's there, I don't
know. Right, right. Oh yeah.

1269
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:03,640
But it would not feel comfortable being
his, was he dad or mom? What does it, oh,

1270
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,830
you would not feel comfortable
having him as my mopar. Right.

1271
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,930
I mean feel weird if you're that kid,
that's where she's like, Hey, shut up.

1272
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:13,710
Calming Mocha. Yeah. Stop
asking me comfortable.

1273
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,920
Do you think something mental
is going on with this type?

1274
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:17,510
Um,

1275
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:22,510
don't understand like why you bitches
and people is May this because I say I'm

1276
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:30,190
black and Andrea to Dakar.
Sam Let,

1277
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,010
but at the end of the day, what
is the race anyways? Your family.

1278
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:38,490
Cause like we outlined, we are here
on this world's supposed to be equal.

1279
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:42,870
It just in the past people
was messed up and stuff.

1280
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,470
Oh honey,
what's going on here?

1281
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,780
I feel so angry at our educational system.

1282
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:56,590
Sometimes I really get
angry substance stuff.

1283
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:59,800
I don't see anything metal.
Why? Nothing mental health wise,

1284
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:03,640
other than the little angry, but,
but just like, come on everybody.

1285
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:08,070
Let's go back to school. Wait, let's
be able to function in society. Yeah.

1286
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,010
You want your

1287
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,660
daughter to stay at a fuck bitch.

1288
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:16,930
Why would you with somebody you don't
know this real sad and obviously you can

1289
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:22,370
see I'm not ugly bitch in my head.
Go down. Might be a little fat.

1290
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,080
Never claim to be skinny.

1291
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,770
Is there a per people just listening?
These are two back to back. White girls.

1292
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,160
I love these two girls. Yeah,
they're pretty, pretty entertaining.

1293
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,110
Why don't you start talking like that?
I'm trying. I can't do the accident.

1294
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,950
She's still going

1295
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,300
and I don't see Nancy
and I don't see Nancy

1296
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,330

1297
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:00,160
Yeah. You know he'll, he'll talk about
it being raised around that. Oh really?

1298
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,700
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Louisiana.

1299
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,200
He does not have good feelings about
what was going on there. Really? Yeah.

1300
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,780
It was pretty good.
Stuff's going to get me in trouble with

1301
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,100
the racial stuff. Tommy, what's
that word that you taught me?

1302
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,520
Where you choose your race? Oh,
trans rate. That's interest. That's,

1303
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:25,840
people are like saying like, like it'd be
like me saying, you know is I was born.

1304
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,190
I know, but you see, but I'm actually
Filipino. Yeah. Identify with fillers.

1305
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,360
Filipino mental illness or is that a,
what's going on with you?

1306
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,440
You've tried to get me how much trouble
you've tried to get me one podcast.

1307
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,200
These people, what's happening?
Is this a societal homeless?

1308
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:48,790
This is a social phenomenon. This is not,
it is not a real health issue. Got You.

1309
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:51,610
So this is just the time.
This is what's in the ethers.

1310
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,303
Yes.

1311
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:02,220
If you want to move to that fuck the Oh,

1312
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,660
oh, there's one last guy. This
guy has been like a big deal.

1313
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,170
This poor man. Right. But there's just
one guy we want you to weigh in on.

1314
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,980
Just, he just uh, he's got a
dinner waiting for him at home.

1315
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:22,870
Walking down the street,
just working on a song. Okay.

1316
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:32,570
Yeah. Machines. But then

normal or no? Trying to make my rough,

1318
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:44,560
trying to talk to Shawn with
machines,

1319
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:47,010

1320
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:56,590
I just feel, I feel sad. I
feel sad. It makes me sad.

1321
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,253
What part of it?

1322
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,500
Just that we're failing people
so miserably and it's done.

1323
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:03,813
He made a note.

1324
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:11,670
It's called crazy, isn't it? Well, who
would I go? I'll drop that birthday party.

1325
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,440
Crazy. Isn't it crazy? Isn't it?

1326
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:20,830
Drop that first drop that
first got the not crazy.

1327
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:25,790
Isn't it crazy?
Isn't it crazy?

1328
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:30,660
Isn't topped up first. How crazy.
Isn't it innocent. Innocent.

1329
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,400
Innocent.
Is it great?

1330
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,590
Juggalo okay. He would
be, we'll be fine there.

1331
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,510
He'll be fine amongst his peers.
Wow. There it is. Normative,

1332
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,500
somewhat normative behavior is engaged.

1333
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:48,270
Even the junk clothes for five
rob with us, but he will like,

1334
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,010
he will make a good juggler. Okay.
You know you're amazing. Amazing you.

1335
01:20:52,011 --> 01:20:53,260
You got your spidey senses back.

1336
01:20:53,261 --> 01:20:56,680
So now would you say this is mental
illness or an educational failure?

1337
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,940
It's a juggle. Osis. Did
I go jogging? Holy Shit.

1338
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:05,170
I was, I almost went to the
Juggalo conveyed whether
they call it the gathering.

1339
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:08,550
Yeah. I want to go to the gathering just
to see what's, what's going on there.

1340
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:10,890
I got to show you how many
people are so interesting.

1341
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:15,340
I want you to treat them my very fun.
Can you treat them and mass?

1342
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:17,080
Can you open up a booth at the juggle?
Okay.

1343
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:21,460
Well the price people warned me off going
cause they said it'd be too scary that

1344
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:24,070
I would get hurt. I think that's
a good idea. That's a good,

1345
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,810
I really wanted to go though. I
really did. This gentleman is just,

1346
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:33,190
he's a of low is a juggler.
It's just, it's a cultural,

1347
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:37,930
it's just an expression. Expression.
No problems. Okay. He's not angry.

1348
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:42,790
Oh yeah. Yeah. He's socially, like I said,
I got sad, but to know there's a place,

1349
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:45,490
a home,
even for him amongst the Juggalos,

1350
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:49,740
I mean that felt pretty good about this.
Hope for that was just different.

1351
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:59,090
I think we're traumatizing.
Dr. Drill another one.

1352
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:03,680
I'm in love with this. This is just
good comedy, man. Well, I'm saying like,

1353
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,810
do you think, is there anything to
doing that is they're like, well,

1354
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,820
should I be concerned about her?
Well, yeah, that's trauma, right?

1355
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:15,620
Fart videos for money. Come on for
money. She gets paid for that. Of course.

1356
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,593
God is great.

1357
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,950
I mean seriously like seriously.
This is man,

1358
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:24,973
you can do this too.
Okay.

1359
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,033
There's a reason.

1360
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:32,570
I

1361
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:34,970
mean there's people that do this.

1362
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:39,250
Is there something that there are people
that didn't play it over and over again?

1363
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:43,460
The other guests on pipes. Well I'm
saying are you're saying, I'm just saying,

1364
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:48,020
I'm just saying see there's suddenly all
kinds of pictures and she's been abused.

1365
01:22:48,021 --> 01:22:52,010
Right. Stepdad. I'm in love with
her too. She's a very sweet girl.

1366
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:54,690
This is the best thing ever.
This is now. That's just funny.

1367
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,400
I just enjoy that. Thank you. What about
[inaudible], why is that funny? Oh,

1368
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,210
cause it's does this type of,

1369
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,010
cause you have so like there's still
many tells that you're keyed in on. Yeah.

1370
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,910
I feel like, cause you're like, you
know, you look at the eye. Yeah.

1371
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,840
Do you think that this voice go property?
Yes.

1372
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:14,490
She made me do copious
amounts of cocaine with her

1373
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:21,450
and I thought my heart was
going to stop. Yeah, that's it.

1374
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:26,510
She made me do copious amounts of cocaine
with her and the point I thought my

1375
01:23:26,971 --> 01:23:31,850
heart was going to stop. That's
it. She told me to calm down.

1376
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:33,200
Oh,
gave me a drink.

1377
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:34,770
Okay.

1378
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,000
And I don't know it was in the drink,
but I blacked out.

1379
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,260
Okay.

1380
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:42,570
She had both of my legs
over her shoulders and I'm,

1381
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:46,430
she was numb sucking my asshole.
Like there's no tomorrow

1382
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,280
numb sucking. What is it? I'm sorry.

1383
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:54,010
I tried to find it. I tried to
get away, but I was restrained.

1384
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,520
She told me that I liked it.
You probably,

1385
01:23:57,521 --> 01:24:01,590
Jay told me not to worry because she
used the good jelly. The shmuck says,

1386
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,530
I mean,
is this something we don't know who this,

1387
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:09,160
nobody's paid me to confess this now,

1388
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,790
and I've kept it under wraps for all
these years because I knew that no one

1389
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:16,960
would believe me.
No one will believe that Hillary Clinton.

1390
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,400
Oh my asshole.

1391
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,780
Oh my gosh. But doesn't his, his.

1392
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:25,250
I feel like there's something going on
and tell him the truth. I can't tell.

1393
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,230
I can't tell what he's
not telling the truth.

1394
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:31,700
I don't know what's up with [inaudible].
Ryan sickler. It's very funny comedian.

1395
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:36,290
Oh, is it? No, no, no,
no. I thought it was him.

1396
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:40,190
I'm looking for my favorite picture
here for you guys and the Juggalos. Yes,

1397
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:42,500
my check a little picture.
I'm going to find it.

1398
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:45,310
They could really use you
in that community. Yeah.

1399
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,190
Maybe I just don't want them
to kill me if I show up. No,

1400
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:51,820
you think that this love pops.

1401
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:56,830
We've had a bit of a rest time now for
some triangle or assaulting and Templeton

1402
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,880
few pop place seems really simple because
most people just get huddle hobbling

1403
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,600
around and going more for,
for buck buck.

1404
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:07,970
But it's really so much more complicated.

1405
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:13,860
But that guy started this
pup play training in New
Zealand writing training and

1406
01:25:14,871 --> 01:25:18,980
he's got all these guys into it there
and he was, um, basically like, oh,

1407
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:21,920
it's a fun, get together. You
know, like, well first he was like,

1408
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:25,670
just a bunch of guys enjoying each other's
company and then later it's like we

1409
01:25:25,671 --> 01:25:29,860
also ejaculate in each other's face. And
yeah, that was a big secret, you know,

1410
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:32,870
after we, so, so that's sorta like the

1411
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:38,930
furbies furries. Yeah.
On that video there.

1412
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:41,390
It's all like, you know, on the up,

1413
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:45,830
like it's like we just hang out and I
treat them like dogs and then we found

1414
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:51,250
videos of him online in a different
light where he was basically like,

1415
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:54,170
run your finger along
new. Correct. If your ass,

1416
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:55,970
you don't need to figure your home.

1417
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,730
You don't want to come back with shit
on your finger. No, you don't want that.

1418
01:25:58,731 --> 01:25:59,060
Yeah.

1419
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:04,040
But he was instructing people in a much
more graphic way when it wasn't a news

1420
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,300
piece. Of course he didn't want to.
Yeah. What's that? Oh there we go.

1421
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:12,920
Oh my gosh. Violent J and Shaggy. So drew,

1422
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,630
show me a picture tonight on love line.

1423
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:17,900
You had these two guys on level
repeatedly. The insane clown posse.

1424
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,630
These guys are many times ICP,
they're my buddies.

1425
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:24,900
I've heard them on a stern before they,
they're seen front and they're fun.

1426
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,380
Guys like come to studio like this.

1427
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:32,410
They never seen anywhere without either
a Mexican wrestling masks mask or that a

1428
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:36,800
comic upon ever. They've never
been seen is a lot of work. Yeah,

1429
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,060
that does seem like a lot of work.

1430
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:41,780
Do they do it themselves and imagine the
guy with the hockey mask wearing that

1431
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:45,170
makeup that then he starts to make
sense, does it, right, right, right.

1432
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,180
That's what he was looking at you,
what's your take on,

1433
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:49,870
you would look like shaggy or you know,

1434
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:53,270
people make fun of Juggalos a lot
and like ICP and all this stuff.

1435
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,990
But then I love them though,

1436
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:59,360
bring about how business savvy
these guys are with this, you know,

1437
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:00,900
the brilliant and,
and there,

1438
01:27:00,901 --> 01:27:03,440
there's a whole philosophy of stuff
and it's hard to argue with them.

1439
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:07,070
I mean they really are conditioning
guys and it is positive, right?

1440
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:07,990
They're all about this.

1441
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,630
A little bit too much aggression
and violence when they gather, but,

1442
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:14,300
but other than that, I have no
quarrels. All right, well we'll look,

1443
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:19,190
we want you to go home and have salmon.
I want to see support for videos. Oh,

1444
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:23,960
okay. Right. Oh my gosh.
Your mom's house. We got 'em.

1445
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:28,580
You asked for it. Yeah. Oh,
same girl. No. Do you think?

1446
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,190
Do you think she really does this or
somebody playing with a video or sound

1447
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,310
effects over is a rooster
in the background?

1448
01:27:33,311 --> 01:27:36,980
Do you know who you chat is the best
idea? You think? Do people pay for this?

1449
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,810
That's the thing that we're trying to
figure out. Is it sexual? Yes. Yes.

1450
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:46,010
It's super get off on this.
It's not just comedy. It up.

1451
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,740
A while ago a guy wrote
in and he was like, well,

1452
01:27:48,741 --> 01:27:52,760
the whole thing is seeing a
pretty girl do the dirty thing.

1453
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:55,220
That's what he gets off on a dirty thing.
Well,

1454
01:27:55,221 --> 01:27:59,950
you know why the rest of us just
laugh? I don't know. Some cake farts.

1455
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:04,190
Who has,
come on,

1456
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:10,910
let me see if I can
definitely had a bad child.

1457
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:15,860
I mean you don't find on the Internet
cause things were good and your childhood,

1458
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:20,090
you know, there's, there's a high degree
of secondary enforcement. What's that?

1459
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:24,260
She gets paid a lot probably to do,
it may just be one of those things.

1460
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,760
It's a hundred dollars a
hundred dollars, I think. Uh,

1461
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:33,530
Susan says she's tired and she made
a crappy dinner. Oh, that'd be like,

1462
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:37,550
I'm glad I'm not there. Should I put
her on the show? Get on the phone. Yeah,

1463
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:44,780
we're watching fart videos.
Do you think something's going on?

1464
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,570
Um,
we're gonna show you the king real quick.

1465
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,160
[inaudible]

1466
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:54,710
sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1467
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,000
Please analyze this guy.
We're really curious about him.

1468
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,690
We get it. She's texting me. What
she has to front is drives me crazy.

1469
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:09,880
It drives me crazy too, is don't you
want to murder your spouse sometimes? No.

1470
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,480
I want to kill you and you don't
answer and I want to talk to you,

1471
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:15,990
but he didn't just complete a
text to you and then not answer.

1472
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:21,120
Oh my God. Please. Come on. Come
on. Susan. Come out of this.

1473
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:25,990
She's missing such good
material. Talk about she loves
fart humor. Really, really?

1474
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,850
No, she, she does not get it at all. Do
you fart in front of each other? Sure,

1475
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:37,453
sure.

1476
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:45,820
He's called the king ass rep over there.
How about the guidance during the days,

1477
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:51,320
Joe? The farther here. This
guy blows that guy away, dude.

1478
01:29:51,321 --> 01:29:55,930
Yeah, it's really good. It's a real,
we've tried contacting him. Oh my God,

1479
01:29:55,970 --> 01:30:00,170
you won't come on our show.
I know. I guess it's identity
is a secret. Yeah. Yeah.

1480
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:04,960
Well, no, no. Shows his space.
Yeah. In this video, does
he respond to your emails?

1481
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,650
No. I mean, look, look, we've offered
him money. Look, it's all it's all about,

1482
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:14,480
oh my God. You guys live in this
world. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, Susan.

1483
01:30:14,481 --> 01:30:17,630
You're on the podcast. You
didn't tell him that. Hey,

1484
01:30:17,631 --> 01:30:20,000
you didn't tell me that your mom's
house is just these two sitting around

1485
01:30:20,001 --> 01:30:22,460
watching late baby.
Okay.

1486
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:26,920
I'll look at the king asked
river on the voice. Oh,

1487
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,900
she's watching the voice. Oh. Um hmm.

1488
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:34,790
Whether you didn't tell me that your moms,
hang on,

1489
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:37,880
you didn't tell me your mom's house is
just these two sitting around watching

1490
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:38,723
park videos,

1491
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:43,270
which you want to think
mark video. Yeah. Yeah.

1492
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:49,520
Uh, no. Uh, we have files saved. We,

1493
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,030
yes. How did you, how
did you know about that?

1494
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:58,893
Yeah.

1495
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,450
Well these two have made
an art form of that,

1496
01:31:02,451 --> 01:31:05,840
that they apparently study it
like the Zapruder tapes. Yeah.

1497
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:10,830
Yes. I was, my first
exposure was recently. Yes.

1498
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,190
We were both like in
disbelief. Thank you. No,

1499
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:17,020
this was just watching women fart online
and we were like, yeah. What? Yeah,

1500
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:19,910
it's a special lane.
Thankfully I had been pre my,

1501
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,280
my hymen had been ruptured prior to
getting here. I might've been shot

1502
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,230
your version of art,
art videos.

1503
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:31,960
Um, so many, but I just want to tell you
I'll hear the it but she can't hear it.

1504
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:32,843
Right.

1505
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:35,413
That's the guy though.

1506
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:46,540
Aw. Yeah. This is the guy at Barton,

1507
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:50,280
his dog. That's animal abuse. Right.
In our world. Our dog's abuse. US.

1508
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,640
Of course the dog enjoys it. Is it
really considered animal abuse? You,

1509
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:57,630
as soon as I called you to
tell you what I'm still doing,

1510
01:31:57,631 --> 01:32:00,150
so I'll get home soon as I can deed
your crappy dinner as you said.

1511
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,630
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

1512
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:04,550
It's fine. I'm sure we miss
you as soon as we could be here

1513
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,200
this time.
It was terrible.

1514
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:10,130
Oh, I'm sorry. But listen, they miss
you too. I'm sad you didn't come.

1515
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,000
Oh, I know. Thank you for
saying, man, I wish I could have

1516
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:19,630
do all the, do all the plugs. Gifts. I
isn't, wait, wait, Tom, sorry to Susan.

1517
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:24,570
How great. How great is
Drew's body? Amazing. Yeah.

1518
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,780
Yeah. And if we were talking about
it, you know, it's really cool. Oh,

1519
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:33,820
okay. This just in case your
kids are listening. No, no, no.

1520
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:37,990
You have your prostate
removed. No Demon. Right.

1521
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:43,810
Those very closely.
Very clean and that must be nice.

1522
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,490
The changes. No Muss, no fuss.

1523
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:49,960
Oh No.
Is that not PC for your show him?

1524
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:54,300
Oh
are you fucking

1525
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:59,930
started? Very nice. But it
goes down a rabbit hole and
you were not in the leader,

1526
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:03,750
so that's so fun.
That's the best line of the night.

1527
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,080
He'll give all the plugs on there.
Forget. I'll remember to do it. Go ahead.

1528
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,960
No, before I, after I
bleached my butthole,

1529
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:15,740
make sure you listen to this podcast the
doctors do about forest or my counter

1530
01:33:15,741 --> 01:33:20,500
would just depending on what kind of mood
I'm in. The dark [inaudible] podcast,

1531
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:24,810
Adam Admin, drew podcast and
weekly infusion. Oh, it of course.

1532
01:33:24,811 --> 01:33:28,070
Calling out with Susan Penske,
which I'm resurrecting. Okay.

1533
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:31,250
Oh, I'm not sure you want this
crowd over there, but okay.

1534
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,150
They've already been on the show,
honey.

1535
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,360
No, no, not these two.

1536
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:40,250
I mean the people that did find them
amusing in their current mom's house.

1537
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:46,170
Okay. All right. Well I'll be home
soon enough. All right. Love you too.

1538
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:50,770
Bye Bye. Just, it was beautiful. Yeah.

1539
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:54,700
The your show, what's it called?
Sorry, I've forgotten the you live.

1540
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:57,760
How do you have time to do all of
this shit? What the hell doing?

1541
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:01,690
I'm just to crank them out. So you're like
a pro podcast or, I mean, I'm, I'm like,

1542
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:03,310
it was a serious workaholic though.

1543
01:34:03,311 --> 01:34:07,380
So everything seems easy to me since
those days. Yeah. This is the fighter,

1544
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:10,180
but he also does gluttony videos.

1545
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:15,040
Three fucking Oh beef and shut her
sandwiches. Slop with fucking manager.

1546
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:22,700
He's in Brooklyn too.
Full complete disappointment.

1547
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:27,070
You don't like to eat anymore.
It's hard to watch. Yeah, but he,

1548
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:32,020
but I love how fucked up people are.
Very

1549
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:37,360
weird. Right? There's,
there's also videos.

1550
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:42,370
He gets out a bunch of this food
and farts on it and then he said,

1551
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:48,070
I want, I want, I'm not interested in
him. I mentioned that. Who's watching him?

1552
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:52,690
Yeah. Like who we've brought him
to a lot of people. I mean a lot.

1553
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:56,980
Dual. Yeah. Yeah. It makes
you want to throw out.

1554
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,970
Do you think this is like a fetish
thing? Yes. All this is off of it. Yeah.

1555
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:07,260
Any, anything that's sexual that shouldn't
be sexual, you know what I mean? Why?

1556
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:11,910
Why do you think gluttony? How
does that turn someone on? I, I've,

1557
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,100
I don't,
not an expert in this area,

1558
01:35:14,101 --> 01:35:18,960
but I've always had the sense that it
was something to do with being force fed

1559
01:35:18,961 --> 01:35:20,100
as a child or something.

1560
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:24,210
It was two gratifying or
maybe the breastfeeding was
done at two an aggressive

1561
01:35:24,211 --> 01:35:27,490
away or something. So they always feel
like they're overwhelmed by it. Yeah.

1562
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:31,400
Just do fart videos and then a,

1563
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:34,860
then he started doing the glider evolved
as an artist. Yeah. He really did evolve.

1564
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:37,710
Paid for these things, right?
I think so. But you know,

1565
01:35:37,711 --> 01:35:42,711
we've never really found his pay stuff
more fucking gluttony already know.

1566
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:50,190
Yeah. Gaining leading community.

1567
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:53,010
Yeah.
I'm wondering if it's my channel,

1568
01:35:53,011 --> 01:35:56,580
gluttonous slob and go to
the pig out checkout button.

1569
01:35:56,670 --> 01:36:00,440
I'm wondering if it's so we know
you guys asked me for cash is

1570
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:06,730
gay or straight gay? There's no
women that are interested. No, no.

1571
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,700
I'm other heterosexual men. It's all,
everything weird is mad. Let's face it.

1572
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:12,310
A heterosexual men or straight or gay man.

1573
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,250
Maybe that's why he won't answer US genes.

1574
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,510
I think because we reached out to him so
many times and I think he needs to keep

1575
01:36:18,511 --> 01:36:21,790
his business in tact. I think it's gay
guys that are in there that he, uh,

1576
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:26,160
he goes also by, I fart in
your face. That's a, but he,

1577
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,520
we really, this is him here. This is like
him and his hard drives to the Florida,

1578
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:34,800
our dresser to Fart on, you know,
and he would just post these

1579
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,753
videos.

1580
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,330
Camera Quality.
Yeah.

1581
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,023
God,

1582
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:51,010
Oh, everyone has their
own towels. You know,

1583
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:54,360
there's a big scandal about those five
videos with him was that he'd handle,

1584
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:58,590
but people didn't believe
they were genuine. He was
shooting heroin to himself.

1585
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:01,620
Okay. There will still be genuine
in a weird way. Well, yeah. Well,

1586
01:37:01,621 --> 01:37:05,250
let me ask you this. Medically speaking,
I mean, is that really possible?

1587
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:06,660
What that guy's doing or is that fake?

1588
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:10,530
It's possible is that the bacteria
can produce a lot of gas. Right?

1589
01:37:10,531 --> 01:37:12,970
They split that I tried to do is waste.

1590
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,490
Are you writing this down then and
so the methane that's produced by the

1591
01:37:17,491 --> 01:37:17,971
bacteria,

1592
01:37:17,971 --> 01:37:20,970
it can be high volume and if he holds
it in for periods of time and then films

1593
01:37:20,971 --> 01:37:23,460
it when it's time to go,
yeah, I can see where it'd be.

1594
01:37:23,461 --> 01:37:25,170
Probably probably knows what to give him,

1595
01:37:25,171 --> 01:37:29,570
feed himself to get the optimal
and sometimes swallowing air.

1596
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:33,090
Sometimes people will swap out of air
and some guys could suck in air. Yeah,

1597
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,820
they could actually suck it.
Like will the party,

1598
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,990
it's kind of a trick,
a parlor trick in not a real thing.

1599
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:43,440
So it's like inserting
air. Well, let's be fair.

1600
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:47,010
What is it you actually
want from this guy? I mean,

1601
01:37:47,011 --> 01:37:49,170
does it really matter
how it got to that point?

1602
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,920
Does that violate your sensibilities,
your delicate sensibilities?

1603
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:58,070
The Geneva Convention on Fart has to
be pure bacterial Beth production.

1604
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:03,060
We'll have no above air for below.
The judges will rule for me.

1605
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:09,930
I want him to eat that. Rbs. Yeah, but
if it's swallowing air as part of it,

1606
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:12,420
his gas production,
some people the air goes through.

1607
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:16,860
And why not give them that if he has
that talent? I mean, I, I understand.

1608
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:20,250
Like I'm just saying, the judges say,
I feel like they couldn't be the judge.

1609
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:22,140
I feel like the committee
would want to review this.

1610
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:25,760
I feel took worthy of worthy
of a throwing the flag I want.

1611
01:38:25,761 --> 01:38:29,170
I want to official review. Yeah. I have
another very scientific, oh my God.

1612
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:30,880
I don't know if I could take anymore,
I'm sorry.

1613
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:34,890
My mother used to tell me she used to,

1614
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:37,640
I used to Fart a lot and when
sometimes I'd complain about the farts.

1615
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:42,300
She would say that you should
be grateful for the farts farts.

1616
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:45,110
Push the shutouts. Now is that true? That

1617
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:51,780
puts the farts out as far as and shit or
a center sort of disconnected phenomena.

1618
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:58,440
Yeah. There's sort of, this
can be a little connected,

1619
01:38:58,441 --> 01:39:00,570
but they're obviously, there's
some connection there, but they,

1620
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,260
they're independent.
They're not just still push the farts out.

1621
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:08,490
They eat a shit. We'll a fart. We'll come
out with the shit, but this shit is dope.

1622
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,410
Yeah. And the, she said the
FARC push the shit right.

1623
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:15,640
And it's a little different and the
farts just come out. They just forget.

1624
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:20,160
There's no causal relationship.
Not really. I mean,

1625
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:24,270
it may give you more of a sense of a
desire to depart, studying and being,

1626
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:28,780
did I ever think I'd be on this show?
Any show talking about this and you never,

1627
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:33,240
I not, that's not something I expected.
If he's talking about, I thought we,

1628
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:38,360
I thought your wife was really smart and
I thought we'd talk about Kierkegaard,

1629
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,230
Kierkegaard, Thomas Aquinas,
Kierkegaard on top of it.

1630
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:45,540
Well,

1631
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:50,540
I took a leap of faith by coming on
this show and I'm here to work here.

1632
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:56,460
I was wrong because it has
done so much work out there.

1633
01:39:56,461 --> 01:40:00,220
It's for, is required to get
here. But, uh, I think, uh,

1634
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:05,070
Heidegger was a little close to the proper
analysis of the extensional phonology

1635
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,370
round. You're the best
man. Thanks for coming on.

1636
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,660
Thank you for letting us torture you
with these plants. Are we really done?

1637
01:40:12,661 --> 01:40:15,330
I have a weird sort of like
desire to continue. Oh,

1638
01:40:15,331 --> 01:40:18,870
I'll get the weird like weird,
like I feel attached to all this.

1639
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:22,830
I've traumatized traumatic attachment,
trauma bonding.

1640
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,600
You're going to associate beards with
this for a long time and it's stalking

1641
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:31,680
behavior and I'm not going to know
when to leave or go. Give me one more.

1642
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:35,250
Give you one more. Okay. Gimme
a gimme a high grade? No, no.

1643
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,420
Violent medical injury stuff that I'm
to be thinking about the surgical suites

1644
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:44,320
without the dad excitement.
The trans.

1645
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,400
What about one of your other guests?
Have extra,

1646
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:52,380
had extraordinary reactions
to extraordinary high level
reactions to two guests

1647
01:40:52,381 --> 01:40:56,110
that should be able to take it. Is this
thing, I don't know. Is this one of them?

1648
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:57,520
Hold on.
I want one.

1649
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,490
They did eventually meet Ken who
shares her sexual preference. Oh,

1650
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:08,290
not this Belgian until I was 29 years old.
That was to follow him.

1651
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:13,090
No, no. Zolal file. Yeah, I know.

1652
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:19,670
Shit. I'm doing it on the fly.
But then bomber. What about the,

1653
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:23,280
what about the transition?
Savannah Trans Canada highway? No,

1654
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,940
that's not weird enough. No. You know,

1655
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:30,060
my radio partner and Mike Catherwood
sends me where it's stuff all the time.

1656
01:41:30,061 --> 01:41:35,061
He goes on the dark web and he's very
fascinated with a dire people that

1657
01:41:35,491 --> 01:41:38,720
diarrhea on each other. I, I buy,

1658
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:43,560
I need to connect Taran breakup clearly.
Uh, they diarrhea on each other.

1659
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:46,350
It's a sexual thing.
You can't really do it on each other.

1660
01:41:46,351 --> 01:41:50,670
Only one person gets to be the
receiver. Oh, I got to go. Well for you,

1661
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:52,860
I've got to go look for you to see it.
It's really awful.

1662
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:56,130
The vomit every time and he
finds great gleer delight.

1663
01:41:56,190 --> 01:42:00,780
People have a strong reaction
to this. Ah, here we go. Tom,

1664
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:05,520
your moms and your, my son and I if
falling in love with him. Oh, he said,

1665
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,070
are you really? I said, yes, I
am. He's thinking, you know what?

1666
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:12,310
I was scared to let you know too. I am
too. We're both consenting adults. If,

1667
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:16,840
if it comes down the way, operate it,
it's just like it is a whole phenomenon

1668
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:21,530
and everything.
Everything's fine and a way.

1669
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:25,150
There's a woman I ended up in interviewing
several times who was in recovery

1670
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:25,984
from this.

1671
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:29,860
And so she can talk about what the
delusion is like when you're in it and how

1672
01:42:29,861 --> 01:42:32,050
people get into that and
how they get out of it.

1673
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:36,580
So you're saying because of
the separation, the, the bond
was, it's distorted. Yeah.

1674
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:39,640
It gets all fucked up. So He'd be,
how do you develop a, a romantic,

1675
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:42,980
you don't see them as a maternal figure.
It's just a way.

1676
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,150
It's just all you get sexualized
inappropriately and stuff.

1677
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,790
So should you be able to marry your
mom? Know, cause, cause whenever,

1678
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,820
but everyone's just like
the gays though. What, what?

1679
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:57,640
That's what that guy says. You saw that.
But he goes, it's just like the gays.

1680
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:01,570
What are you shooting? Yeah. Yeah.

1681
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:07,050
It's like if we're both adults
[inaudible] and producing kids that close,

1682
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:11,770
you can do that. But uh, I, you know,

1683
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:14,290
I have a question about
government overreach too.

1684
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:16,160
We should get involved
with that at all. Yeah, no,

1685
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:21,000
I heard in a college that you can
have sex with your eyes forward. No,

1686
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:24,030
not accurate. This is University of San
Francisco. Okay. A lesser school. Yeah.

1687
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:25,140
And I,
I,

1688
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:30,120
I was told that you can have offspring
with your cousin that you won't have a,

1689
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:33,130
you can with your siblings
are and with your mom. But it,

1690
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,940
but the risk of trouble
is they're really hot.

1691
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:40,560
The lessor lessor because as you get
further and further away, it's less,

1692
01:43:40,561 --> 01:43:42,530
our cousins is not that big a risk.
Right.

1693
01:43:42,531 --> 01:43:46,480
Like royalty used to marry the Egyptian
royalty. You were married their kids.

1694
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:50,110
Oh yeah. That's pretty good. Brothers and
sisters and things they did. Horrible,

1695
01:43:50,111 --> 01:43:53,720
horrible, nasty. Hell.
That's a very bizarro

1696
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:55,900
the kilometer marker.

1697
01:43:56,470 --> 01:44:01,470
7,128 and this is where
I believe with a 90%,

1698
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,390
uh,
no mic,

1699
01:44:07,391 --> 01:44:12,391
that 95% chance that this is in fact the
very place where that Trans Canada paid

1700
01:44:19,691 --> 01:44:21,470
dates.
Last section.

1701
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:27,530
Oh yeah. Right here. Yeah, that's me.

1702
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:29,450
That's me

1703
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:36,610
there. And he's based, he's
really good. He Really,

1704
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:41,210
oh, one more time. Down the middle

1705
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:47,730
said the guy with the double rainbows.
Yes. But that guy was on dry six.

1706
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:52,440
Oh. Oh, oh. Oh. This is a downhill sucks.

1707
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:56,960
Unfortunately, this is drugs so
weird. We never thought about,

1708
01:44:57,450 --> 01:45:02,240
oh why didn't we think of drugs? What?
What kind of drugs are we talking about?

1709
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:04,820
Louie? Second doubt. Yeah. Yeah.

1710
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:06,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

1711
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:11,030
your Trans Canada highway.

1712
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,610
It's odd, right? I mean it's a lot.
Can I take a shower before I leave?

1713
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:21,680
But it's oddly mesmerizing. Yes. All
of this salary. Mesmerizing. Huh?

1714
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,990
You guys are good. Good job.

1715
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:33,210
Is that Charlie
out?

1716
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:37,840
[inaudible]
calm down layer per Musteal.

1717
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:41,330
It's just soup. Moose
suit. Yeah, she's looking,

1718
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,110
she's a watching this boat race and the
guy falls in the water and then she goes

1719
01:45:46,111 --> 01:45:48,030
from like, you know like you
hear like fuck cause you,

1720
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:52,650
he fell in to keep asking them
to come over for moose soup does.

1721
01:45:52,651 --> 01:45:55,920
She's got later for them.
What do you think she looks like drew?

1722
01:45:55,921 --> 01:46:00,150
Like just on the voice. Hmm.
Granny from Beverly hillbillies.

1723
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:04,560
That's pretty accurate.
What does she actually look like?

1724
01:46:04,561 --> 01:46:06,540
A granny from nailed it.

1725
01:46:06,930 --> 01:46:11,610
Oh yeah. You guys come down here
after I got moose soup and everything.

1726
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:18,100
All right. You guys are doing
good. It's not the rights of to,

1727
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:20,640
Hey,
I got you on video.

1728
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,230
Did we get to see her?

1729
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:29,340
She blows them all later in a different
video or a floor guy. Yeah, that's great.

1730
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:33,270
No, no Tom, no, this, she really
look like the granted, you know,

1731
01:46:33,271 --> 01:46:37,440
we never say no. No, no, she does. Cheryl
Tiegs she doesn't no, no, no. She looks,

1732
01:46:37,441 --> 01:46:41,110
she looks like she's a mass bill.
Yeah.

1733
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:46,350
Like she has most of all time. Jesus. All
right, I'm ready to go. Alright. Okay.

1734
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:50,940
I'm dying over here. Is done. Tapped out,
tapped out. This has been awesome. Thanks.

1735
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:54,870
I wish I had,
I wish I had had a clip to play.

1736
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:57,940
They would top everything I was
trying to, you know, get me a winter.

1737
01:46:58,020 --> 01:46:59,910
It tells this video.

1738
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:05,370
I'm actually pretty amazed at how not
phased you are by all of this. I mean,

1739
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:06,450
you have seen it all.

1740
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,920
I have seen it all. Trust me, I eat
mostly what I, when I see Albert behavior,

1741
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:15,660
I'm either sort of Zig
Wadley, you know, sort of,

1742
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:19,110
uh,
intrigued or I feel sad.

1743
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:22,050
Those are the two feelings I get are like,
like really?

1744
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:24,360
People do that and then I get sad

1745
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:27,990
cause I know how fucked up that you're
sad it, but you're also empathetic.

1746
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:33,600
Think we should go on strike
against, come uh, come stripe,

1747
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,713
keep going.

1748
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:42,480
I'm only going to swallow the calm of
a man or put on my by the come of a man

1749
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,570
who's willing to touch
it or kiss me afterward.

1750
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:49,520
She just felt like she's good for
her and she plays a little Chopin and

1751
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:54,300
Beethoven. Oh yeah. Yeah.
That we'll attach this calm.

1752
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:58,840
I won't either
bolts that.

1753
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:03,310
She's my favorite.
She's probably still was piano teachers.

1754
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:08,510
So it's a, it's extraordinary stuff people
put on line is that, that's our whole,

1755
01:48:08,511 --> 01:48:11,760
that's our whole show. But I mean
the stuff, the stuff they send you,

1756
01:48:11,761 --> 01:48:16,730
I'm impressed. I got to get Kathy when
in your, in your my radio partner in, in,

1757
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:18,330
in your world.
Let's do it.

1758
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,530
Cause he goes on the dark web and he's
a genius at finding horrible stuff. Oh,

1759
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:24,440
please hook us up. Please
look us up. Okay. Yeah.

1760
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:29,250
I have to just constantly
erases his texts. Just
fucking, let's do a group text.

1761
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,840
One last thing,
just as a societal question.

1762
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:37,530
You're a smart guy and you seem to
analyze stuff and where it's all going.

1763
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:41,970
I do feel like this lack of shame that
we're now experiencing in our culture,

1764
01:48:41,971 --> 01:48:44,580
like people posting, come
strike videos, et cetera.

1765
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:48,840
There used to be an element of like,
hey, this is private versus public. Oh,

1766
01:48:48,841 --> 01:48:53,650
that's all gone. Right. What are the
consequences of that psychologically as I,

1767
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,290
uh,
society,

1768
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:59,880
I,
I'm less worried about the,

1769
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:05,230
the mechanism of this manifesting as much
as it is that people are running at it

1770
01:49:06,611 --> 01:49:10,330
and using it all the time. In other
words, they have no personal boundaries.

1771
01:49:10,331 --> 01:49:12,550
So this is the perfect place
for them to be boundless.

1772
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,850
It's not the technology's fault.
That's an internal phone.

1773
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:18,760
I didn't know what you guys are putting
on line, but I'm going to be looking,

1774
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:22,070
I'm imagining it's not going
to be this kind of stuff. Yeah.

1775
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,440
Hoping Tom Left. No. Okay.

1776
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:30,760
Uh, and so it, it's, you know, we live in
a time with people who have been abused.

1777
01:49:30,761 --> 01:49:33,430
Their body boundaries have been violated.
They have no personal boundaries.

1778
01:49:33,431 --> 01:49:37,860
They've come from no fan, unstructured
family systems. And you know, that's,

1779
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:42,580
this is it. And shame is shame
is the sort of, either they're,

1780
01:49:42,581 --> 01:49:45,310
they're overcome by shame or
they're totally avoidant of shame.

1781
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,530
Those are sort of the two
versions we have today.

1782
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:51,840
And avoidant shame avoidance are
narcissists assess exactly shame of,

1783
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,100
Oh yeah, there's this refuse to
feel ashamed of anything. Yeah.

1784
01:49:57,101 --> 01:50:01,150
There's a real famous guy right now
when you get to see him every day. No,

1785
01:50:01,151 --> 01:50:04,170
but you know, really was like,
that was Clinton. Oh yeah.

1786
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:09,190
He was very slippery with shame.
Right. And we're just be, you know,

1787
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:11,700
be these horrible,
shameful things. It just

1788
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,470
depends what it is in super narcissists,

1789
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:22,500
Uber narcissist and that I'm surprised
that has not come crashing down more.

1790
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:25,860
Yeah. So that's like, there's a push for
it. More like it's coming now. It's, it's,

1791
01:50:25,861 --> 01:50:27,980
it's starting to comment
and it's been the,

1792
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:33,190
I always thought that was
the most extraordinary
exploitation of an underlying,

1793
01:50:33,221 --> 01:50:36,070
you know, just extraordinary
in a, in a place of business.

1794
01:50:36,071 --> 01:50:39,640
Can you imagine that the person in the
highest level of authority take advantage

1795
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:42,670
of the person at the lowest
level? Hmm. Yeah. That guy would,

1796
01:50:42,671 --> 01:50:44,560
that CEO would go to jail,
right?

1797
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:49,060
Not only be in a civil problem and if
his wife came out and then tried to abuse

1798
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:53,280
the intern, she'd be in trouble
too. It's like, yes, I get it.

1799
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:55,920
It's just not okay. But I guess, yeah,

1800
01:50:55,921 --> 01:50:57,880
because like we said at the
beginning to be a president,

1801
01:50:57,881 --> 01:51:01,360
you can't be all that healthy. Yeah,
for sure. Oh, it's for the record.

1802
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:04,540
Drew thought that the car
crusher video was funny,

1803
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:07,540
so that's just something off the record.
I muted both of your mics,

1804
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,670
muted both of your mics. Yes, he did.
Yes, he did. This is Tom signing off.

1805
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:16,240
You said it was funny.
I said there's a funny Pete.

1806
01:51:16,241 --> 01:51:20,590
Part of it is stuff I that for the
three stooges to be very funny,

1807
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,840
if it were in the context of fiction,

1808
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:25,510
a lot of people have sat there
and said it was funny. By the way,

1809
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:27,280
I understand why.
I understand why,

1810
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:30,820
but I know the reality is people are
psychotic, right? No, no, no, no.

1811
01:51:30,821 --> 01:51:33,860
I could see why somebody would say,
that's funny. Let's put it this way.

1812
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:38,020
First of all, they were not female. They
were all male, which for sure, right?

1813
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:42,230
Maybe we should. We find violence
funny women. It's all w you know,

1814
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,190
three stooges humor,
because they're dumber.

1815
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:47,410
Why is the defining line between men and
women is three students. Humor stupid.

1816
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,280
Why women just looks at it.

1817
01:51:48,281 --> 01:51:51,730
It's cause it's stupid because we
create life and you guys destroy it.

1818
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,590
When you're a mother and you make life.

1819
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:57,250
The thought is is pretty
much we don't kill.

1820
01:51:57,251 --> 01:52:00,220
We just destroy her name or
different name. Yeah, it's my child.

1821
01:52:00,221 --> 01:52:04,310
I think we'll wait to, your son gets
older. Oh God. Oh my God. You'll see it.

1822
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:09,040
You will see it. The destructive nature.
Oh wait, your kid turns 40 I can't wait.

1823
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:10,300
I want to be here to
do a podcast with you.

1824
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:15,130
You'll think it's great coming back
to come back. Yeah, let's schedule it.

1825
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:18,050
Let's schedule it. All right. All
right. All right. Thank you so much.

1826
01:52:18,051 --> 01:52:19,660
I'll talk to you later.
Thank you.

1827
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:25,170
Do you know what that is?
But those are

1828
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,250
the song made a busy stores love you to

1829
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:37,403
everybody.

1830
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,273
There you go.

1831
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:33,030
I love you.
