Most of Alta Loma sock.
No hard man.

110
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,480
Why did she take a fucking aboriginal
Blaine to people listening?

111
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,130
What's going on?

112
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:14,130
This lady looks like she's on one of
those Lotto Collin local segments and

113
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,160
flourishing and burn. And it sounds
like Norway. As she was talking,

114
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,320
she, uh, she vomited, stepped off
screen for a second, just came back.

115
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,740
And the, uh, translation on the page,

116
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,880
the closed captioning says that,

117
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,980
that she's saying I have very
painful menstruation. Right.

118
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,550
And that's why she can take a painkiller
for that. You don't need to feel it.

119
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,000
Does it ever, is it ever painful? So
painful. Yeah. You feel like vomiting?

120
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,860
Absolutely. Hammy. Wow. Wow.

I'm skipping it. Look, I
skipped it for you. God.

123
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,750
I'm the best LMS show to piggy back.

124
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,220
Yes.
Tables had my sock.

125
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,260

127
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,900
Sharon, can you got guys
working off? It was odd to me.

128
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,053
So

129
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,260
they provide the right hit the town.

130
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,840
She's a pro though, isn't it? Yeah.
I mean she came back like, hey,

131
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,520
back at it. There was so much vomit to,
yeah, I didn't even like see how much.

132
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:39,480
Thank you. Hmm. I don't know why you
didn't watch. You haven't done that shit.

133
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,470
Like on the road,

134
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,740
the gripe had a fever of like 102 and
performed or like violent diarrhea and

135
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:50,250
then they call your name no sick.
One time I went to,

136
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,290
um, my doctor, our doctor, Doctor Dick,
who people know from my stand up. Yeah,

137
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,530
I was so sick. And he, he,
he looks, you know, doctors,

138
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,260
when you go with a cold, the check out
your notes, check out your ears, he goes,

139
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:07,490
woof, you got an ear infection
bad and your left ear when I go,

140
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,710
so what do I, what can I do? I have a Gig.

141
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,150
I still remember I was playing in
Indianapolis to Planar sometimes cause you

142
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,980
can't, you can't go. And I go, I gotta go.

143
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,640
Cause I used to have the mentality that
like, yeah, your health doesn't matter.

144
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,020
Yeah, you go right. Your show is number
one. And he's like, well I want, he goes,

145
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm putting in the file that I told
you not to travel. And I go, okay,

146
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,230
I'm going. I go, is there anything
I can do? He goes, well, yeah.

147
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,610
Um,
so in your left ear,

148
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,090
so if you get a left window seat,
um,

149
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,130
when your eardrum ruptures,
it'll go all over the window.

150
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,320
You could do that. I got it. Thanks.

151
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,620
[inaudible] you asked me
what you could do. Yeah.

152
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,780
And then he gave me a steroid
shot, you know, it helped. It was,

153
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,500
now he put that in my head,
the rupturing and that whole flight,

154
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,960
it felt like it was building
right to the end of, yeah,

155
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,490
I could feel the pressure growing.
And I was like, ah, ah, ah. You know,

156
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:14,470
and then I mean I performed that week.
I couldn't hear, I couldn't hear myself.

157
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,230
I couldn't hear it through
the monitors and the speakers.

158
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,490
I remember I did radio and
when I left radio I got up.

159
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,750
Somebody else sat there for a segment and
he goes, uh, hey, is your hearing okay?

160
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,790
And I go, why? He goes, these headphones
are so fucking loud. And I go,

161
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,340
I can't hear shit right now.
It was

162
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,820
the word. Remember that weekend
I remember telling you not to go.

163
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,750
But that was also the,

164
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,550
that was also the time
where I thought if I don't,

165
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,060
not only why like not work again,
but I also need this money. You know,

166
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,380
it didn't need it bad enough.
Right.

167
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,450
But it was like it would
have made a difference.

168
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,770
Yeah. That's a time in your career. You
don't realize you can just cancel it.

169
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,370
Staff if you have to. You have
your second, you're dying.

170
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,370
I actually had to cancel one thing.
I did have a legitimate illness.

171
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:04,050
Remember a booker doubted my how
sick you were and I was like, Bro,

172
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,950
trust me. You don't, you don't
light heartedly cancel a week. Like

173
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,820
there was that flight. I puked
on the whole, the whole flight.

174
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,810
And then I spent the night there puking
and then flew back and then they gave me

175
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,070
like,
so what

176
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,560
going on, right? Yeah. Do you think,
yeah. Like look at my track record.

177
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,130
Do you think that the kind of
person that I just go like,

178
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,400
well that's why we're so reluctant to
cancel because these assholes do go like,

179
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:32,120
yeah, oh, come on man. Are
you really bleeding out of
your ass or what's happening?

180
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,750
I don't think so. You can still perform.
Come on. Monkey dance. And you're like,

181
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:40,460
no bro. Yeah, I know. Hey,
I remember the guy was like,

182
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:44,380
you cancel on me last second. I
got, I'm throwing up and shitting.

183
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:47,630
I'm on both ends. Yeah.
Puked that. Sure. Flight.

184
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,730
I've gotten sick in a Boca Raton. I did
the New York City Comedy Club. It used,

185
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,390
it's no longer there. Uh, it was a
front for something else, I'm sure.

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,600
And I had a fever of 102 and a flu and
I was like shaking and performing for a

187
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:05,690
bunch of blue hairs and I was so horrible.

188
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,210
What I do it like I
should've just stayed home.

189
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:12,480
I don't even know if I got there
and I was sick or what, but oh,

190
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,850
that's the worst man. You
can't even remember. You don't,
I'll never do that again.

191
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,920
So now, um, we have a blue band on Mike.

192
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,920
Just a little, uh, introduction
to some people listening.

193
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,880
Uh, I was always fascinated by the Jewish
people. They seem to be everywhere.

194
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,790
They have a lot of power
and influence in this world.

195
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,450
Although lighter skin shoes like to claim
to be white when it's convenient for

196
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:37,850
them. Jews and whites are
in fact very different.

197
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,970
Would it be known that blue band put
this file in our folder for this show?

198
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,520
This is the, this is the girl who
got kicked off of Youtube. Yeah.

199
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,980
For Making Hitler wasn't that bad.

200
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,360
Yeah. So this guy re uploaded
on it. Something from
somebody else. Yeah. Oh good.

201
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,290
Well let's learn more about it.

202
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,810
109 countries throughout history,

203
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,890
so they have picked up on all kinds
of various genes. In this video,

204
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:09,820
I'm going to teach you guys how to
properly identify who is of Jewish descent

205
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,370
because Jews particularly are so mixed.

206
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:15,730
It can be very difficult to
identify who exactly is a Jew.

207
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,490
I like the little girl

208
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,210
she is. That makes it extra
sweet the way she does it.

209
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,040
Do you think Ari Shaffir ears?

210
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Aries is so fucking on point with Gigi.

211
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,080
I know all of these guys look like Ari.

212
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,670
Here's how saying here's how
Jewish looking Ari is. Yeah.

213
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,350
I could tell somebody, hey, meet
me at the staple center. Right.

214
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,380
Um,
but first meet,

215
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,020
I want you to get Ari and bring them
down to our seat. Right. You know,

216
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,470
they're like, who's that? I'd be like,
he looks real Jewish and they'd be like,

217
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:54,190
come on. And then they would walk up the
Ra and be like, I found them the course.

218
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:57,820
He's an exemplary ju. Yeah.
Not under the radar at all.

219
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,000
So it's just so exciting because now this
opens up Jew jokes in a whole new way

220
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:08,710
for us. Yeah, sure. I feel like we
couldn't really go far now. Yeah.

221
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:14,280
Yeah. This is a well, can we see how a
new identified you? I'm sorry. Sorry. Um,

222
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,850
she, uh, so anyways, this girl
has been kicked off of tragically,

223
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,790
tragically kicked out. Hmm. Let's see.

224
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,890
More Jewish. Glad somebody has, the
easier it is to spot them to successfully,

225
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,070
you have to examine all
of their facial features.

226
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,960
You have to look at their facial shape,
eyes, mouth, and listen to their voice.

227
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,410
People with Jewish glad always
have more than one Jewish feature.

228
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,610
I personally look for three
or more features to the
side. If somebody is Jewish,

229
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:41,960
three or

230
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,320
more. Um, one thing Jews. Oh,

231
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,470
nearly all Jews have naturally
curly and coarse hair.

232
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,590
This is due to being in a mixed with
negroid blood. No boy, more Jewish jeans.

233
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,970
The darker there. Harris Jewish men
tend to have chorus beards. You know,

234
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:59,540
we're about to find out.
We both have a,

235
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,640
what I call Ju Ju rumors.
Tumors in our family.

236
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,880
Yes.
We may have a Jewish blood.

237
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:10,130
So we did the DNA testing 23 and me,

238
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,030
it takes like six to eight weeks and
we're gonna find out 40 parties. Yes.

239
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,720
We both have juniors in our, do you
really have a tumor? Yeah, absolutely.

240
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,900
From the code of the Spanish descent
that there's, um, no Spanish too. Yes.

241
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,760
All right. God Sephardic, sorry guys.
I know my juice. Hello? Whatever. Um,

242
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,250
there's the other type
of Joe Has Siddiq nope.

243
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,250
Tom Ashkin. Ari. Oh,

244
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,740
she figured that would be your fucking
line right there. Yeah. That is a shift.

245
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:44,150
Or you're a Jew. Yeah. Um, my
mother thought she was a Jew,

246
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,710
so we'll see. Okay. Um, this is uh,

247
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,430
quite the video.
Yeah,

248
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,840
I think I'm pretty, yeah,
pretty full on it actually.

249
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,420
She has, she, she's like, I
personally like to go with three. Wow.

250
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,700
Oh really hate the Jews. It's so weird.
Yeah. There's a few that aren't too fun.

251
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,730
I never understood this one.
Uh, me too man. The other races,

252
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:12,790
it's so easy to process. Oops. But the,

253
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,410
what are the Jews? The don't do anything
except to be successful in proximately.

254
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,330
All Jews have naturally
curly and coarse hair.

255
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,840
She's going to read now what I just read.
I mean every other group that you spot,

256
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:32,640
you spot the hair. Yeah.
Oh my God. A classic ways.

257
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,540
Looking at the nose. This is so racist.
It's really that and look at her.

258
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,220
I liked the drawings and that
drawing looks like Ari. Yes.

259
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:46,221
One thing that kind of sweaty and
greasy cause like ori eyebrows arch.

260
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,490
This is not happening.

261
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,560
We got a lot of stories.
That's really good.

262
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,530
Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Blue van, Betty
free. Dan, I didn't know she was a here.

263
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,630
So jeans, a lot to cover
today. Two genes. Genes.

264
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,230
What do you have for me? You have
something, there's a lot in our world.

265
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,190
Where do we begin?
I mean do you want to start off with,

266
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,260
let's just do some
personal news first of all.

267
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,680
So the other day you and I,
well this was actually last night,

268
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,000
I was in the bathroom.

269
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:34,540
You were in the baby's room and we
both burped at the same time. Yeah.

270
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,490
That was really weird.

271
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,890
And different rooms and profit
and it just kept together. Yeah.

272
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,890
And I, and I asked you, I go,
what time, what does that call,

273
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:48,000
cause you famously named the double
pipe classic. Yeah, that's true.

274
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,400
And I know people give you credit
for that. I appreciate you.

275
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:54,710
I appreciate you for
saying that. Yeah. When,

276
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,820
so lovebirds burp or fart in different
rooms without seeing each other.

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,250
It's called synergy
synergy.

278
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,610
I feel like that is what we have.
I mean mine,

279
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,570
I was just walking out
of that room and then I

280
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,660
write yours at the same time and
we fired it at the same time too.

281
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,840
Unprovoked.

282
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,860
That's cause you have to be really
connected to somebody for that to happen.

283
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,010
It's like when you pick up the phone to
call someone and they're on the line,

284
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,200
you're like, what are you doing?
And they're like, I just fired it.

285
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:32,040
I thought about you. Yeah.
So synergy now synergy.

286
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:36,510
Neat wine is interesting too.
It led to yesterday. You,

287
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,420
I've never, I could, I thought
this was a magic trick.

288
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,230
You smelled my beard and you
nailed what I had for lunch.

289
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,020
But I mean to a t,
right?

290
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,260
So we both have our talents,
Tom. Yeah, but my beard,

291
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,330
so my beard normally just
smells like farts. Right?

292
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,070
Like whenever I eat something that
smells like garbage parts but,

293
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,570
but so garbage and fire,

294
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:05,830
it says accurate. Yeah, I came home.

295
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,220
But right now it's a little more trim
when the, the bigger it gets, the more,

296
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:13,310
obviously it's, it's really, uh,
traps, the traps things. Yeah.

297
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,350
So I think you go to kiss me or
something and you go, you hold my face.

298
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:20,710
You're like, you had at
first I go, that's a guest.

299
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,970
And you start listing the details.
You got, yeah, you had garlic chicken,

300
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,130
you had onions, you had
rice, black beans. I'm like,

301
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:34,870
what? And then you go and you had
planned tans. What? You nailed it.

302
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,160
I know. I mean that's the exact meal
ahead. I know. We went to Versailles.

303
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,360
A Cuban place. Yeah. And you named
everything that I ate. Thank you.

304
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,040
The thing is is that I, you know, I don't
know if I can do a blind smell. Yeah.

305
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,390
But if you give me an area, cuisine,
I can tell you which items you ate.

306
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,200
Uh, just off the smells.
It's unbelievable. Yeah.
The smells. Usually this,

307
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,380
the strongest ones are
right around your mouth.

308
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:02,800
You tend not to wipe that clean enough.
No,

309
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,860
I'm serious and I can really smell
what you ate. What do you mean?

310
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:10,170
I tend not to wipe out really clean.
You're not like a hygienic. What?

311
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:13,900
The person that's so wrong and misleading.
You're a liar.

312
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,060
I'm not hygienic. Not really. What
your beard always smells. That's life.

313
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,870
My beard smells like life.
It doesn't smell. I like,

314
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,150
I am hygenic that smells like go ma.

315
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,830
Meaning that he would say that it's
not true anyways. They're not anyways.

316
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,210
I am hygienic. Not really. Like, what
do you mean always in your beard?

317
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,050
Is there a product we could buy
that would get the food smells?

318
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,630
I think I can take a shit on your
fucking face while you're sleeping.

319
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,000
I think it's called soap. If you used soap
on that beard, you're such a liar. Oh,

320
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:50,620
by the way, I'd like to thank
you. I didn't get a chance
to, but thank you so much.

321
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,130
Uh,

322
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,750
you left a like a poop smear as a
bottom of the ball this morning.

323
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,200
Yeah.

324
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,280
And it was a nice surprise when I went
to go pee to look down and there was like

325
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,350
a layer of fresh shit.
Do you think that was,

326
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,930
what was that from,
do you think?

327
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,440
I think it's from your turn and
you didn't flush. You just left.

328
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,490
You left like the poop cart drove
through and left streak. Yeah.

329
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,150
Well that happens a lot.
It was heavy. That happens.

330
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,113
Okay.

331
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,610
Yeah. Hey, this is another clip.

332
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,460
I'll say different things to different
cause a different clip board. If it's,

333
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,730
that was not the same clip.

334
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,550
Uh,
that was fun.

335
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,030
That was fun. I enjoyed that. Very,

336
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,400
you know what made me laugh hard this
weekend is when you came in the room.

337
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,880
Yeah, you're right. I think
it's time to admit it.

338
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,670
You Go,
I have IBS.

339
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,620
Do you really? Yeah, it's been 10 years.

340
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:23,360
I've been telling you that something's
wrong, something's wrong. And you're like,

341
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,790
it's an, everyone has diarrhea
all day, every day. I'm
like, no, something's wrong.

342
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:33,380
It's in your act. It's in your fucking
act about how you shit. And I'm like,

343
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:36,790
do you need to go to the hospital?
That's real. Right. So what,

344
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,750
what's the tipping point
for you that you find

345
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,240
somebody else talking about it and they
were like, yeah, you know, if I eat that,

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,010
you know,
I'm going to just shit.

347
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,760
It's going to be pretty immediate.
And you know, I have IBS.

348
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,260
That's how I think every day. If I eat
that, I'm going to shit everywhere.

349
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,520
So magic three, three
syllables, three letters.

350
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,880
Yeah, I'm, so then I started to do some
research and I was like, I got this.

351
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,350
And then I started to Google treatments
and we started to read the things you

352
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:15,670
should eliminate and you go,
you eat all those things.

353
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,630
It was like chocolate, caffeine,
artificial sweeteners, carbonated drinks,

354
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,650
fried food, like everything that
was on there, I'd be like, yeah,

355
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:32,160
that's an Asus rotate.
Every day you wake up,

356
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:36,030
the first thing you do is throw some
sweetener and some coffee and then it's

357
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,220
sugar parade and then it's crap.

358
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,630
And then it's so does [inaudible]
all day long. Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup.

359
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,230
Any other buddy?
So are you going to go to Doctor Dick?

360
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,480
Doctor Dick? Yeah. Maybe I'm going to,

361
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm going to go to this
food specialist that he,

362
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,260
food allergists person
that he recommended.

363
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,790
You're going to start,
they're going to start this.

364
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,770
I read somewhere that there's two blood
tests you can take that will determine

365
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:06,010
if you have IBS and then
we can medicate you.

366
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:10,300
Or maybe you could just not eat sugar
and caffeine all day every day, you know?

367
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,860
And there's that option.

368
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,770
Yeah, I mean the thing about
me is I always, I'm alert.

369
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,090
I would say I'm a quick learner

370
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,190
and something happens to me.
Not at all.

371
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,300
6,000 Times I'll pick up on
that, you know, and I'll be like,

372
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,020
I'm going to do something about
that. So that's, I finally,

373
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,390
I figured it out way
faster than most people.

374
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,450
Yeah, you're not, you know, you're
not big on cause and effect.

375
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,160
So now we know I'm not big on
hygiene and not big cause and effect.

376
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,290
It takes a while. Got It, got it.

377
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,250
So that was kind of neat that you finally
admitted to having a stool problem.

378
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,670
Yeah. Now when you, you said that
there's red in the bowl too, right?

379
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:58,050
Is there a red,
there's red.

380
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,150
How often? How often is there red? There
should be no red. Sometimes there's red,

381
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,100
like a not looking again
for me once fool me once.

382
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,360
Shame. Oh, not everybody for
me twice. I'm not doing it yet.

383
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,460
Okay. So No, I'm not, I'm not
even going to look over there.

384
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:21,420
I'm going to look at the people at home.
Watching people at home was,

385
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,530
there we go. Um, I'm not looking.
I know what you fucking frozen.

386
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,040
I didn't freeze it on anything.
Yes you did.

387
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,160
I can see in my peripheral vision
cause I've perfect peripheral vision is

388
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,820
probably on her barfing and I know that
it's not. Yes it is. No, it isn't lying.

389
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:40,170
I know you're lying because
you're laughing. You're
like blind person right now.

390
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,850
They're like
play the piano.

391
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,590
Okay. Can you please come back
to the show? I am on the show.

392
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,880
You can take away the still of her
barfing and then I'll return to the shell.

393
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,680
Not Looking. All right. Do you see how I

394
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,310
got you? I got it. Yeah. Are we done? Yes.

395
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,883
Yes.

396
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,740
May I bring up another item?
Another one of your

397
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,490
movements is,
um,

398
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,490
I like these notes that
I keep on our lives.

399
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,630
So I think we should play a game where
I smell your beard and guess what you've

400
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:28,050
eaten today. That should be a segment
on the show. I was thinking about that.

401
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:32,820
Maybe he's pretty good and you can try
to trick me. We took a shower again,

402
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:36,550
so we resumed our marital
shower takings together.

403
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,410
So horrible.
And you had boogers

404
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,870
hygienic,
everything that day.

405
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,670
Anyways,
we were in the shower briefly this time.

406
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:06,810
I don't make the same mistake of
showering with you the whole time.

407
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:11,370
So I was getting out and you came in
just as I was about to leave and I am

408
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:16,371
standing there and I smell what smells
like somebody just dumped an entire

409
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,480
container of coffee in the shower like
somebody took, I don't know what that is.

410
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,630
Correct.
And just it's so pungent,

411
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:32,631
like black coffee and I looked
down and your p is like Brown.

412
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,140
It's so thick.

413
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,030
Like do you think you could
drink water today, dad?

414
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,260
I mean you complain about dog,
but it smelled so strong.

415
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:47,290
You said that. First of all, I've
always been a big water drinker.

416
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,190
Oh Book Shit I have. I've always your
water now it's right behind you. Shit.

417
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,390
That's my one or liar.

418
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,750
I've always been a big water
drinker for from the day we met.

419
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,450
I've been somebody that has a bottle
of water on them all the time.

420
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,900
And since that day I thought about it
and I've been balancing water to coffee

421
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:08,590
more. You really need to. I
have been. That's my point.

422
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,190
Smelled exactly like fresh brewed coffee.

423
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,150
We should measure who drinks more
water in a day. I, I do in a second.

424
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,110
I think it's me more than two
to one. No, absolutely not.

425
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,820
I hydrate so much more.
Okay.

426
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,680
That doesn't mean anything
because I'm prepared for the show.

427
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:29,830
I knew I got it just means you have one
right now. Hour and a half of water.

428
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,600
I dehydrated and I hydrate. Same. Oh
my things, Lee, Bro. That's what I do.

429
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,230
Wow. That's what I do. You're going
to lie like that. That's the truth.

430
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,790
That's not the truth is the truth.

431
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,530
I drink more water than you and then I
got a backup water that I keep here just

432
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:47,890
in case the primary is not there.
Don't even drink water.

433
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,270
You don't even drink water.
Get your life compared to me.

434
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,620
You better get your life liar. You
don't drink water. Seriously. Wow.

435
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,770
That's how little you drank.
Okay. All right. We'll see.

436
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,090
Why don't we do a water
challenge? I'll fucking challenge
you right now, Bro. Okay?

437
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,770
Okay. Let's do this. You'll see how
much of your water hell to the, no,

438
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,130
seriously. Why don't you
love her? You want to,

439
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:15,820
why don't you get your own Goddamn fucking
bring one. So drink my old ass water.

440
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:19,570
He may get their fresh fresh one. Know
your why. Smells are all over. I like,

441
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:24,130
I've even wash your beard since yesterday.
Since you ate Versailles, please God,

442
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,520
give me the old one.
I don't trustee you steal it from me

443
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,840
now I have more.
You're the worst.

444
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,150
Stop it.

445
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,260
You're the baby.

446
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,300
No. What am I going to do for the
whole show? Have plenty of water.

447
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:47,780
You got water in your hands.
Me. That's not enough shit head.

448
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,713
You're the worst.

449
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,230
Hope your IBS gets even
crazier shit in your own beard.

450
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,793
So great.

451
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,070
I had a really interesting
question I wanted to ask too.

452
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,550
I never know what it is
with you. Go ahead. Okay.

453
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,760
I remember a long time ago,
first of all,

454
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:23,090
we haven't even played the song to let
people know that we're talking about

455
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:28,070
Brown. It's kind of, it's
a little late for that. Why
don't we save that one? Okay.

456
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,590
But I have a really important question I
needed to pay attention to me right now.

457
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,933
Really important.

458
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,960
So remember when I asked a long time ago,

459
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,210
where's this going?

460
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,180
How is it?
How come?

461
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:49,181
Sometimes you make yellow and then you
make brown and then there's more yellow

462
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,230
like yellow road.
Yeah,

463
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,940
I remember, but okay.
And then remember, okay,

464
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:06,020
then why is it like you can be full, like
your stomach feels full. It give either

465
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,470
you take your shit, right? Like
let's say you take like a hardy shit,

466
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:16,280
like a hot hardy one and
then you're hungry again.

467
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,040
Like how does that, that's
the question. How does this,

468
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,810
because what's in the condos?
There were some like,

469
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,060
do you think they come out faster?
No. Lynn, how are you hungry again?

470
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,180
Probably because if you take that
big hardy shit that you talked about,

471
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,440
right? One that meant that your
intestines were removing, right? Right.

472
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,240
So if you take that big shit,
maybe they get a little more activated.

473
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:44,530
Juices start flowing,

474
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,660
which kind of sends a signal to your
body that the digestive track is going.

475
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,220
Therefore, maybe what's in your stomach
is starting to move down and then, hey,

476
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:58,570
since this is moving, let's get
some more food in here. Okay,

477
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:03,320
so you're saying that the biggest
digestive signals to your, to your brain,

478
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,220
maybe your body's like you just lost
a lot of food or eat more now. Yeah,

479
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,180
maybe that's an interesting
theory, Dr Oz. Yeah,

480
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,700
but it was a really scientific questions.
Yeah.

481
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,080
You know how you make Brown and the yellow
and then there's more yellow and then

482
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,950
you know how when you take a stinky
hardy shit, then you got to eat.

483
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,610
But doesn't that happen to you a
lot or you eat and then, I mean,

484
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:30,640
I mean I do feel like sometimes I'm about
to eat and like I got to shit and then

485
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,720
I go shit. And then eating as much
more satisfying. It's the same thing.

486
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:35,830
It's not the same thing.

487
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,270
What I'm saying is sometimes you'll feel
like full and then I'll take a shit and

488
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:44,170
then I'll be like, dude, how did I just
get hungry again? Like I just ate? Yeah.

489
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,450
You know, that's one of
life's great mysteries. I,

490
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,050
the good thing is you put it
out there too, a lot of people,

491
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,350
so I'm sure we'll get some
really interesting answers. Okay.

492
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,690
The good thing is someone's job here
to go through those emails. Now, um,

493
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,830
you have an email or excuse me, a
voicemail that we should, oh my God,

494
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,090
this came in as we were preparing to do
this show is breaking news late breaking,

495
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,290
uh, [inaudible] a
friend, the Persian lady.

496
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:15,520
We call her guys please or
have, uh, our Farsi listeners.

497
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,440
If you could really pay
attention to this one for us,

498
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:22,410
it is the most aggressively
worried, one in 30 voicemails. Um,

499
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,460
here's what sound the Ma
is listening to right now.

500
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,730
I just tell on my main blog at Denny's,

So cons of this somewhere.

510
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,410
Got It.
I think there was a,

511
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:17,411
there's a lawsuit because of a bad
breakfast at Denny's or like you said,

512
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:21,230
like take like a grand slam didn't
come out yet. I'm supposed to.

513
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,180
Yeah I heard that too. Cause she goes,
if I can, Danny's mother fucker right

514
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,510
on my main blog at Denny's mud.

515
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,770
No, no, no. She said I got a blow job.

516
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,720
Yeah I do. Oh, a hanger steak.

517
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,600
I didn't tell him my in blog and Dennis

518
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,190
right course of bars. Oh my God. Am I
taking the balls? Oh my God. On my mind.

519
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,130
I mean

520
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,233
the wall,

521
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,873
dude.

522
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,150
That's it.
And this way to go back and forth on that,

523
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,750
the plot thickens and I mean I'm kind of
glad that day we didn't get to talk to

524
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,160
her and it just went to Miami
on the outer voicemail. Yeah.

525
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,500
Cause we can't put a stop to this.
Unreal man. This is crazy. It's getting,

526
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,570
the stakes are getting even higher.
Okay.

527
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,550
Someone needs to translate
that immediately.

528
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:15,430
We find out what [inaudible] is doing.
Yeah.

529
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,520
Oh Wow. Awesome. Interesting.
In my cell phone news.

530
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,660
I got another, um, you
know, sexting offer.

531
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,160
It says hi. How are you?
I just got back in town,

532
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,850
just looking to hang smiley face.
This is from Nate.

533
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,050
I remember a while back. Yeah. It
was like, Hey, what are you doing?

534
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,250
So let's see. I mean, I haven't answered
him and he's still persistent. Nate.

535
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,400
I never took up on his offer last time.

536
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,110
Hey. Um, you know that a bird is so
fat stuff really took off. You know,

537
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,140
I know he's been just getting bombarded
hammers and then I got some audio.

538
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,600
Uh, he's his shows back. It's coming
back. Bird the conqueror. Yeah.

539
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,960
So He's been doing
radio, um, and you know,

540
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:07,500
just call in and like promoting the show.
And it's a great show.

541
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:12,240
So it makes sure you record,
it's on travel channel
called a birth the conqueror.

542
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,780
And he does like adventurous stuff.
Guys. This who were fat guy. Shit.

543
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,370
So here's him on a,
I think radio maybe today.

544
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,013
Bert,

545
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,280
what's up? What's up
with you? Oh, I'm fat.

546
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,390
That's what you had to ask you.
Bird. Chrysler. Why are you so far?

547
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,480
Dude, I'm getting fat. Shamed beyond
belief. Why? What did you ever do?

548
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,570
You know what you guys know? She
does know Tom's a girl, right? Yes.

549
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,360
And Tom just as a joke said to somebody,
uh,

550
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,570
they was doing one of those morning
TV shows and he was like, Hey,

551
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:52,060
do me a favor in the middle.
Ask why Burt Chrysler's fat.

552
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,930
And the woman messed up my name and said,
why is bird Chrysler so fat?

553
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,420
And Tom just said some answer, but it
just went viral. And literally, I mean,

554
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,800
I get a hundred tweets a day. Same Burt,
why are you so fat? No, really Burt,

555
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,200
I have a lot of questions. Why
are you so bad? And it's so,

556
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,240
this is what the problem with fat shaming
is, is that when it's true, it hurts.

557
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,070
I mean, you should see
my Wikipedia page. He is,

558
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,050
he has taken it upon himself to just I,
and he find,

559
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,650
he called me up the other day and
he's just giggling. He's like,

560
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,750
have you seen what they did?
Their Wikipedia page? It
is, it is literally a page.

561
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,200
It says, I died. She says,
I'm allergic to giraffes,

562
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:39,020
that I enjoyed digging holes
that I'm uh, related to, uh,

563
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,210
the Lee Iacocca Chrysler people. And then
I changed my name because I was so fat.

564
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,361
It's got to stop.

565
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:47,980
And so now we have to start thinking of
something to come up with four Secura.

566
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,900
See the problem is that that's like,
that's like threatening to burn the devil.

567
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,880
He doesn't care. He loves
it. He loves it. He loves it.

568
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,490
He enjoys it so much. He kept laughing.
He goes here, but it isn't real. I go,

569
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,240
the problem was all of it is he
is 10 times fatter than I am.

570
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,460
He is borderline obese.
Like not even joking.

571
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,700
If you saw both of us naked, you wouldn't
for a second say, oh, it's a tie.

572
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,540
You'd be like, well Tom Ziglar has
got them by, by at least 40 pounds.

573
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,400
Does he have,
does he like his beard?

574
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:21,930
Like is he proud of his
beard and said this shit?

575
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,400
Well,
let me tell you something.

576
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,710
He didn't have a beard until
he saw me and I had a beard.

577
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,610
You got the beard idea for me to do.
You look so fat. I was like, dude,

578
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:34,220
you cover it up. If you don't have a
beard, it looks like your Chin as balls.

579
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,760
You've got to grow a
beard and cover that up.

580
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,530
Birds such a liar.
He had a beard before birth horse,

581
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,630
way fatter than you buy them. And
he's, the fat is comic working today

582
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,440
by the way. It didn't just go
viral. It went mommy. Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:57,800
I think he was BTW it went up.
They went m o m m

584
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,190
hello Bernd Chrysler,

585
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,130
the Wikipedia thing.
That is just hilarious.

586
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,950
I don't know who got it
into them to do that,

587
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:16,450
but it is so fucking
outrageous. Um, and find it.

588
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,690
He thought that, that we, I go,
we didn't ask people to do that.

589
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,880
People just did that. No, we don't. We
don't really encourage that either. Uh,

590
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,140
changing somebodies Wikipedia page.
No, no, no, no. Not at all. I mean,

591
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,980
we'll see if it's still, it's still
right now. Okay. It says he was born in

592
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,200
[inaudible] 78 in Cheyenne,
Wyoming,

593
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,860
and then he died today
in the coastal waters.

594
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:44,360
Off of France,
possibly from AIDS.

595
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,940
Okay.

596
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,860
He was born in Wyoming. As a kid, he
would dig out, dig for hours, each tray,

597
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,450
each day, the trial, the other side of the
world. Sometimes you only food. He would,

598
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,710
he would eat for the day.
We'll be worms from the ground.

599
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,530
He eventually gave up after a water spout,
the,

600
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,370
that dug up knock crusher out briefly.
Uh,

601
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,970
he has an addiction as a kid of biting
hair off his uncle's beer with his teeth

602
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:08,804
for hours,

603
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,130
which was cured when his uncle punch
Burton the job for two hours straight. Uh,

604
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,320
she wanted his crisis.

605
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:18,260
His mother wanted bird to create
clothes for Jurassic and adult.

606
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,910
But vert was allergic to your ass.
I don't fuck it is so fucking silly.

607
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,250
Um, it's, oh yeah.

608
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:29,930
And then it says that on this
podcast that we talked about him, um,

609
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,670
about how the Chrysler Company,
uh, you know. Gotcha. Okay.

610
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,430
It's really, really funny.
Well, I'm glad that it's hit.

611
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,800
It's hit the mainstream media now.
It's a,

612
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:43,410
it's a real thing and it's
all because of my eyes.

613
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:48,340
Yeah, it really is. You guys really,
really, really got him. Uh, wait.

614
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:52,600
Actually it surprised me. I remember we
made the thing of the plea, we're like,

615
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,250
hit them up with a bunch of tweets today,

616
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:57,940
but it went so much further with
the Instagram, the Facebook,

617
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:02,140
and he said that on his Facebook page,
people will be like first fucking year.

618
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,130
Why are you so fat? And that people that
know him will be like, hey, that's rude.

619
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,170
And then they'll be like, hey, fuck you.

620
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,080
I just want to know why he's so fast.

621
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:22,960
Oh my God. Anyways, it is
probably the best entertainer,

622
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,430
sportsmen fat or the new since
the beginning for years. Years.

623
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:29,400
Brian Speer much fatter. Uh,
it's because of his belly.

624
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,710
It's very distended and bloated.

625
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,710
Like an alcoholic or somebody
pointed out he looks like,

626
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,980
like an African child like that.
Who else looks like that?

627
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,630
I remember from the boyfriend
on trailer park boys. Oh yeah.

628
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,060
Lay, lay. Lay. He's Randy.
Yeah. Late by my friend.

629
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:50,760
It's like if six Randy's
were tied together. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

630
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:55,410
Right. He's, he's a little fatter than
Randy, but yeah. That, that type of fat,

631
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,710
that's a booze. Fats, the
hard booze belly. Yeah. Right.

632
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,880
That's going to be harder for him to lose.
Right, right. Cause it's hardened. Yeah.

633
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,780
Visceral fat, visceral. That's the
heart attack fat, right? Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:10,130
It's what they call it. Fat. It's going
to get that anyway. No Fun. Bert. Um,

635
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,600
can we pause for women and I
need to go to the restroom. Okay.

636
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,810
You're going to shit or a p no,
I gotta fix my makeup because I cried.

637
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,580
You got a few announcements.
Oh, I bet. Yeah. Um,

638
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,460
that was really funny about
bird, by the way. When do you,

639
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,680
do you think he'll ever
actually lose weight? You'd
have to stop drinking, right?

640
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,980
Yeah. Yeah. That's not
going to happen. Um,

641
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,370
I want to make an announcement before
I forget the movie. I narrated.

642
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:39,900
Can we take a joke? Okay. Documentary.
The trailer is on iTunes today.

643
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,500
Uh, I just retweeted it
at Christina P on Twitter,

644
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,360
iTunes trailer.

645
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:49,730
It comes out a limited
release in movie theaters.

646
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,910

647
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:58,730
You guys can see it then. I'm so excited.
It's such a great documentary. Yeah.

648
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,710
I can't wait for you guys.
See it.

649
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,290
Did you think you have the
right not to be offended?

650
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,400
Either change your
parameters would offend you,

651
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,440
were raw or just realize you're wrong.

652
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,550
I've always refused to
apologize for a joke.

653
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,680
There's a lot of people out there whose
job it is to be offended for other

654
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,620
people.
It's almost like people have gotten soft.

655
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,763
Yes.

656
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Duty of a comedian to find out where
the line is drawn and deliberately cross

657
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:31,634
over.

658
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,110
Bye
Bye Dad.

659
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,380
Stage
no yard.

660
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,101
Easily offended.

661
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,580
Please don't come to a comedy show when
they start going through the comedians.

662
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:52,960
Everyone else needs to sweat.

663
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,890
This play was specifically designed
to offend everyone and then the I'm

664
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,750
offenders changes into
you're going to die.

665
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,140
They were calling me black Hitler
because it's the Jews weren't safe.

666
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,033
The blacks weren't safe.

667
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,530
Yeah.

668
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,880
Lenny Bruce, he was arrested for
what he said. I can't imagine that

669
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,620
there is that cool to have your show
with the cops or the side of the stage

670
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,360
beat that.
Anybody ever

671
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:30,370
free speech greenway important
because me being a Jew,

672
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,750
I don't want to have to pay for speakers

673
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:38,730
anyway. I narrated it.
Ted Balaguer directed it.

674
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,120
It's going to be out soon to go watch
it. That's awesome. I'm so excited.

675
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:44,220
It's such a timeline. I'm,
I'm excited to see it.

676
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:49,110
There's so much bullshit going on.
Comedians or apologizing for jokes.

677
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:53,820
It's so horrible. So
horrible. Yeah. It's um, oh,

678
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:54,750
we should, uh, by the way,

679
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:59,751
we should plug the fact that
on our youtube page every
Thursday we have classic

680
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:07,860
jeans going. Oh, right. How
exciting. They're saying, oh yeah,

681
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,070
we should set the set up.

682
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:15,030
The fact that Dave don't
find art on the podcast.

683
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,570
It's so unprofessional.
We've traveled together.

684
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,120
Sweeney everybody. I apologize. Listeners,

685
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,120
apologize. That's the first part. Did
we record this in a submarine? Why is,

686
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:32,110
this just shows you how far the shows
come. This is what is a red band.

687
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,610
Oh, Mommy's in Burbank.
This is not his couch.

688
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,990
This is before we even moved it into
red bands studio on the back of,

689
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,880
he says is that first one,
right? Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah.

690
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:48,430
So you fired on the very first episode
of Wyoming? Yeah, episode one. Wow.

691
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,380
How neat that do you see how
that part is the main ones?

692
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:55,420
I like you porn and stuff have made it so
that, that they work now on the iPhone.

693
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,330
Yeah. And stuff like that. Just
started a jerk it last week too much.

694
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:04,240
My iPhone stuff. I know and don't look, I
know people are like, oh is she going to,

695
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,110
this is so like tame for our
level of discourse with each other

696
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,190
post quite all. And he'll be
like, I gotta take a shit.

697
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,750
And then that's the first one. Very first
episode. You, isn't that interesting?

698
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,280
It's, it's same shit. Different
toilet, you know. So we're at,

699
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:22,480
we're doing is with classic jeans
were going through the catalog. Yeah.

700
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,820
Every Thursday a new one comes up
cause they're all the originals.

701
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,900
I kinda know I want to see it,
but I don't because I'm embarrassed.

702
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,600
And then when it got, when it hits
episode 41, it'll be audio only,

703
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,070
but it will be up there,
you know.

704
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:41,040
So there's gotta be some episodes
with up to $40. I have missing videos.

705
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:41,883
You have missing video?

706
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,250
Yeah. To make you didn't do it. So. Wow.

707
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,120
Did we burp on that first one? I don't
know. I don't think so. I don't know.

708
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:52,900
We'll have to watch it just,
just far. Yeah. That is special.

709
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,280
That is pretty special
man. Um, oh wow. Wow.

710
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:00,640
Good to see where you kept it real,
Huh? From the very, from the jump.

711
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,230
No, I haven't seen this, but um,

712
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,670
it says there's queen ass
rapper. Who's that? Yeah.

713
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:09,990
That's not her legit name. But uh, shed.

714
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:14,180
I just did audio because the video we
probably shouldn't be playing. Okay.

715
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,360
You just found someone submitted it,
someone submitted as like,

716
00:49:17,361 --> 00:49:21,740
I think I found queen ass rapper. So
she makes, these are like self made. Um,

717
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,300
someone records it for her.

718
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,230
There's a weird porn guy that's
like prompt her and stuff.

719
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,440
Really interesting. Let's see what,
what was the, let's take a listen,

720
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,113
but I kind of,
yeah,

721
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,350
thank you for, it's all day.
They be coming out of my big old,

722
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,970
oh my gosh. More big,
hard boiled eggs today.

723
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,760
Oh, that'll do it. Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe that's a,

724
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:52,180
that's that's the lady for the king,
you know,

725
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,320
could be,
I don't think he wants to be set up.

726
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,020
I feel like he's just happy
living in him and his farts.

727
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,050
You have any cell in his food and
his Manet's yeah. This guy is,

728
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:05,884
you know,
he's not,

729
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,580
he's not,
oh,

730
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,590
there's so gassy. Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,000
She seems like so much sweeter than him.
So much sweeter. And he's not like, Ooh,

732
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,590
he's, whoa. You know what I want though?
And I know it exists. I need a woman.

733
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:27,230
Cause this sounds a little fetishy
like, oh, I can't believe. Yeah,

734
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,140
like phony. Like I want those stinky
farts I've been doing all day long.

735
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,850
Give me the girl that just does
it for the love of the game,

736
00:50:36,851 --> 00:50:41,290
the way the ass rapper does. See, I think
I should stop eating eggs for breakfast.

737
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:46,810
Like, no, no, no. I want someone that's
in it for the love of the FARC. Yeah,

738
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,990
that's good.
But better work is good little booty.

739
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,530
Yeah. You know when it's good. It's good.
Yeah, that's true. She's doing good work,

740
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,010
man. If we could see her, we could
at least identify if she was a Jew,

741
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:10,011
but let's move on to now we have
something alarming to talk about.

742
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,770
You're what? We're doing it. I just
had my, yeah, my stomach lurch.

743
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:20,070
Like I have something in the pit
of my stomach. It's nerve wracking.

744
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:21,720
So upset about it already.

745
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,260
So last week it was
obviously a huge episode.

746
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:31,750
Speaking of farts where somebody brought
into question the authenticity of this

747
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:35,060
isn't any part,
we ended up calling the hotel.

748
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,730
We went through this
whole ordeal with them.

749
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,820
Then we made an addendum that
we tacked onto the episode.

750
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,950
There's a video of it where we discuss
it and we break down in that moment that

751
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,420
we figured it out,

752
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,690
that we were in fact in eight oh eight
and we're so embarrassed are considered

753
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:57,620
not even doing what we're
about to do right now.

754
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,410
But we have to be honest with the Mommy's.
We can't, can't lie to them live a lie.

755
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,820
I know, I know. It is not about
lies. Talked about. We were like,

756
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,950
should we just let it go? And then
we decided no important Tom Board.

757
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,960
And we have too much respect for
you to make you believe that it's,

758
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,880
you know, okay to do this and it's
not. So we're going to tell you

759
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:26,560
right now, cancel your
reservations for Roommate Oh eight,

760
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,760
because the Cincinnati fart
happened in room six 18.

761
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,710
Oh my God,

762
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm so ashamed. I'm so
ashamed. I'm embarrassed. Look,

763
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,160
this is the water gate of your mom's
house. This is a massive scandal.

764
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,910
But Tom and I want to come clean
with you guys because we respect you.

765
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:51,800
We respect those of you who are
making pilgrimage, uh, to your Maca,

766
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,200
which is the redness. It's
stolen. The Renaissance Hotel,

767
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,620
the Cincinnati farts still happen.
Here's, here's how we just,

768
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,100
the room number I'm afraid we should
have done was detective work. Obviously.

769
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:03,710
Sorry it in the moment, but here's
how we figured it out. Okay. Yeah.

770
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:04,990
Okay,

771
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:09,990
so I do see a reservation that we did
have for you in room 18 and your arrival

772
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:12,670
date was August 19th

773
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,800
six 15 1618 six 18

774
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,080
girl there though with the same name.
I just want to make sure I'm not,

775
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:26,010
because my dad also stayed
there under the name

776
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,980
Tom Segura. So do you
see a second? Second,

777
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:36,180
a different date of arrival?
August 21st

778
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,240
okay. Here's how we figured this
out. Let's walk through this.

779
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:41,400
Let's walk through this.
Okay.

780
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,760
The reason that the eight away wasn't
making sense to me because of the arrival

781
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:52,941
date of August 21st so I looked in
the phone August 21st was Friday,

782
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,430
the day of the wedding, and
I go, well, nobody came in
town the day of the wedding.

783
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,920
How do I know this?
Because everybody,

784
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,020
US and my father were at the rehearsal
dinner the day before August 20th your

785
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:11,370
honor. Right? So August 20th
that's rehearsal dinner day.

786
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,920
Everyone's there for that. And
I remembered that. So I go, no,

787
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,800
he was in town for the rehearsal dinner,
couldn't be him.

788
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,960
And then it hit me the wedding day,

789
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:26,430
August 21st my dad would
have checked into the hotel.

790
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,563
Why?

791
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:32,870
Because the days before he stayed at my
cousin's parents home with my mother in

792
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:39,000
Cincinnati, in Cincinnati, went to
the rehearsal dinner, went back,

793
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:43,080
but the wedding was closer to the hotel.
So the day of the hotel,

794
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:45,510
instead of driving back
out to the suburbs,

795
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:50,870
he checked in on August 21st stayed in
room eight Oh eight the Cincinnati fart

796
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:56,450
had to have happened in room six 18 and
I know this is mind blowing to a lot of

797
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:01,290
people. I'd honestly upset us quite a bit.
I mean we considered, I'm embarrassed,

798
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,610
I'm embarrassed. I know that people
have been writing reviews and,

799
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,840
and you know,

800
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,840
saying that they crawled on her hands
and knees to the room and just smelled

801
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:14,610
under the door.
But listen,

802
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,340
eight oh eight is not now in the,
in Diff,

803
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,350
in defense of room eight Oh
eight Topdog did stay there.

804
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:26,680
Yes. And here's why I made
that association with eight
Oh eight state the band.

805
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,350
Cause I, here's how I, anyway,

806
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,010
in far breaks and here's how I know I
remembered the night of the wedding.

807
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,570
I went home early with top dog.
And your mom, you stayed behind.

808
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,250
Okay. They drove me home and then
we went into the hotel in the lobby.

809
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:46,330
We went up in the elevator, they
dropped me off, walked me to my door.

810
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,940
That would be on the sixth floor.
And then they went back,

811
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:53,200
took the elevator the remaining way up.
So now I remember that's correct.

812
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,840
They were in room eight oh eight not us.

813
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:00,370
And we were in six one eight which is
my birthday. So that, the problem is,

814
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:01,720
those are two numbers that had,

815
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,250
and the mistake was in the early episodes,

816
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:09,251
people saying 1618 that's why it said
it's not [inaudible] it's 6.8 I mean this

817
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:13,670
is just, I'm sorry. I know
it's, it's beyond upsetting us,

818
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,260
but we had to tell the truth,
but did you want to keep this alive?

819
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:20,090
I can't live a live with these with our,
with our audience, with the Mommy's this,

820
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:23,980
it's too important to us.
Draw a line through it.

821
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:30,570
Six one eight draw a heart around it and
that's where it happened and that's for

822
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:34,200
sure. Now we're, we're
priests are sticking to six
one eight this is the Diane,

823
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,920
if you already made your reservations,

824
00:56:35,921 --> 00:56:39,790
I'm sure you can cancel eight oh eight
and get transferred over to six 18 there

825
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:40,750
was sure they'll accommodate.

826
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:44,560
There was a guy that recorded
him making the reservation,

827
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,670
really was a good trails off at the end
of the day and then he explained to them

828
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,540
why he wants to stay there. No. Okay,

829
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,090
so Cincinnati fart and they're
like, okay, well let's amend it.

830
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,890
It's not 808-SIX-ONE-8618 that's a
final, final answer. Finally answer,

831
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,810
look, we had to come clean. Would you?
You know what? You want to live a lie? No.

832
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,650
Did the listeners want to live a lie?
When you go make your pilgrimage,

833
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:14,020
when you plan your summer note,
it's upsetting.

834
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,850
It's upsetting to a lot of you right now.

835
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:17,680
I know your summer plans just got ruined,

836
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:22,550
but I think it's better to just tell the
truth. You know? And now you know that.

837
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:26,710
Now you know what, what really
happened? It really happened. Ashamed.

838
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,950
I'm embarrassed.
I feel like Nixon

839
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:35,590
Watergate scandal,
the newspapers Thursday

840
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,790
all going to be like you thought
it was eight Oh eight wrong.

841
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:48,130
The mommies are wrong late
breaking me late. Breaking news.

842
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,150
That's happening now and I know it's
fine to this news is find a devastate the

843
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:55,180
mommy community,
but I feel like we can heal.

844
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,650
I don't even know what to do.
We're getting g all we're going to,

845
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,613
we're going to move on.

846
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:08,140
And I still believe we all

847
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:13,141
Guys Hashtag we believe
Hashtag burn it's man man.

848
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,290
Unreal.
We're not perfect,

849
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:24,360
but we know what's important and it's
important to be honest with you. Um,

850
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,230
hold on. I do have one more piece
of interesting news before I forget.

851
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,880
We had a celebrity,
a double pipe class.

852
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:35,400
Like now a lot of you have been tweeting
us that you've had your first double

853
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:38,690
pipe class constitutes
a double five classic.

854
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,350
There's a lot of chatter on the Internet
about, you know, when, what, how, why.

855
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:48,140
Uh, but we got a celebrity
tweeting that, uh, the,

856
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:52,530
the singer of panic at the
disco. Yeah. Brandon a Uri.

857
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,970
And is that how you say his last name?

858
00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:00,150
He tweeted that he had a double pipe
classic. Pretty crazy. There was a lot.

859
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,950
It's a famous one and there was
a lot of attention around it.

860
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,320
I mean, he got, wow,

861
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,560
I think over 5,000 likes and
a thousand retweets people.

862
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:16,020
Most of the first 50 comments or just what

863
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:21,030
his followers were. All cute girls
going like, what's that bread?

864
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,280
I love the socks. But then some of
them looked it up and they were like,

865
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,310
it's a bourbon. A fart at the same time
in case you're wondering. Yeah. Brent,

866
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:37,610
Brendan, Uri, Uri. Yeah. What
did you say? I don't know.

867
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:41,600
I'm just making sure I get the guy's name
right. [inaudible]. It's Brendon Urie

868
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,360
panic at the disco exclamation
mark because he's really,

869
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:48,790
he's a cute boy.
Yeah,

870
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,220
he's really handsome and girls will
just watch this guy chips on periscope,

871
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:54,830
the girl, some girls, not all,

872
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,580
not some 40 year old
married ladies with babies,

873
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,760
but he's really cute and that took a
lot of courage for him to come through.

874
01:00:04,331 --> 01:00:07,730
It was very brave and say that's the
main thing we want to get out there.

875
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,690
You know, it's like coming
out as nonbinary coming out as

876
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,660
a double pipe. Classic
Person. Somebody else you've,

877
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,450
I'm going to keep mocking the
gender spectrum. The answer. Yes,

878
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:26,360
yes. Well, because that
spectrum is a little blurry.

879
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,170
There's a lot of dog shit bullshit blurry
because I don't know where I fucking

880
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:31,004
land on it

881
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,600
and I'm crazy obsessed about my rap.

882
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,750
I love rats more than I
love people. I do. I do

883
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,870
think crazy girl.
I can't live without them.

884
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:53,510
Sean top piece and breeds rabbits.
This is huffing.

885
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:57,840
Arat smells good. It smells like,

886
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,050
looks like you liked those too.

887
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:09,930
So you get a lot of your
two favorite things. Jesus.

888
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,580
I'd be terrified to be in her home.
I'm not going to lie. I don't like,

889
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,570
I mean I think the pet rats a little
more sterile than the oh definitely.

890
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,420
Definitely.
I'm not into it.

891
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:29,090
Sometimes I suffer from
G Gmr I to get more rats.

892
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,090
G G L N get less nauseous.

893
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:40,820
You're right though. A beard
would greatly hide. Yeah.

894
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,420
Oh it looks like a Louie
Anderson Right now. Baskets.

895
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:50,150
That's why he's so amazing in
that role because he's so fat.

896
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:54,010
He looks just like a, like a nice
fat lady. Like a nice older fat lady.

897
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:58,970
So good as a woman was fucking so good.
Cause it looks like bird.

898
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:01,220
If he shaved right bird
without a beard right here,

899
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,440
man. The Rad thing is no good
though. That's no good. You're,

900
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,280
you're going to definitely die alone.

901
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,970
Why can't tell one or two is acceptable?

902
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:16,370
I think a house fall is probably not wise.

903
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:20,050
Tall has nine 1972 bedroom.

904
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,910
Any animals
or children?

905
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,250
Each of the Ras have
different personalities.

906
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,130
He doesn't like the exercise.

907
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:32,760
Janice and lily is my jumper.

908
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:34,750
Sweet.

909
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:39,740
He's like our dog breeds
bothers me the most.

910
01:02:39,741 --> 01:02:44,510
Janice, I'm not a fan of Janis. You have
big, this whole tale is how big that is

911
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,060
right away.
Like for children.

912
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,510
Each of the rats have different
personalities. Burger likes to eat.

913
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,290
Do you ever get so scared your eyes?
Water.

914
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,190
That's what just happened to me right now.
Can I tell you though?

915
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,330
I used to be afraid of them too.

916
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:01,900
And then my cousin had a pet rat
for a while and when they're,

917
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,801
when they're your pets,

918
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:05,110
there are a lot cleaner and
it's just like having a rabbit.

919
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:10,780
I would be in her home and just with a
golf club and just beating these rest

920
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,790
today in front of

921
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,220
her crying.
You're not jumping anymore.

922
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:27,780
That doesn't bother me as much
as the, the, uh, the terrain,

923
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:32,440
Angela people really, I, that makes
me, Matt makes my asshole pucker.

924
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:37,120
That's not as filled. And I've had
them pretty much ever since then,

925
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:40,660
I'll never be without them. And we know
both of my siblings and they were rats.

926
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,240
We get to know one each other.

927
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,250
Oh boy. Yeah. Yeah. He's
like, I like rats to, I don't,

928
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:50,800
but my fucking mom made me live with rat.

929
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:56,270
That's one of mom's crazy things. Could
you imagine having to live with that?

930
01:03:56,271 --> 01:03:57,940
About bringing girls home
and tried to finger him,

931
01:03:57,941 --> 01:04:01,510
whether it's fucking rats crawling all
over the place on the couch, you know,

932
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,610
he's like, yeah, I was
watching movie. No Lily,

933
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:08,890
don't worry about having like a Boa
constrictor or a python as a pet.

934
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:12,460
You know those people and
then they're like, whoops, the
snake God out. Yeah, no, no,

935
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:17,080
that's not it. No. Why? Why
are you doing this? Stop. Just,

936
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,860
there's, there's rescue centers for
a reason. Animal Wildlife Center,

937
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,140
and then you hear those idiots in Florida.

938
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:26,980
They get pet crocodiles in their
bathtubs and then they grow up, you know,

939
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:32,370
they caught on video that we're in that's
been in a golf course for 19 years.

940
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,900
Easily 500 pounds.
Man will tell you they need,

941
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:42,400
you need to take that, that gator and
put it somewhere else. It's not, okay.

942
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:47,230
Not Okay to have that.
And it's terrifying.

943
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:51,400
What do you think the deal
is with the 19 rats? I mean,

944
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,730
I do think people get the exotic
pet for like it's an attention.

945
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:58,320
She's the same thing as this
is filling an emotional need.

946
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,430
This is like a hoarder. 19 of 19
of any animals. Something wrong.

947
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:08,380
19 of a rat. Like when you get an
out of the norm pet that many times.

948
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,320
Yeah. You could tell someone's
got a lot of emotional.

949
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:15,800
It's like eating diapers and stuff.
It's like eating diverse. Yeah.

950
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,990
Do that. That's it's one of the, yeah,
eating the diaper. The eat the diaper.

951
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:23,470
Dirty diaper. Yeah. It's a
strange addiction episode. I
haven't heard that one yet.

952
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,320
Eat the mattress. The
mattress phone line. Yeah.

953
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:30,430
Nail Polish and then they go
what's really going on there?

954
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:34,410
Like I was abused and like, okay,
can we talk about that? Yeah.

955
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,760
That's what you're feeling. The whole
molest. I never dealt with it bad.

988
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:56,820
And the reason for that is that humidity
actually rises and it's lighter than

989
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:00,190
air. So inside of your humidors,
especially if it's a lump,

990
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,160
you're wondering what's, uh,
what's so crazy about that?

991
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:07,300
It's because you might not realize it
at the time, but it's a deliberate,

992
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:11,380
it's a deliberate choice to make do that.

993
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,210
Your voice doesn't do that on its own.

994
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:17,450
You have to make it happen and you can
do it so much that it becomes second

995
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,770
nature that's actually really
harsh on your vocal cords. Yeah.

996
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,920
But that sounds like he's just being lazy.
Like,

997
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:29,660
maybe he doesn't want to a
nonce. Yeah. But he's actually,

998
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:33,880
yeah, it's a lazy way. This
is that because of the APP and

999
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,531
it wasn't,

1000
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:41,531
I develop this thing and I'm proud of it.

1001
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,030
You know,
you'd think that they would also,

1002
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,910
humidity actually rises and it's lighter
there. Throw inside of your humidor,

1003
01:08:47,911 --> 01:08:49,760
especially if it's a larger humidor,

1004
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,110
might have to have a
higher humidity level.

1005
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,920
Uh, a more inspiring guy to
do the video for the product.

1006
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,700
Probably insisted on doing it. He
goes, I have the best global fry.

1007
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:05,710
I want to do it. Um,
what's this thing? Oh yes,

1008
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:06,670
I have it queued up.

1009
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:11,560
So I bought a new mic and we tested it.
Yeah.

1010
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,220
And it's so great that
we're buying a second one.

1011
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:18,240
It was too good to put on the show
today because it would have been, yeah,

1012
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,790
it would've been one mic and then only
you sound like you're in a tin can and I

1013
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,300
sound amazing.
So what I did was kept it that way.

1014
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:28,720
I did radio a couple of
weeks ago and I remember,

1015
01:09:28,721 --> 01:09:33,130
and the guy was saying, oh, what do you,
what do you use for your podcast? For the,

1016
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:36,790
for mic. So I told him these, sure as
I'm sevens and he goes, he goes, well,

1017
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:41,560
the best ones are these Evy, uh,
Ari 20s. And I didn't really,

1018
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,380
uh, remember entirely, I remember that
somewhere in the number was r e or,

1019
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,500
or you know,
20.

1020
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,730
So I just pull up the company and
they have an ar [inaudible] and an

1021
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:55,330
[inaudible]. And I go, well,
which one should I get? Oh,

1022
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:00,160
and then I realize I could
probably just Google, you know,

1023
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,020
a comparison. And then I realized I
could, and then this is what I got.

1024
01:10:05,021 --> 01:10:07,000
It's really,
I think it's really interesting

1025
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,920
here. I have the capsules from each,
the Ari 20 and the [inaudible],

1026
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,540
as you can see,
they're quite different.

1027
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,060
The Ori Three 20 uses the same capsule
designers in the already 27. Oh,

1028
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,560
no, no, no, no, no, no.

1029
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:24,210
I already 20s or external tubes and the
Ori Three twenties are integrated into

1030
01:10:24,211 --> 01:10:25,200
the capital structure.

1031
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,380
I meant for a microphone comparison.

1032
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:34,870
This guy says a lot of stuff that a lot
of people maybe don't understand about

1033
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:35,680
Mick

1034
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,120
cre,

1035
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,780
20 users of standard gas magnet to
create a synergy and [inaudible] uses a

1036
01:10:40,781 --> 01:10:44,770
neodymium magnet to create is voltage.
So the Ori Three 20 I'm like,

1037
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,800
well which Mike should I get?
We'll have a brighter and higher output.

1038
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:53,620
The Ori 20 sensitivity is 1.5 millivolts
for Pascal and the Ori Three 20 says

1039
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:58,120
2.5 millivolts and they both have
humbugging coils to eliminate emi.

1040
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:02,980
Oh the already 20s is an enclosed Bob
and wire directly below the element and

1041
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:07,540
the Ori three twenties isn't exposed coil
wire on the outside of the capsule and

1042
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:12,541
do achieve it's brighter top in
the Ra three extra resonator dome,

1043
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,360
which it excites me.
Shop around nine k,

1044
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:18,150
just shoot me in the and what
makes the ori three towns capsule,

1045
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,700
new diaphragm.
It's geometry and low mass,

1046
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:27,570
high velocity mylar wherein
exceptionally fast I go,

1047
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:32,571
I think I want to get the Ari 20 but
then transient response and vivid detail.

1048
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,590
So those are the differences
in the capsules. Okay,

1049
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,610
but what else does she have a close
look at? The switching differences.

1050
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,780
This is what I wanted to,
if you already,

1051
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:47,010
20 contains a dual position switch for
filtering in the left hand position.

1052
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:51,690
The mic is flat from 80 Hertz up to six
k with a broad two and a half db rise

1053
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:56,160
between 16 and 18 K and it's balanced
out with a minus three DB slow

1054
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,450
80 coach down to 45

1055
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:03,610
the right hand position engages a base
till curve throwing four and a half db of

1056
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:08,611
attenuations see 100 hertz down to
100 so then I thought the Ori three 20

1057
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:12,400
switching effectively creates two
different mics with completely different

1058
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:17,350
personalities. Stop it and
presence. There's a form. Okay,

1059
01:12:17,351 --> 01:12:20,100
I'm going to die. That goes
on to compare on paper. Well,

1060
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,440
I'll show you how they compare
and sound. That's what I, okay,

1061
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,720
I've got the mic set up
and ready for comparison.

1062
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,213
Great leg.

1063
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:33,070
You think you would do this earlier?
Like we're three minutes.

1064
01:12:33,071 --> 01:12:37,600
I know I did actually. The guy does
a very informative video obviously,

1065
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:41,290
but Jesus, when he takes that thing
apart and starts talking about it,

1066
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,640
check a wise

1067
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,460
and canisters and tell me
which one to buy, asshole,

1068
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,770
asshole.

1069
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:50,401
You know what I mean?

1070
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:53,910
Which one's a good one to mention that
because the ori three twenties output is

1071
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:58,650
hotter than the Ari 20s. I've
got the microphone preamps
balanced on the console.

1072
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:03,380
So did the game. Is he talking about
he like, he's doing a good job buddy.

1073
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:08,050
Good job. Yeah, it was a lot.
All right. Um, so now you know,

1074
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:12,010
it was seven minutes to just tell me
which ones, you know, how are we hit? We,

1075
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:16,960
we played Joey Diaz. I'm talking
about shitting in a bathtub. Yeah.

1076
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:20,680
He said that the reason that he
stopped was because of his wife.

1077
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,780
I knew it and this is,
I'm so happy to hear that.

1078
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,370
Do that no more. That's when I was an
animal. I've done was way before the baby,

1079
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,680
way before I got married. Yeah,
you don't Shit in the shower.

1080
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:33,150
My wife caught me one time.

1081
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:38,010
She caught me tossing this shit
and she goes, what was that?

1082
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:40,710
It was a bit as she's quiet like,
Oh shit,

1083
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:43,710
this thing flying off and it
was rolling in the air with

1084
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:49,400
the scanner and it just bless it goes.
What was that like? Why that accent?

1085
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:53,440
You have an accent no more. You're too
old for that shit. And that was it.

1086
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,903
My wife gets it.

1087
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:59,130
That's it. Wow. He threw a log. Yeah,

1088
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,720
I heard it from the shower and a toilet.
Yeah,

1089
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,620
he did you imagine me walking
in on now and just imagine what,

1090
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:10,570
let like how much of a barbarian that
guy is where a regular practice for him

1091
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,310
with this pick it up.

1092
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:22,360
Woo. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1093
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:26,860
I don't even think I can understand
that. It's a lot to understand. It is.

1094
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,420
It is a lot to understand.
Oh man,

1095
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,850
there's not, there's not a lot
traumatized. I know. No, no.

1096
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:42,730
Um, thanks for sharing that.
I'm glad you brought that back.

1097
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:47,740
I just forgotten about it. You know,
I got something else for you. Okay.

1098
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:48,574
What'd you got

1099
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,380
ladies and gentlemen?
Tom Segura master.

1100
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,670
Wow. Challenges every week come
in. Can you do this accident?

1101
01:15:05,671 --> 01:15:10,630
Can you do that accent? And of
course the answer is always yes. Um,

1102
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,720
but I wanted to see what you thought
of some of the people being pitched to

1103
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:17,130
imitate. Okay. Yeah.

1104
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:20,620
Diane, what is the real key
of the problem into you guys?

1105
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:23,120
It means a player because I ended
up doing with the last two years

1106
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,710
is that the guy from the blues traveler.

1107
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,700
Remember that guy?
Know that guy?

1108
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,750
Why did you put me into,
does it mean the party?

1109
01:15:35,751 --> 01:15:40,370
Because I ended up doing with the
last two years, about two years.

1110
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:43,870
You have to do the laugh.
The craziest then that's fine.

1111
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:48,140
But what I'm really good just sit in is
getting is for you to get to know Joe

1112
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:52,820
here in the middle. Yeah. Joe was coming
up. I knew it was going to go here.

1113
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,700
Joe Is quite the guy.
I mean I,

1114
01:15:55,701 --> 01:15:58,100
I was really excited
when I saw him come up.

1115
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:02,950
What? What does the New York,
you have to call me too.

1116
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:08,240
What it means we left
because we keep up to what

1117
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,800
it means a lot. It was
like four teeth. He does.

1118
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,520
I always wonder when a
guy like this did the,

1119
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:22,490
when the teeth fallout,
does he just go fuck it?

1120
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:25,220
Like does you think they're in the way?

1121
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,830
Like does he think thank God, you
know, that fell off like a scab.

1122
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,310
You're like,
Oh God damn.

1123
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:34,640
But waiting for that scab to fall off
for a week because now he's got his

1124
01:16:34,641 --> 01:16:39,540
drinking that he's got his frequent mouth.
We're ready to go.

1125
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:43,110
Yeah. Yeah. Wait, my favorite
is you do look in a mirror.

1126
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:48,140

Ah.

1184
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:28,890
Something tells me that when the pub
burnt down, Joe didn't not drink.

1185
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,130
Yeah. It wasn't that no pub
equaled no drinks for Joe.

1186
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,120
Joe was still able to find the right,
like he's pouring something.

1187
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,860
We have to, we'll have some video of
an outlet in the lead up to speed.

Oh, good microphone guy. Why?

1208
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:00,290
Because he's not a bloated
alcoholic piece. That might be fun.

1209
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,300
I can't understand a word he's saying.

1215
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:31,230
What is he saying? I'll tell you here.
Let's start. Let's start from here.

You're distracting. It's too
distracting. It's too good.

1221
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:59,370
There's too much in this. Okay, here,
let me, let me make this easier. Okay.

1222
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,510
But now I wanted to see the drug guys
face when he's staring at that guy talk.

1223
01:24:03,511 --> 01:24:04,344
It was great.

1224
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,273
Worst.

1225
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:14,350
Kim, what? What's it like to
have the pub? Did you think

1226
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,310
it's boring?

1227
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,890
Tell you that everybody,

1228
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,940

Can I please see my boyfriend again?
Yes. I miss him. I miss his drunk stairs.

1231
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:49,080
That's what I'm to blame him.
Hate daggers at the guy.

1232
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,210
I like his beard. I like
everything. I liked it. I'd be
here like that. What's that?

1233
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,180
The traps? Yeah, those are good. Yeah.

1234
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,440
What did you have to to live out in the
wild on the bottle and just talk to be

1235
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,613

1236
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,130
He said it's great to be back. I
don't understand man. Oh, okay.

1237
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:17,180
I never understood why they
let drunk people play darts.

1238
01:25:17,181 --> 01:25:20,570
That has to be the dumbest thing in the
world to put in a pub with these guys.

1239
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:30,980
He was standing.

01:25:41,421 --> 01:25:44,690

to our show and they're like,

1244
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:49,340
what are these fucking American saying?
No, they think we talk like retards core.

1245
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,980
They understand it. Yeah. Yeah.

1246
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,810

1252
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:27,550

He does that too.

1259
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:54,350
It says that he loves women's toes and
it's because he's always around stripped

1260
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,460
and the shrimp reminds him of the toes.
So he always is.

1261
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:02,780
I'm eating shrimp and toes.
Um,

1262

and he prefers just lemon juice and
not cocktail sauce. He says. Wow.

1263
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:13,700
He's a, a, a member of the Patriot and
family. So big shout out to Mike Johnson.

1264
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:17,690

that was submitted by d Joseph Mccann.

1272
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,310
Uh, okay. Have you done a
mom? Australian filler up?

1273
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:29,680
I'm pretty certain we
have a long time ago,

1274
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:33,170
but he said there's such good options.
So she's everybody's favorite anti-semite.

1275
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:35,180
Mel Gibson. Yup. Um,

1276
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:40,250
who I thought to be clear that he was
born in the u s moved to mom's Straya live

1277
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:47,010
there for a few years in his youth move
back. That's what I understand. No,

1278
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:51,370
don't know. There is this super advanced
Chicco watt machine in front of me,

1279
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:55,480
so I'm actually going to
look that up real quick. Um,

1280
01:28:55,590 --> 01:29:00,580
he doesn't represent mom's Trillia that
he was born in Peekskill New York. Oh,

1281
01:29:00,581 --> 01:29:02,190
okay. Then they, his folks

1282
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,430
moved. Yeah, that's, that's what
I understood. Um, let's see.

1283
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:10,050
Lucky mom's Julia is nice. Yeah. Nice
place to like, exactly what happened.

1284
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:14,870
Move with his parents to Sydney
when he was 12 years old, said Nay.

1285
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:20,390
The mom's trail? Yeah.
Yeah. Do you do Australia?

1286
01:29:20,391 --> 01:29:22,480
And that's again Bomba Mobay

1287
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:29,250
so his paternal grandmother was
born in Australia to Irish parents.

1288
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:34,250
Paternal grandfather was from us,

1289
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:39,120
so yeah. Okay. So he went there for a
while. Let's see, when did he come back?

1290
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:46,800
Oh, and then his dad basically wanted him
to go there to avoid the draft. Smart.

1291
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:48,900
Good.
Yeah.

1292
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:54,780
Since his net worth is $425 what the fuck?

1293
01:29:56,550 --> 01:30:01,110
Wow. Maltesers is that
mom's Joleon, right?

1294
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:04,680
Is that your favorite actor? Mal tasers?
Lubin is they your favorite actor?

1295
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,840
Mel Gibson? Yeah. No. Oh,

1296
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,220
is he your second favorite actor? Nah,
I don't think he's on the top five.

1297
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:19,590
Six? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That's
your six favorite actress?

1298
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:22,860
My six favorite. You
know what if that, um,

1299
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:26,730
that this girl who did these,
these videos,

1300
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:31,800
it's just narrow. It's just Mel
Gibson and they just put a pitch on

1301
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:36,660
how to spot as you could be like, I
want to do this, how to spot at you.

1302
01:30:36,661 --> 01:30:39,700
And they're like, everyone is fascinated
by the Jewish people and you just,

1303
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:46,050
although lighter skin smell,

1304
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,310
Mel Gibson going when I just get Jews
are flagging guys. I said pitch it up.

1305
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:55,770
All right. Get the kid to do it. This
must be somebody's a daughter, right?

1306
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:56,693
I'm assuming.

1307
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,740
Probably there's no like little kids
raging antisemetic seven year old girl,

1308
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,840
the greatest singer songwriter
actor of all time. Russell Crowe,

1309
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:11,120
but fucker Xtrordinair Hugh Jackman.
And of course,

1310
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:16,200
does that mean Chris
Hemsworth? Uh, Hugh Jackman,

1311
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:20,670
I guess. I don't know. Do people assume
he's in the bud fucking, he's not.

1312
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:24,290
He's straight. People are
always like, yeah, big,

1313
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,840
but because he doesn't musicals
and all that stuff. Yeah.

1314
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,520
You can throw in Steve Erwin, Paul
Hogan, nausea wine member hand. Okay,

1315
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:36,930
so let's talk about what
you do is we want to,

1316
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:41,990
I think we've probably done Russell
Crowe and maybe he hasn't aged.

1317
01:31:41,991 --> 01:31:46,910
Well let's take your mail out of it.
He's just a port,

1318
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:52,020
so I think we go Chris Hemsworth.
He's really contemporary.

1319
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:53,940
You know that. His jeans? No.

1320
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,950
Betsey's licking Fifo as Peter
Right now. That's cool. Dog Porn.

1321
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:04,030
I love that stuff. Oh yeah. You're going
to want some of this right here. For sure.

1322
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:12,110
Cute. I like him. He looks like
a vampire when he's long hair.

1323
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,030
I like that.

1324
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:16,840
Um, some of that hems. Wes,

1325
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,910
how about him?
He has a brother.

1326
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:24,840
He has a brother Tom Cigarettes.
Yeah, they're both accurate. Oh,

1327
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:29,520
that's his brother. Okay, well
let's pull up both then. Oh,

1328
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:31,243
Liam,

1329
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,530
that's crazy that there's two pieces of
Dick like this in a family, you know.

1330
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,410
So lackey. Yeah. Okay,
well, here you go. Um,

1331
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:46,410
so let Liam looks like he
did he date Miley Cyrus?

1332
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:52,050
Oh yes he did. So let's, uh,

1333
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:55,230
let's look at what Liam's
done so people know.

1334
01:32:55,860 --> 01:33:00,650
So Liam is Australian actor played
the role of Josh Taylor. Uh,

1335
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:06,750
oh, he was, he started as Gail Hawthorne
in the Hunger Games film series. Oh, okay.

1336
01:33:06,751 --> 01:33:11,640
Let me think. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I got it. Cute. Cute. Yeah. Okay,

1337
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:16,290
so real cute. You cute dog. Um,

1338
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:22,020
and then homeboy, what's the, what's
the other guy's named Chris? Chris.

1339
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,920
Chris. It looks like they have
another brother. Really? Yeah,

1340
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:31,470
but Chris that this guy's got fucking
just, just pouring out of his eyeballs.

1341
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:36,060
Look at him. I know
that guy, the Avengers,

1342
01:33:36,061 --> 01:33:40,470
he played Thor,
a perfect getaway cabin in the woods.

1343
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,220
Snow White and the husband Red
Dawn, right? Dawn. Yeah. Red,

1344
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:48,880
red bleeding dog. Cause you get so much
pussy. You don't know what the do. Yeah,

1345
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:53,070
that's him here. That's, that's this guy.
He's got a bloody dog. That's stress.

1346
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,760
These guys both have bloody dungs now.

1347
01:33:56,761 --> 01:34:00,480
But I feel like a lot of people who
are into the hunger games, that's a,

1348
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,800
that's a tough one to
shake. Right? Cause that's,

1349
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:09,210
that's a really popular movie. Oh
He's got a man Bun and no blame. Yeah,

1350
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:13,770
not a fan.
Well what are you feeling?

1351
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:17,570
I mean they look the same. They
don't look the same. Similar.

1352
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:21,950
I'm going to vote for that panic at the
disco guy. Is, is he didn't play what?

1353
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:26,510
He's not on the list. He's not
Australian. Same. Okay. I see.

1354
01:34:26,511 --> 01:34:30,140
So this one's like Cla,
little cuter. You're cuter.

1355
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:33,500
A little more Fay and
the other one's rugged.

1356
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:34,031
Yeah.

1357
01:34:34,031 --> 01:34:38,750
That one's a little more rugged but like
rugged because he just bought fuck you

1358
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:40,970
so hard that he built up a sweat.

1359
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,110
This guy's definitely making you eat
his ass and you're never ever sang.

1360
01:34:45,111 --> 01:34:48,860
I don't think so.
It's always clean enough to get in there.

1361
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:53,430
Now the other boy is a little more emo
and he might have to talk about feelings

1362
01:34:53,431 --> 01:34:58,010
with you, like write in his journal
and I dunno if want all that

1363
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,600
come on. I like to go rugged. I'm more of
the Alpha. Personally. You are the alpha.

1364
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:07,490
I mean I like an Alpha Guy Chris,
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's,

1365
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,360
he's not, you're right. He's not
going to take no for an answer.

1366
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:14,850
The other one is just, he's going to talk
too much about feelings. It'll make him

1367
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:21,350
all my questions. They go out the window
because he's got all the answers. Right.

1368
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:25,040
I like that. Yeah. I don't have
to be like, what do I do now?

1369
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:28,720
He's just going to take me by the back
of the head like 50 shades of grey.

1370
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:33,020
That's Chris. He's that guy and he's
going to put you in his fuck done, Jen,

1371
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,220
and you have to sign a contract where
you exercise. It's going to turn a week.

1372
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,930
I just don't care.
Right Chris,

1373
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:43,340
you know Luke is going to be like you
sure your eye with those and I'll be like,

1374
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,240
dude, fucking wrap it
up. You know, let's go.

1375
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,670
So I'm definitely going,
I guess.

1376
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:53,170
I think these might be the three
brothers right here is if I end.

1377
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,340
There's always one brother.
That's the really odd ball.

1378
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:59,000
He won like two brothers got the good
looks and then that third brother,

1379
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:02,900
not so much. Didn't really sucks
for him. Dribble all the way down.

1380
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:09,140
I'm going Chris. Right? I'm going
Chris. Maybe we could do it three way.

1381
01:36:09,141 --> 01:36:13,280
Let's ask him. That'd be great. Let
us know. Fill her up. Sealers shot.

She plays Seth Rogan's wife and the
neighbors and the neighbors sequel.

She actually has really good comedic
timing. Excellent. She's really funny.

who's, this guy is such a good actor.

1407
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:10,350
You know this guy.
I did tell you my answer already.

1408
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:11,184
You know this Guy

1409
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:15,910
Oh yeah. Duties in a, he was in a
Jackie nurse, Jackie. Yeah, exactly.

1410
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:20,380
And he's on a vinyl right now,
that HBO series. Oh, he's great.

1411
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:25,370
He's a great, great. Yeah. Uh,
well here's the thing. So that,

1412
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:30,280
that girl, the, the fat ones
married to him. No, that's
Jackie Queue. Right. Gotcha.

1413
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:33,940
Yeah. So that's, yeah, that's her. Listen,

1414
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:36,460
I can tell you straight up
now for a lesbian affair,

1415
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:40,000
I can't do the big girls cause
the sweat and the smells.

1416
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:45,370
But you do big boys. It's
different. Vaginas are
different. You get it, you know?

1417
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:49,030
Yeah. What if she just cleans it up?
I don't know. You have to really,

1418
01:38:49,031 --> 01:38:49,900
really be on top of it.

1419
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:53,690
Okay. I know my choice, but go ahead.

1420
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:58,180
I'm Jackie who I love her. I'll
explain a little bit. Well,

1421
01:38:58,181 --> 01:39:02,280
I'm still a huge fan of her work and
we could talk and her coach, you know,

1422
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:07,090
won't be a sweaty. That's
what I'm thinking about. If
I got it down there, sweat,

1423
01:39:07,091 --> 01:39:12,040
smells, things like that. See, I'm
kind of into that and I think, oh boy,

1424
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:15,430
I'm going rebel all the way. A couple
of reasons though. First of all,

1425
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:18,790
I really like rose. I like her work.
Yeah. But I feel like with Bobby,

1426
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:23,770
see he's dropping the hammer so regularly
that her standards are real high.

1427
01:39:23,771 --> 01:39:24,071
You know?

1428
01:39:24,071 --> 01:39:28,520
I'm going to have to have like my best
day to equal maybe his worst day. Right.

1429
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,220
You know,
and like he's really,

1430
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:33,970
I think he's probably just a
savage fucking Italian pig.

1431
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,960
So I just feel like there's
a lot to live up to rebel.

1432
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:41,920
She's happy if you go like, Hey, I dropped
this on the ground. Do you want it?

1433
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:46,630
But I know what you're saying. And I think
in normal world terms, that's correct.

1434
01:39:46,631 --> 01:39:48,760
Yeah. But she's famous. Doesn't matter.

1435
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:52,540
She's just really getting a lot of
d thrown at her. Yeah, absolutely.

1436
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:55,180
Famous people get way more love
thrown at them though. It's different.

1437
01:39:55,181 --> 01:39:58,350
It's different with women and different
with women that are overweight.

1438
01:39:58,351 --> 01:40:01,330
It's chick hat. Yeah. But you have to
understand there's someone for everyone.

1439
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,310
And now with the Internet,

1440
01:40:03,311 --> 01:40:08,050
she can find whoever is
into her styles and types.

1441
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:11,350
Listen, it's just, there's
something you don't understand. Um,

1442
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:16,750
I know what's what here and I
want to pig out on her. Right.

1443
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,950
And,
and she'll be,

1444
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:23,900
she'll reciprocate so much
more because she'll be like,

1445
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:27,320
oh, you're a fucking, like
a awesome looking guy.

1446
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:32,210
And like you just ate my box so much.
Right. Then I didn't even pay the day,

1447
01:40:32,211 --> 01:40:35,600
but you don't care. And, and then
she's Australian. She's so cool.

1448
01:40:35,601 --> 01:40:38,860
She's going to have the best
personality. I know. She is. Yeah.

1449
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:43,340
But I just feel like then I'll be like,
you know, you reminded me of this, uh,

1450
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:49,030
one of these big trees and I like to
get every week that it's like this puffy

1451
01:40:49,371 --> 01:40:50,240
kind of pastry,

1452
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:53,770
but then inside there's so much custard
and that's what I'm going to you up with

1453
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:58,000
right now is all this custard and
then she'll be like, is that it?

1454
01:40:58,030 --> 01:40:59,530
And then we'll go for like round two

1455
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:03,000
and then I'll just keep
just telling her up. Yep.

1456
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:07,500
But you're saying she's custard flavor?
She was like an eclair. Yeah. Vlan.

1457
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:12,130
And Yeah. Yeah. And I think I'm going
to just really, she has hardened her.

1458
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:16,110
Okay. Um, anyways, I just wanted
you to know that. All right.

1459
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,730
I just feel like you should
appreciate it a little more.

1460
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:22,900
Can I have a threesome with a Jackie
Q and her husband though? God,

1461
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,560
you're such a liar. I like him
too. I like them both, you know,

1462
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:30,340
huge fan of her.
You trying to his fine.

1463
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,753
You,

1464
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,280
there you go. Um, yeah,
that's, that is. What else? Is
there anything else to cover?

1465
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,620
We have, we went through and find a
shirt a lot. It was a really fun episode.

1466
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:59,020
Let's see. Before we close this out, we
have to do, we have to do a shout out?

1467
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:00,760
This is so ridiculous,
man.

1468
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:03,430
We have to do a shout out because we
have a closing song and call it young

1469
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:07,450
Patrion. Oh good. Oh my God.
