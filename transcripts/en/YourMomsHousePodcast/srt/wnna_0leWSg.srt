32
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:16,060
Tonight I'm hitting over 30 cities
on this tour coming up in 2017.

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,280
Jesus Christ, a lot of them are one
night only, so you got to get on them.

34
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,380
We added, we added shows. I forgot.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,640
We added a second show in Chicago and a
third show in Miami. Annapolis. Right.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,010
So if you're a in either city,

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,180
shows have been added and by the way I'm
whatever, just go check out the site.

38
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:38,350
Okay. Genes is going to Washington. Um,

39
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,610
December 19th, 2010 I like to
take December down for standup.

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,020
It's good too. I like to take,
I'll do local being a store,

41
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,870
but I think come on that, you know what
I'm saying? Yeah. Thousand ranch.com. No,

42
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,620

You know what I'm saying

43
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,340
is that it also,
listen,

44
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,590
the holidays are upon us.

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,060
You got to do your shopping and using
our Amazon Danner do not fly with gifts.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,110
Those dumb dumbs and Tsa,
if you,

47
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,860
if you wrap a gift and fly with it
on your carry on, what do they do?

48
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,330
Tommy Wilson Goode, what's to
here. And then they emerge,

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,190
they unwrap it and they go, oh, you can
go back and check it in if you want.

50
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:28,870
Like anybody fucking does that. You don't
have time for that. So go to Amazon,

51
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,710
send them to the destination you're going
to. Why would you travel with gifts?

52
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:37,150
It's silly. Have it shipped and
use our banner, your mom's house,

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,810

58
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,620

start the show jeans? Yeah.

59
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,060
God Start Tom,

60
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:03,800
your mom and you're my son and I if
falling in love with him. He said,

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,350
are you really? I said, yes, I
am. He thinking, you know what?

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,560
I was scared to let you know too. I
am too both consenting adults. If,

63
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,310
if it comes down to it, you know, it's
just like the gays there, there, you know,

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,620
as long as they're over 18,
everything's fine.

65
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,340
No, bring it in for this. Well,

66
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,030
we'll go to your mom's house,

67
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,640
Christina visits.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,753
Yeah.

69
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,443
Okay.

70
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah. Amazing. Right.

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,240
That clip I saw on Facebook yesterday
and I almost had a fucking coronary.

72
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:27,920
I thought it was so funny.
Yeah.

73
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,790
The Blue Band right away. Right
away. You got to add this.

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
That's the new opener for tomorrow because
that was the craziest Shit I've ever

75
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,480
heard. Yeah. What's, can we hear it again?

76
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,700
Yes, of course. Of course. You're like,
I really need to get into it. There's,

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,950
there's so much amazing about that clip.

78
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,330
Uh, it's so, it's so unbelievable.

79
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,270
Yeah.
Hmm.

80
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,200
By the way. Oh, this is
what I wanted to say. Don't,

81
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,610
don't fucking break my
balls spooky because I know
someone right now is breaking

82
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,190
my balls because there's no video today.
Oh,

83
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:12,140
well you listen to a mother fucker.
Yo. You know, first of all guys,

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,400
we barely had our lives together
enough to do today's episode.

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,930
This has been a massive
move. And Tom, oh my God,

86
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,820
left town the day we had one day here and
then you left town and I've been alone

87
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,770
with the baby and workers
workers coming in and out.

88
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:32,240
We have everything's chaos,

89
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,580
have electricians and handymen and
there's a guy right now doing shit in the

90
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:41,420
house, like all kinds of stuff. And
I know some people are like, dude,

91
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,700
I fucking well I like to watch it and
you're fucking up my well low cheese.

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,620
It's chaos right now. So you guys are
probably like, well good luck to you then.

93
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,120
Well you know, we're like, you
have a good fucking night then.

94
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,530
Okay guys, listen. It's a miracle
that we pulled together audio tonight.

95
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,210
So sorry. We're going to have to
look. It's chaos in here right now.

96
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,960
There's were, we did this like a,
this is a makeshift studio right now.

97
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,100
There's cords laying on top of
stuff like this isn't set up. So No,

98
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:17,120
I'm looking at just everything
splattered everywhere. Yes.

99
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,070
Bad and not, not healthy. This
is a level eight hoarders,

100
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:26,000
right? What's the highest on
the hoarding? Uh, I think five.

101
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,190
This is a five. Yeah, there's
pathways, which is a good sign.

102
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,970
You saw pathways. I mean there's,
there's fecal matter everywhere,

103
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,490
which is bad in buckets. My friend
Matt told me, he's like, you know,

104
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:43,070
and you want you to have the fecal matter.
Is that when you're at a five? Oh yeah.

105
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,580
Is that what pushes you to the last
and no, no. Pathways. Like you said,

106
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:50,510
you can't have no, wait, sorry. So if
you still have pathways, you're like, uh,

107
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,560
three uh, yeah. I mean you're somewhere
on that. You know, you're below,

108
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,690
you're like that.
So we're at a three.

109
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,650
I think it's so hilarious that there's
like call, cause I know that Guy Matt,

110
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,060
what is he, what's his, his website?
It's like five steps or something.

111
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,050
I forget men. Um, but
that's what, that's what he,

112
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,980
he classifies people as the hoarder
levels. Like if you've got dead animals,

113
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:16,940
you're definitely like a five plus
feces and buckets. You're five.

114
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,570
You want to hear the,
the, of course, of course.

115
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,300
I live for this kind of shit.
I love psychological things like this.

116
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:30,380
This is so peculiar that says
this is for for fire service.

117
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,130
They they watch.
It's a fire service hoarding scale.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,320
So level one is the start. Most of
the homes we see are at this level.

119
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,340
You countered large amounts of materials.
It's us, but find normal clutter,

120
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,670
apparent signs of insects,
some apparent size of insects and rodents,

121
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,290
clutter and we're the level
one. All doors, windows and
hallways are accessible.

122
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,980
We're not even, we're well
our, our doorways are not that

123
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,180
accessible right now. Windows we
might be able to is a hoarder home.

124
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,590
That the amount of overall clutter has
begun to appear is the point where you

125
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,280
would consider the amount of belongings
to be over and above the normal level.

126
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,270
Trash cans are overflowing,
one or more exits are blocked.

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,780
Housekeeping is at a minimal level.
At level two,

128
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:20,150
the piles of belongings may be at
or above waist level. Oh my God,

129
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,290
God. Windows are starting to be unusable
as piles to continue to get larger.

130
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,580
Level three quote,
big problems begin.

131
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,960
The amount of belongings have
taken control of the house,

132
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,050
making the rooms unusable
for the occupants. Serious
hazard for firefighters.

133
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,603
Yeah.

134
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,980
The goat paths become the only
access usable space like the animal.

135
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,410
Yeah, I guess because
there was so narrow, right.

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,690
Climbing on mountains
on neuro level three,

137
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,290
the clutter may be visible
from the exterior. Yeah.

138
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,270
You're fucked. Stairwells are mostly
blocked from below with belongings.

139
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,700
It's just a narrow path. Level four
is also the beginning of the end.

140
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,980
Uh, the beginning of the
end of the unusable areas of
the home starts from level

141
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:15,180
four. Most of the rooms are
unusable, hoarded space levels. Uh,

142
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,940
the piles of belongings will be
at the ceiling where they're,

143
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,880
all windows are covered.
God, attic spaces are full.

144
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,380
Oh boy. All cabinets are full.
Even under the floor spaces.

145
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,340
And level five is uninhabitable.
Unable to enter.

146
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,430
There's obvious structural
damage. Broken walls, men.

147
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,700
Does it talk about the feces and the dead
animals or no? No, because this is like,

148
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,210
that was what I read you
was for firefighters. This,
this day. They do that.

149
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,130
They don't get into the fun
stuff. Yeah. Roaches and oh,

150
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:53,160
he would clutter cleaner was,
yeah. Oh, this is a different,

151
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,230
this is a different one. So
this one, level five is, um,

152
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,210
according to this,
animals at risk and danger,

153
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,410
uh, pervasive spiders,
roaches, mice, rats, squirrels,

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,660
key living spaces are not usable.

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,120
Um, toilets, sinks and
tubs are not functioning.

156
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,090
Human, urine, urine, an
excrement is present,

157
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,270
rotting food cans or
cans or jars are expired.

158
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,850
Member Tommy harder's where
she was, she was like, well,

159
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:37,030
it's not puffy. I can still eat it. Yeah,
the bacteria. So there'll be like a,

160
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,400
like a box of like soup or broth.
And this woman would be like,

161
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,390
the ordering cleaning lady would be like,
this is a year ago state. And she goes,

162
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:48,390
well, the box isn't puffy. I can still
eat. It's not puffy. I can eat it.

163
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,120
Is it puffy yet? And she would ask that
and they're like, no, not yet. Well,

164
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,160
don't throw that away. Shit. My

165
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,820
favorite two was when, um, the one,

166
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,750
the women had a problem collecting things
like beanie babies and then an entire

167
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,320
bedroom would just be a floor to ceiling,
like beanie babies.

168
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:08,920
The tag still on like, well,
I gotta collect all 700.

169
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,350
This one's a limited edition.
They're so crazy.

170
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,980
The Hordern shows really do.
It sounds like a bit,

171
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,930
but they do make you
feel good about yourself.

172
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,560
That's why I think that's the allure that
was the, I think why they had viewers.

173
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,960
Yeah. I got my shit together.
Of course. Yeah, of course.
You watch it and you go, oh,

174
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:31,240
my house is, there's a lot of
alarming shit on that show.

175
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,650
One of the most alarming though was
when they had, uh, a psychologist.

176
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,940
Do you remember that one? The
psychologist was the hoarder. Yeah.

177
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,920
How could you do that? And she was
like, oh, I know I treat people.

178
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,600
But you know,
the cobbler's children have shoes,

179
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:53,530
credible levels of denial. That's really
what it is. It's some kind of trauma.

180
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,090
I think that happens. And
then it's unresolved. And
then they turn in. They, yeah.

181
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:02,080
And they hard to deal with the trauma.
Usually that's what happens. I don't know,

182
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,430
unless some people are just nasty. Some
people just so mad. He got to be so nasty.

183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,580
It's my favorite episode of hoarders.

184
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,190
Remember the the woman that
had 75 dead animal carcasses,

185
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,170
75 that was my, yeah, it sounds really,

186
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,780
I wish there was more
shows about mental illness.

187
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,020
I just love mental illness shows.
I could watch that. Oh my God,

188
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,410
you guys are so disgusting.
Yeah.

189
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,790
So far I can watch an entire series
of people who just shit into jars and

190
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,670
collect them. I love that. I can
watch that shit all day, man.

191
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,920
Why works really,
really gross when he's talking about,

192
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,290
wait, so what's our house at right now?
Like a three. No, we're not there, man.

193
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:52,120
You gotta be kidding me. It's
not that bad. We're not that
bad. But it's just, it's,

194
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:56,620
it's still, it's chaos for not
mentally ill people, you know?

195
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,210
It makes me,
it gives me so much anxiety to have boxes.

196
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,320
I fucking hate it so much. They
get it. Just the appearance,

197
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,250
just boxes everywhere. It gives
me, I just hate it. Boxes Smell.

198
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,130
They smell. Yeah. You just, you know that

199
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,580
and then there's just stuff
like you're missing. Like,

200
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:19,650
I've got the,
uh,

201
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,780
I've got the Cup but not the
lid to the fucking, you know,

202
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,020
like a boy,
one of these right here for that one.

203
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,310
It was just, and I'm never
going to find that quarter odor,

204
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,830
a whole other piece for it. I'm
missing all kinds of shit. It's just,

205
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,650
we will be back with, um, you know,

206
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,190
with an actual camera show next week,

207
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,190
but let's Thanksgiving week two,
we're going to be home.

208
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:49,470
We'll be around so we can straighten
things up a bit more. Definitely. But, uh,

209
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,700
so oil boy, you know, it
was neat about moving Tom.

210
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,240
My favorite thing and having
workers around is, um,

211
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,610
all every,

212
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,730
every mover that was in her
home took a shit they did bad.

213
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,783
Yeah.

214
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,180
And what's cool is there's a point in
the day where the door would be shut,

215
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,630
but the fan would still be on. So you
knew that people were just to show you.

216
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Yeah. That's cool. Through them.
Through the door. You can hear it. Yeah.

217
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,030
Yup, Yup. Cool.

218
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,750
That's what you hear. Like a stranger.
A strange dude. Yeah. And like,

219
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,740
you know that lunchtime, I remember
lunchtime came, they broke for lunch,

220
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,770
never moving day, our
packing day. Right, right.

221
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,110
There's a break for lunch and then five
dudes came and shit in our move a whole

222
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,990
house like that they had, they
sent like the crew, you know,

223
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,780
so these six guys show up.
Yeah.

224
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,920
Moving couches and beds and just heavy
shit. And then all six of them are like,

225
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,760
I'm gonna take a shit. Right.
Shit. All Shit in your house, man.

226
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,710
All so gnarly. Yeah, it's been,

227
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,820
my favorite was we had a carpenter come
a couple days ago to the new house and

228
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:16,570
the guy shook my hand. Sweet guy.
Yeah. Shook my hand. Hey, I doing I,

229
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,730
my name is. So Steve, we're going to
do the thing. Great. Great, great.

230
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,230
Not Five minutes later. Can I use
your bathroom? And I'm thinking, well,

231
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:27,590
he's going to go number one. It's
a morning. It's early morning. No,

232
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,040
the guy takes a full,

233
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,160
yeah, yeah, yeah. You can hear it.

234
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:37,960
Hear

235
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,420
it. Yeah. I could smell it. And he
used the bathroom by the kitchen.

236
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,020
I'm cooking for my son.
I'm eating breakfast and this,

237
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,340
this carpenter is taking a shit in my
bag. Yeah, that's correct. Right here.

238
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,280
But why, why save it for my house? That
was a first call in the morning, you know,

239
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:53,920
it was a cool guy.

240
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,990
You think he wanted to pull over to
Starbucks and maybe shit somewhere else,

241
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:01,250
but he brought it to my house and I think
I, I just saw what he did to this too.

242
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:06,230
I think he gave me a modification hold
there for this. Oh, I was looking for,

243
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,010
I'm excited. I'm so excited to show this
to people when we have it set up. Dude.

244
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,440
You guys are going to shit
when you see the studio. Yeah.

245
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,390
It's a professional studio. It
is. But we'll give you a tour.

246
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,280
I want to do this as like a Patriot
on bonus or just a bonus. No, they,

247
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:21,440
we'll just put it up man.
Yeah.

248
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:25,760
You guys to see the quality of the
studio is bananas. It's soundproofed.

249
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:29,180
It's got like velvet on the walls.
Sound paneling,

250
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,220
just beyond anything drastically.

251
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,020
A number of major motion pictures
were scored in. It's right.

252
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,820
And we have a couch here that the
original owner left behind that leg,

253
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,700
Dr Dre sat on screen,

254
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,360
all these crazy directors and this
guy was a composer for films. Yeah.

255
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,120
So it's a cool, it's a great studio. I
can't wait for y'all to see her next week.

256
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,150
Hopefully I'm your mom and you're
my son and I fall in love with him.

257
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,670
Are you really? I said yes.
He said, you know what,

258
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,830
I was scared to let you know too. I
am too. Both consenting adults. If,

259
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,140
if it comes down to it, you know, it's
just like the gays. There's dairy.

260
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,710
As long as they're over 18 everything's
fine. It's just like the gays,

261
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,460
the gays.
Do you they just like the gates.

262
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,830
The gates.
Yeah.

263
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,490
So homosexuality, let's set
this up. These two dumb dumbs,

264
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,980
they have that real
dumb way of speaking to,

265
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,440
you know,
he's,

266
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,060
I'm your mom and you're my son
and I if falling in love with him.

267
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,940
And so I guess the story is this,

268
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,700
my fucking lunatic woman gave
this guy this kid up for adoption.

269
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,870
Oh cool mom.

270
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,890
And then they were
reunited 20 years later.

271
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,150
And then they fell in love.
That's sweet. Wonderful Story.

272
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,340
I mean,
and he talks real dumb like mom does.

273
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,700
You can tell that they're
related in that photo.

274
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,440
Apple doesn't fall far from the
stupid tree man. These two idiots.

275
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:20,730
I mean, is there anything more
repulsive? It's just like the gay

276
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,690
man. So good. That's a,
that's about 19 1991 logic.

277
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,300
I mean, there you going to marry your
dog. I think people still say crazy stuff.

278
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,440
Yeah. I got to tell you, as
a mom, as a mom, as a mom,

279
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,310
I'm a mother and a wife that,
and I'm also in show business.

280
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,200
The thought of falling in love with
my son. It's just not on the table.

281
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:55,170
Why you have a father?
What's wrong?

282
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,030
The other day when we found
this clip, you're like, well,

283
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,200
what did it take for you to date your dad?
I think you said,

284
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:09,150
I'd rather you said something horrible.
I'd rather like be drown or execute.

285
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,850
I would literally rather die a slow,
horrible death.

286
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,600
The only way I would do it is
if is if they were like Ellis.

287
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:23,730
His life depends on this happening. I'd
be like, absolutely. Like it's my son.

288
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,010
But yeah, no, I do anything for that boy.

289
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,960
Look at this kiss and they both have
teardrop tattoos, which is Kinda Nice.

290
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,860
I'm pretty sure would you French or knows?

291
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,070
Like I love my mom and she's like,
I love you too.

292
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,290
And like, and then we keep, here we go.

293
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,200
Now I think I'm falling in love with,
will you ever date your mom? And he said,

294
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:52,980
well you did your son. And I said the
honest truth. Yes I would. Oh cause uh,

295
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,380
19 years you're the best thing that ever
happened to me and I really want to be

296
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:00,580
with the rest of my life. I'm going
to throw up. So can we talk so dumb.

297
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,970
Come you talk to him. Ah, wait for 19
years, it's the best thing that happened.

298
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:11,060
Or why did you give him up for adoption
there? I don't know. I mean, God,

299
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,310
she's all kinds of fucked up.
She asked him that,

300
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,940
that ever important question asked them,
will you ever date your mom?

301
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,300
No. No. I asked to awesome.

305
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,820

306
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,400
well you did your son and I sit
and honest truth. Yes. I would.

307
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:47,530
Honest to goodness 19 years,

308
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:50,260
you're the best thing that ever happened
to me and I really want to be with the

309
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:54,870
rest of my life. Yeah. Dummy. It's called
having a child. You dumb. Fuck, I'll,

310
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,920
could you imagine banging
your head just no grow,

311
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,680
not that little boy grows inside of you.
You push him out of your,

312
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,040
your meow and then you know, sex with one
of your parents. It just like the gays.

313
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,530
The first approach was actually
me. Oh. What happened was we were,

314
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,120
we were hanging out and you know,
just talking and all and just laughing.

315
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:22,740
And I looked at her and she looked
at me and I kissed her. Oh my God,

316
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,813
here's a real quick,

317
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,740
it was a real case. Uq is was a real good
cause or okay, here's the real cause.

318
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,310
It's just like the gays.
Yeah.

319
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,390
Yeah. Damn it. These two. Oh Man.

320
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,630
I don't know. You gotta
stay in school, you know,

321
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,080
that's what you took away from this guys.
He's gotta go to fucking school.

322
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,880
You know,
you gotta study,

323
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,800
you gotta you gotta not marry your mom
and you got to not be like the gays.

324
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,050
Yeah. All that fancy book, all that
fancy book learning. Seriously though.

325
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,690
Real talk word.
What would it take for you to date?

326
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:07,691
Charro I want to fucking hit you for
even asking me such a disgusting thing.

327
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,390
Oh, like, oh, so, and she likes

328
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,380
like, Woo, I'm your mom.

329
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:22,400
Would you ever date consider dating your
mom? That's the question she asked him.

330
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,760
I would like, uh, uh,

331
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,150
what a beautiful courtship story too.
One day I was like,

332
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:32,090
would you ever date your mom?
And then he was like, yeah,

333
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:35,630
I want to do my mom who was
a real kid cause or okay.

334
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,690
Sometimes I call him,

335
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,870
he know Hito at that means son
wants to know why he calls me mom.

336
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:44,310
You know what I mean?

337
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,600
Thank our cases about whether I have
the right to love somebody and I sure as

338
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,780
hell have the right to let Monica know
it's not about whether you're the right

339
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:54,320
to love somebody. You could definitely,
you have the right to love your mother,

340
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,760
right? I guess the courts are taking
them to task and so they're like,

341
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,740
why can't they just stay in their house
and not telling anybody the weird by

342
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,440
yourself,
you have to marry somebody locally.

343
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,960
Like why don't you just do your
weird shit and keep it quiet?

344
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,380
You're not going to fight for
the right to marry your mom.

345
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,980
I don't think society is going to
get on board with that one guys.

346
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,840
I don't think so either. Jesus just
be goddamn weird at home. Right.

347
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:26,110
It's like it's like you always said,
you know, you've always said no.

348
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,570
No. You've always said, why? Why
do you have to tell everyone?

349
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm proud to have come out as polyamorous
and now I'm excited to share that I'm

350
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:36,770
bisexual. I'm like, why you want to tell
everybody? No, nobody needs to know.

351
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,970
This guy was like, I told my parents over
Thanksgiving dinner, and you're like,

352
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,401
why?

353
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:45,401
Why let them eat stuff and they don't
need to know your 70 year old parents

354
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,050
don't want to know who
I'm poly and I'm bi.

355
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,810
I'm Paula and I'm by dad, buddy.
Hey, got to tell you something.

356
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,630
I'm Paula and I'm by

357
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,740
Pauley and I'm buying like they're old.
They're old.

358
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,420
They don't want it. They don't care. Or
in this case like nobody cares. Well,

359
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,910
it's disgusting.
People care if you inform them,

360
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,460
but no one cares if they don't know.
Fuck your mom.

361
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:18,030
Go ahead and go fuck your mom with the
doors closed. Shut the blinds. Retard.

362
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,220
No one cares or weird
shit on your own time. No,

363
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,840
don't make it illegal now. Yeah. Well the
thing is I have to marry her. Why? Well,

364
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:27,674
they're dummies.

365
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,560
They don't know how to shut the fuck
up and just do what they gotta do.

366
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,330
Not necessarily talk about it.

367
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,640
Just like people to fucking animals
and do all this weird stuff. You know,

368
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,180
they stay in the shadows. It's, there's
some things you got to keep in the shadow.

369
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,620
Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting.
It's so gross. It is so, so,

370
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,610
so wait a minute. You don't want
to go down on your mom. Oh my God.

371
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:54,360
Shut up from that same suite vision
that you came out of a really, you're,

372
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,810
you're fucking, what about
sucking on those? Ted does.

373
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
It's really gross. Moving on. So

374
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
maybe you could drink milk
again. So I should, uh,

375
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,560
from those low hangers because
swinging hangers, by the way,

376
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:20,420
I want to thank everybody. I
can't even really describe. I,

377
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:20,691
you know,

378
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:25,340
I've had a lot of fun on the road recently
with like just being away from your

379
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,170
family. The best part,
that's the best part.

380
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,080
But the second best
part has been the shows.

381
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,670
And I'm saying raw ball.

382
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,690
Raul meet Charlotte friend
men disco Jude or activities.

383
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,050
Yeah, they've all been so fun. But my God,

384
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,950
this weekend and fill up Delphia

385
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,330
gave every show of the last
year a run for its money.

386
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,870
That's how much fun it was.
The, the crowds were amazing.

387
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,250
And so I just wanted to say thank you
everybody for coming out to the truck.

388
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,670
It was awesome. Man, why don't
you marry him? I wish I could.

389
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,270
I wish I could marry each and every of
you like you were my own mother. Um,

390
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,420
Josh Potter opened for you and what's
new with him? How's he doing? He's great,

391
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,920
man. I mean, same old shit

392
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,610
sell in Buffalo, buffalo
and Barthalow. Uh,

393
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,780
he's still doing his thing. He was Hila
he killed, he killed, I guess Twitter.

394
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:24,770
Is he on Twitter? Can we give him a shout
out to help? Oh yeah. Um, let's see.

395
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,810
What does Josh Potter, Josh,
I love Josh Potter. He's,

396
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,580
he is very funny and he's a,
he's super,

397
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,080
he's one of those dudes that's funny
offstage to where you're just talking to

398
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:38,090
him and you're like,
this guy's crazy funny.

399
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,360
His self deprecation is so super good.
He's at j underscore

400
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,610
potter, p. O. T. T. E r underscore
pop. Yeah, she's on, um,

401
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,250
shred and Reagan in buffalo
in the mornings. Um,

402
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,730
he's really a great guy,
but like,

403
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,220
I probably got hit up after that show.

404
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,730
I can't tell you how many times that
people asking you about who he is too,

405
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,460
so that's wonderful. Yeah,
it's really good. And he's,

406
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,471
it's sweet.

407
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:08,880
Due to which he had great sets and
he and throat Zillow were dating.

408
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:12,090
Is that true? Well, I mean
they met, but I'm right.

409
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,260
I think it reminds me I am going
to her city later in the year.

410
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,960
Maybe I should bring him again.
Yeah, that's a great idea.

411
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:22,830
Maybe those two can spark up kind of a
connection. Be a little love connection.

412
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,660
Cause they start a connection last time.
Well they certainly got, you know, they,

413
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,550
there was a hello and a goodbye.
I don't know if anything happened.

414
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:33,270
I mean I don't, I don't hold his hand
when we walk around and kiss. Uh,

415
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,080
Josh is the one that turned us on
to her snapchat. Josh turned me on

416
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,820
the whole story. Josh was the
one who let it be known, uh,

417
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,020
who she is and, and what
exactly what was going on. The,

418
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:51,690
the story of course was
about, um, you know,

419
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,470
her and a famous athlete. So, sure.

420
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,200
He told me about that story
and I was like, wait, what?

421
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,060
And then he actually is the one who he,
uh,

422
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,223
he's the one that,

423
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,350
that got me thinking about which position
in football has the best captain worst

424
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,900
cap assholes. Really? Yeah.

425
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,250
And that's an ongoing conversation
that we've had and we had it. Oh yeah,

426
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:20,970
we had it. Even this, uh, this weekend
in the car with the Uber driver was like,

427
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,810
who do you think has the worst?
Kept a whole,

428
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,170
you really got to understand football

429
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,530
to have a, an opinion. I'm just
asking, can you just give me the top?

430
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,160
Well we basically excluded
everybody but Lineman, you know,

431
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,370
so we have our top tier grade a assholes
are like the quarterback diva receivers

432
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:44,461
we decided are probably like just nice
assholes like and very well kept clean

433
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,980
and, oh no, sorry, I misunderstood.

434
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:52,480
I thought you were talking about the
best of the best are probably wide

435
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:56,770
receivers, diva corners and quarterbacks,
you know, like the best. Why do you think,

436
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,670
uh, it's just, you know, that we,

437
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,540
they just appeared to be guys that
take a lot of pride in appearance.

438
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,010
They take care of themselves physically.
They're in great,

439
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:10,920
phenomenal athletic shape.
And, um, you know, they,

440
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:14,200
they probably take care of everything
including those rosy red assholes.

441
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,920
So that was a conversation he and I had.

442
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,130
And then it w it further got into,

443
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:25,780
well then what would be the worst asshole.
And that's where we,

444
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,870
we have a difference of opinion cause I
say offensive line and he says defensive

445
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,720
line. But it's, it's an interesting
theory that he presents.

446
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,060
May I throw out something?
Okay. Yeah sure, sure.

447
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,070
Have you considered, I just think that
sometimes there they have white uniforms,

448
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,110
those tight pants.

449
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,360
And I think that those teams would
have to keep the cleanest be holes.

450
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,170
Oh just cause they have white.
Yes.

451
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,570
Because I can see everything
when they bend over and I'm,

452
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,530
we got the that widescreen
TV. I see. I can see cheeks.

453
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,100
They don't wear panties.
They're not wearing panties.

454
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,570
I can see I outlines of balls.
So I think you can,

455
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,440
you gotta be careful. Cause if the
chocolate smears, if your wipe wipe,

456
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:20,970
wipe wipe and you know,
we to be careful by the way,

457
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:25,050
I've had horrible dumps since we moved
in here cause we don't have our wash.

458
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,930
Let's installed and I've ha,

459
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,490
I had disastrous bowel movements
and I've had to shit to shower here.

460
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,180
Well, it's like really have you really?
Yeah, because I don't have a wash.

461
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:40,050
Let the bad days not here yet.
It's terrible.

462
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah. The wash that we got
to get that hooked up. That's
a, yeah, that's a priority.

463
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,840
But I mean how disgusting was it
to shit on the road without, uh,

464
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,400
it's horrible every time. Like, do
you think this guy's assholes growth?

465
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,120
And let me just see what's what,
what's this person's name?

466
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,390
Bj and he's got a 90.

467
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm going to say I wish I could see his
hair situation because I feel like it.

468
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,180
Does he have dreadlocks? No. No.

469
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,650
Sometimes I feel like people
with dreadlocks or extra
dirty downstairs too. Yeah.

470
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,880
That's just my bias. Then you
feel that way. They're like,

471
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:17,660
if your head smells then
your asshole on your Coochie,

472
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,990
you're going to stink like that too.

473
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,950
Could be maybe, I mean, I've heard people
say that those are pretty bad smelling.

474
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:27,170
Sometimes some drives where
you think this guy smells like,

475
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,840
I think his bee holes clean.
Do you think this guy, wow,

476
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,000
Christina was talking about
Vince Wilfork right now,

477
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,100
if you don't know who that is,
you can look them up.

478
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,410
But I think a lot of people
would look at that and go, oh,

479
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:40,010
that guy's ass holes a disaster.
I, here's why I'm, he's his head

480
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,490
is clean shaven and he groomed
his facial hair nicely.

481
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,860
I think he takes pride in his appearance.

482
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,950
And here's somebody who
doesn't know anything about
football and you're throwing

483
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,510
a whole wrench in the game
right now. Interesting. Yeah.

484
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:57,260
Well sometimes it takes a fresh
perspective on an old timeless problem.

485
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,900
I'm wondering,
um,

486
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:06,650
let's see who we could probably look
at that might change your opinion.

487
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,080
Um, right now, let's see.

488
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,140
See is this guy,
ah,

489
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:21,180
let's say Barnes is he,
he's uh, for the, okay.

490
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,750
You played for the chiefs right
now and see what this guy's ass,

491
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,530
what do you think of his asshole thing?
This guy's an asshole. Smells okay.

492
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,680
First of all,
I think all of their assholes smell.

493
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,190
I don't think there's a football player
alive who's butthole doesn't. Yeah,

494
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:39,390
he's dirty. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Cause he,

495
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:42,570
you can tell he doesn't care about
his face. Okay. Barnes while he's,

496
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:46,940
he's got shared, like you said,
it's groomed, you know? Yeah.

497
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,040
But a man that maintains
facial hair shape,

498
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,370
that's a guy that cares that
his appearance in general.

499
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:55,140
But if you're just clean shaven it's like,

500
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:59,490
well there's effort but not
as much effort. Okay. Okay.

501
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,290
Um, let me, let me pull up. You put a lot
of effort into maintaining your beard,

502
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,183
right?
That's true.

503
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,190
And over the years I've civilized you
to care about your be whole cleanliness

504
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,320
and your body cleanliness, you know? Yeah.

505
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,490
Although every now and then you do slip
up and you'll fly home after a long

506
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,610
weekend of shows not showered and then
demand that I orally pleasure you and

507
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:30,030
I'll be like to have you showered in
the last 24 hours or is this your swamp

508
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:33,670
nuts from your flight and then
everyone makes mistakes. Yeah. Okay.

509
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,950
Who is this guy? He's disgusting.
He's disgusting. This is Cody Wickman.

510
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,560
Now he's a pig. The uh, now
what makes you say that?

511
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,920
It looks like a real nice smile.
Know that facial hair is bad.

512
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:48,630
Facial hair for 30 guy facial hair. He's
got just the chin cover. The shaggy. Yeah.

513
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:52,670
The uh, the one, one
quarter of a goatee. It's,

514
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,420
it's gross. I'm not, I'm not,
he's six, five, 320 pounds.

515
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,220
He's a little boy. Six Five, three
20 says tiny little sweep muffin.

516
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,220
I see what you're doing now. He's a very,
he's a dirt bag. Yeah. You think so?

517
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,930
How about um, well my pain Manning,
Eli Manning. Peyton manning. Eli. Well,

518
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:12,210
you know what they look like.
What do you think Eli is?

519
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:15,600
Retired or Peyton Peyton's. I
love pay it. Can I tell you that?

520
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:18,510
I love his commercials. I think
he's so funny. Like he's, yeah,

521
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,740
he's actually really funny. He is
funny. His timing's great. Yeah.

522
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:25,850
He's a funny dude. Those guys
are clean. I think Greg's clean.

523
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,780
Do you think Greg Robinson? Yeah. Clean
left tackle for our Los Angeles Rams.

524
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,050
Six five three 32.
It's sweaty,

525
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:38,040
but he works hard at maintaining his eye.
He

526
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,170
looked why? What you just read.
Do they live in this city?

527
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,870
We probably could get some of these
guys in here and get their take on this

528
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:46,900
whole perspective. What a neat
idea. I'll be your asshole.

529
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,780
How and who's got the dirtiest asshole
on the La Rams? Well that's, I mean,

530
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,610
come on. It's going to take
us a while to figure out,

531
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,150
but I don't know if someone's listening
and you're in the La Rams. We'll look.

532
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:59,130
I just showed you a couple offensive guys.

533
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:03,840
You said one was was really gross.
Um,

534
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,680
so let me give you a big,
a big defensive linemen.

535
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,320
This maybe you're not
even following a silly,

536
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:15,220
but do you think this his ass smells
bad? Hideous, so maybe terrible.

537
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,010
Maybe you're on Joshua's. Maybe. See,

538
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,660
cause you don't really know
what the position was. No idea.

539
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,620
But she was looking at, uh, Michael
Brocker is right now. He's a mass.

540
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,850
Why the facial hair is all a mess.
But see,

541
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,180
he look how groomed though because
it's too bushy. But see, he's not,

542
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:35,940
there's a lot of attention to that though.
That doesn't just happen.

543
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,930
It's not a good, but somebody
faded that down. Yeah.

544
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:44,420
But I think it needs to be made. The
maintenance is not there. He see Josh,

545
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,140
his theory is that the aggression
with which this position has played.

546
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,720
In other words, these guys are chasing
after the guy with the ball. Yeah.

547
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,840
Leads to a funky or dirty
or asshole. Interesting. You
know, it's an interesting,

548
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,260
you have to really understand
football too. I don't get the nuances,

549
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,290
but that's what, that's part
of why he thinks he's, neither.

550
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,430
One of us talked about facial hair.
Interesting.

551
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,800
Going on aesthetics alone
and Michael Bloggers.

552
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,400
We want to smell your asshole.
Micheal Brecker's. I liked that name.

553
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,320
Michael Brocker dirty and disgusting. That
guy's going gonna fuck you Michael. Oh,

554
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,820
I think so too. And if you don't
want to too bad, cause he has six,

555
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:27,360
five, three 26 God. Yeah.

556
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,600
Michael is a little fucking hold.
You realize these,

557
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,670
these last five guys that showed you,
it would make me look like a child.

558
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,600
That's crazy. Their meat and
cheese. Oof. All meat and cheese.

559
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,470
Big Ole fucks. I think our
son's going to be big like that.

560
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,910

564
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,250
[inaudible] he's

565
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,760
a pitcher. Barks. Pricer

566
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,810
isn't that fantastic? Japanese
class of children. This is adorable.

567
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,860
Not only do we have that, we also
have from India. Oh my goodness.

568
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,820
[inaudible]

569
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,083
Chrysler's

570
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,243
Chrysler.

571
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,450
Chrysler
doesn't go to the gym.

572
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,250
Bon Chrysler
drinks too much.

573
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,710
I took it to another level. This might
be the most impressive one. Yeah.

574
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:45,210
This is an entire class of 40.
You said 40 Indian children.

575
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,720
Adorable little kids. They're
so cute. And the, the teacher,

576
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,380
the woman with this is our first female.

577
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,780
She's like improvising to adding all
kinds of shit. So good. Oh my God.

578
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,643
That was amazing.

579
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,533
Around

580
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,490
all right. [inaudible] is the real water
champ. I don't like it anymore and cute.

581
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,440
I don't like it.
And yeah,

582
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,830
I can't feel,
Geez.

583
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,240
Oh my gosh, I can't, I
can't believe this. I know.

584
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,230
This is truly an international
and this isn't like, um,

585
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,570
like an American teaching abroad.

586
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,010
This is an Indian woman who I'm assuming
listens to the show and then this is

587
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:39,140
amazing. Wow. I'm blown away. I'm
blown away. Thank you for this. So, uh,

588
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,710
Sean, the uh, the Indian edition. Wow.

589
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,170
Look at the children of Kolkata. Oh. Um,

590
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,690
he did it so that they don't
suffer the same fate as burnt. Uh,

591
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,430
and then Chris wrote to us,
I moved to Japan to teach English.

592
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,840
I remember specifically that Mommy,
Tina Aka water champion. Thank you.

593
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:05,070
Asked for a video from Japan. So I
made one for her. I Hope Mommy Bonds,

594
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:09,660
Aka Ivs champion will enjoy this
too. That is from Chris. Let's, uh,

595
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,190
let's see what else is in the,
uh,

596
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:17,100
Burt is being shamed in Calcutta
now. Oh my God. And we've had this,

597
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,310
how many foreign language ones have we
had already? It's count countless. It's,

598
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,180
yeah, it's just, yeah,

599
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,870
you may love Commedia itchy. Both.
How? Comedian number one fat community.

600
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,940
Oh my God.
Is He,

601
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,200
why
does he meet that?

602
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,430
He yes,
he goes,

603
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,260
okay. Yeah. So he goes
eating and you're right.

604
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,280
He goes eating with another
fast friends is friend is bad,

605
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,620
but he is number one back.

606
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,970
He's explaining it. Adorable little
Japanese child. This is so fun.

607
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,040
Think my favorite thing.
God. This is hilarious.

608
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,620
Teachers with kids talking about fat bird.
It's my baby,

609
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,950
right?
Is he fat?

610
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,610
Is he fat?
Yes.

611
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,970
Very good.
Very good.

612
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,810
Oh my God.
He's amazing.

613
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:34,660
Chris had the kids draw pictures of her.

614
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,430
Yeah,

615
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,600
these are fantastic. These
are wonderful pictures. Yeah,

616
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,510
it looks like big titties on Burt Burt's
wearing a diaper and this one. Yep.

617
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,330
It looks like Santa Claus.
And this was so good.

618
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,890
Yeah. Here's a bird in a speedo.
Okay, let's right, right.

619
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,250
Wow. I'm so impressed. I cannot
believe a, so here's the thing, Burton,

620
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,040
I have a weight loss competition going
now, right? Really real now, right?

621
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,620
Just as the holidays come to.
Oh my God, it'd be tricky. Um,

622
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,760
so we have a new side bet going.
Okay.

623
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:16,060
So the big bet is that whoever's
lower has to take the other comedian,

624
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,893
the other friend.

625
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,430
And for some reason Ari Ari get injected
himself when these old is William do it

626
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,540
cause he was the driving force,
he said behind it. Okay. Um,

627
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,510
so the other, the other, the loser,

628
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:38,100
the guy who weighs more has to take the
two other people to like some desirable

629
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:42,540
event. A concert at the
staples center. Yeah. Event.
And it can be in another city.

630
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,190
So it could be like I want to go
to the Superbowl and it's like,

631
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:47,520
do you got to take everybody?
Okay, we have a new side bet.

632
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,350
And it made it really real because
the thing is that's a costly endeavor.

633
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:54,580
So I'd like Burke to spend
that money of course.

634
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:58,820
So we need to slim me down.
Yeah, I got a win. Yeah.

635
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,250
The new side bet is that the
loser has to shave his beard.

636
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,450
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.

637
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,340
And then you can see exactly how fast
it goes or is there's a fat cover up.

638
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,330
It's been a long time.

639
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,010
I know both of you and Bert have
had beards for years. For a while.

640
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,610
And I was looking at this photo we
have above the US back to back here.

641
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:24,620
We took this at Sears a few years ago.
Yeah. Look how thin your beard was. Yeah.

642
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,320
It doesn't look good when it's thin.
I know. It looks good. Bushey yeah.

643
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,250
So I haven't seen your face and I don't,

644
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,000
I can't remember what about
a full shave. Yeah. Yeah.

645
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,140
I don't remember the last time
that you'd done that. So I, when I,

646
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,030
I texted him that I go, how much anxiety
just that give you, and he's like so, so,

647
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:43,740
so much,
so much.

648
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,900
And then he sent me a picture of him at
some press event like years ago without

649
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:53,430
a beard. And I was like, Ooh, terrible. Oh
well it's just what he goes. And he goes,

650
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,050
when I waste so much less than this photo,

651
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,430
I can't even picture Burt without a beard.
I've,

652
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,010
I know ever known him with a beard.
I've seen him without it a while.

653
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:06,030
But you know, I'm kind of banking on a
couple things. First of all, you know,

654
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:10,560
I've been working out a lot. Yeah. Been
eating well. Your stomach is almost gone.

655
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,280
But the other thing I'm banking on is
his gluttonous lifestyle and it's the

656
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:22,470
holidays. And guess what? December I'm
home and he's on the road every week.

657
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,910
Forget it, forget it here, here's the
variable that's going to mass with Bert,

658
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:31,170
the party life cause he's the life
of the party when he's on the road,

659
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,650
it's booze, booze, booze,
every night eating it,

660
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:38,670
two in the morning and then sleeping and
waking up and doing it all over again.

661
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,440
I mean,
I want to win for a lot of reasons,

662
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:42,830
but I also think I have that
in my favor because yeah,

663
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,660
I don't have to get to like
a crazy number to win this.

664
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:50,550
I think if I just get ahead
and, and then, you know,

665
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:54,990
just stay, stay working out the
way less than bird, right when yes,

666
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,270
it could be. Yes. Okay. Um, but you know,

667
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:02,850
I think that, I don't think
he'll be able to dial it back.

668
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,130
Not during the holidays. We know that
because everyone parties in the holidays,

669
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,880
he's renovating the house.
They all live in the same room right now.

670
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:15,420
He's stressed out all the time. So
when he is home, he wants to drink.

671
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:19,830
When he's on the road, he's
going to party. He wants to
party. He's going to party.

672
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,920
Yeah. So where were you guys the last
time we weighed in? Who was ahead?

673
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,920
Who was behind? Well, it's funny.

674
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,810
So when we weighed w when I weighed
in with him on Ari's podcasts,

675
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:35,670
I was two 42 and he said it was
two 40 bullshit. And I go, okay.

676
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:40,680
And then he, uh, he texted me like a week
later, he goes, oh, slowing. Of course.

677
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,650
So actually I haven't had started
off, of course, you way less than him,

678
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,820
but you know, a lot of people came up to
me and fill her up and they were like,

679
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,000
you know, you're, you're smaller
than I saw it last time. Yeah.

680
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,640
I think you're going to beat Bart.

681
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,580
I got a lot of people pulling for me
on this and he's got his, he, you know,

682
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,940
he has loser, like the people that into
him. So there'll be on his side. But like,

683
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,920
you know, I think, uh, I think,
I really think if I stay,

684
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:10,700
I think December is going to
be a big month for me with, um,

685
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:15,400
home virtually the entire
month. Get on the routine. Yup.

686
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,280
Properly. You're, you're, you've
got my support and that we're on,

687
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,180
I'm on primal Kido. We're there.
We're, we're maintaining. Yeah.

688
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,120
Now you're, you're going to
kick his ass jeans. I think so.

689
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:30,640
Of course you're going to kick his
ass. And I think that those, those,

690
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,810
those road days he has coming up.
Yeah.

691
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,950
The thing about it is what
actually happens is the booze.

692
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,150
What happens when you drink a lot of
booze? It leads to more food eating. Yeah.

693
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,910
Yeah. So I think his days are
fine. It's just that when the,

694
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,740
when he starts boozing it up,
yeah.

695
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:49,460
He's then going to need to fill up
the stomach with the alcohol. Yeah.

696
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,590
And don't forget alcohol itself
is, yeah, it's sugar. Oh, sure.

697
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,830
That's a lot of calories.
Yeah. You're, you're talking,

698
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:01,300
that's your daily caloric intake.
How much he drinks. Oh yeah. It's,

699
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:04,570
I'm not Burt's and alcoholic,
so we're doing, you know,

700
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,690
we've got a real thing going on.

701
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,420
Say saying that real talk in order
for Bert to defeat you. Yeah.

702
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,660
He would have to stop drinking.
Right. In which case, yeah, he could.

703
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,010
And that was his big, if that was his
big goal, he could do it, you know,

704
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,340
cause he's just like the gays,
you gotta you know,

705
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:27,500
it's just like the gays. Yeah. Jesus.
What a couple of knuckleheads. Huh?

706
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,240
So anyways, that's our
new side bet. The Shave,

707
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,280
the shave to me is way worser then
the sporting event. Oh my God.

708
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,550
Cause that's just money. But yeah,
this is like, that's embarrassing.

709
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,560
It's embarrassing.
And if I were to do it,

710
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:46,830
that means I would go to I think
Kansas City with a fully shaved face.

711
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,180
Well, the good thing for you is
that your beard grows back so fast.

712
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,920
It grows back so fast,

713
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,270
but it would be shaved for longer
than you think it would. Uh,

714
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:02,050
it would take to the end of the month
to start looking like myself again.

715
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,630
I wish you guys would shave your
heads too. That would make me laugh.

716
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,770
I'm going to get a haircut on
Wednesday. Oh, go on Allen. Oh,

717
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:14,280
hi. Oh, hi again. A common, that was boy.

718
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,540
Oh, okay. I can't wait for TG
jeans. Did you use a lot of fun?

719
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,710
We're gonna to make a feast.

720
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:24,740
I've decided to cook full
American thanksgiving because
we haven't done it and

721
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,790
ears. Just as we wrap up, weight
loss talk, you're like, yeah,

722
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,900
I'm going to make a fucking feast.
Ummah.

723
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:34,300
I got us a smoked Turkey from honeybaked
ham and I got us a honey baked ham and

724
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:38,560
then I'm going to do green bean casserole.
Sweet potatoes. Yup. I'm going to do,

725
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:43,240
I'll do Mac and cheese. A
omics, omics, Pumpkin Pie.

726
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,750
One day you can fall off the
wagon for one day. Yeah. You know,

727
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,110
but you know what the funny thing is the
leftovers. I'll just give them to Sarah.

728
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:50,944
She's coming over.

729
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,360
The funny thing about when you start
eating healthy or like sticking to

730
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:59,530
something you like,
don't even really want no to that stuff.

731
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:05,530
It's a total bummer. Yeah. What
do you look at for motivation?

732
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm mixed flow. I live in North
Carolina and I'm aware of model

733
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,280
meet Nikki,

734
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,910
otherwise known as ms flow.

735
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,890
I think the name is flo cause I
thought it was killed and I flat fee.

736
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,600
How would you what? What do
you, her asshole smells like
it is never clean. Yeah,

737
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,460
she weighs 700 pounds.
She's a big girl.

738
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,600
I Dunno if it's seven, but I
mean it's, it's definitely,

739
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,360
it's definitely gotta
be like close to five.

740
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:44,810
I'm thinking it's Manwell your rebate.
It's really bad.

741
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,230
She looks like she's the couch.
She's kind of, Oh my God.

742
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,300
How much to go down on ms fluff.
Oh, okay. Here's what'd you read it?

743
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:54,920
You got to either,

744
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,420
would you rather French or
mom or go down on ms fluff.

745
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,050
I mean go down on ms fluff,
but it's not going to be nice.

746
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,050
Now way her legs are glued.

747
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,160
There's like she's got that fat person
thing where she gets lesions from where

748
00:51:10,161 --> 00:51:13,430
the fat lives together.
It's really bad.

749
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,040
I mean this is no way to live. This is
not, no, no, that's not, that's not,

750
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:23,390
she's not like overweight or fat.
You know, this is life threatening.

751
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,320
This is this belt. Wait, I
mean this is like, of course,

752
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,350
you know a doctor would be like, we
need to hospitalize you. Of course.

753
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,920
Know something is mentally wrong with
this person. She's like, I'm a web model.

754
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,410
I'll carry it there.

755
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,390
You've got a lesion and salt.
I don't believe, by the way,

756
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,100
I don't believe that she believes she's
doing. I believe that she does the cell.

757
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,700
You know she can sell it, but
no, she knows she's a disaster.

758
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,120
She's turning the negative into a
positive, but I don't buy it either.

759
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,370
I just love myself like,
no you don't.

760
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,880
There's no way you can be into
being that fat. No way dude.

761
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,590
Do with people like jerk off to
this like do. She has a pay site.

762
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,090
People are paying.
It's so great.

763
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,890
Is there a site where I could
sell my soggy mom tits and my,

764
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,460
my destroyed mom body.
Is there a,

765
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,020
is there a ha a soggy mom body site,

766
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,920
post partum bodies. Come on. No, I
am. My tits are fucking destroyed.

767
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,420
Yes they are. Why are you lying? You're
making it sound like you're miss fluff.

768
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,060
I am. This fluff. You're
not. Okay. Let's go on.

769
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,720
Jesus.
Fuck my ass and I want my age.

770
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,550
My body is my arm up.

771
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,630
You see how my fingers can
actually get loud and, oh

772
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,120
wow.
It looks like dough.

773
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,560
She was like the Michelin man
but fatter her arms or the sand.

774
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,960
Like it just kinda goes through it.
Yeah, totally. Totally not good.

775
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,290
She likes her ass. She wants
it to go bigger. Yeah. Far,

776
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,793
far

777
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,190
less fluff uses has super
sized soft body to make cold

778
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,250
hard cash is 1599 for 30 days
subscription and you know,

779
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:36,300
you could see the pictures, videos
and all, all that good stuff.

780
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:42,910
But I have had was to do a fart in BDO.

781
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,340
This is the one fan told me,
he was like,

782
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:51,330
I'll pay you $5 a fart and
I need response on them.

783
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,500
So he said, I will give you $100 if
you could just make a couple farts.

784
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:59,910
Ought to be. I was like, you know
what, that's not really my thing.

785
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:04,520
This is good. This bitch has
it all figured out. Here we
are working for a living.

786
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:08,920
He's got a Fart in a Web Clark
far.

787
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,670
I can't believe how dare she.
She did it.

788
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,310
She can't turn down $100 for a couple
of farts. Come on man. I would do that.

789
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,413
Ooh.

790
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,640
$400 for a couple of
farts. Would I do it? Yeah,

791
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,590
you. Of course I would do it. We do
them for free on this shit. Yeah.

792
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,650
I tried to Fart on Mike all the time.
I had a big fart before we were rolling.

793
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:43,200
We got to get those fart mix. Yeah.
Get the card, making them out of it.

794
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,800
Making sure the nanny's not
texting us. Maybe we'll do, um,

795
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:52,930
I think we should do a show
where we have some meal before.

796
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,130
It'll create a lot of parts. I
just made some Chili, I feel like,

797
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:02,270
but you got to time it right. There was
that Peruvian joint on the east side,

798
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,090
Don Felix, where we had
Lomo site though. Yeah.

799
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,300
And it would give me so many farts.
Interesting.

800
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,910
I've never heard you say that before.
Why?

801
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:15,440
Why is something about it was like there
was some type of oiliness to the way

802
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:20,441
that they made it there where whenever
I ate it for dinner the next morning I'd

803
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,950
be in bed like mom prom.

804
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,310
So maybe we need to have that one day
and Brussel sprouts make me Fart a lot.

805
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:29,270
Oh yeah,
that'll do it.

806
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,230
Collywobbles but it's a timing issue
because for me it takes a few hours.

807
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:35,750
Well that's the thing is we're going to
have to really work on this, you know?

808
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,950
But that's what scientists do. I
mean, you know, trial and error,

809
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:41,570
it keep trying to get it right.
Did I get it wrong? Right.

810
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,970
It's important for the listeners,
for sure.

811
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,180
For a

812
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:54,320
damn. She is so fucking, she's
an enormous person. Jesus Christ.

813
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,210
Normous good.
Laura.

814
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:01,240
She's a made good money
because you can show,

815
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:06,930
right or you can charge on one thing
is they will put it on your website.

816
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,270
So it would be like double that they,
but when I do special quizzes videos,

817
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,040
I don't really put it on my website.

818
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:16,820
I kind of let it be like you're a private
gifts to you. You know what I mean?

819
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:22,000
Do you think she's going to marry
her mom soon? She talks about,

820
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:26,310
was it just like the gays? She's
about as bright as the, uh,

821
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,310
the mom and son team that open mouth
like you good judge and she was out of

822
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:33,640
breath right there. I know. She's
just sitting there putting on a show.

823
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,730
This poor woman. I actually, I mean
she needs to go to the hospital.

824
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,550
She needs a surgery.
Yes.

825
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:45,040
Why do you think people like to see you
trying on clothes that are too small?

826
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:48,940
What does it do?
Mix the losing of me.

827
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:52,170
Maybe even more enormous that I am.

828
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,930
I like it too though.
I like to hear the sound,

829
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,063
ah,

830
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:04,883
putting

831
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,423
shirt.

832
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:16,210
Now the question is how am I going to,
uh,

833
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,090
but the point is
what kind of Gig?

834
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:26,560
The incredible hall.

835
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,590
What kind of Gig could she have?
Like, you know what I'm saying? No.

836
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:35,130
Just making the best of her
horrific situation. Like if she,

837
00:57:35,131 --> 00:57:39,770
she can't really work in an
office because, you know,
yeah. But she should, I mean,

838
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:43,040
I get it, but she needs to work
on staying alive. You know,

839
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,780
she's past the point of like, ah, uh,

840
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,940
if if she were a couple hundred
pounds less, yeah. Doing
this site, I'd be like, oh,

841
00:57:50,941 --> 00:57:54,320
okay. I get, but right now, like she
looks like she's going to die. Yeah.

842
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:57,170
She's killing herself with food.
Yeah. He's just not a good thing.

843
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:02,230
I'm a food whore. I like
expensive, nice phone.

844
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,820
See Food and it's this band cause I don't,

845
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,670
oh my God,
she's eating,

846
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,870
she's eating a watermelon and
she's topless in bed. Yeah.

847
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,590
She's eating a water man.
You don't see that all the time,

848
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,130
but everybody likes food. You just
have to be like, hey, I can't eat.

849
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,230
Part of the illusion though, when you're
fat, but the denial is you go like, oh,

850
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:29,500
I like food. I like it
so much. It's my thing.

851
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,630
The reason other people aren't like this,
right.

852
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,540
They don't like it as much as I
do. Right, right. You just, yeah.

853
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,410
You know what I noticed with being
on this diet thing is that I would,

854
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:43,510
I would make food a prize for
something, like a reward. Like, oh,

855
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:46,570
I had such a bad day, but I'm going
to reward myself with cookies.

856
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,080
Or like the reward can't be food.
Right.

857
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:53,440
It can't be the emotional
outlet. Like I'm, I'm lonely.

858
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm just going to eat something.
And that's totally what I did. Yeah.

859
00:58:56,890 --> 00:59:00,700
The other thing is like the
mindfulness, you know, of going,

860
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,640
of reaching for food.
But if you stop and you go,

861
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:05,440
am I eating this cause I'm hungry,
right.

862
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:10,330
Or am I eating this because I'm just
trying to like, uh, Phil, you know,

863
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:15,690
fill this a moment of feeling
nervousness or anxiety,

864
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,570
you know, instead of smoking a cigarette,
I'm going to, yeah, yeah. This thing,

865
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:23,750
wherever he is, smoker, quits,
gains weight always. Some
of them gained incredible.

866
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,310
Yeah. But I've seen people put on
50, 60 pounds. 80 pounds. Yeah.

867
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,690
And you can see it how,
I'm sorry,

868
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,840
I was just drinking water because
I'm the champion. Yeah, you can.

869
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:38,270
Where's your water? I'm interested
in the cameras aren't rolling. Yeah,

870
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,800
but where's your water?
I'm just curious.

871
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:44,000
What are you talking about and let them
right here. Let me hear you take us up.

872
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,520
Oh, you're such a faker. You're drinking
your imaginary water. No drinking water.

873
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:53,900
I have water right here. Okay. Um,
I forgot, even when I was saying,

874
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,820
I don't fucking know. The point is it's,
it can't be an emotional thing. No,

875
00:59:57,821 --> 01:00:02,420
that's a problem. Yeah. As with anything,
it's hard not to have addictions,

876
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,820
alcohol, cigarettes, food. It's
just an easy thing, you know? Yeah.

877
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:12,110
It's, it's tough. It is tough.
It's hard to be a vice free sober,

878
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,200
essentially. I mean, and you know, and
I, yeah, cause food is, is uh, isn't it?

879
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:20,940
Addiction thing. Everything.
Yeah. Sex, gambling,

880
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,210
alive fruit. Shake it
for me. I think I eat,

881
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:28,640
she can't lie.
You don't know how much I eat.

882
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,470
Do you eat fried chicken
from a seeking something?

883
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:36,380
Just fried one pool. She, if she
just had like chicken breasts,

884
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:39,230
she would not be this fat.
Yeah. No, of course not. No.

885
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,120
She's eating like the buckets, you
know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah,

886
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:49,330
yeah.
Oh

887
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,390
yeah. Oh No. And I was like,
would you ever day your mom? Hmm?

888
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,220
He's like, yeah, I will do my mom. Oh,

889
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,280
Tom, let's do the scene.
Okay. I'll be your mom. Okay.

890
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:08,000
So like would you ever
consider dating or mom?

891
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,750
And I was like, uh, yeah.

892
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,430
I mean I liked her and I was like,

893
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,100
do you like me to, yeah. Uh,

894
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,260
sometimes I call you like
my son or one of Quito,

895
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,210
but not all the time
because you're my son.

896
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:34,290
I wanted to make sexes with you
and like I made the first move.

897
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,260
Uh, I was like, what's up? And she
was like, hey. And I gave her a kiss.

898
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:44,670
It was like a real case, but it was
like a real kiss. Huh. But it's like,

899
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,580
what's the big deal? I mean,
just like the gays, you know,

900
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:53,370
over 18 is like oil.
It's a big deal.

901
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,780
You know, it's a big deal. I love
my mom cause they were okay. It was,

902
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:03,050
it was it just like the gays for um,

903
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:08,340
a lot of good drops on today's. Yeah.
Some good stuff in here. Far and far,

904
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:13,230
eh, so we got an email here, dad accents.

905
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,870
Hi,
Mommy's in episode three 69,

906
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,190
master of accents and water. Mommy. Tommy

907
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,400
talked about how top dog would speak to
Peruvian family members in English the

908
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:27,780
same way they would speak English.

909
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,060
I thought you might find
it interesting that my dad,

910
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:35,061
a white CIS gender man does exactly
the same thing with Asian people.

911
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,110
My Dad makes toys for a living,

912
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:41,940
so growing up he was in China a lot and
he's traveled to many Asian countries as

913
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:43,380
well as many other parts of the world.

914
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:47,040
You would think a well traveled mommy
such as himself would be respectful of the

915
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:50,910
cultures and dialects. He
as it was exposed to, well
within the last few years,

916
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:55,830
he started doing this really neat
thing or he speaks to Asian people at

917
01:02:55,831 --> 01:03:00,180
restaurants with broken English,
things like this. Good right?

918
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,560
Or food comes soon.

919
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,250
He's also gone as far as to ask
people in a Korean restaurant,

920
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,470
what part China you from?

921
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,810
It warms my jeans to hear that the
legendary top dog does the same thing and

922
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:18,420
that our dads have something
really neat and common.

923
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,880
Hope you want me to have a stress remove?

924
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,540
I'll see Tom on December 30th mom,
Lando,

925
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:29,550
Bo through that is so fucking
funny. I like that. It's so amazing.

926
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:33,420
The Broken, oh my God. It's
such a fucking dad move.

927
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,280
And he does. My Dad does it
like, it's so embarrassing.

928
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:43,620
And he's like, what? Why neato neato
because he doesn't do, he can't,

929
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:48,621
he can't do any like correct
Spanish like Juanito today.

930
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,220
And you enjoy the very nice no,

931
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,530
the museum. No. And they're
like, see, I had a good time.

932
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,930
Yes.
Tomorrow maybe you'd like,

933
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:08,070
we go a very good place to
eat. And they're like, okay.

934
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:11,550
Do like,
why are you talking to him retarded?

935
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:16,950
Because that doesn't help him learn
English better. Oh, this good. Right.

936
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:17,963
Food comes soon.

937
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:25,740
That is fucking such a dad.
Um, mazing God damn boy,

938
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,680
I got to fucking figure out a way
to incorporate this in a more,

939
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:32,820
it's so fucking funny.
I love that he does that.

940
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,553
I really love it.

941
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,330
I wish we could get a recording
of your dad doing this to someone.

942
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:44,760
Does he do it in restaurants to
your dad? Oh yeah. No. But if,

943
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:48,450
if anyone, if there's another
culture, especially Latin,

944
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,440
I think it's like he's saying his dad
spends a lot of times and a lot of time in

945
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:54,150
Asian countries,
it's the,

946
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,350
it's the foreign culture you're most
associate comfortable with that you do it

947
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:02,670
to the most. So my dad would do it
probably two more Spanish speaking people.

948
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,190
Right? So if someone
was Spanish, he would,

949
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:10,050
he would start speaking retarded English
stuff that a Spanish version would

950
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:14,400
speak and this guy does it to Asian
people, which is just outstanding.

951
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,750
These good, right. These
are good. Will come soon.

952
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,520
Oh, I can imagine too that
those people are always like,

953
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:31,630
why is that guys speaking?

954
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,640
Talking day that I imagine my cousins
too would probably like of everyone I

955
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,760
spoke to today, only he talked
to me about that person. Yeah,

956
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:44,330
because I never ever was like,
you like school fun today? No.

957
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:50,180
Oh my God. Now you slow it
down for a foreigner. Right.

958
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:54,850
You know, you speak
slowly. I'm a listener.

959
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,160
Wrote this and hey Tom,
wake up.

960
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:02,290
Dan Pena is trying to bang your wife.
No, please. This is textbook billionaire.

961
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,610
Evil Villain behavior.

962
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:08,860
Penny is trying to get Christina all up
and Guthrie Castle and added those genes.

963
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,640
Keep your enemies close and your
genes closer and best of luck,

964
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:17,380
a concerned fan of the show.
Joshua.

965
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:20,950
Thank you very much. Um, I wouldn't worry.

966
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,400
I think Dan's got a wife
that he's really into.

967
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,170
I don't think he needs to squeeze on
my tits. You know what I mean? Um,

968
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,410
well thanks to the unexpected.

969
01:06:30,411 --> 01:06:33,670
A hundred or so episodes that
you guys put out all at once.

970
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,240
I decided to go back and listen to
some classics and a recent Mama.

971
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:41,380
So Tina claimed to have a story where
she went to the dentist and they told her

972
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:42,520
she had 15 cavities.

973
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,780
So she went to another dentist where
they told her that she had none bonds.

974
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:51,460
Looking baffled was like,
hmm. Yeah, that's my story.
Well thanks to some free time.

975
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:55,540
I listened to episode 78
with Bill Burr and tamp.

976
01:06:55,541 --> 01:07:00,541
Tom told the exact same story and not a
peep from Tina should have spoken up at

977
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:05,650
that time. I don't know. Liar. Hedo eight.

978
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,460
See something. Say something, Derek.

979
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,900
Because I remember when bill was in our
home that was back in silver lake and

980
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:18,210

All right. Yeah. Well, you know, just,

981

987
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,160

Correct. Jesus Christ. You know,

1071
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:16,990
I don't know. I feel like I should be
able to choose who gets to live you. Yeah.

1072
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,130
Like number one od. There should
be, okay, here's the thing. Yeah.

1073
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:25,720
I think there should be a basic
Iq test for living for life. Yeah.

1074
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,090
And if you fail,
you're just not on the planet or you just,

1075
01:13:28,091 --> 01:13:32,250
we send you somewhere else. Yeah. I
don't know where. Maybe you cut Alaska.

1076
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,190
It doesn't make the cut. This guy, he does
not make the cut. We ship them to some,

1077
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:38,570
like the Arctic. Arctic Tundra. Yeah,

1078
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:43,150
in Alaska somewhere really hard to live
and if he can survive, he gets to live,

1079
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,720
but I don't do, you don't just
get to live and being this dumb.

1080
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,120
Same with the incest. Yeah. Couple.

1081
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,020
I think we give them an Iq test
shift from ship them off town.

1082
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,690
They would fail without question.
This guy might pass.

1083
01:13:55,691 --> 01:14:00,250
You don't know if he built a truck and
made it into can't. I mean you never know.

1121
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,220
washing my cat. He does. Hey

1122
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:24,250
Mudcat, your hands and brush
your teeth. Now. You know God.

1123
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,520
Had you been good at? And the
gray. So lean. Yeah. If it moves.

1124
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,730
How if this week,

1125
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:40,150
wow, so he's got like a makeshift.
It's as true. It says RV.

1126
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,910
Yes. This is, this is
traveling. Showery yeah. Wow.

1127
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:47,200
That dude is special man.
Can I tell you? I have,

1128
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:51,630
I'm not convinced that making
stuff is necessarily the,

1129
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:54,940
the money saver, you know what I
mean? And then it's time and energy.

1130
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:58,910
It took that guy to piece together.
The RFE so happy with it though.

1131
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:03,310
Just by knowing happier
than him. Yes, sir.

1132
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:07,660
Is just glass and that glass,
glass, glass and glass and guys,

1133
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:10,570
the happiest man on the planet.
Um,

1134
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,340
that guy's so stoked.
He's so happy to be alive.

1135
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:17,980
I'm just just groups coming
through. Glass, glass, glass,

1136
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,190
glass.
It was salt the Moose

1137
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,780
that got it. See that's the sound of
joy. That's, that is glee. But this guy,

1138
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,390
he gets class and sometimes he gets glass.
It's glass.

1139
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:37,880
Just this guy's pretty happy too.

1140
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:44,180
I forgot about that.
Yeah, I was pretty happy.

1141
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:47,540
Go really bad by bad bite.

1142
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,740
Um, so you're making us sound
bad and you're like, oh,

1143
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:54,410
these Brits got it all figured out.
What about this shit right here? Okay.

1144
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,591
Okay.
Pops.

1145
01:17:55,591 --> 01:18:00,480
We've had a bit of a rest
time now for some training.

1146
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,370
What's involved in pop place?

1147
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,850
At first seems really simple because
most people think you're just getting on

1148
01:18:05,851 --> 01:18:09,330
all fours, waddling around and
going more for, for the buck buck.

1149
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,730
But it's really so much more complicated.

1150
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:18,930
So there are people that are
wearing puppy or dog zip,

1151
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,860
like leather zip ups,

1152
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:25,500
like s and m dog masks and they're
on their hands and knees. Yeah.

1153
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,170
This guy had them in a cage.

1154
01:18:27,171 --> 01:18:30,370
You had him in a crate now and he's
describing that it's not just about, yeah,

1155
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,530
that you know, I gotta tell Ya. He
didn't sound like he was from Louisiana.

1156
01:18:34,531 --> 01:18:39,120
Did Christina? He's
definitely a UK. I just,

1157
01:18:39,121 --> 01:18:42,300
I don't you feel like this shit,
like how much fucking free time?

1158
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,590
How do these people have time to
dress up in latex dog costumes?

1159
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:50,740
I barely have time to fucking
take a shower every day.
You know what I'm saying?

1160
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:55,610
These assholes have time to for fucking
puppy play. Getting their dicks hard and,

1161
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:58,550
and latex dog costume.
Really don't have time to do anything.

1162
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,160
Like fuck has time for this shit.
Yeah.

1163
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,580
That's an addiction I guess in the
way I feel it was in Baltimore.

1164
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,460
I feel I have to look to what,
Oh my God.

1165
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,880
It's kind of like being
part of a secret club.

1166
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:16,050
Take the past time involved the whole,

1167
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:20,143
Oh boy.

1168
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,430
He knows something else going on here.
You know. So many ladies are in the room

1169
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:29,610
zero. Whenever it gets real
weird. It's only, it's only,

1170
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,833
only browse

1171
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:34,390
and they, they're dressed up in the
dog. They in there smelling each other.

1172
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:36,880
And why howling?
It's just like the gays

1173
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:41,830
and there's a fuck swing hanging.

1174
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,830
Yeah. And they're in there.
Yeah. They're leather dog outfit.

1175
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,880
I liked that they had to do the math.
The interview with the mask on. Right.

1176
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,810
It's not just about a Isabelle.

1177
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,230
You think you could take
the mask off for that dude

1178
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:03,140
in my guys, I work as a doc.
Doctor. GP is a really, really busy,

1179
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,170
it's tiring. It's exhausting. So
he doesn't have time for this.

1180
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,980
Having the outlet off

1181
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,730
pup play gives me,
oh recreation,

1182
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:15,660
you gotta be fucking Shit that we all
have animalistic passions as humans.

1183
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,490
We are sexual adults and my animal
just happens to be a bit more German

1184
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:21,324
shepherd.

1185
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:24,370
This is insane.
This is a general physician.

1186
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:29,050
I know it's usually professional people
that have high stress jobs that like s

1187
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:31,750
and m in this stuff, but how so?
How are they fucking each other?

1188
01:20:31,751 --> 01:20:36,490
Cause they're in full body latex costumes
and they did they unzip their dicks

1189
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:39,850
and then fuck each other's butts? I
don't know how this works. I don't know.

1190
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:41,343
I really don't know.

1191
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:46,540
Uh, what draws me to human pup play
is I like the gear. I like the,

1192
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:51,700
the lifestyle of it all just makes
me feel like I am 10 foot tall and

1193
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,700
bulletproof. No, he's mechanic.
Just physical. There is emotion.

1194
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:58,210
Having a,
hold on,

1195
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:03,270
I get to go to my secret persona where
I have no human inhibitions that suits

1196
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,673
reframe.

1197
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:08,090
Yeah.
It's so alarming to me.

1198
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:13,670
This is like more bothersome
than the woman marrying her
son. No, that's not true.

1199
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,600
Well, it's just like the way they talk
about it, it was like, it makes my,

1200
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,330
it makes my ass, I'll put
her to, yeah. The thing is,

1201
01:21:20,331 --> 01:21:25,331
is like I envy that these people are so
in touch with their feelings that they

1202
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,170
can find something like,

1203
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,790
I am so shut off from how I feel
that I could never be like, you know,

1204
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:35,990
what secret are you? Are you
that shut off? And I just
want to be a dog and latex.

1205
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,120
No, but I'm saying that I'm so shut
off. Like I might love this. Oh, right.

1206
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:44,510
Because of who I am. I'm so quick to
be like, fuck you, you fucking asshole.

1207
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:48,590
Oh right. But I wouldn't even be
open emotionally cause he's right.

1208
01:21:48,591 --> 01:21:51,080
Like think about it.
The argument is during the day,

1209
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:55,220
I'm this helpless car mechanic,
but when I put on my puppy play costume,

1210
01:21:55,221 --> 01:21:57,720
I get to be a dog with
no human inhibition.

1211
01:21:57,721 --> 01:22:00,760
So it's his channel of freedom.
Yeah.

1212
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:04,920
But I'm so fucking uptight and
judgmental. I could never get there. Sure.

1213
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,230
I could never get there.

1214
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:12,040
Mahjong wouldn't say it's a specific breed
as such terms of the personality that

1215
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:15,280
it has.
It's a very loyal to see these people.

1216
01:22:15,281 --> 01:22:18,640
This is something I'm a little
bit of social anxiety. I see.

1217
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,920
Wearing the popcorn's
allows a bit of anonymity,

1218
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:25,300
so it means that I can interact with
people and not be so concerned as to what

1219
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:26,140
they're thinking of me.

1220
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,250
Uh Huh.
Okay.

1221
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,700
I didn't go into human pup
play for the six part of it.

1222
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:33,940
The cell phone and things. Oh, I've
had sex with anyone in puffier.

1223
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,420
It doesn't just involve men. I've met
female pups. Yeah. Not many hands on.

1224
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,530
You didn't entirely. I'm still
not in this video. Are there,

1225
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:45,760
let me see any lady outside of
the human pup play community.

1226
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:48,610
There's not too many people that
know that I'm here. I'm pub. Yeah,

1227
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,610
I want to keep it that way. Exactly.
Yeah. Okay. Puffs come present.

1228
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:57,370
God Rice. This guy come present
dripping out of his nose.

1229
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:02,980
We've gathered the pups here
today for training today. Skills.

1230
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:06,280
So Park Hills show me a kneel position.

1231
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,710
Oh Wow. That's like obedience school.
Yeah. I couldn't get into this.

1232
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,720
I mean they'll just give them a
treat. Some cute. I'm doing it.

1233
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:18,330
Hey pulls his dick out right there you go.
Hey you go pups.

1234
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,310
Well that's what we do
with our dog. Yeah. God.

1235
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:26,140
Yeah. When he sent that he's sicker. No,
that belongs to somebody in the room.

1236
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:29,910
We'll don't pop. See you
knew it was mine. Well Doug,

1237
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,200
thank you book

1238
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,650
cause you don't even get to pet them like
at night because they're wearing that

1239
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:38,740
latex shit. Yeah. I don't understand
why they're not wearing fur. Yeah,

1240
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:43,130
that would make sense to me and less
creepy law school. What makes it really,

1241
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,180
any other trainers, there wasn't. What
makes it creepy is the fetish, the latex.

1242
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,650
And he's like,
we don't fuck each other.

1243
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:53,940
Well then what's the point of wearing
fetish stuff? If you're not getting laid,

1244
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:58,800
it's fetishy but not shit's weird guys.
Shit is weird.

1245
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:03,240
It's just like the gaze. This
guy does this body type. Yeah.

1246
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,780
This, it's, it is a very English
thing. Sorry. English listeners. Yeah.

1247
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:10,530
It's the male physique of I've
never exercised once in my life.

1248
01:24:10,531 --> 01:24:12,540
I've never lifted away a day in my life.
I mean,

1249
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:14,400
there's obviously some Brits that do.
Yeah,

1250
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,570
but I'm saying this particular mush
brand of male, it can be American too.

1251
01:24:18,571 --> 01:24:22,740
I shouldn't just single English.
Sure. The guy who's like never ever,

1252
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:25,610
ever lifted a weight. Yeah. That's, yeah.

1253
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,900
Yeah. We got to go, man. This computer's
about to die and I don't have, yes, it is.

1254
01:24:30,901 --> 01:24:34,510
The things that I don't have
is, uh, a charger in here.

1255
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:36,900
Oh God.
Charge your mom

1256
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:40,670
guys. It's thanksgiving. So
thank you for, thank you.

1257
01:24:40,671 --> 01:24:45,671
But say it in the master of fixe
give Thanksgiving and Marika.

1258
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,790
Oh, that's right. If
