1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,600
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,290
Well, well, well go to your mom's house,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,980
Christina.
Interesting.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,360
With the ever increasing demand for
greater speed, an aircraft carrier.

5
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,843
Oh,

6
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,150
oh,

7
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,293
talking about,

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,333
yeah.

9
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,280
Yeah.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,090
We welcome guests to,

11
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,430
I think I appreciate that even more
than I do too. And I, you know what?

12
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,530
I actually think,
by the way that is called,

13
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,930
that is called Canadian denim.
It's by Garrett herder.

14
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,070
Uh,
that's the,

15
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,290
I think that he actually
is the ultimate dad boner.

16
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,510
And here's why we can get
lost in the reaction. Go
ahead. Cause you can get lost.

17
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,800
You can get lost in the reactions. Right.
And think that that's really what it is.

18
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:50,801
But it's actually really about the
reaction to the whatever circumstance.

19
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,540
Right? And so some people are
actually reacting in huge ways,

20
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:00,340
but to truly astounding things
in other, you know, the whales

21
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,380
coming out of the water and
the guy's like, oh my God,

22
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,200
or normal reaction because
it truly is remarkable. Or,

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,410
or when the guy in the plane sees
the eclipse and he's like, Oh man,

24
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,570
I forget the word.
I mean he gets excited,

25
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,300
but that's a phenomenal
thing that he's seeing.

26
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,960
This guy's reacting like
this to a fucking highway.

27
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,950
So I think he's actually the,

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,880
the biggest dad boner of all cause.

29
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:30,880
So it's the level of Dad Boehner is
directly proportional to the stimuli.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,460
Right. Well, so some people have
reacted even bigger than him.

31
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,320
Few because he sounds like he's coming,

32
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,580
but still it's to a highway,

33
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,070
you know who gets that right?

34
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,080
This is him. I mean it's, Oh,

35
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:51,130
the story that this road towels come on.

36
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,320
I mean it sounds like he's drugged.
Yeah.

37
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,700
Do you think it's a mental
illness? I think this guy
has something wrong with it.

38
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:01,700
Yeah, for sure. But you know, I
dunno if he's, if he's truly like,

39
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:05,370
I want to say he's mentally ill to,
to like kind of poke at them. No,

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,750
but I think this guys were really this
excited. I think it's actually genuine.

41
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,350
Oh, oh, oh, oh. That's him for real.

42
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,630
Right. We're running down
the street on the highway.

43
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,400
We pointed out it's very
similar to somebody.

44
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,980
Oh God.
Coming really,

45
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,293
you know?

46
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,480
Do you think it's because maybe he was
watching them build it for so long,

47
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,930
like maybe that's his route to
work every day. I think his level,

48
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,520
his real excitement is infrastructure.
Highways. That's his jam.

49
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:45,750
So when he sees the, the where the, the
fucking highway ends or where it needs,

50
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:46,500
whatever,
yeah.

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,060
He gets that fucking excited about
everyone's got to have something they do.

52
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,620
That's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah.

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,820
Um, I'm sober, I'm so excited to be here.

54
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,660
I spent the last 48 hours
in a courtyard Marriott.

55
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,170
How is that really exciting?
I mean,

56
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,880
it was really neat just to sit in the
brown room and then as I forget how a

57
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,830
boring the days are for stand
up. Yeah. I forgot about that.

58
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,870
Like you have to just fill hours of
time. Yeah. And I didn't do a good job.

59
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,440
I just sat in my room and I watch
Netflix all day and slept well.

60
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,440
I think maybe you did do a good job.
Maybe you're not giving it maybe. I mean,

61
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,330
how are you supposed to do it?
I think maybe you do,

62
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,220
you do a lot more on the road. You're
like, oh, I worked out. I, well,

63
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:38,400
the workouts big to be on the road, I
got to do it. I, I actually at the point,

64
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm at this point now, I won't
do a show without it. Yeah.

65
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,630
See you're good that, that part
of it. But I mean, I do it,

66
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:49,380
I like to do it two hours before showtime.
Wow. That's when I start to sleep.

67
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,720
That's when I start my nap.
Really? Five o'clock. No, I,

68
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,470
if I have a seven o'clock,

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,260
5:00 AM in the gym this way I
can know I can work out. Um,

70
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,010
and I don't try to kill myself.
I try to do enough where I'm like,

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,820
I'm sweating heart rates definitely
up, but I'm not exhausted. And,

72
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:08,654
um,

73
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,420
and this way I feel really alert so
that then I can go back to my room.

74
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:18,290
I don't have to panic, shower, change,
get ready. And then it's like, you know,

75
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,420
I have 15, 20 minutes to get
to the venue. How my day went.

76
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,660
My Day is, I have two beds. There's
one that you sleep in. Yeah.

77
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,470
And the other one you eaten.
And I ordered Postmates and I ate.

78
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,710
I do like the separate beds
and one's for stuff like that.

79
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,860
Put all your shit on it. You
turn the air off, turn it down.

80
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,500
Now you're very suspicious. I
am. Cause I saw you're insane.

81
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,760
Post on Instagram where you showed
that in Sacramento this week.

82
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,560
You had the heat on in your room.
76 I like it. A balmy 76 God,

83
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,000
but that feels good to me.
It feels natural. Normal. I
don't like, I hate cold air.

84
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,460
We ever had a dispute in court.
They would.

85
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,950
They would bring that as
evidence and the divorce.

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,550
The judge would rule against you and
be like, well this is a crazy, yeah,

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,510
just the gavel come down. What about
the end of the jurors would be like,

88
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,930
well what about,
what about what I tolerate as a wife,

89
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,620
like a lot of your boxer shorts setting
and do what I did do while you were gone

90
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:20,420
and I thought about you
because nothing, the farting,

91
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:24,770
the belching,
snoring shit's the constant shifting.

92
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,900
You're always excusing yourself to shit.

93
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,860
You've been doing it much
more than I have. If you,

94
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:32,030
if you want to be honest about it.
How are we rewarding?

95
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,290
Every morning we're hanging
out as a family and you're
like, oh, I gotta go shit.

96
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,670
You always leave the shit first.

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,040
You have to shit at like seven
o'clock in the morning. No, no.

98
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,020
You're gone a long time. Healthy
people should quickly. Yeah, but I,

99
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,790
so I have to check Instagram.
I got to look at the Twitter.

100
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,560
I got it posted on a long, you really
are grinding them out, I guess.

101
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,620
It doesn't take long to come out.
My road dumps are very,

102
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,310
can I tell you what gave me, listen,
if you're having trouble taking a shit,

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
let me tell you what
will kick out your jams.

104
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,090
Go to Starbucks by the
instant coffee at Starbucks.

105
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,900
I drink those on the road instead of
the swell that they call coffee at the

106
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:16,500
courtyard Marriott and I shit like
footlong. Really? Yeah. I did.

107
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,020
Really proud of you. So wait,
what were you going say though?

108
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,420
Kind of lost me and all this.
We're talking about judges. So, um,

109
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,610
I uh, I like to talk more about
Starbucks. Instant coffee. In a minute.

110
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,170
I slept in your, in your spot. And how
was that? It was great. It was great.

111
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,350
And then, uh, one night,
right before I went to bed,

112
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,740
I sat like I sat up and I clip my toenails
in the bed and then I just brushed

113
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:48,050
him to your side of the floor. Yeah.
That's so rude. I let you do that.

114
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,460
Could picture you go like, oh,
like stepping on one and uh,

115
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,250
it's not nice and made me happy.
Let's open this show. Okay. Yeah,

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,860
we've got to do this. Here we go.
That's so rude. Hell, y'all know,

117
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:03,990
I know Kevin Cooley coming in g lab.
Maybe you think this guy's getting railed,

118
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,290
which a lot of people like Joe,

119
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,780
my dog slowly just kind of food or my
dog's going to eat this kind of food

120
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:14,670
because it caused the lower. I want to
test that out and if they get bull shit.

121
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,853
Hmm.

122
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,990
Oh is Randy? Don't bring
anyone in London. Well, well,

123
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,730
well go to your mom's house

124
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,830
Christina.
Cause it's interesting.

125
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,873
Okay.

126
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,780
Yeah, I think our son has
more teeth in this guy.

127
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,190
This guy doesn't have a lot of teeth,

128
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,270
but he's a big burly dude and um,

129
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,490
he's tired of people talking
about comparing a dog.

130
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:28,630
Foods are saying like, my dog doesn't
like that. Yeah. I don't think it's that,

131
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,870
that's not true. Like my debt, my
dog doesn't like, I think people,

132
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:33,540
I think that does happen. Yeah. Dogs,

133
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,860
I've always just eaten whatever
slop we put in their bowl. Like you,

134
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,890
it's similar to how you are.
That's probably true.

135
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,310
But I think some people do our
big end of that saying like,

136
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,700
oh my dog is a big fan
of this and I guess yeah,

137
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,260
dog won't eat that or doesn't like them.

138
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,230
Now he's got a number eight on this
knuckle Auger to more aids to see a hail

139
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:54,730
Hitler. The eight, eight,
eight that's what the white
supremacists, yeah. Let's see.

140
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,780
Ape Letter of the alphabet.

141
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,920
Remember we learned this blue man
taught us this blue band Tati yeah,

142
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,990
cause there was somebody with an
eight, eight, eight tattoo and he,

143
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:06,080
this is when he was in studio and
he's like eight is h. Oh right.

144
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,580
It's the eighth letter of the alphabet.
Will do. We know our abcs. Hail Hitler.

145
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,900
Let's try it. A, B, c, d, e.

146
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,970
F. G. H.

147
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,790
I don't know if he has all three. That'd
be really disturbing if he did. Well,

148
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,010
I mean I,
if the shoe fits,

149
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,040
he sounds like someone
then say hi to Hitler.

150
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,860
He sounds like the kind of
guy that would have, yeah.

151
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,190
Well I don't know if that's fair
to people that sound like that.

152
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,150
There's a lot of people who
sound like they numbed. Dang man.

153
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,530
Hey Hitler. See Danny at Danny.
He's not from the south. No,

154
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:45,980
she says it totally differently to

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,970
kind of sleepy. Yeah, I got
him some Maddie Dell food.

156
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,920
Some kind of body is cheaper.
Can Mighty dog.

157
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,710
Oh, I wouldn't eat mighty dog. At least I

158
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,610
out of the clip. I had
no, we were going there.

159
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,920
Oh my God. He fucking woo. Boy.

160
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,200
Is it done? I think I

161
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,010
can't even do this

162
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,850
for a second cause he's making a video.

163
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,590
Woo.

164
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,333
Why

165
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,620
is this funny? First of all, I
didn't, sometimes I look at clips.

166
00:12:56,621 --> 00:13:00,010
I have no idea this was coming.
I swear to you. I had no idea.

167
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,390
You said you've seen,
right?

168
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,630
I've seen the beginning
wait kind of dog food.

169
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,370
I tried.
That's FIEPs prescription.

170
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,270
That's how you not vomit the
science hill diet or whatever.

171
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,850
Cause he's got that
guy that worked at the,

172
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:20,500
at the dog food place said don't
eat that cause he said it had a,

173
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,080
it's got maggots and stuff,
but then you got a nice ring.

174
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,970
I did get my got a nice ring.
It didn't taste that bad.

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,310
I don't know what this fucking
hillbillies all crying about.

176
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,090
But you think he'd be used to eating
like raccoon and snake and and be

177
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,450
squirreled. Be Fun to hang out
with. What does it say on the,

178
00:13:55,451 --> 00:14:00,130
on this tattoo here you read
it. It's tough. It's that.

179
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,610
Oh it's Stewie isn't, that's two weeks
from the family guy. I don't think it is.

180
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:11,110
It's really weird. Oh yeah, you're
writing. Maybe it's his catch phrase.

181
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,900
I don't know what it is. Look,
at least I did it for a ring.

182
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,410
This guy did it just for the,

183
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,730
he just did it for like youtube likes.

184
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,760
Well that was a very entertaining video.

185
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,420
I would tell him that that was very
entertaining. It's not that bad.

186
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:33,300
What's this fucking sissy crying about?

187
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,920
Can Pussy you hit the road and
you're hitting the road again?

188
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,170
I'm going to Fart next this week and then
I've been single dad. I was doing that.

189
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,380
I left you alone for exactly 48 hours
and now you're a full single dad.

190
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,980
Single Dad,
48 hours.

191
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,040
What happened while I was gone? Uh, we
had a good time actually. It's really,

192
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,910
it's fun, right? Yeah.
Sometimes it's good.

193
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,730
Obviously really trying
moments and yeah, and the, uh,

194
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,400
I think the thing that wears on you
that wears on nerves is when the whining

195
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:12,200
doesn't stop. When you hear like,
do you want this? You want that?

196
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,170
Do you want the other thing? Like when
you, when you offer everything up,

197
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,220
you don't rest. Do you want change? Do
you want food? And they're like, ah.

198
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:22,440
And that goes on and on. That's when
you're like, I'm all right. Yeah.

199
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,900
Is anyone else coming over to help or not?
Yeah.

200
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,580
So I understand that it's hard cause he's,
he only knows a few words.

201
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,230
So what do you want? And then sometimes
they don't know what they want.

202
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,180
That's the other thing.
They just want you to fix it.

203
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,230
But sometimes they're tired, but
you don't, you think that, oh,

204
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,910
do you want to sleep?
And they do,

205
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,720
but they don't know that they
need to work to get to sleep shit.

206
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:50,960
Like they don't know how to,
yeah, it's tough. It wears on you.

207
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,520
But there's a lot of fun moments.
He's the cutest fucking little kid.

208
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,840
So I had a lot of fun with him.
You know,

209
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,810
the only times I get stressed out
or like, excuse me, nighttime,

210
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,480
like if he doesn't sleep through the
night and then I'm up with him all night

211
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,020
and then I have to be with them the
next day alone, then I'm like, oh,

212
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,090
I want to blow my brains out.
Yeah, there's, it's tough.

213
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,820
It's whatever. But the good news
is that you've got a lot of, uh,

214
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,530
check attention at the mall.
A lot of Cherokee country club.

215
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,150
I've got to tell you something.
It's so funny. It's interesting.

216
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,520
I take him to the country club and
you know,

217
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,740
for people that don't know it
here, out here, if you're like,

218
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,680
why are you keep going on the mall?

219
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:37,330
For us it's like we live in
a very hot city and it's,

220
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:42,950
the heat has already begun. It's
like in the 90s, like today it's 93.

221
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,790
Um, is that, let me check my apple
watch to confirm that it was in the car.

222
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,810
So they said in the car,
but anyways,

223
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,910
and then the other day over the
weekend it was really windy,

224
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,310
like trees blew down.
Um,

225
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,450
so that is one of the reasons we go and
it's like, it's, you know, it's space.

226
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,100
It's, it's uh, he can,

227
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,710
he can run stuff for kids to go get lunch.

228
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:07,544
So anyways,

229
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,170
we go there and I notice that I'm getting
a lot of different types of looks.

230
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,890
I'm getting like dudes that are like,

231
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,070
like let's say three guys are having
coffee together at a place looking at me

232
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,180
like she, that guy like that,
that's what the look is look,

233
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,050
just like you see that guy with the
baby, the kidnapper, the kidnapper.

234
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:30,260
Or like as like a woman,
you know,

235
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,220
that's how I read their look.
And I noticed that it's a different look.

236
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,440
Like they don't register a guy with
a three or a five year old like that.

237
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,720
It's up and running and, but when it's
a like our kids 16 months they're like,

238
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,980
Huh. Women too would look at me
curiously like, cause I'm sitting there,

239
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,813
you know,

240
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,030
I'm putting him back in the stroller
because he gets tired of running and I'm

241
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,410
pulling up a part of banana giving a
pieces of banana, here's your water.

242
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:03,150
Like I'm doing all that caretaking thing.
And they're looking at me like,

243
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,530
yeah, where did this guy steal this? His
mom, mom does everything like no offense,

244
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:10,020
but mom is really,
I get it.

245
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:15,021
But she has an interesting real look to
get from strangers and it tells you a

246
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,380
lot. It tells you a lot about, you know,

247
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,800
it was so society and
also these individuals.

248
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,340
I mean some of them are looking at
me because they think that I even,

249
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,740
I shouldn't even be doing that.
Well,

250
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,350
and that's the thing is that people
assume women are natural caregivers. Yeah.

251
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,220
And that's really not
true because you have to,

252
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:37,680
I had to learn how to
take care of an infant.

253
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,920
It's not like it comes out of you and
you're like, oh, I know how to breastfeed.

254
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,190
Like right. No, I, someone had to
come to our house and teach me how,

255
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,020
and then I had to learn
how to change a diaper.

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,170
So it's learned behavior
and men can learn it too.

257
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:54,171
And I don't know why the fuck the
default his mom all the time on every,

258
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:58,290
well, I know why it makes sense
actually. It came out of me, which, yeah,

259
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,620
because as a woman,
and also don't forget your,

260
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:04,030
the actual food source and
I'm talking to you about,

261
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,520
but from the beginning the
woman is the food source.

262
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,610
So it makes sense because we're programmed
biologically for you to have the,

263
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,370
the life grows in you and then you nurture
it. So it's not that crazy. But it's,

264
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,570
it's interesting that you know,

265
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,220
obviously people in times of evolved
and people are looking at me like,

266
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:29,010
what the fuck are you doing?
I mean, he stole baby. Yeah.

267
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:31,290
They looked at me like I was
crazy and I could, you know,

268
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,820
I wasn't like one or two people.

269
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,410
I'm talking about multiple people
throughout this hour at a mall.

270
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:41,160
We're looking at me like, what are you
doing? I know it's sad when people,

271
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:45,090
when men are like, I'm going to babysit
and babysitting my children this weekend.

272
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,330
When my wife goes away. It's like,
you're not babysitting assholes.

273
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,510
Those are your kids.

274
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,100
Why is that the assumption that
only mom can take care of children?

275
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,120
I think men should be offended that it's
assumed to be a female role. I mean,

276
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,020
don't you get some satisfaction in taking
care of Ellis? I of course, like I said,

277
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:05,010
is factual, so yeah. No, it's great. I
mean like I know I'm doing a woman's work,

278
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,420
but I still, I still enjoy it. Just like
if you were to fucking build a deck,

279
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:13,230
you'd be like, oh, this is cool
as well. Just what humans can do.

280
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,810
I feel like people can do it. I
don't know, despite having to like,

281
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,230
like if I cook, I'm like, oh cool. Like
chicks do this, you know, you cooked,

282
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,980
he cooked excellent. I did have
a great Sunday cooking day. Wait,

283
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,890
what was it called? The brisket
and is that what you mean? No,

284
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:32,420
I did try to dictate. That was so good.
Tip was God damn, that was amazing.

285
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,810
I got a big green egg.
There's some, uh, another,

286
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,180
some super barbecue fans out there.
Um, I like to work with fire,

287
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,430
so I'm, I don't like doing, I like
charcoal. I like wood chips and I like,

288
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,980
I like messing with fire.
And this thing

289
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,630
is, uh, it's really,

290
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,690
it's really simple actually because you
control your heat just based on the air

291
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,740
you let into it. So you can, you can
basically get this thing if you want to,

292
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,420
let's say throw a steak on and you
want to just have that thing go quick,

293
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,321
you can make,

294
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:09,760
you can make the thing about almost
700 degrees and just have the vents

295
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:13,620
completely open, put your penis. And it's
like a fucking, you know, almost like a,

296
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,250
like a broiler and then boom, you're
seg has done in a minute, you know,

297
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:23,251
but you can also reduce the air flow and
bring that temperature in that to 25 to

298
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:29,860
50 range and slow cook some things kind
of. And that's what I did with that.

299
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:30,420
It was so,

300
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,680
but you see it's smokey tasting
because you get smoky smoke. Yeah.

301
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:39,270
You can't like smoke a cake in there. You
can, you can smoke a cake. Absolutely.

302
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,350
You missed it while,
uh, while you were gone.

303
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,760
I did a couple of birthday cakes in there.
Yeah.

304
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,100
Some cupcakes like smoking chocolate.
People love that. That natural

305
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,220
cold tasting cake is like,
it's, it's just such a, it's a,

306
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,500
it's an uh, it's on a common, but
it's a, it's really rewarding.

307
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,820
Yeah. Interesting. No,

308
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:03,500
but I actually did do a
British baking show treat.

309
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,230
I tried it.

310
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,310
That was awesome. Yeah. Cause we
found, uh, the secondary show,

311
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,660
the masterclass,

312
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,720
they have it on Netflix and you can
watch Mary Berry [inaudible] and Paul

313
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,080
Hollywood make the recipes Hollywood.
And you know what I,

314
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,370
what I noticed when I was watching it is
that Paul Hollywood is like a big show

315
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,970
off. Yeah. Like he cracks the eggs
with one hand on the side of the bell.

316
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,800
He does it fast too. Right? Like showing
off. Yeah. And he does everything really,

317
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:35,040
really fast to show off.
And Mary Berry was like, Oh,

318
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,870
I've noticed when you crack it that way,

319
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:41,040
all the egg drips on the side
of the bowl and he, you know,

320
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:44,910
she was kind of like relaxed
83 Douche bag, take it,

321
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:46,050
take it down a notch.

322
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,230
But that's the, that's it
kind of contributes to the
chemistry of them. Right.

323
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:54,880
Because she's like, TD, notice none
of the egg drivels all my bone.

324
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,630
And he's like, that's fine. They're
like, it doesn't even, he's like, yeah,

325
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,370
it's just like you are
with your mom basically.

326
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,890
Yeah. Okay. Mom.

327
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,180
He made a couple of old jokes at her at
one point and she did not react like a

328
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:09,450
couple of them. She was like,
nope, she did not like it.

329
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,880
So I tried his chocolate volcano.

330
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,380
Yeah. Missed one small but key step. Yeah,

331
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,550
I forgot the two tablespoons of flour.
God dammit.

332
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,810
And I could just see him trying it
and being like the flavors there.

333
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,180
Yeah. It's a good bike. It's a good
book. Yeah. Do you didn't get to rise.

334
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,180
You should have gotten your right.

335
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,980
Let me just get that, that molten
lava cake grise for those of you like,

336
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,360
Oh, you guys are back on
the fat train. We literally,

337
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:44,110
we did it like bakers. We had a
couple bites. I fucking throw it away.

338
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,070
I made fitness today.

339
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,930
I reign it in. Yeah, we're go. All good.

340
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,510
Got To make fitness and make
it all the time. I made it.

341
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,760
I made it four times last week and a,
I'll make fitness each morning.

342
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm going to do,
uh,

343
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,580
I do twice with a trainer and I'm
going to do a couple solos this week.

344
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,220
Can I attorney into like that
mom life that I got going?

345
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,160
You just pull out these twice a
week taking care of the kid alone.

346
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:10,760
Now I'm pretty exciting.
Yeah, it was pretty exciting.

347
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,820
Now there's one thing that, you
know, we've got a lot of emails,

348
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:14,780
things that go through.

349
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,390
One thing that has been coming up
is like personality wise. Okay.

350
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,270
Really is, um, the champ.

351
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,900
You're not going to read
listener emails are you?

352
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:31,820
Because those are always really slanted
towards one of us or they don't really

353
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:36,080
know us in real life. You say
I got one better for you. Okay.

354
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,890
I have actual commentary.

355
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,330
I was listening to this
podcast contest personality.

356
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,370
And if for me it's to,
even if it's not a concert,

357
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,110
it's like five by five by five.

358
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,140
You have to go cause peanut
has it really nicely.

359
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,620
[inaudible] mark [inaudible]

360
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,110
charming,
amazing [inaudible]

361
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,230
and all the things around you.
When that,

362
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,520
wait a minute is that it's
not gone through there. You're
the winner now. Yeah. Hi.

363
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,040
But wait a minute, that's not some
random color. That's your biological mom.

364
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,680
That's the woman that raised you.
How about somebody that knows us both.

365
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,830
She's supposed to feel that about
the people that knows both. You know,

366
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,280
I mean there's other people that know.
That's your mom.

367
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,700
Sadie loans. Hey, uh, I was
just listening to them. Awesome.

368
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,730
Uh, you know, I love
Christine. I don't know

369
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,663
what

370
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,680
years Ryan Sickler, you know,
I know, I know who this is.

371
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,530
Beautiful girl, great mom,
hilarious comedian. Yeah.

372
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,460
Um, great friend, great daughter.

373
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,800
But when it comes to personality,
cardboard,

374
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,230
absolute, just dry shift sandpaper,
you know what I mean? Yup.

375
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,890
Really nothing there.
Definitely married off. I mean,

376
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:14,790
when it comes to personality stuff,
you'd definitely have a better person.

377
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,090
I can't believe you solicited advice.

378
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,180
That was Ryan sickler of the crab feast
podcast. Yup. He's a what? A trader.

379
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,830
I can't believe it. There's different,
I mean, people are calling in.

380
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,580
Those are people, those are too
biased. People that you set up.

381
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,250
Hey Buddy, listen to the
show. Interesting question.

382
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,830
Who has the best personality?

383
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,140
I think that part,
Christina,

384
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,470
clearly the more intelligent

385
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,490
educational background. He's so into
that. I think in terms of personality,

386
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:58,530
after all, you know, my son. Oh
yeah. Awesome. You got listen,

387
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,740
most of your personality from me.
Yeah.

388
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,120
So I think that my vote has to go to here.

389
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,780
Unreal.
Unreal.

390
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,390
I mean it's obviously a skewed,
I don't know.

391
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,920
I mean there's people, I mean
obviously my parents are going to vote.

392
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,890
Hey Tom, it's mouthful
shrine. Oh, we'll charge. Uh,

393
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,080
I was thinking about this lately.
I don't know why I was thinking about it.

394
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,170
You're worth pursuing is so
funny. On stage. On stage,

395
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,650
but off stage,
um,

396
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,690
I kind of think you have a better
personality. You're fun to hang out with.

397
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,290
You always got the joke.
Yup. Like offstage.

398
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,320
I like hanging out with you,
man. You should know. Yeah,

399
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,250
please don't tell Christina I said that.

400
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,700
Wow. Wow. This is really quite
a coup here. Well, so I mean,

401
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,370
I'm devastated. I can't believe
it. It is kind of alarming

402
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:01,570
not to go off.
Go to [inaudible] Park test.

403
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,670
I told them about what
you said up the other day.

404
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,940
You take it, I'm a guy, my
personality, I'm not on anybody's list.

405
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,730
So talk to take you say that you do
have a high rise supposed to now.

406
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,730
You know what? I'm sorry. Yeah. She's a
great mom. Go look in Prague. Funny Comic.

407
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,690
Of course he's kind of like,
ah, you know what I'm saying?

408
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,370
They got the Goulash and a sword.
They're jumping up a salary. Shit.

409
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,700
Your personalities kind of smooth.
Uh,

410
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,800
Christine here she goes back.
There you go.

411
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,990
Wow. Thank you. For what? It's worth

412
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,440
straight black. So do you feel like, I
can't believe this. I know it's kind of,

413
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,403
it is crazy.

414
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,590
But you feel like this is because these
are all people that are more connected

415
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:51,790
to me.
Is that what you're saying?

416
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,500
I'm saying I just have a feeling
that you solicited these comments.

417
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,310
These are just people that called him
and said these things. I, you know,

418
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,080
so weird that they,
the everyone,

419
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,590
all of our friends are listening to our
Pi gas and then felt compelled to call

420
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:07,920
and leave a voicemail that,

421
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,310
I mean, but how do you, do you
think like, do you think if you had,

422
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,390
if we had your people call in it
would be different though or no,

423
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,450
you think so?
Tell me what you did.

424
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,373
It's a Shauna,

425
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,800
I heard there was like a discussion
about who's the personality fam.

426
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,810
No died when, I mean I've known
Christina since I was 16 yeah,

427
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,940
and I love her for her personality.
She's Robert took gust,

428
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,250
but then when I met Tom, I mean when
they got married I was like, wow,

429
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,230
this guy has got a great personality.
Say Personality Champ, Tom Cigarettes.

430
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,290
That's your best. That's terrible. Your
best. I can't believe you did that to her.

431
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,680
How much did you pay her pay or
anything? You did? I did not.

432
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,030
I'm going to find out how much you paid
her to say they are a dime. Oh my God.

433
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,850
You called. I know you did. You sent them
glass and tee shirts for free. No, I did.

434
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,800
You sent her and her husband Jimmy free
tee shirts and that's why they did that.

435
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,890
I got that. I know I did not. No, I
know what I think it's pretty much,

436
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,120
it feels settled to me. These are
the people that know us. Both.

437
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,100
Even the listeners obviously side more
towards me. Yeah, no, it's the way.

438
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:25,000
Everybody who commented Nosa everybody
knows us. That's interesting.

439
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,360
They're voting. They're voting
with their voices, baby. Okay.

440
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,200
So I think it's the assignment.

441
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,300
Throw in the towel on this one only
tells me you've manipulated the data.

442
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,430
I listen to Steve Call and I'm just
looking at the podcast and one of the time

443
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:41,430
there and my buddy Steve,
I must say when it comes to looks,

444
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:46,050
Christina is by far the much better
looking person. That's obvious. Yeah.

445
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,530
No contest at all. On
the same day. However,

446
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,660
personality wise I got to give it to Tom.

447
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,440
Yeah, this is too fast. Or you go,
this is so stupid. How has it stupid?

448
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,400
I mean it's so obviously manipulated,
not manipulated. This is,

449
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:04,360
these are alternative facts. Everybody
knows. No, it's not that. It's so stupid.

450
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,450
Don't you feel done with it now?
No, I don't feel done. In fact,

451
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,470
this compels me to continue
the dialogue and uh,

452
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,540
I'm going to take it to the
streets and I'm going to really,

453
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,960
really interview people
from now on. Really? Yeah.

454
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,160
Do you really think that anybody
would side with you? Yes.

455
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,590
Everybody who knows us.
Both unbiased people.

456
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,910
Maybe not family members or best
friends that you've manipulated? Yeah.

457
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,130
Well, it seems like one of
yours, um, sided with me.

458
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,020
One of your best friends, you paid her
in free tee shirt today. Not Today. Her,

459
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,730
you paid her in Fiji. She, I,

460
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,680
she sent me a picture in our glass
and shirts last night and I thought,

461
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,720
well that's weird. That's odd. No,
she doesn't normally, you know, buy,

462
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,700
merge from us and then now
it makes perfect sense.

463
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,640
You send her those shirts and you bribed
her. That was pretty great though.

464
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,720
Do you I know the funniest thing, I can't
believe you did this. This is too funny.

465
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,583
Oh you are.
So

466
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,580
no, no. Down in a two carbon
compound reacts with a four
carbon compound that you

467
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,700
produced a six carbon compounds,
citric acid and only fuck.

468
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,110
In subsequent reactions,

469
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,100
two carbons are lost to see
o two electrons are stored

470
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,870
and ATP is produced. God dammit. No,

471
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,170
I never even took chemistry because I
couldn't get past the first like week of

472
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:20,830
it. I did. And the guy fucking loved
me and that's why he gave me a deed.

473
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,780
He loves me. That shit so
hard. He didn't love you.

474
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:30,080
He probably loved how hot you
were in high school pen. No,

475
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,870
he was at Father So-and-so. I was somebody
that treated him like a human being.

476
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,630
Yeah. You know, like,

477
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,680
like I treated the teacher like a person
I had real conversation with and you

478
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,060
could tell that nobody did that.

479
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,290
So he was so engaged with
me and I really, this, it's,

480
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,070
this is like an extension of my
awesome personality, but he was like,

481
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,940
some might say a manipulative personality.
He loved me.

482
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,620
And I remember he could not get
over how bad I was at chemistry.

483
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,230
And he did it in a subtle way.
He wasn't obvious, but he,

484
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:03,500
you could see it on his face like,
don't you get this? And I'm like, no,

485
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,430
I could not get it. Get it saved my
life. I mean, in high school I could not,

486
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,970
I had to drop out and take two
different classes to count as chemistry,

487
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:14,420
if that's what you had to do in order to,
I dunno,

488
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,620
be of value in this world. Oh my God.
It'd be a fucking bottom feeder. I mean,

489
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,400
it would just be, I'd be living in a
cardboard box in a gutter. Bangladesh.

490
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,880
Why's it gotta be the dirtiest place?

491
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:29,660
I know that is not the dirtiest
place on earth. Why do you say that?

492
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,390
Because I've seen photos.
You're horrible.

493
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,480
Where do you think this is a
display of your personality?

494
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,130
Where do you think the worst place on
earth is? Be? Real and obviously to Lido.

495
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,830
How dare you? The PARISBURG
Uri. I've not been to Erie.

496
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,240
Um, no, I dunno. I Dunno where
the worst, I mean on on earth.

497
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,150
Your say nothing's that bad in the US.
I think Bangladesh.

498
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,180
I mean, no, I, I wouldn't have said
Bangladesh. Pakistan, I've been there.

499
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:02,480
It's terrible. It's not as bad as you
know. It's funny. When I was in Hong Kong,

500
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:07,460
which is amazing, a lot of native
people, they were telling me,

501
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,870
don't go to mainland China.
Seriously?

502
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,940
No, no, that seriously. They're like,

503
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:18,110
don't go outside of the cities of China
yet outside of it, they were like,

504
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,680
I've heard that too. Rough. It's real.
These were Chinese people telling me this.

505
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,290
They're like, they thought they
thought we were going there.

506
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,980
If you guys go into Shanghai and stuff,
we were like, no. And they're like, well,

507
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:30,390
don't, you know, don't
venture outside of there.

508
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,840
I've heard there's a lot
of like toothless people,

509
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,000
people with five legs and two heads.

510
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,860
You know who heads I see that a
lot on the, and the Instagram.

511
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:44,210
Like I fall on Nat Geo on Instagram
and they're, and they're like,

512
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:47,900
this baby was born with five
legs and two heads from India.

513
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:52,160
It's never America. That
the five legged baby. Yeah.

514
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,563
I'm really,

515
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,310
I'm really amused by your quote.

516
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,480
Consensus of this got the better
personality. That's very, it's very done.

517
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:05,870
Very amusing. Uh, do you wanna hear the
funniest part of this whole thing though?

518
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,003
So

519
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,860
when I called and I told my parents
to call in, I go, so here's like,

520
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,500
to manipulate the data,
here's the set up and do it.

521
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,830
So my dad calls and he acts like a,

522
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,380
he's just a regular caller.

523
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,540
So I had to have him call
twice because the first time,

524
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,100
hilarious as if the listeners would not
know who he is. So he first time he goes

525
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,610
on who the personality

526
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,320
and winter,

527
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,120
so, and he can't, he can't say it right
either person. Personality. Winter. Yeah.

528
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,570
And he goes, Hey Tom. So I called back
and I go, what was that? And he goes, oh,

529
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:53,100
your mom said to so that the
people don't know. It's uh,

530
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,410
it's me like to the, we don't, I go,

531
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:58,500
do you guys don't think that that
not only would the listeners know,

532
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:01,270
but that like we wouldn't play. It'd
be like, Oh, that's your dad. Yeah.

533
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,540
You can hide who that is. And
he goes, yeah, I thought so.

534
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,320
But he just left it as I'm dead.

535
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,660
Hey Tom,
just want to offer my opinion.

536
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,680
I go, you've never called
me. Never. Not even one time.

537
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:19,350
I've never heard him calling you that.
It's always a buddy buddy, buddy. Yeah.

538
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,990
Big Dog. Yeah. Never time. No.

539
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,250
The funny part too actually is that our
interior designer was here this morning

540
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,100
showing us plans and you weighed in.

541
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,970
She weighed in and were
really good relationship with
her. She's very funny. And,

542
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,850
and I go, forgive Tom. He's, he's late.
He's just not very good personality.

543
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,420
And I go and I go Shauna,
that's her name. To what?

544
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,220
Who Do you think has a better
personality? Tom Or me? Yeah,

545
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,420
and at first she gave the very
considerate like, well you guys are both.

546
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:51,330
And I was, when she broke it down,
come on and here's what she said.

547
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,000
She thinks I am a,
I have a better personality.

548
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,660
Show more people. She said, she
said you're kinder to more people.

549
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,770
That doesn't make better movies are
more selective of who you are kind to.

550
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,090
In other words, you withdraw
and restrict being kind. Yeah.

551
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,830
Selectively.
Yes.

552
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,210
Whereas I am that way with more people.
Jeez.

553
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:18,900
I wonder which of the two of us
as a better personnel, hold on.

554
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:22,320
Yana allow me to defend.
Here's why. A, I'm a woman.

555
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,270
If I walk around being all googly star
ride and kind every a whole out there,

556
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,670
guys think you're hitting on
them if you're nice to them.

557
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,670
And I had to learn that in my twenties
I think you learned it this weekend too.

558
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,730
And I did. Yeah. I got hit on
actually twice in the airport.

559
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,610
My wedding ring is not big enough.
Yeah.

560
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,290
So the second part to that is I grew
up in a major city with a lot of, hi,

561
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,930
how are you? What's your name? What's
Your Pronoun? Is that what happened?

562
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,120
The second part is that
when you grow up in La,

563
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,820
there's a lot of nut bags here
that come from other places.

564
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,790
So you got to put up the shield
first and then, then if you're cool,

565
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,390
they're all nice now. But I'm
nice to servers. I'm nice to,

566
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,010
to everybody. I just don't go out of
my way to be kind. Kind of like, hey,

567
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,540
be my friend. Yeah. Not
until I know you. Okay. No,

568
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,340
I'm not rude to like service people
though. Never said you were rude to say,

569
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,250
but that's what I'm saying. Like I would
never ever be shitty to like service.

570
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,860
You're obviously not very kind
to the Bangladeshi people. Oh,

571
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,900
they're not listening. They
don't. We don't think so.

572
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,470
They don't have I phones like aren't they
don't, oh, podcast. I'm just kidding. No,

573
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:24,520
I know they did. No, they
don't. They're no, no, no.

574
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,860
Like Yoshi. No, they don't know by the
way. Oh, I gotta make this announcement.

575
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,570
So the live Yoshi episode went up.
Uh,

576
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,250
I saw some complaints about the audio.

577
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,710
Luckily we got an email from a guy named
Malcolm in Seattle who volunteered an

578
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:44,740
idea to fix it.
Yeah.

579
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,540
And a blue band did it and it
was a thousand percent improved.

580
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,530
So if you tried listening and you, and
you go like, I don't like this audio,

581
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,870
this sucks, and you stopped,
please give it another shot.

582
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,840
Here's what you have to do though.
Um,

583
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,810
this is what I've been told
is that if you downloaded it,

584
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:06,811
you have to delete it and
download a second time because
the feed has a new file

585
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:11,590
in it. So that's a, it's the live
episode. It went up on Friday.

586
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,040
Um, Yoshi joined us and it
was, he's crazier and shit.

587
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,520
Crazier than, and great guests.
Great. Great. Gus? No. Back
to this Bangladeshi thing.

588
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:22,690
Just so you know, I had an Indian
stepfather for 17. Oh, I'm allowed.

589
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,810
I have a black friend that's one of those
lines, not the same. And he hated India.

590
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:31,811
He only ever told me horror
stories about growing up in Bombay,

591
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,040
Mumbai. Horrible, horrible me, mommy.

592
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,660
So all I ever heard was what a dump
India was and how much better America is.

593
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:45,710
And so just seeing, you know, I've
got a fucking witness. Oh, I'm not,

594
00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm not in the stance. That's fine
if your mom's phone, but really,

595
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:51,530
where do you think the worst place
on earth list? Let's, let's go.

596
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:53,630
It's a really great question.
I mean,

597
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,790
I think the worst place on
earth is hot India. Go ahead.

598
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,540
There's one for India yet.
Dirty check too.

599
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,870
And uh, undeniably. Really Poor d
check three. Yeah, three for three.

600
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,590
It could be like that. Yeah, it could be.
That could be the place. I don't know.

601
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,190
It sounds terrible. I probably a lot of
central African places. Oh boy. Oh boy.

602
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,570
That's gotta be rough to fuck.
Yeah. Or war torn w clearly Congo.

603
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,540
Oh shit man. Yeah. No,

604
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:26,120
it's got to be the worst because we're
talking about reality. Like real,

605
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,500
like you go there now, right? Yeah.
Shit's real right now. Terrible. Yeah.

606
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,270
Like you're drinking the water that
everyone's bathing in kind of stuff.

607
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,560
And then, yeah, aside of all,
like we take away the, the, the,

608
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,470
just the punishing heat.
Yeah.

609
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,850
The unfair extreme poverty.
Yeah.

610
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,960
The, the, the disease. The filth. Yeah.

611
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,180
Will you take away all
that and then, and, and,

612
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,790
and bullets flying overhead and
let's say you get away from all that,

613
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:57,200
you could still turn around and
have a rhino bite you and half true.

614
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:02,100
This isn't an Africa in certain parts of
Africa. Sure. Tigers can swim and, and,

615
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:06,460
and Maleo. Yeah. That's more of an India
problem. That's an India problem. Yeah.

616
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,010
I thought it was an Africa
thing. Yeah. Also the civility.

617
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:14,760
I've heard stories where um, a
pedestrian will be hit in the road. Yeah.

618
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,680
In India somewhere and they'll just
keep driving over them like people don't

619
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:19,191
pull over.

620
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:22,790
Well that's also has to do with
populations of human life is not valued as

621
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,230
island. Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,670
Once you get, once you have a
country with over 1 billion people,

623
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:33,671
imagine if we had vague right now we
had four times as many as we have right

624
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,070
now.
In

625
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,960
the states. You would, they would
report things. You'd report it. Murders,

626
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,270
last year report. That's less. Yeah.
You'd be like, look, it's a lot of people.

627
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,400
If people are fucked up,
people die. That's how you be.

628
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,700
You won't even have to tell
somebody if you hit a pedestrian.

629
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:50,880
Now let's keep driving SCO, which fine.
Oh, the guy. Yeah, that guy's done.

630
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,090
What I noticed too when I was
like in the Middle East, um,

631
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,320
is that people just walk on the freeway.
Yeah. There's a lot of that too.

632
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:05,090
Like camels just run next to the freeway.
People walk when they're not,

633
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,300
they shouldn't lock. Yeah. These,
they don't give a fuck. Yeah.

634
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,630
We're going to get some emails next week,

635
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,390
so I'm sure once you tell people you
got a lot of stuff coming up. I do.

636
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,650

648

Oregon.

656
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,060

ahead of time. So we're

like, Hey, no, I wasn't like, Hey,

685
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,470
what happened was I'm wearing, I
don't wear a big chunky garish. Yeah.

686
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,110
Diamond Ring. I just went, didn't work.

687
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:55,970
I have a very tender little wedding band
that says Mrs [inaudible] I love this

688
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:57,230
thing. Yeah, it's cool.

689
00:45:57,231 --> 00:46:01,490
It's subtle and I don't think
it stands out enough because um,

690
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,570
twice I got kind of like toss with
how does it work? Cause I imagine,

691
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,550
I'll just tell you, I imagine that, that,

692
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,930
that happens to you in
my mind all the time.

693
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:16,580
The guys I know how guys operate, they
see attractive woman. You just go, hey.

694
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:19,280
Right. Yup. Well, I'll tell
you what's a really big cock.

695
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:22,800
Shrinker is a one year old in
your arm. Well, I know when, uh,

696
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,020
I'm assuming when I'm talking about
when you're not with no child, um,

697
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,420
I usually look like hell when I travel
and this time I had gone to Alan,

698
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:35,350
I got my hair done and it was,
it was blown out nicely. Yeah.

699
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,950
So I think like I was not made up,
but I looked like a civilized human,

700
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,950
but I don't send out any kind of
signal, like eyes down, eyes forward.

701
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,030
Usually earbuds, very shut off. Like
I'm very cold in public. That is true.

702
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,220
Like I don't,
I'm not kind as you say to everybody.

703
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,630
So I'm in the security line and that's
the first guy who's about my age,

704
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:01,060
you know, he's alone and he's doing
the whole, who has Burbank airport.

705
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:03,410
It's really easy, Huh?
And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

706
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:07,910
Oh this is so much better than
Texas. And we, where are you going?

707
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,040
Like doing the whole,
the chatty Cathy.

708
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,760
Oh yeah.
To you now.

709
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:16,720
Yeah. Right. Yeah. I was
like, what husband? What kid?

710
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,850
And I hid the screen photo. I have you
and Ellis like immediately I changed it.

711
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,110
Yeah. Yeah, I changed it. Um, and then
I, you know, I'm, I shut it down though.

712
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:27,310
I don't really want to get into it.

713
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:32,311
And then I was on south airline and we
were lining up like animals and the guy

714
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:36,580
behind me did an where are you going?
A business or pleasure.

715
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:40,540
How long are you staying in Sacramento?
How do you handle it? Well, in California,

716
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:43,510
first of all, we don't do that. Like
that's a south, a southern thing.

717
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:48,420
Maybe I'm not an la, nobody talks to
people and now it's just forbidden.

718
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:53,230
It's against the rules,
you know? Okay. So I don't,

719
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,540
what I do is I answer politely,
but tersely I don't give a lot of details.

720
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,110
And by the way, I don't like people
knowing where I live, where I'm going.

721
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,870
I don't like fuck you.
Don't ask me.

722
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,090
I fucking lie to people all the time.
Now the driver, um, who do, I mean,

723
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:14,500
the airport yesterday didn't, he's like,
so are you here for business or pleasure?

724
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:17,830
And I was this close to lying and being
like, oh business, I'm a paralegal.

725
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:22,570
And then just glasses. And he
looked at the sheet and he goes, Oh,

726
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:26,000
you're a comedian. And I was just
the punchline, arrange the ride.

727
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,460
And I was two seconds away from just line
this guy so that I don't have to talk

728
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:32,020
about comedy for the next hour.

729
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,900
So I'm glad I didn't lie
to him cause I normally do.

730
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,030
And he did the whole thing where he,

731
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,990
he looked in the rear view mirror as he
was driving forward the whole fucking

732
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:45,570
time, which should me, I panicked
like, Bro, look at the road. Don't,

733
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,310
I don't need to make eye contact with you.
You know there's one worse than that.

734
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:52,760
And that is the full
turnaround. Yeah. Stop that.

735
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,680
Yeah. This isn't a movie like you're
really driving. How long you in town for

736
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,650
a couple of it. Look at that.
What's that there? Oh, the road.

737
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,360
You fucking idiot. Yeah. So do you
like to you to kind of flirt back?

738
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,190
I'm telling you, this whole not
kind of thing is I'm polite,

739
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:17,800
but I certainly don't invite a dialogue.
I don't really like all over my face.

740
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,870
That too.
I don't like small talk.

741
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,500
I really can't tolerate a lot of like
where are you from? What's that like?

742
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,630
Please can we talk about, let's talk
about anything else. I hate small talk.

743
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:33,490
I can't do it. Fuck, I can't and I can't
be polite. I can't answer things. Right.

744
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,350
You know? Right. You ever been hit on a,

745
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:41,500
when you were with Ellis live girls,
blue eyes.

746
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,820
Usually what they do is they're like,
oh my gosh. As they're looking at him,

747
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,880
you know, you look up at me
and they must be mom. Yeah.

748
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,880
There you supposed to be with this boy.
I'm telling you.

749
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,740
You mean to tell me that after shows now,

750
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:59,800
cause I hear stories from male comics
who are like, dude, I had a fucking,

751
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,240
my set was so killer. I had a four
way afterwards. I swear to God,

752
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,860
like there's never been a set and
then some fucking whore afterwards.

753
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,440
It's like you want to sext and you're
like, yeah, give me your number.

754
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:16,330
I love sexting. No, no, it doesn't
work. Right. No woman's ever been like,

755
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,220
you know,
I heard you talking about farts up there.

756
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,940
I was wondering if you would fight in my
mouth and my face. That happens. Yeah,

757
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,380
that happens. No they, they, they don't
really, it doesn't really work like that.

758
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,750
A R t

759
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,960
they um,

760
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,060
how does girls don't come solo to my
shows and they don't come in twos and

761
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:39,070
threes and we don't get like some guys
like three girls might go see this guy.

762
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:42,780
They like, it doesn't work like
that for me. It's not that for me.

763
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,140
Most of my audience, yeah. Cook would
have like a gaggle of girls. Absolutely.

764
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:48,950
And there's a bunch,

765
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,700
there's guys out there now and I'm
sure draw women like single guy.

766
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,680
But for me,
I'm telling you,

767
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:59,150
this happens every show guys are bringing
their girls like a guy's doing a lot

768
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:02,160
of dates, right? And that guy
takes his girl to the movies take.

769
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,450
And then in the meet and greet lines,

770
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,070
that guy will take a picture. And
this happens. Every show goes baby.

771
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,270
And she goes, I'm good. And then I go
and then he's like, no, no, come on.

772
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,070
She says I'm fine. No
thanks. No thanks for like,

773
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,530
I don't want a photo of this.

774
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,420
So you think that your onstage persona,
your personality,

775
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,320
so unlikable pretty much onstage?
Yes. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:34,590
I have, I have it all the
time. And no girls do not go
like, hey, it doesn't have,

777
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,270
no, never. Not even like sometimes no.

778
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,730
Sometimes there's jokes like they,

779
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,880
they will listen to our show
and they'll kick your ass.

780
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,870
Like there was a whole time, where
was the whole time of that, you know,

781
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:52,220
we're offering to take something
every time. Very exciting to hear.

782
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,730
Very exciting to hear. I was
always pleased to hear it, but,

783
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,100
but on a regular basis, no,
I don't get like, hey you,

784
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:03,290
sometimes groups will say like,
where are you going afterwards? Um,

785
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,760
and won't get hints that I don't
want to hang out. We're not social.

786
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,460
I'll be like, I dunno. And then they go,
oh, do you want us to wait here? And I go,

787
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,650
no, I don't know how long I'll
be here. And they're like,
okay, we can wait outside.

788
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,900
I'm like, don't do that. And then
it's like, there's still be like,

789
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,240
so there's a bar across the street. Yeah.
Which one is that? And then I'll be like,

790
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:30,880
yeah, yeah, I might go there. No, of
course not. I don't like to hang out.

791
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,980
Well, it's so late. By the
time I was done with my shows,

792
00:52:33,981 --> 00:52:38,210
it was like 1230 and the audience is
tired. I'm tired. I want to go home.

793
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,530
I was thinking about it.
I think I told you, uh,

794
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,640
Burt posted some photo on his Instagram,

795
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,350
him with the Bachelorette group.
I think he was carrying one of them.

796
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,310
It was like here was tonight
and I almost texted him like,

797
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,640
your idea of a fun night is
my idea of a panic attack.

798
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:03,610
Like that is anxiety
inducing hundred percent like

799
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:10,150
partying with a fucking group of people
and that for him that's a show cannot

800
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,340
fucking do it.
Can I say what?

801
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,080
What gives me the most diarrhea
about an exchange like that?

802
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,670
The amount of small talk that
would have to ensue. Yeah.

803
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,290
So what's it like being a comedian?
What's it like being too,

804
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:25,260
I'm not really a big
drinker, you know? Yeah.

805
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:30,261
I would have to get fucked up to hang
out like that because bachelorettes with

806
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:34,100
anyone. With any group I'm saying because,
because of the small talk. Yeah. He says,

807
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,940
I can't do it sober. I'd be like, well,

808
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:40,650
I'll just fucking knocked back some
shots and do this. I'm so uncomfortable.

809
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,360
And in large groups too,

810
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,340
I have never functioned with large
groups of girlfriends or the parties.

811
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,940
I don't, I never, I never had a fun, it's,

812
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,470
I'm better like in a smaller situation.
Um,

813
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,440
like let's actually talk. Of
course. Yeah. I also wanted to,

814
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,920
Burt likes to hold court, you
know, I can't do, nothing.

815
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:05,190
Makes me more uncomfortable than that.
And he's also good. Can't do that.

816
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,030
Let's do this and do that.

817
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,930
And now it's like he has all these
ideas of how the fund can continue.

818
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:15,230
And I will say though that our audience
is so wonderful in that like every time

819
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:19,380
I work somewhere, the staff goes, God,
you have the best crowds. You guys,

820
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,970
you guys get to now also because
our crowds at live shows,

821
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,500
so responsive mix podcast
listeners and stand up fans. Right.

822
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,510
But I feel like the reason I keep
getting compliments from venues on the

823
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,990
audience is because of podcasts.
Absolutely. Because I get it.

824
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,900
I got it on this whole tour.
Everywhere I go, they go,

825
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,900
you bring in the most amazing people.
And at first I'm like,

826
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,590
oh you just mean like, cause they
laughed at the sh like they like a show.

827
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,470
He's like, no, they're like
so respectful. Oh yeah.

828
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:54,030
If it's a heckle, they they
tip well they're, they're,

829
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:58,140
they're nice. They didn't, you
know, start any shit with anyone.

830
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:00,120
They're just like good people.
So they're the best.

831
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,410
And I would say that they're the type of
people I actually probably would have a

832
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:08,100
drink with like one on one. Generally when
I meet Mommy's I'm like, oh thank you.

833
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:11,610
Actually a normal human being can be
friends with you. It's kind of weird,

834
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:16,720
but then I wouldn't because the anxiety
of the social interactions too much. Oh,

835
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,270
you got an email about that,
by the way.

836
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,100
I swear I go away.
We've talked about this one.

837
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:26,340
Go Away for two days and
it's like a fortress.

838
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,180
You've just built up all this ammo against
me. I know this is not against you.

839
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:31,860
It says it actually
says to the two of you,

840
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,970
but then they kind of single you out
because I've been a mommy's it's way back,

841
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:38,910
so no disrespect,
but you guys see the two of you,

842
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,800
but it's not about you really fired up.
They got real fired up against me.

843
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,390
Sounds so dumb. Low and lose when
you talk about retarded people.

844
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:53,040
I'm working on my degree
in teaching Special Ed work
at a center for adults with

845
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,030
intellectual disabilities,
and my kid has special needs.

846
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,850
Every retard,
retard.

847
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,970
You meet as a different
person with different dreams
and desires just like you.

848
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:09,960
Retards. Okay? Yeah. Some
do like white bummer movies.

849
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:14,700
Some get married,
some have jobs live independently and yes,

850
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,190
they drive.
No,

851
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,440
it's not pleasurable to be retarded.
You sound dumb.

852
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,440
Mommy. Tina, I'm sorry,
but no, wait a minute.

853
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:31,090
Are you saying on this comedy show,
this is not serious show I sound stupid.

854
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,360
Well, that's weird. And
the email. Yeah. Uh,

855
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,500
some of my students fully understand
the world around them as well as their

856
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:41,840
struggle. I don't know about fully
and I don't think it's fully, uh,

857
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,940
they were retarded,
Babe. Whatever they go,

858
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:50,320
people think they don't know shit and
all they do is um, masturbate and drill.

859
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,410
Right. Shut the fuck up with this. Oh,
Sarah. Sarah is, she's got a point,

860
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:00,270
Sara. All right. Well,
retarded. I didn't, but we,

861
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:03,630
we, we knew that they had lives. We're
not [inaudible]. They don't have lives.

862
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,620
We did that. We did. Where
does it know they could drive?

863
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:10,030
That was the big surprise was the
drive thing. And that's all on me. I,

864
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,040
first of all, I thought that your
comment was insane. That like,

865
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:19,570
do they not know that they're retarded? I
wouldn't. I did. I genuinely didn't know.

866
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:23,440
I believe that you genuinely said it.
Yeah. I still thought it was crazy,

867
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,190
but my thing was I really
didn't know if they could drive.

868
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,430
I really didn't know
that. Well. Yeah, I know.

869
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:34,330
I'm saying like I'm volunteering
that she's saying that like, yeah,

870
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,970
some of them drive like in other words,
you're stupid for not knowing that.

871
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,110
I really didn't know that.

872
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,320
I asked genuinely I didn't think it was
possible that so either with that level

873
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,990
of visibility it came mental capacity,

874
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,860
which he needs some mental
capacity to drive that react.

875
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,930
Absolute reads signs,
whatever the fuck it is this a legit,

876
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,380
what about like junction?
You know what I mean?

877
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:59,420
Like where things come together and four
wheels and like, oh yeah, it's a lot.

878
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,680
I know the rules. I mean I thought
that that would be more complex.

879
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,780
Complicated for me.
I'm barely not retiring,

880
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,850
but the the question as to whether or
not they are aware that they are retired.

881
00:58:10,851 --> 00:58:14,230
Of course there no to know. We'll hear me
out. Let's look at this philosophically.

882
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,590
If you are this thing and you don't know,

883
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,820
maybe you don't know another way of being
just because you are that way, does it?

884
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:25,690
It's just like the gays. It doesn't it.
It does a dog. No, it's consciousness.

885
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:30,040
As a dog consciousness that it's separate
from that being human is different.

886
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:33,700
I don't know. I feel like I want
to bail you out and an animal,

887
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,390
different consciousness. Retired persons,
different consciousness letting me,

888
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,770
I don't care. I really don't give a shit.
I don't care to fuck. No, not really.

889
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,570
Zero fucks given about what about
whatever. If somebody is upset that I,

890
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:54,370
I uh, you know, if I have a
genuine and telling you how come,

891
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:59,270
how come, why, why come? Why can't I be
curious about this? You can be curious.

892
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,980
You can be curious.
It's fun.

893
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,760
Oh, somebody says you cheating.
Cheating. Huh? Uh, I'm furious.

894
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,790
This person writes,
I am not going to take it any longer.

895
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,450
Christina put cheat ski.
Yeah.

896
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:22,340
Routinely cheats at would you
rather know stop and her husband,

897
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:26,210
Tom allows it because of
sexism and nepotism and Obama.

898
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,590
It is an outrage and a tragedy on
par with the worst crimes in history.

899
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:35,591
She's basically Pol Pot when the options
in would you rather are poor and skinny

900
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,510
or rich and fat.

901
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,160
You cannot say you'll choose
skinny and find a rich guy.

902
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,060
No, no, no option is skinny and poor.

903
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,860
So even if you did find a rich guy,

904
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:52,480
you would not be able to enjoy any of
his money or the trappings of his wealth.

905
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:56,690
He would remain in a shed in the
backyard like a proper poor person.

906
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:00,410
How dare you allow this cheating
to continue? How dare you.

907
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:05,420
I demand reparations.
Yours forever and love Bert Buczynski,

908
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:10,490
Lao. Bert. That's a, that's a really
good point. You made a good point.

909
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,420
Thank you for bringing that
to our attention. Yeah, you
do do that. You're like,

910
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:19,310
I'll just find this way through it.
Would you rather at the loophole, Yana,

911
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,930
I went to law school for two though,
because you're present.

912
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,910
You're like your skin, like this is your
life or this is your life, which life?

913
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:29,060
And you're like, well you do it this way.
There's always a work around in life,

914
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:32,000
don't you get it, Tom, that's
not, how would you rather works?

915
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,840
Do you think your honor would send you
to the hole for 30 days just through

916
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,450
pitching this idea and come
on. That's all. That's how,

917
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,870
that's how you play the game. You have
to find your work around another email.

918
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:45,290
Critical view.
These emails,

919
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,180
how much I suck.
Who's faking the email?

920
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:55,970
Hey Hitler,
I've known as Jesus Jeans says plenty of,

921
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,960
can I say something? Can I tell you
something? Because he never listens.

922
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:02,210
Tom Never listens to can I just say,

923
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:06,800
do you think this is the Midwestern mom
translation of, you know what I'm saying?

924
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,630
You feel me? Or you know what I mean?
Finished and done shorty. George PS,

925
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,100
chef John,

926
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:16,970
might as well be a member of the Wu Tang
clan because he ain't nothing to fuck

927
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:21,130
with. Wow. Still upset
about making fun to shoot.

928
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,780
Can I tell you why I tell you why I say,
can I say something right?

929
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,330
Because you just talk right over me.

930
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,540
You've done it this episode like
two or three times. Oh, come on.

931
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,240
I have to interject. Otherwise I
can't get my fucking thought in there.

932
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:39,920
You really feel that way. Hello. Then
why am I saying, can I say something?

933
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,380
Because it's always cause you
don't let me, you move on.

934
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,920
See like right now I'm talking to you
and you're looking at the soundboard.

935
01:01:44,921 --> 01:01:48,860
Tell him, look at me. No, but I'm
still listening to you. No ma'am.

936
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,560
Can I say something?
Can I just say something?

937
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,700
The thing is we watch sesame
street and what is cookie monster?

938
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:59,440
Learn to listen with whole body.
Whole body, whole mine eyes,

939
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:06,020
eyes wide,
body relax and you don't do that for me.

940
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,771
Even right now.

941
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:10,160
You're fucking looking at the computer
and still listen to you and not fully,

942
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:14,860
not like cookie monster. Listen, why does
it have to be exactly that way? Can I do,

943
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,060
would you rather real quick? You
want to do it with your other, yeah,

944
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:20,700
go ahead and just go for it. It's simple.
It's not, it's not too complicated.

945
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,810
Okay.
Okay.

946
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:26,700
Would you rather live in a courtyard
Marriott where you did where I did?

947
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,180
Yeah. It's like those for those
of you don't know what that is.

948
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:34,800
It's a Marriott that you can actually
like. It has a kitchenette bathroom,

949
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,810
you know, like kind of like living in
a, in a crummy apartment. Yeah. Okay.

950
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,460
That's your living situation.

951
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:46,461
Tiny communal pool made
service or it's an Rv.

952
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:51,420
You live like it like I did on
road rules, road rules, life, RV.

953
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,920
Now keep in mind the RV. Yes,
you, you can park in RV parks.

954
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:58,380
You can't really park an RV just anywhere.
Don't think you can.

955
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,630
And if you take a shit in that Rv, you
have to unload the sewage system in it.

956
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,700
But I think you could learn
that pretty quickly. Right.

957
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,600
But it still stinks and it cooks in
the summertime, the shit. I mean,

958
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,910
maybe now it's better, but back
in the 90s, that's how it was.

959
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,680
Um hmm. But so wait, what is it?

960
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,180
How long are we living in
each situation of your life?

961
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,440
So you're either living at the courtyard
Marriott or in the, in the RV. Yeah.

962
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:24,150
But it looks like with
the Rv you have mobility.

963
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,300
Yeah. Oh, okay. Well let's change it up.
Oh, so, so let's change it up. No, no, no.

964
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:30,970
I'm making the courtyard Marriott more,
more appealing.

965
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:35,740
You can live at any courtyard,
Marriott location. Oh, now as you know,

966
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:39,790
can you have one built just for you?
No, but I'm saying like if you go,

967
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:43,330
let's say you go, oh I can, I
want to live in a, you know,

968
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,720
New York City and they don't have
one. Can you say New York City? No,

969
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,870
it was to be an existing
location. Okay. And as you know,

970
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,370
the locations are generally across from
like a nice Chili's or maybe down the

971
01:03:54,371 --> 01:03:56,470
street, a mile from our red lobster. Sure.

972
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,460
Generally not a sidewalk in front of it.

973
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:05,020
And so usually on a busy highway the views
are of parking lots, things like that.

974
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:10,220
Um, I think I would still
choose the RV. Okay.

975
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:14,660
Because you can move it, you can drive
it right. It's part of the appeal to me.

976
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,030
So I think I would,
I would get,

977
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,120
I would get comfortable,

978
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:24,680
I would learn how to dump my sewage
and maybe real stinky. I'm sure it is.

979
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:28,540
I'm sure it's terrible. Um, that's the
only thing I asked Brian Regan by the way,

980
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:32,930
when, cause he has a tour bus, I go really
nice tour bus. It's your first question.

981
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:36,410
Yeah. Go. So can I ask you, I go the
rules on tour buses is like no shit.

982
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:38,390
So like right. It's always
like, I was like, no shits.

983
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,040
You know you piss in here but you can't
shit in here. Can I go so isn't that,

984
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:46,160
he goes, well no I, I shit. And I said,
well he doesn't say he actually was like,

985
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:49,610
no I can't. I go, well so it doesn't, your
whole bus smelled like shit then. Yeah,

986
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:52,640
I think it was now cause it's like they
have new technology now where it's like

987
01:04:52,641 --> 01:04:56,000
this grinding thing and it's
like a whole, he goes, yeah,

988
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:59,600
I wouldn't get one if I couldn't
take it down. He was like,

989
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,060
this is all you want to talk about.
Cause I kept talking.

990
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,740
Well it's fascinating because airplanes,

991
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:08,520
they have to unload the septic
tank to after every flight.

992
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:13,220
Anybody that tours that is like the, one
of the first things. It's always like,

993
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,030
hey, especially it was a group,
you know, a band touring or

994
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,850
friends. You're like, we are not
dumping here man. Yeah. Yeah. You can't,

995
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,580
you can't have five guys constantly
shitting on your tour bus for getting it.

996
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:26,591
I see.

997
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:29,550
Now here's the other thing with the Rv
Park that are the RV that you don't make

998
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:33,760
me not think about as a professional.
I've lived on one. You can't, like I said,

999
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:37,210
you need electricity to plug
into at night, so you're not,

1000
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:42,160
you're not parking your
trailer necessarily in just
in front of any residential

1001
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:43,630
street.
Cause someone will call the cops.

1002
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,960
You have to go to RV parks to plug
in to get your amenity to shower,

1003
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:53,440
you know? Yeah. Now RV parks
sometimes are not that nice. You're,

1004
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:57,660
you're amongst special
different people. Yeah. And um,

1005
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,250
some of them are nice and Australia,
like some of them were super nice.

1006
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,500
Like there's one in Malibu
that overlooks the ocean.

1007
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,490
It's like a million dollar RV park.
Elitist. Yeah. Oh of course. Yeah. Not La.

1008
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:10,550
So anywhere that's not La, who knows what
the situation will be like, you know?

1009
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:13,990
That's true. That's true. How do you feel
about tour bus? Would you do it? Yeah.

1010
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:18,520
Yeah. Yeah. So do you think you are
though the, can I say something?

1011
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,420
Can I just say something Jay? Oh, let me
guess. Cause is there a super cut? No,

1012
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:24,070
there's not. There's no, okay. Yeah.

1013
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:28,840
Interesting that you need in your
preparation for today's shit on Christina

1014
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:32,950
episode. There wasn't a super cut,
not a should ocracy and atmosphere is,

1015
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,510
it sure feels like it.

1016
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,150
People like my personality and Allison
is that she never seen episode.

1017
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,800
You've just been really, you know, you,
I think you're a little angry then.

1018
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:45,870
I left you this weekend
over nick.

1019
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,370
That's just a little bit of
you right there. It's not me.

1020
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:51,940
You know what I'm saying? You, you
know what I'm saying? But you know,

1021
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,960
you know who the, you know, champ is, it's
a kid from Harvard. He's a hockey player.

1022
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,520
Oh Tyler, thanks for being here. How about
the keys to the game and facing Duluth

1023
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,670
tomorrow? Yeah, I think, uh, you know,

1024
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:04,070
the main thing is just going to be
managing the environment. Obviously,

1025
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,770
if we've got a great, uh,
Opportunity here and, you know,

1026
01:07:06,771 --> 01:07:10,280
a lot of fans and Tyler Moin
on everything, um, you know,

1027
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:15,130
and just managing that and what's
been the key to this wall here and,

1028
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,750
you know, to, uh, you know, to create
that kind of culture where, you know,

1029
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:22,390
we hold each other accountable,
you know, and to a, you know,

1030
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:23,690
really get up for big games.

1031
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:26,880
And I think that that's been
something that we've been
able to draw from. And, um,

1032
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,110
you know, like, like I said
before, we got, we've got a
great, uh, Opportunity here,

1033
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,220
you know, and, you know, we know there
no weekend news, you know, but you know,

1034
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,400
you know, to, uh, you know, you're
Latino, you know, this, you know, like,

1035
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:43,010
you know, like right now, just trying to
give me an occasional major, I'm guessing,

1036
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:48,320
you know. Yeah. We've, uh, we've, uh,
obviously I got a great opportunity here.

1037
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,670
Oof. Wow. So we had an ivy league,
Ivy League, you know, that's a big,

1038
01:07:53,671 --> 01:07:58,510
that's a big step. We never had a
Harvard one. No, we haven't. That's a,

1039
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:02,520
that's, that's quite a unique thing to
have a Harvard level, you know, champ.

1040
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:06,570
Very special. Can I, you know
what I'm saying? Just say,
you know what I'm saying,

1041
01:08:06,571 --> 01:08:11,010
that uh, thanks to everybody that
downloaded, uh, mostly stories,

1042
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:12,900
the album, Eh, you,

1043
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:16,490
you may be number one on and

1044
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,650
I got the physical copies.

1045
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,210
I signed a bunch of them today and
they're at the, uh, in the store.

1046
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:27,140
So if you want an autographed,
a hard copy of the album,

1047
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:29,540
it has two bonus tracks.

1048
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,800
I put that in the store.
It's in the store right now.

1049
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,070
I also,
um,

1050
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:40,790
went to recent or sign the
remaining glass and posters.

1051
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:45,830
So if you want it to be glass and poster
and it's funny, it's autographed. The uh,

1052
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,570
the rest of them I autograph.

1053
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:52,220
The rest of you kindly offered me an
autographed copy of mostly stories.

1054
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:55,940
Thank you for that. Yeah, I did.
I offered for that. Um, and,

1055
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:58,460
and I keep getting asked, everyone
says vinyl. What about vinyl?

1056
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,480
There is going to be a vinyl
release in June of mostly stories.

1057
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:05,960
So if you're waiting for vinyl,
I'll announce it. A big thing then,

1058
01:09:05,961 --> 01:09:10,961
but it is going to be in June and that
will come with a little side little

1059
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:14,900
present with it. Oh Hey,

1060
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,460
do you want to hear my
new foreign voicemail?

1061
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:20,030
Is there any way we could listen to
it? Uh, yeah, you can hear it set.

1062
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:24,200
Tell me what your voicemail it is.
Let me just make sure they can't,

1063
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,800
they can't transcribe it.
Apple. That's fine. That's
fine. The top one. The top one.

1064
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:30,770
Two one, three number. Okay.
Yeah, I got a brand new,

1065
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:35,720
it looks like I have a brand new, a silo
me cause we lost her a he's gone. Yeah.

1066
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,780
Oh yes. That solid may finally
figured it out. I think so.

1067
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:41,990
But now I've got a new one which is
kind of exciting and I hope it keeps up.

1068
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:47,230
Yeah, I hope so too. Um, I should
have it here in a moment. People, uh,

1069
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,470
someone weighed in here, I think my
at council weighed in on the pilot,

1070
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,730
blowjob offer. Jesus, you had
your, you retained counsel,

1071
01:09:56,210 --> 01:10:01,070
um, to, to negotiate with me.

1072
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:07,370
Right. So this is the email that
I think your counsel received.

1073
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,890
The Kim Dear Mrs [inaudible].

1074
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:13,010
This is the water champ personality
and I'm pretty much everything.

1075
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:14,180
Champs representation.

1076
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:19,660
We have picked up Mr Segura on a pro
bono basis because of said champion this

1077
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:24,200
and such. Find that he is fully
deserving of everything he wishes.

1078
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,660
Now down to brass tacks,

1079
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:31,190
we counter propose since the main mommy
has to do something he doesn't wish to

1080
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:34,220
do refrain from obtaining
his pilot license.

1081
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:39,290
So should you in likeness after
all justice his eye for an eye.

1082
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:44,120
All I am sure as I'm sure Mrs. Gross
sickened by the fact that he'll be missing

1083
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:48,710
out on his license and the for 40 hours
of instruction we counter propose the

1084
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:53,711
you must watch and listen to 40 hours
of vomiting and try to be completed no

1085
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:56,210
later than one year time.
Furthermore,

1086
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:59,780
you must listen and watch vomiting and
dry heaving for at least two hours per

1087
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:00,560
year thereafter.

1088
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,370
To counterbalance all the splendors that
Mr [inaudible] girl we missed by be not

1089
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:08,210
becoming a pilot. Sincerely don't
frown white, Brown and associates

1090
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:13,410
while your councils are really,
I got a stupid argument. Well,

1091
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,560
let's see what your counsel replies
with. Now. Here's what I'm thinking.

1092
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:21,480
You are in the midst of negotiating for
the blowjob pilot license and we know

1093
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,300
that there's going to be a lot of back
and forth and no one's going to settle on

1094
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:28,440
the first offer. I'm wondering if we
could throw this into the mix as well.

1095
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:33,070
Introducing the model one service droid
from our limb robotics engineer to

1096
01:11:33,071 --> 01:11:34,300
perform the most intimate,

1097
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:38,590
pleasurable human interaction
discreetly at a price you can afford.

1098
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,350
Yeah. And this way you don't
have to do as much. Right.

1099
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:44,560
Does she get to where the
hiking boots and the rain,

1100
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:48,420
whatever you want to put her
in. I love that park. That
winter wonderland. Blowjob.

1101
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,270
Why is she,
why the rain boots?

1102
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,450
Because it's hard to give blow jobs out,
uh,

1103
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,670
out of ladies after a long hike.

1104
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,710
I think that cause right if you go like
let's go on his hike and camp and then

1105
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:06,220
it's like, oh man, we just hiked all day
and be like, Hey, can I get that Bj now?

1106
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:10,120
And she's pretty tired and pretty
dirty. I'd really like to, you know,

1107
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:13,360
can we wait till we get back to
civilization? And you're like, oh,

1108
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,890
it's a pitch all into the fucking excuse.

1109
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:18,760
That camping fantasy is
top on the porn stuff.

1110
01:12:18,761 --> 01:12:22,270
But when you strip all that stuff
away, all you got is this. So you know,

1111
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:27,140
not as central, it features a fully
adjustable body hiding in plain sight.

1112
01:12:27,141 --> 01:12:29,720
Disguise does a cushion
and model robot warrior,

1113
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,880
it's designed to be assembled in seconds.

1114
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,030
All it takes is a folded blanket over
the bottom. Oh yeah, there you go.

1115
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:38,060
That's what outer clothing garment
of your choice to create a model.

1116
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:42,260
So realistic, feel like another
human in the room with you. Boy,

1117
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:45,620
that is the saddest thing I've ever seen.
How really? I thought it was so joyful.

1118
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:50,810
Fingertip control allows speeds ranging
from gentle foreplay to a punishing 120

1119
01:12:50,811 --> 01:12:55,000
cycles per minute. But with enough
system latency to be safely stopped.

1120
01:12:55,010 --> 01:13:00,010
So you can say the soft flexible
entry give smooth access complete with

1121
01:13:00,321 --> 01:13:05,000
semi-hard teeth. Nice tongue anthro
contours are realistic experience.

1122
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,790
Gosh, it seems like it's not funny.
This is, this is all we think about.

1123
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:13,660
Many use their intellect to
create things to make them come.

1124
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,320
That's how the Internet was developed.
It's just I need to come.

1125
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:19,070
I need to come in.
It's pretty amazing.

1126
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:21,660
All right,

1127
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:26,460
and then turn disturbing the flow
of air unrestricted movement.

1128
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:31,000
The exit tube can be covered
with a fingertip to the
exit to provide toe curling

1129
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:31,920
suction on demand.

1130
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:36,580
Oh, so you can, it's like hitting a
bong. You know, like a pipe. You know,

1131
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:39,560
you just cover up the air there.

1132
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:45,710
The up to 100% human hair is attached
securely flowing directly from inside the

1133
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:50,310
model scale. This can be
washed shampooed, ironed, cut,

1134
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,440
styled any way. Design plunging your
fingers through the thick, luxurious,

1135
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:59,100
soft hair. Beautiful. Forget
hard plastic containers.

1136
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,910
Vibrating balls are rings that
provides such a natural sensation.

1137
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,920
Nothing can imitate that gentle rhythmic
caressing motion. The head on the chest.

1138
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,100
It makes you sad a little bit
though. What are you talking about? I

1139
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:16,720
mean it is the happiest all ever for how
many people are like fucking finally,

1140
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,720
you know, I want them to focus on
what's the price tag? I mean that's,

1141
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,440
that's got it costs like 10 grand.
That looks like it's expensive. Super,

1142
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,290
very reasonable.
We didn't get to the real price.

1143
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,930
My thinking is if you can pay for that,

1144
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,520
why not just pay for an actual woman to
do that for you? That's a good point.

1145
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:40,780
Yeah. I guess I said this thing,
you know you can just have it for,

1146
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,370
you don't have to call again. Here's the
thing. It's like you can wash this hair.

1147
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,233
First of all,

1148
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,840
you know dudes aren't going to wash her
hair and they're not going to clean out

1149
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:52,110
the mouth. He, that's the
problem. The real problem. Yeah.

1150
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,000
They're going to nut in that thing
and then I'll be like, oh no,

1151
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:59,660
it's growing mushrooms. Why
is it rotten? Yeah, it smells.

1152
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:01,243
Oh,

1153
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:07,000
he can't really trust men
with this sort of technology.

1154
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:11,980
I feel like this is not good idea.
That smells is going to be horrible.

1155
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,050
No. Here's the, here's the real, here's
what you need. A service. Really.

1156
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:20,530
It smells bad. It's what I'm saying. Well,
here's a service that needs to happen.

1157
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:24,310
There needs to be an app and you can
order the machine to be delivered and then

1158
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:29,200
taken away. Oh, isn't it? And then you
leave it out front. Like in a hotel.

1159
01:15:29,201 --> 01:15:32,380
When you leave the, the takeout
with the dining services stuff,

1160
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,910
just throwing done dot. Yeah. That's
the service disposable. One of these.

1161
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,540
That's another, yeah. Disposable heads.

1162
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:45,340
The head in the trash and then garbage
comes on Monday and they're like,

1163
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:50,341
there's six female doll heads and the
trash with their mouths open eyes are uh,

1164
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,820
and there's calm. Just drawing
it all over them. The solution.

1165
01:15:53,821 --> 01:15:57,610
But I had a crazy weekend. Jesus. Ooh.
Feel better though. I feel way better.

1166
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,930
Right? That's the solution. Um,

1167
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:07,380
there's no way to dudes are maintaining
that things. Hair and mouth. No, no, no.

1168
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:10,350
Guys are casting real fucking
animals, man. Come on.

1169
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,960
The guy that's going to do that.
You think he's a real neat freak,

1170
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:19,630
real socialized person thinks
about stuff like that. Hell No.

1171
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:24,450
Hell to the no, he's cutting up cats in
a basement somewhere. Oh yeah, for sure.

1172
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,380
Um, so what does I wanted
to play for you? Oh,

1173
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:32,920
you had an email to read reading them
it. No, you were going to read an email.

1174
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:38,460
You said that you read an email and
we'll look for once in my life being an

1175
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:42,790
asshole really paid off. And
I'll show you why. Tell me why.

1176
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,040
My wonderful demeanor I've
saved lives as it says here,

1177
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,650
Mommy, Tina saved my life.
Please. Wow. Yup. Yup.

1178
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:54,130
My dearest mommy is
nothing but love t bonds,

1179
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:57,550
but this email is about how my main money,
Christina saved my life.

1180
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:01,720
I can't reference the
episode, but Christina made a
comment, then changed my life.

1181
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:04,510
I'm paraphrasing and I'm far
too lazy to find the episode.

1182
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:07,150
But a comment was made
that if you are 400 pounds,

1183
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:11,120
you either need to get your
life or go for a world record.

1184
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:15,770
At the time I heard this,
I was 406 pounds. Wow. Wow.

1185
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,080
In the heat of the moment.
I hated her for the comment.

1186
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,410
That opinion quickly changed
after a good night's sleep.

1187
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,740
I couldn't shake her words and decided
for the first time in my life I was going

1188
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,030
to make a positive decision.

1189
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,900
I decided that I didn't want it to be
one of these fat fucks that needs to be

1190
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:33,350
fork lifted out of their home after a
series of heart attacks and decided to

1191
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:34,970
actually do something about it.

1192
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,210
That morning I joined a
weight loss program for men.

1193
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,690
Huge shout out to Harvey
Brooker in Toronto there.

1194
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,080
Couldn't have done it without you started
taking my diet seriously and got off

1195
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:47,960
my ass and started working out.
At the time of this email,

1196
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:53,230
I am pleased to say that I am now down
100 pounds and pushing for 100 pounds

1197
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:59,480
more. I send this email is simply thank
Christina for the inadvertent inadvertent

1198
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:01,070
motivation to get my shit together.

1199
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:05,660
She honestly extended my life by making
an off the cuff remark and is directly

1200
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:09,170
responsible for improving my
quality of life. My more active,

1201
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:11,480
confident and a straight up pussy slayer.

1202
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,590
But my dog looks significantly bigger
and I can fuck for a straight three

1203
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:19,260
minutes without breaking a sweat. There
you go. So thanks for the [inaudible].

1204
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:23,030
Now see what's his name? Johnny.
Johnny congratulate. Thanks Johnny.

1205
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,890
That's amazing. A hundred
pounds, dude, congratulations.

1206
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,870
This is the Shit I've ever seen.
An episode.

1207
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:37,220
That's the celebrate Christina
episode. Yeah, I mean, you
know, I sometimes I just,

1208
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:39,510
even with drop pearls,
you know,

1209
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:44,450
I would say because I help people,

1210
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:48,540
I have the better personality
and definitely a personality
chant. Somebody Bros,

1211
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,640
nothing but helping people right in

1212
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:55,190
there is the real champ
breakdown. Oh, Jesus wasn't here.

1213
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:58,490
You greedy mommies.
You both can be the chance of everything.

1214
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,970
So I went and did a you as a favor and
broke it down and it listen to your

1215
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:06,970
podcasts in the car and when I get carts
at food lion, so I got this shit. Okay.

1216
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:11,180
BURP champ. This is Tom. Ron. This
is evident throughout the podcast.

1217
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:14,570
He has variety volume and
that. Oh, so perfect pitch.

1218
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,980
F A R t champ. Christina. Listen,

1219
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:23,090
Tom had that one fart on the mic. He
did recently. That was immaculate,

1220
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:27,310
but Mommy team, Tina seems to
have her farts down. Thank you.

1221
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:30,900
Water Champ. Tom. Ron, I should know.

1222
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:36,020
I have to explain this one. We know
he downs gallons of water every day.

1223
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:41,140
Even Joe Rogan is a witness to his
water madness personality champ.

1224
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:47,030
Christina, she just seems
Pfizer, Pfizer, Pfizer.

1225
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:51,770
She just seems nicer. I don't
know. Fuck you. That's what
he wrote on. There you go.

1226
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:55,640
I have nice glass and
champ. Christina, thank you.

1227
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:58,670
I know this hasn't been brought up,
but come on.

1228
01:19:58,671 --> 01:20:02,930
Tina's always writing down notes is very
observant and which is a necessity for

1229
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:05,210
glass and if I miss the championship,

1230
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:09,060
please let me know and I will analyze the
evidence. Thanks for the show. Love you.

1231
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:12,240
Mommy is keep it high and
motherfucking tight. Davis. No,

1232
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:15,960
we never brought up the glass and
champ discussion, but I like it.

1233
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:21,240
I'm definitely way more observant than
you. That's like, oh, I'm so observant.

1234
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:24,450
No, you're not. You Miss
Everything. Literally everything.

1235
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,780
You're not observant so much more
observant of my surroundings.

1236
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:32,670
I know what's happening. You don't pick
up all, I pick up on stuff all the time.

1237
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,830
I pick up on that.
Do you pick up on like a nail on the head?

1238
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,130
But like you don't pick up on subtle cues.

1239
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:45,150
You don't pick up on little
behavior nuances of voice,

1240
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:48,750
of inflection of saying this and they
meant that the look that you don't pick up

1241
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:49,560
on any of that.

1242
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,120
Just like I care for a toddler a
lot and I pick up on what he needs.

1243
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:57,850
He can't talk. I'd say
I'm very sensitive. Yeah.

1244
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,850
Oh look at you.

1245
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:03,450
All of a sudden I'm a stay at home dad
for two whole days and I know I'm the mom

1246
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:05,460
champion. I don't think you're
the very observant person.

1247
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:08,480
I'm so much more observant.
Oh, there he is. He's our guy.

1248
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,600
He's a new food videos.

1249
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:18,050
He trenched like pizza and ranch.
It's not bad.

1250
01:21:18,051 --> 01:21:22,220
It's good. He's fat are definitely,
sounds like he's in public.

1251
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,490
There's like weird to make
this video in public. Right?

1252
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:30,100
Well maybe that's the new thing, you know,
and he's letting it strip on his shirt.

1253
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:33,670
It's, we're listening to king.
Asked ripper eat. By the way,

1254
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,780
there's some fried chicken
definitely in a public setting

1255
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,250
here that there's people around.
It's kind of weird that he would do this.

1256
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:52,420
He's a stuffing food. I know. Honestly,

1257
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:56,410
I'm not really into the eating videos as
much as I liked the farts in the burbs.

1258
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,930
I don't like cause I feel like he's,
he's,

1259
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,470
he's really interesting.
Fascinating.

1260
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:11,710
Fascinating. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

1261
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:15,240
Make an eye contact of the camp.
Is that a restaurant? Oh yeah.

1262
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:19,910
He's in a restaurant. Oh, he
got like a back table. Yeah.
Good idea. Good thinking.

1263
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,880
Even the buffet now. So he went to a
buffet so he's still making videos. Yeah.

1264
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:31,360
God bless him. I miss him.
I know. I'm glad he's back.

1265
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,950
It's really weird to see him not
wearing tidy whities. I know.

1266
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,440
It's weird to see him out in public.
I didn't think he did that.

1267
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:42,750
I thought he just stayed in his basement
all the time. Just farted on stuff. Yeah.

1268
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:47,770
Barter on credenzas and such that I feel
like that's like old now. That's just,

1269
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:52,780
it's not the same anymore. Well
evolved. He's an artist. He changes.

1270
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:57,790
Can't expect him to stay
the same. Somebody wrote,
thanks for making me dream.

1271
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:02,470
I am pleased to inform you that for the
first time in my entire life I had a

1272
01:23:02,471 --> 01:23:05,950
dream about taking a shit and
it's all. Thanks you. Oh Wow.

1273
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,560
Listening to episode three 92 on a long,

1274
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:11,170
late car ride home last night I got home,

1275
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:16,000
I probably fell asleep and had a very
involved dream in which I was a young,

1276
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:19,330
I was in a yoga class
and had to make Brown.

1277
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:22,030
The toilet was in the middle
of the class for some reason,

1278
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,560
and not only did the instructor
call my attention to my shitting,

1279
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,800
but I was so embarrassed that I went to
wipe with my balled up tp and absolutely

1280
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,310
got shit on my hand.

1281
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:38,710
I've been a lifelong toilet
paper water up until today.

1282
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:44,220
You've gotten into my psyche inception
style and now I feel I can finally get my

1283
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:48,940
life. Thanks jeans, Kaitlin. Wow. I
wasn't even expecting that to be a lady.

1284
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:54,070
No, me neither. That was lady. Oh
yeah. Or maybe it means Katelyn.

1285
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,160
Maybe it's the Caitlyn.
Maybe could be,

1286
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:02,240
which is obviously still
a a lady. I didn't mean to
suggest anything. Oh my God.

1287
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,220
Save the Heysel offended. Please,
please save the hate mail.

1288
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:11,860
