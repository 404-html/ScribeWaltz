1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,710
Christina,
cause it's interesting

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,763
you wake up,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,920
there's a shower three days. But
that means on the good side. Yeah,

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,070
she's got real stinky be home

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,510
today. I thought I would play, play,

7
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,620
play with me today.
I thought I would play with me.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,770
Play with
play with mass.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,670
Personate there's probably
a lot of smells going on.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,420
Thinking about wholesale
is this lady's got one.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Someone can sit on my face all day with
her ass and I wouldn't mind smothering

12
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:09,340
them with snow. You asshole. What?
Today? I thought I would play,

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,430
play, play today.

14
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,680
I thought I would play with my ass.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,230
She is playing with my life.
Yeah.

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,600
Hmm hmm. Hmm. Yeah, you
got it. She's early.

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,850
You got a gnarly be
whole right now. I do. I

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,430
run your finger along the crack of your
ass. You don't need to finger your whole,

19
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,290
you don't want to come back
with shit on your finger.

20
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,830
Always good advice and it's not sexual.
That's the best part about it.

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,690
That's the best part
about pup play is just,

22
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:45,950
it's just a bunch of guys hanging
out and latex dog costumes. Yeah,

23
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,110
just exchanging recipes.
Yeah, it's true. Swabbing,

24
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,130
swapping Kido recipes I like,
we're both really keyed up for today.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,010
I both are really excited.
You know why I'm energized because I,

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,490
I came back from fart next and I met
so many mommies and then, you know,

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,010
they tell me things like your, the water
champ, your, the personality champion.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,490
And then it inspires me to come
back and just be those things.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,310
We'll get into that later.
But there's,

30
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,500
there's more than a controversy I
would say. I doubt that. No. Well,

31
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:22,370
you can doubt all you on. This is a huge
episode because you had, I don't want to,

32
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,760
I don't want to blow what it is, but
yeah, you've had quite an, uh, uh, uh,

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,470
past three days. Yeah. And for this show,
it's pretty much what we're all about.

34
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,800
So we're going to do a full hour on
what happened to you, I think. Yeah,

35
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:38,480
there's a lot, there's a lot
to get into. Um, yeah. He
didn't sound enthusiastic. No,

36
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:43,100
no. I, I mean it's, it was very
traumatizing. Very emotional.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,830
Yeah. So that's going to be a lot
to, to talk about. Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,000
We'll process it, but that's what the show
is for. To process what happened. Yeah,

39
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,830
that's true. They give it as your therapy.
I do. I do. This will be a good for me.

40
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:02,500
It'd be good for us as a
couple. As a family. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,860
We'll get into it too when you have
three and you, all right, well let's,

42
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,780
why don't we do a proper show open and do
it. Yeah. We proud of each other. Okay.

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,273
Here we go.

44
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,650
And then years later
when I was masturbating,

45
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,760
when everyone in my family to see
who were roused me, Oh my God,

46
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,590
I tried my father, my
mother, my children. Oh,

47
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:30,490
my grandparents, my cousins, my siblings,

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,160
and the only one who arouse
me with my father. Yeah. Well,

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,463
Oh,
is

50
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,890
she?
Your mom saw

51
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,443
Christina

52
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,780
nasty bitch.

53
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,630
I mean, first of all, for this show,

54
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:38,420
it's supposed to be your mom that arouses
you and I mean houses normative of her

55
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:42,950
to choose her patriarchal at she is hard
fucking core. Yeah. Without a doubt.

56
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,340
No kidding. She gets in
there, she never plays games.

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,940
Just when you think she
can't shock us anymore. Yeah.

58
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,320
And then she drives that knowledge.
Isn't that bananas? Yeah. But you know,

59
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,220
when you think about it,

60
00:04:55,221 --> 00:05:00,020
it kind of makes sense from us from a
Freudian psychoanalysis perspective. Yeah.

61
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,650
Because your father is your first, your
first love. Yeah. Well she, you know,

62
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:06,890
she breaks it down. I
mean, uh, this is, um,

63
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,320
somebody that's not new to our show.

64
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,540
I always love that the Beethoven is
prominently displayed behind her.

65
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,570
It really does offset
any wacky stuff you say.

66
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:20,480
If you have like intelligent
things behind you. I know.

67
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,830
That's how I got to start doing for my
calling. She's, yeah, she's great. Yeah.

68
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,150
She's really cool. I like her. Yeah. She
has a lot of things going on there. Um,

69
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,210
she has a lot of things going there.

70
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,740
She has a, like I said, she's
not, she's not new to our show.

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,030
Uh, we've, we've featured
her prominently before. Um,

72
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,920
you may remember her. I've come
all over my face. That's her.

73
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,080
Um,
he loves this company.

74
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,700
So then she went on to come strike.
That's Ryan. I've forgotten.

75
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:56,860
How did that come strike?

76
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,740
Because guys kept wanting to
come on her and all over her.

77
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,910
They were horrified if their
own come touched themselves. So.

78
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,480
And did the strike work, did
she get a raise? I don't know.

79
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,340
I mean I watch CNN a lot and I
know that's kind of, you know,

80
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:14,460
so maybe it's covered on Fox or maybe
some BBC or something. I Dunno. Right.

81
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,080
Um,
so I dunno if it was ever covered,

82
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,430
but I know that she did make a big
thing about going on in the company.

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,290
There's a writer's strike happening.
Does it have anything to do?

84
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,940
I think they have averted that. So maybe
they averted the two things together,

85
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,690
I'm guessing. Cause we didn't know how
her, her strike ended. That's true.

86
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,980
Let me see if, um, yeah,

87
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,310
if I can pull up a w w what
do we have here? Um, but yeah,

88
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:44,030
so she, she was just, she's big on,

89
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,310
um, on talking in detail
about I think, oh,

90
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,360
here we go here. Would, she could have
had a career as a muppet for sure.

91
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,390
On strike against com. Com. Yeah.

92
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,970
Which you're going to come on sesame
street. We were looking up the character,

93
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:06,740
like who does the voices of cookie and
Oscar? I think she'd make a killer muppet.

94
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,790
She has a great voice for that.
Yeah. If she gives us the thing calm,

95
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,010
she should do that. I think we
should go on strike against calm

96
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,390
Tom. I don't want to share my
[inaudible]. That's pretty good.

97
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,400
Yeah.
You have to share.

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't want to share my cookies.
That's pretty good.

99
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,580
I don't want to share my com.
Yeah, I've got this cup of common.

100
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,920
It's all mine in my balls, right? Yeah.

101
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,510
Just to come for everyone. No,
I'm going on to come strike. Yeah.

102
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,710
So it's really good. Yeah.

103
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,510
I can tell you what a lot of
children's programming. Um, Nah,

104
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,140
scram. Oscar's our favorite
right now. Oscars off.

105
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,870
See how we integrate the fact
that we have a child over into,

106
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,490
you know,
we're a family show,

107
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,590
but also we discuss things that
appeal to adults. I'll come strikes.

108
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,480
Uh, just because you become a mom and dad
doesn't mean you have to be lame. Yeah.

109
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,820
So as a mother,
I'm offended by that.

110
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,270
Oh
Gee.

111
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,900
Dad's upset. That doesn't want
to hear going on a come straight.

112
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,340
So do you like to join me on my,

113
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,730
and I don't want it to
be like that were pilot.

114
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:35,480
Like I'm not trying to
make fun of this lady.

115
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,870
It's just that she covers so many things
outside of normal everyday coffee talk

116
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:47,360
conversations. She really needs
her job. Yeah. She gets out there.

117
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,990
So this is like, Eh, this is stuff
that maybe we should be talking about,

118
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,810
but we're not understanding which they
should put her on the view. Whoopee.

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,900
But they don't have the balls. You know
who does? Yeah, we do real show. Yeah.

120
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,020
Do your incest fantasies.

121
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,420
I want you to feel guilt
or shame around them.

122
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,480
Maybe you've never allowed yourself to
have them because you think you would be

123
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:17,410
a horrible person if you ever went there.
So it's all suppressed.

124
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,290
Yeah. Wow. Does she have a phd in
psycho analysis too? I don't know,

125
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:26,490
but she's really this sex
Bert, right? Cause she's, yeah,
she's written books on it.

126
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,190
She's definitely experienced a lot of it.
Yeah.

127
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,330
Incest fantasies are normal.
Okay.

128
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,280
I first learned this from Betty
Dotson's book sucks for one,

129
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,490
and when I read her book in my late
forties and she wrote about incest

130
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,720
fantasies,
I was repulsed.

131
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,103
I'll be honest.

132
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,280
The idea of of approaching
the subject is terrifying.

133
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,570
It's not supposed to be like,
oh yeah, I totally, I get it.

134
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:58,560
Like you're supposed to feel right.
It's not a good top it,

135
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,210
those fantasies do exist.

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,170
I think the mind does a good job of
shelving them pretty deep. In other words,

137
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,550
it's not something that's on the
forefront all the time, you know? No,

138
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:11,070
but like again, I feel like it makes
total sense when you think about it.

139
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,610
Your mother is your very first sensual,
and I don't mean sexual sent,

140
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,300
like since you,

141
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:21,900
you literally embraced her
boobs for life in the morning,

142
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,610
in the morning and the
beginning of your life.

143
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,170
So it makes sense that that's
your first sensual experience.

144
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:32,910
Not necessarily sexual, but stimi.
That makes sense. Yeah. Wow.

145
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,320
So fucking deep did. And then your mother
is probably the first one that's like,

146
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,540
yeah, he was around now and
you kind of go for it. Wow.

147
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,580
But then would you marry your mom? I
mean, marrying your mom or other things?

148
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:49,200
It's totally different. It's
just, you know, it's just
like the gays. That's right.

149
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,430
Yeah.
Um,

150
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,260
and then a couple of years later, I
actually, when I was masturbating,

151
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:59,530
went through everyone in my
family to see who were roused me.

152
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,060
I tried my father, my mother, my children,

153
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,930
my grandparents, my cousins, grandparents,

154
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,070
my siblings, nasties. It
asked me was my father,

155
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,430
do you think you, your granddaddy gets you
hard for you, by the way? For me. Well,

156
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,870
just cause you know, you're
a woman. She's a woman.

157
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,110
While I was taking it
for the grandparents,

158
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:28,130
I know you have some pretty sexy grandad
fantasies, don't you? I liked it.

159
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:29,540
Her approach to it though,
it was like,

160
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,150
I'm going to start masturbating
and then go through the Rolodex.

161
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:36,800
Like who turns me on? Who Turns
me on? That's how she, it's just,

162
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:40,330
it's, it's different. It's a brave, yeah.

163
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,130
I'm not sure I need to go there.
Like you said,

164
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:45,590
that's kind of one of those things that
you can totally repressed your whole

165
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:49,550
life and be fine. Like there's some
things you don't need to go into. No,

166
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,130
I'm totally cool with no, hopefully
we'll explore it today. That was a, for

167
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,260
me,
that was the only one that turned me on.

168
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,370
My boys did not or my mother or anything,
but um,

169
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,390
I allowed myself,
I didn't judge my fantasy,

170
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,860
I just went with it cause it was
a rousing to me and I'm like,

171
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,200
well what does this pant,
is he teaching?

172
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,410
Nothing like that. She's exploring. Asked
him, will you ever date your mom? Oscar?

173
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,830
Do you ever have any sexual fantasies
about your dad? No. Get out of here

174
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,670
and where it showed me and what it does
do you and who I will play with Mommy

175
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,740
fucking price.

176
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:33,700
Say It involves a lot of the insights.

177
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:37,960
My name is Tom is about having sex
with someone who loves you. Oh,

178
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
and who you feel love for?

179
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,410
Is that what that's about? That's, it
would be great. Yeah, that is a good one.

180
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,760
Is that,

181
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,550
is that I'm going to ask my therapist
about that cause she's afraid in psycho

182
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,280
analysis that she breaks it down that way.
Does that change it at all for,

183
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:58,450
you know, if you, I don't know.
I wasn't paying attention.

184
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:02,110
I was still horrified. Like I'm still
on the Rolodex. I'm not here to,

185
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:06,910
Annecy is tied to having sex with somebody
that really loves you. Oh, like love.

186
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,810
Yeah. Yeah. That's the maternal,
the paternal right thing. Now,

187
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:13,930
can you masturbate to your dad? Right,
right, right. Got You. Okay. Oh,

188
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,890
is that what we're trying to do?
We're trying to get me, yeah.

189
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,370
Probably get you into the same
mindset. Oh, okay. No, it's still not.

190
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,940
Let's keep working on not,
oh, please. No, no, no,

191
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,260
master.

192
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm glad I allowed that fantasy
because now it no longer turns me on.

193
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,060
Like it was just a step on
my sexual evolution. Yeah.

194
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
Because I think all of our
fantasies teach us something. No.

195
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,120
Repressing them just stops the
sexual evolution, I believe. Okay.

196
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,510
So what do you, but in all
seriousness, do you believe this?

197
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,370
Do you believe that perhaps

198
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,840
she is very sexually
evolved? Absolutely. Yeah.

199
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,380
I think anybody that can go to the dark
side, their force and come out of it.

200
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,630
Here's the thing,
I repress so much shit.

201
00:13:56,631 --> 00:14:01,010
Like I am a fucking vault of dark
thoughts. Yeah. I mean it's, I'm,

202
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,390
I'm a comedian. I see a shrink once a
week. Like the darkness is Sodi been me.

203
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,850
I can't, I can't go here. That's
why I love shit like this.

204
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,790
She goes there and I can make fun of
her. Right. Like we're poking at her.

205
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:15,380
We're having a good laugh.
Yeah. But truthfully, yeah.
She's actually very sexy.

206
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,370
Way More evolved than me. Yeah. And
I can't stand it. Like I'm, I'm,

207
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:23,480
I'm so threatened by it. Shoreside
that's her name. Thanks dude.

208
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:27,810
It's all love girl. You just blew
our minds again. Yeah, you did. Damn,

209
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,370
that's not possible by the way.
Very hard to faze us on the show.

210
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Say that know very little like rattles
our cages and sometimes things are just

211
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:43,350
fun to learn. Oh No. This
one I showed you that. No,

212
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,900
I don't like this one.
Why not?

213
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,840
Jim's normal routine was after he kills
someone that he was loved status and lay

214
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,100
down and take a nap.
I mean it was like

215
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,240
a Aphrodisiac Pharma taking a value.
It was just nice and relaxed.

216
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,870
Implement next couple of weeks.
Nice to relax you.

217
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,850
Just like a stress relief and then you
could see a buildup in again. But yeah,

218
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:05,060
like killing people a relaxed him.

219
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,700
Yeah.

220
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,290
That's a Kevin Weeks as part
of the Winter Hill Gang.

221
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,790
He ran with James Whitey Bulger your hero.
No.

222
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,103
Um,

223
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,030
as I was watching this documentary on
bodyguards and so they have different,

224
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,400
um, bodyguards, different worlds
of being about, in other words,

225
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:31,540
they have entertainer, like
Justin Bieber's body guard.
They had Nelson Mandela,

226
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,660
one of his body guards.
So you have like an entertainer,

227
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:38,670
you have a head of state and then this
a soccer player. Was it Nelson Mandela?

228
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,210
The hockey player? That's right. Yep.
The uh, great, great hockey player.

229
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Uh, he did so much from the Blue Jays. Um,

230
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,680
I forget what team they believe.

231
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,010
He really paved the way for so
many great hockey players. Um,

232
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,250
but then they had this Guy Kevin Weeks
who I've seen another documentaries and

233
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,060
so he was a, he was like muscle
for a Whitey Bulger. Yeah.

234
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,500
Also a really neat guy who whitey
Bulger. Yeah. It was positive.

235
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:14,180
Like Tony Robbins telling people what
to do. Yeah. He's a real piece of work,

236
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,800
acting the world of love.

237
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,320
But then he's telling these stories
about all these different murders.

238
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:23,280
They committed God and then he tells
this part where he's like, and then,

239
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:23,970
you know,

240
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,360
his usual routine was he would kill
someone and then just go take a nap.

241
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,360
And he's like,
and then he was just cool for weeks.

242
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:34,230
Like you could see that he was like, like
killing people really relaxed him. Yeah.

243
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,453
That was,
um,

244
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,550
I know that you've been high on this
clip for days. No, because it's so crazy.

245
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,370
And it is. Yeah. It's so crazy. I'm also,

246
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,760
I also love that I play it for you before
bed. That's what I was going to say.

247
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:50,930
This thing where you're like, stop showing
me these things before I go to sleep.

248
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,101
Well,
yeah,

249
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,800
I mean we weren't let showed you something
that you told me it wasn't your dream.

250
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,810
The next day you'll get fucked up.
My whole green of course.

251
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,140
The thing is you and I were having
fun like we were like what play?

252
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:04,100
We were laying in bed petting the dogs,
just like school girls. So I was like, Oh,

253
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:07,250
I've got to show you this funny
thing and then you ruined the moment.

254
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,720
You're like, oh, hold on,
hold on. Speaking of which,

255
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:12,710
I have a really funny clip to show you
and then you turn on the sh the show and

256
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,110
I was like, dude, I'm
about to go to sleep. Yeah.

257
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,430
I don't want to hear about murder and
how the sky light likes killing people.

258
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:19,520
Right.

259
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,090
It makes me sleep nice to relax in
the next couple of weeks. He was nice,

260
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:23,380
you know,

261
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,230
actually was just like a stress relief
and then you could see a buildup in again,

262
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,930
but showing people a relaxed him.

263
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,230
I think watching documentaries about
people kill people relaxes you.

264
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,510
It makes me laugh. What? What part
of that like brings you so much joy?

265
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:43,890
It's so crazy. That's why you like having
your mind blown before bed. Is that,

266
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:47,010
is that what it is? Just so
crazy. I, here's the thing,

267
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,820
inappropriate behavior,
inappropriate

268
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,850
things said is a huge
mindblowing laugh escape for me.

269
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,470
So like somebody saying like the lady
saying, kiss my pussy in the bank. Yeah.

270
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,750
I always make me laugh. We have
a whole show dedicated. I know,

271
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,150
but for some reason a
murdering because it's,

272
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,880
it's so like to hear somebody talk about
it this way is so far removed from how

273
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,500
you should talk about it. Yeah.
So that's why it makes me laugh.

274
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,250
Like if it was somebody
saying it in the way that you,

275
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,720
like if this guy was scared and
talking about how scared he would,

276
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,530
it wouldn't register as, um, it's
funny the way that he's talking,

277
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,520
like he's talking about it like, like
he's talking about, I don't know,

278
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:37,020
like wildlife. I think the club is
actually very amusing. Yeah, it is.

279
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,700
But it's also really disturbing.

280
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:43,160
So what it is I'm not hearing from
you is like, yeah, that was funny.

281
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,760
It's really,
it's ridiculous.

282
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,120
But I'm not sensing the empathetic sort
of and how tragic that he's killing

283
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,400
people. Because if we go into,
if you, if you shift it, uh,

284
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,890
30 seconds earlier or they're talking
about the graphic details of the murder,

285
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,240
I don't find that funny because
they show up what's not funny.

286
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,730
It's funny for a guy to describe as his,
one of his close friends and he's like,

287
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,760
it really relaxed them and you can see
that actually he doesn't register that

288
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,820
it's absurd. Right. That's the funnier
part. It seems like he would take a nap.

289
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,680
You know what I think it is with these
murder shows is that you consume them the

290
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:26,750
way most people consume
comedies or sitcoms.

291
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,380
I don't like watching comedies neither.
Why very seldom do I enjoy a comedy.

292
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:34,670
But you consume them at such a high rate.

293
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,960
Like it really is your favorite thing.

294
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,820
Does it upset you that I don't share
your enthusiasm for murder and can I tell

295
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:46,320
you though, my, the really, the thing is
I'm completely convinced that everybody,

296
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,790
all of us who consume any
type of either books, movies,

297
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,650
TV shows, well, we all like our
stories, but that's the universal thing.

298
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,350
It's a story. There's only
like six stories, right?

299
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,260
So the thing that I like about crime
shows and whatnot, but the crime show,

300
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,400
what I like is,

301
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,270
I like the stories
involved in the crime show.

302
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,880
I like that somebody does something.

303
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:17,150
And then I like the path of the
people hunting that person down,

304
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,530
getting like,
I liked that whole story.

305
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:23,040
So you like it when the
murderer gets caught as I do,

306
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:27,180
I absolutely side with the killer. And
you're like, I'll be gets away with this.

307
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:30,750
No, no. But I want, I want,
if it's a good crime story,

308
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,670
you want him to almost get away with it.

309
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,230
Otherwise it's boring you hard
enough. Yeah. You want them,

310
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,490
you want him to, I mean, look at all the
grunt great crime movies or, or stories.

311
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,900
It's that, you know, he misleads
the investigators. He leaves a clue.

312
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,130
They think they have, he
gets away. I mean, that's

313
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,570
what makes those stories excited. Okay.
Look, I'm not, you know, yeah. Oh,

314
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,380
say anything and just curious. But
also thank for you. In my past,

315
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,960
I don't do any more, but when I used to
kill people, he's just very relaxing to,

316
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,440
yes. Very nice. Take a nap
after. Oh yeah. I mean,

317
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:07,441
the idea that somebody can take a
nap after that is in saint sociopath.

318
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,410
Yeah, of course. Yeah. Sociopath.
But that's why it's like,

319
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:16,180
it's jarring to hear about. It does,
it gives them a charge if they did.

320
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,770
Yeah. The, the last thing they'd be
able to do is take a nap. Right. Yeah.

321
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,610
You know, I, my step father is
dead now and my mother's dead,

322
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:26,600
so I can talk about
them, I think. Yeah. Uh,

323
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,340
my Stepdad was a sociopath as well,

324
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,370
and I know that it gave him a lot
of joy to stab somebody tires.

325
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,270
Right.
But not stab people.

326
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,550
Not People know that he didn't
kill people that I know of now.

327
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,300
I did give him a thrill to
do wacky stuff like that,

328
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,350
but it wouldn't put them to sleep.

329
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,440
It would just give him a charge and
then he actually got excited. It was,

330
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,570
it was like the, yeah, it was snowflakes.

331
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,970
It was happiness for him and my mom both.
They love to conspire and,

332
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,800
and you know, get, get,

333
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:00,600
get one over on someone you a different,

334
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,920
but I have killed off a lot of people.
I know there's kind of scumbags kind of,

335
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,410
they kill a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I think I want to say that,

336
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,503
you know,

337
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,370
the original count against
Bulger and his crew was like 19.

338
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,240
How do you know of, right? That's
what I'm saying. Yeah. Who knows?

339
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:26,020
What's the heading it putting on them?
That's banana. That guy's a real psycho.

340
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,740
Fuck. Yeah. I mean I saw Johnny Depp's
version of him in that movie. Good.

341
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,740
He's really good. He's always good.
Right? Johnny Depp's really good actor.

342
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,760
Black Mass.
Not About Shaq's assholes about,

343
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,600
it's about white and black mass.
Yeah.

344
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,080
So nasty as hell, man. Yeah.
Black mass does sound like a,

345
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,180
like a B hall that's covered in
Brown. It's a lot. Has Chocolate.

346
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:53,860
He Shit. Dark chocolate. Pretty crazy man.

347
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,270
Yeah. Well neat. So can we
get to finally your weekend,

348
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:03,160
how your life is like God, it was uh,
it's been, uh, it's a long journey.

349
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,910
Next dog. Hands Down, dog coming up.

350
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,363
You've been lowered.

351
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,940
So if you're listening in your cubicle
guys, time to put the headphones on.

352
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,180
Don't worry.
This is not like,

353
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:24,140
I want to tell people because they hear
that and they're like, oh God. You know,

354
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,840
so people are like, are you just
going to just tell me you took? No.

355
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,860
What happened was I got sick. It's
a story. It's a story. So don't,

356
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,400
this is not just about a fart or
something, you know, this is a,

357
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:36,710
this is a real story that's in dignity.
I did something.

358
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:39,260
You're definitely gonna make fun of
me for it. But I thought I did it.

359
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,251
And you know,

360
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:45,050
there's always jokes about buying
Sushi from wherever I bought Sushi,

361
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,250
whole foods,

362
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,420
whole farts. I was there picking up some,
some things. I was a single dad. You,

363
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,600
you left town.
So I did a single dad run,

364
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,290
nanny was here watching the boy.
I run to the store and I go,

365
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,930
I got to get things for breakfast and
lunch tomorrow. So I get, you know,

366
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,460
the usual stuff is milk and is some fruit,
some eggs is this and that.

367
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,800
And when I'm there, um, I had worked
out, I'd worked out like an hour before,

368
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,740
so I'm hungry. Right. But a,

369
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,830
I'm thinking about cooking and it's
like that split second decision. Yeah,

370
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,260
go tired.
Just want to have something quick,

371
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:22,970
what can I get that's going to satiate me?
But also,

372
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,260
you know, kind of healthy.
So as I'm walking through,
it's whole foods has that,

373
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,110
the little Sushi, there's
a chef, they're like,

374
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,520
this is a Thursday. Okay. So
I'm like, you know, and yeah,

375
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,800
it is later in the day. So yeah,
stuff's probably been made for a while.

376
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,270
Ordain rule.

377
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,010
Like you don't want to order Sushi on a
Sunday because the fish markets close on.

378
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,410
Yeah, that's probably
right. But I, you know,

379
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,750
don't fucking so fucking,
I go,

380
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,020
I go, I look at it. Okay.
I get salmon. Sashimi.

381
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:04,900
You're not pronouncing it Salmon
Sashimi. It's like six pieces. That's,

382
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,070
no, that looked fine. It was totally
fine. It's got the brown spots.

383
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:14,160
It's perfect.
I grabbed that real white brown.

384
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,300
I grab some toony and then
I'm like Sasha, me. Yeah.

385
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,620
Then I go,
I'm going to do something else.

386
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,690
And then there's seared albacore chem,
so,

387
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,590
and that's on rice. I'm like,
ah, you know, have like a
couple of bites with Rice.

388
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:32,530
A couple of I, that's how
we, we do Sushi at it. Don't,

389
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,780
you don't want to get too much
rice. So anyways, I grabbed that.

390
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,070
I run home,
I put away the groceries,

391
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,900
I start, I open these three
things, I wolf down the soundman,

392
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,080
take a couple bites of toony.

393
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Then I opened that seared albacore and
the first one I take a bite with Rice,

394
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,270
right? Yeah. And I go back and I have
another piece of like salmon or whatever.

395
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:03,620
And then tuna, and then I go, I remember,

396
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:06,230
I noticed that like that rice
balls too big. So I take a,

397
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,590
I take it the seared albacore
off of it and I'm like,

398
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:13,040
I don't want to have too much rice.
And as I take a bite of it,

399
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm like just tastes fishy.
Which is a no, no, no, no.

400
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,940
Yeah. If you don't eat Sushi, it sounds
silly. But like if it smells like typical,

401
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:27,020
like when you go, it smells like a
fish market. Like fish mouth. Yeah.

402
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:29,840
Like your dog's mouth.
That's not what you want.

403
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,160
So I have like half a bite in and I'm
like, I'm just not feeling it man. I know,

404
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:38,090
but I'm not putting together, you
know everything yet. I'm just like,

405
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,840
I just not digging this.
And also you're a bear.

406
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,070
Bear's just put everything in their mouth.
If it's like

407
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,620
a beehive with the bees
swarming and stinging his mouth,

408
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,690
he doesn't notice the bees stinging you.

409
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:53,310
You've put like molten hot pizza
in your mouth. Did you choose to,

410
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,340
you chew through the pain but so,
but this is awesome.

411
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,750
You chew through the smells too.
I don't need anymore really stop.

412
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,420
So, so I have basically, so that's
good. One and a half pieces of what?

413
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,690
Cause I just go like I'm not digging.
It doesn't smell right. Tastes good.

414
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,940
So anyways, that's all
I have. Okay. I Dunno,

415
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,330
30 40 minutes later I shoot
a water hose out of my ass,

416
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,310
but I go, that's you know that's normal
for you. Well No, I just go like the,

417
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,480
I don't think of it as, oh
this is serious. I just think
like that didn't settle.

418
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:35,310
Right. Cause I don't feel sick. I just
feel like this is, you know, that was bad.

419
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,610
Something was bad, but I don't feel like
it's the next level bad. In other words,

420
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,090
sometimes you eat something, it
doesn't agree with you, it's out.

421
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,130
And it passes as an a metaphor.

422
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,740
Somebody who has a severe phobia of
vomiting what you did like, first of all,

423
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:51,900
I won't even eat whole food Sushi
if you've ever seen me do it.

424
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,380
I know because I'm in a minute. I am
so terrified of vomiting. Number two,

425
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,580
whenever I choose an item of food that's
out, this is going to sound crazy,

426
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,830
but this is one of my crazy food phobia.
Thanks.

427
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,480
I always choose the item that's far
back puts you. Always put your hand,

428
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,530
put it there. They put the
oldest shit in the front. Yeah.

429
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,740
So whenever I choose eggs, milk,
chicken, rotisserie chicken.

430
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,610
Always go for the back dude. Cause those
are the freshest. That's a fresh shit.

431
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,450
The dry shits in the front dude. I bet
you, I bet you picked a fucking first one,

432
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,810
Huh? No, I don't remember how I picked
it, but I do remember this nasty.

433
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,910
Don't eat that shit in the next
morning I woke up and I was like,

434
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,920
oh I don't mind how many shoots did you
make after this one? But it was water.

435
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,610
Yeah, it was bad as a seven. Yeah.

436
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,250
I ended up having the full fucking Bristol
stool chart over the next few days.

437
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,750
But yeah, it was, it was just, yeah,
it was fucking water. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

438
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,470
I'm trying to do the shit lock
and we during an autopsy on it,

439
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,690
the next morning I wake up and I have
this basically you, you've heard,

440
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,900
I'm sure people talk about the coffee
that has like a grass fed butter and MCT

441
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:05,090
oil and basically it, it's, um,
it's, it's richer, but it's, it,

442
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:09,390
you get good fats and it's, it's almost
like a meal replacement also, you know?

443
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,710
And anyways,

444
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,880
I have just that for breakfast
right after seven diarrhea,

445
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,410
well not be here, but the seven
is fucking, I don't know, man,

446
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:23,760
like 12 hours earlier and I feel
fine. I don't feel, I don't feel sick.

447
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,150
You're probably a little dehydrated.
A little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,780
But I have that and it, it
satiates you. So I'm like, I'm not,

449
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm not eating other foods and I don't
feel like I need food right away,

450
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,580
you know, all makes sense. Now I'm free
this way. I know what happened. Um,

451
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,430
with the boy, I feel fine.
He has breakfast, um,

452
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,440
few hours later, I dunno. Oh, we,
you know, I take them to the park.

453
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,910
He has some snacks. Uh Ha. He has lunch.

454
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,080
Then I have an avocado.
I'm like as a kind of midday snack.

455
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,700
Then a couple hours after
that nanny comes over. Right.

456
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,610
So now it's like two in the afternoon.
So I've been with them

457
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,740
all eight hours already
eaten like real solid yet.

458
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,610
I know. That's why you were confused about
where you got the poisoning from. Yeah,

459
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,740
because I haven't really,
so anything else to push out the jams.

460
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,900
Right. So then it's getting, like I
said, it's around two and I'm like,

461
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,690
now I'm getting hungry but I
also don't want to, you know,

462
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,360
I have like things that I eat,
things I don't eat right.

463
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:28,300
So I have this like uh,

464
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,920
Kido like fuel pack where I,

465
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,890
I I eat that just to, it
has some calories, some fat,

466
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,630
and then I go work out.
But I make note like I never do this,

467
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,180
but when I go to the trainer I go,

468
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:47,710
I got to tell you like I feel
white and I also am very tired.

469
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:52,660
I've been up since six and it's two
and I haven't stopped. So, like I said,

470
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:56,440
it's, it is eight hours that
I've been going. I'm like,

471
00:30:56,441 --> 00:31:01,150
I'm just really tired. I'm really tired.
So the trans like, you know, why don't we,

472
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,440
I've never asked for that. It was like,
why don't we like amend some things?

473
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,830
I knew something was up and I go and I,

474
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,870
and I hesitated to say something
cause I don't want to be like,

475
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,130
we take it easy on me today,

476
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,760
but you should look up,
what's the shame in the game?

477
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,900
It's just that normally how I do it.
So I just go,

478
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,160
I just go, I think I should. And she
was 100% was like, oh, we'll just, uh,

479
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,180
we'll do lower intensity. But you know,
so, you know, even through the workout,

480
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:32,320
like it was all right. I didn't
feel great, but I didn't feel sick.

481
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,180
I just didn't feel great and I thought
I was just really tired, which I also,

482
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,070
and you, you're probably were,
you know, low on electrolyte.
Yeah, exactly. I'm like,

483
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,690
when I go, I told her
I'm dehydrated. Didn't

484
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,120
eat right today. Yeah. And
I'm tired and I haven't,

485
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,920
I've been with my kid for eight hours.
Yeah.

486
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,580
So speaking of water, where's your, it's
right here. I'm actually drinking it.

487
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,960
I'm actually one who's been
drinking, so, oh, okay.

488
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,130
I get home and the night before I
had also, when I was at whole farts,

489
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,970
I bought a steak and I seasoned it and
I was like, oh, eat it after I work out.

490
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,540
Right.
So I get the grill ready.

491
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,230
At this point I'm actually hungry,
but you know,

492
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,890
you got to wait for your coals to turn.
So it's like kind, waiting more to eat,

493
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,120
which is like annoying me.
I finally throw that thing on.

494
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,000
Uh, like around, I don't know,

495
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:32,320
probably four 45 I'm eating by whatever,

496
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,900
let's say 5:00 AM meeting.
So,

497
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,300
um,
I eat about half of it and then I go,

498
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,140
okay, I don't want the other half. Um,

499
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,680
you felt full quickly. That's as,
that's another thing is that when you,

500
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,650
when you're sick, if you're
sick, you feel fuller,

501
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,390
your stomach's like create mucus
and shit or whatever it's doing.

502
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:03,080
It's telling you stop eating fatty,
you're about to get sick. I know.

503
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,170
So then the other thing is when I
started having to gestion but I'm like,

504
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:10,060
I don't feel like, you know, what
is it? What happened to Josh? Um,

505
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,900
and then I get to the point where,

506
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,550
so now it's like around seven or something
where I'm like, you know what? Uh,

507
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,800
cause I'm pretty much not just like
sugar free but starch and carbs.

508
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,740
Like I don't eat bread
or pasta or anything,

509
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,150
but I'm getting that feeling where
like I have to put some starch and me,

510
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,940
I'm going to feel when you're sick.
I know,

511
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,520
but I'm saying I don't know I'm there yet.
So I'm like,

512
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:35,890
that's what I'm trying to image it.
Diarrhea.

513
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,390
That wasn't enough for you to
know 20 hours earlier once. Right.

514
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,641
That's not a big deal.

515
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:44,600
I mean it's gone but usually one bout
of diarrhea and I'm like I have to have

516
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:48,050
toast and have to put some starch cause
it doesn't feel like that at the time.

517
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,440
It just feels good. It goes and
it's fine. So then now I'm like,

518
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,440
I got to eat something in my stomach
to feel normal. Right? So I make it,

519
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:01,400
I do make a toast. I put
some peanut butter on it, I
eat it. I don't feel great.

520
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,380
Afterwards I'm like, ah, fuck. I
still don't feel good. I keep burping.

521
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,400
I have all this ingestion, I
have a spot at the store. So,

522
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,800
uh, nanny looks at me and she goes, you
look really tired. And I go, thank you.

523
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,390
And when she does that, I go, I am, I
don't want to go do this show right now,

524
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,630
but I have to, you know, cause
I still am not like sick, sick.

525
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,930
I just don't feel up to it.
I go to the store,

526
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,490
it's really fun shows or show. There was
a really fun, great, great night out.

527
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:36,110
Great. But as soon as I'm done, like
I got to go home and I get home.

528
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,360
I still had been to Josh
and I have another toast.

529
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,350
I still don't feel good after
I eat it. Um, I go to bed,

530
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,390
I have all this weird stomach
feeling going to bed, not pain.

531
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,410
It's just like anxious, weird
feeling in my stomach, you know,

532
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,520
I can't explain it. It just doesn't,
it feels uneasy. Like it doesn't,

533
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,100
it's just don't feel relaxed.
I don't know what's going on.

534
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,030
I wake up a few times throughout
the night, no problems.

535
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,500
Like I don't go to the bathroom, I
just, I've just don't feel good. Yeah.

536
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,600
In the morning I wake up and like within
30 minutes the flood gates are open and

537
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:18,620
I'm just going and I'm with him alone
with a boy or a little worse and I'm like

538
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:20,540
trying to take care of them,
feed them,

539
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,340
play with them and or keep them
entertained and I'm going like two, three,

540
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:29,480
four, five times. That's when I realized
like, oh, I got like something in me now.

541
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,320
So I finally,
I text her because you're gone and I go,

542
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:35,060
is there any way you can come sooner?

543
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,710
Because I don't feel like
I can keep doing both.

544
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,200
And she gets back to me after
awhile. She's like, yeah,

545
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:45,090
I'll get there as soon as I
can. And then I just go, go.

546
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,540
I Dunno,

547
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,540
probably total of eight or nine times
in an hour and a half or something.

548
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,480
I'm so wiped after that that when she
gets to the house I sleep and this is like

549
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,450
mid to late morning, I sleep
four straight hours. Right.

550
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,890
Just completely passed out.

551
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,200
And then of course I
wake up like I feel dead.

552
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:12,201
I don't have any energy so I have some
toast after low while water and then

553
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,460
after a while after that, you know,
you start to kind of feel like, okay,

554
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:21,270
I'm getting better now.
I mean not to eat crazy or anything,

555
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,280
but like you start eating a cracker,

556
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:28,260
a little bite of banana or something
and then the scale changes.

557
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,660
I started to have like like a five

558
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,580
and then the next day I'm like,
oh,

559
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,390
I have low energy but
I guess I'm better now.

560
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,860
I eat something normal and
I'm like back to like six mm.

561
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,510
And like it takes another 24 hours to
feel like today I feel like I'm 85%

562
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,390
normal.
Yeah,

563
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,190
it takes three to four
days. Yeah, for Dare Roya.

564
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,330
But I got straight up Sushi food boys.

565
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,210
Now the good thing is you
didn't eat a lot of that.

566
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,950
Is it albacore that was fishy.
Smelly. Yeah, but that raw fish,

567
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:10,190
that shit will take invite eaten. If
I had four, if I was like, who cares?

568
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:12,530
And just eating the six,
you would be in the hospital.

569
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,950
Can I tell you to the
panic that you put into me,

570
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,690
you texted me Saturday morning as I'm
coming home from Bart Nicks and you go,

571
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,440
I have a stomach bug. And to
someone that has a phobia, Oh God,

572
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:29,030
I should've said food poisoning. And to
me who has a severe phobia of vomiting.

573
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:33,530
Yeah. My world starts to fucking spend.
I'm like, oh, what am I going to do?

574
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,200
Can I go to a hotel?
How do I not get near him?

575
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,150
I have to fortify myself like I
fucking lose my mind. I know. Oh,

576
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:45,650
I hate it so much when that,
that's the scare. So anyways,

577
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,480
thank God you didn't have a fucking
stomach flu. I be, I know. I swear.

578
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,590
We haven't had one knock on wood yet
with a boy. It's gonna. It's gonna.

579
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,400
It's happening. Right, right.
I'm just going to check
myself into the hotel. Sorry.

580
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,740
See you later. No, I understand.
I know. I know that. Um,

581
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,690
oh,
some backlash,

582
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,750
some feedback I should say over
last week's personality debate,

583
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,700
there wasn't even a debate. You know, I,
I have a feeling you, you coerced people.

584
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,590
I'm just saying, I know it didn't feel
genuine. You know, not at all. Hey,

585
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,710
Mommy's, I'm listening to the podcast.
You guys are talking about personalities.

586
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:27,680
How friendly or Kurt
people are at airports.

587
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,370
Toronto is known as the screw
face capitol of the world.

588
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,310
We're not openly aggressive to you,
but we never make small during

589
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,670
a caddy by now,
a huge west Indian festival.

590
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,760
We get a lot of people from New
York coming across the border.

591
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,370
I've talked to a few of them.
They all mentioned the same thing.

592
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:49,260
Toronto's as friendly as a brick to your
face. I had no idea about this. Agree.

593
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,010
I've had nothing but wonderful
experiences and trauma.

594
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,410
This is Anton from Toronto.
Okay.

595
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:58,170
So he's talking about just [inaudible]
personality, your personality, Twan,

596
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,460
uh, hey mommies, I'm a little
behind in the podcast. Um, blah,

597
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:08,230
blah, blah. I'm certainly something
about my butthole PSM team. Christina.

598
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,680
Finally for the better
personality. Yeah. No,

599
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:16,030
I was not paid that. I have some
student loan debt if you are offering.

600
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,330
Thanks Aubrey. I guess she wants you
to pay her for saying that. Okay.

601
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,710
Thank you Aubrey. Let's see. Uh, hey,

602
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,260
mommy's another one
here. Levy jeans. Mommy.

603
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,830
Tina is the water and personality
came through. Sure. Mommy,

604
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:34,210
Tom showboats but he's stronger but
she's stronger in both categories. Yeah,

605
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,540
I agree. Thank you. Oh,
here's one. Hey, Hitler's.

606
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,160
My wife and I were able to get glass main
Tina and Fart next last night, May 4th.

607
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:45,250
I have never seen Tommy bonds
live or met him in person,

608
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:50,140
but I still feel I am more than qualified
to put an end to the personality.

609
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,800
Cham water champ debate.
First off when gene was onstage,

610
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,260
if she wasn't saying something hilarious,

611
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:01,261
she had a bottle of water or lips and
she had throat opened fully like a Chubby

612
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,890
Asu sorority sister for a
maximum non Yorkie slippage.

613
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,390
After the show she ran to the front lobby
to show off her shiny personality to

614
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,620
all the adoring fans.

615
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,790
She took the time to show a
genuine interest in every person.

616
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,430
As I approached the
mother goddess herself,

617
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,570
I got a little nervous and the feeling
can only be described as how a young

618
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:26,230
preteen German boy probably felt
meeting Hitler for the first time.

619
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,500
But she immediately put my nerves to rest.

620
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,110
She was genuine in her.
Thanks for us coming to the show.

621
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,500
This email should put to rest all the
arguing over who the water champ and the

622
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:43,090
personality champ is.

623
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:48,091
I don't want to hear anything more on
these subjects as I have put them to bed.

624
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,700
That's Jeremy Zimmer, sir. Thank you
Jeremy. Zinzer. I, you know what?

625
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,710
Thank you. That's it. That's, that's the
debate. Yeah. It's really fun to do shows.

626
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,880
Um, and then there's always like one
drunk mommy when you walk out on stage.

627
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,310
He goes,
yeah.

628
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,010
And then the people who don't know that
stuff or like I'm experiencing a few

629
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:12,270
more than one just so you know.
It's, it's a bit of a thing. Yeah.

630
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,540
Tommy Bolin. Hey, what's up
brothers? Joe Rogan. Hey Dude,

631
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,310
I heard you're having some kind
of a contest with Christina.

632
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,330
I started having a competition to
see who has the best personality,

633
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,080
which was more easy when I
heard it because I didn't
even know she had a person.

634
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,670
I mean, she's a really funny
comedian and everything like that,

635
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:35,430
but like I barely even
know when she's talking.

636
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,960
You guys have a competition about this.

637
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,550
You got a way better personality
and you don't have a personality.

638
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,470
But my advice to you though
is to like humor her,

639
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,020
pretend that she has, but she's a
person. She's the mom of your kids,

640
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,300
right? Bam. Good point.
January brother, a whole,

641
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,290
well let's get together and
do some guys shit later.

642
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,190
So ridiculous. Anyways. Yeah,
you clearly influenced that.

643
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,930
No voicemail. That's kind of random that,
that Joe would just call it that. Yeah.

644
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,200
Kinda random. Oh, you think
so? Yeah. My favorite was,

645
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,750
Hey, Mary Lynn, right carb. Um, I mean,

646
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,440
I've been thinking about this a lot and
I just obviously Christina who was a

647
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:25,540
good friend of mine,
being a woman, you know,

648
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:30,190
we talk about a lot of stuff
together and very close to her.

649
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,560
So, you know, having said that,

650
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:38,950
it's clear that,
and well it's not clear,

651
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:41,600
but I also,
you know,

652
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:46,210
I've been around Tom a lot and because
I know Christina to Worldcom is just

653
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,010
personality wise.

654
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Like if I were to say
personalities overall,

655
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,880
um, I think for smaller, um hmm.

656
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,530
She's very up and down and calm,

657
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,670
parents abused and you're very even keel.

658
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,450
Everybody measured, measured.
You're very logical. Yup. Okay.

659
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:14,670
I know you're very cool headed. Yup.
And you're also really cool. Yup.

660
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,290
Cool. You're cool to be around.
So many you want a trader.

661
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,950
Um, so big fan, um,

662
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,140
does have a better personality,

663
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:30,480
but I'm just saying generally
like that I hang out with you

664
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,970
just not gonna hang out with you.
Do you hear that

665
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,070
personality? Okay, bye.

666
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,090
Wow. That's one of your
friends, Maryland, right?

667
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:40,830
It's like a very good friend of
mine. Very talented actress. Yeah.

668
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,030
Very talented comedian.
Yeah.

669
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,650
And you know someone who I've
always enjoyed being around. Huh?

670
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,260
Definitely a bigger fan of me.
I didn't even know you guys hung out.

671
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,710
When are you hanging? Talk to her
store. I saw her at the store. Yeah,

672
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,870
Thursday night. It's interesting
that, I mean, she came over. I'm like,

673
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,060
when we moved in here a few times,
but yeah. You know. Wow. Wow.

674
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:06,160
I'm just floored at the lever
level of trader ship here. Yeah.

675
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,120
We've got Sean on my BFF.
Maryland might be BFF. Crazy.

676
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:12,790
Joe Joe. Yeah. I mean that's,

677
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,520
that's preposterous that
he would try me on this.

678
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:19,390
You've spent a decent amount of time with
him. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. He does. He,

679
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,220
he doesn't even think you're alive.
Show me that real clear.

680
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,270
He did. Yeah. Gosh, I'm going to have to
ask him about this. Yeah. You'll see him.

681
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,040
Devastating. You should tell him how
well Millan, no, it's for Dell. I mean,

682
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:35,550
a lot of people are,
you know, I mean, yeah,

683
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:40,410
we're getting emails from whoever,
but whoever the mommies,

684
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,010
the fans of this show who listened
to us hours, hours, hours,

685
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:49,011
and unanimously after my shows in phonics
had lines of people telling me how

686
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:52,680
much better my personality was and
how much more water I drink. I Hitler.

687
00:44:52,681 --> 00:44:56,720
I used to masturbate to Christina
when she was on MTV. Thank you.

688
00:44:56,721 --> 00:45:01,130
This is hard to say. I feel like Tom's
personality can only prop is up so much.

689
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,700
You know what I'm saying? Beyond
the beautiful repaired cleft palate.

690
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:09,210
Christina make loans it on the podcast.

691
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:13,050
She has a lighter shade Brown. I feel
like we're seeing, I could stay on camera,

692
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:17,670
but maybe mute her and have this
personality w on the mic. Like Charro,

693
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:21,810
Fran Drescher, Phyllis Diller,
William Hickey. Just a suggestion.

694
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,380
I feel like that would take your podcast
to the next level. Thanks Jean. Jeff.

695
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,980
Thanks Jean. Singular.
That is so rude. Jeff.

696
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,760
I don't know this one.
I don't know if you're ready for this.

697
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,310
Maybe you brace yourself.
Just get comfortable because
this a celebrity one, two,

698
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:42,310
no, it's just like, it's just
people weighing in. People
call my dad. I already know

699
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,440
is my mommy.

700
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,290
I actually thought of it that my mom
back from the grave to disapprove of me

701
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,500
some more.
I get it.

702
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,503
You don't like

703
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,000
Sarah Burns?
I keep kind of overthinking it.

704
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:09,100
You know her 20 years. Yeah, calling
you. I'll tell you the truth.

705
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,550
I first thought was,

706
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,780
I'm going to say please don't
how Christine and I called,

707
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,790
but I would never want to have a secret
between you and me that didn't include

708
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:27,880
her.
I Love Christina.

709
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,250
I've known her for a really
long time and she's, yeah,

710
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,860
she's more than a friend to me,

711
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,220
but I feel kind of compelled to call
because I've been listening to the podcast

712
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,120
and
I just,

713
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,780
before I say anything,
I just want to say that Christina,

714
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:01,450
she's like, I don't know what is
just like if someone only child,

715
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,960
but
bigger than that to me,

716
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,180
she's so generous with me.
Um,

717
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,520
I don't even expect to get
for no reason at all. And

718
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:23,080
she's been there for some very
tough times for me and I'm very,

719
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:24,380
very good on,

720
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,550
I'm judgmental or nonjudgmental or
unjudging me and I feel like one of the

721
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:35,410
crazier people, she probably knows, but

722
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,770
she doesn't make me feel that way when
I'm talking to her. I'm a great person,

723
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,173
great friend.

724
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,680
I feel really bad saying because she's
always been so funny and so pretty.

725
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:54,240
She's like I say,
she's my best friend and

726
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,671
she just,
I mean,

727
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:01,020
she's the first person in my
life that I ever just went up to.

728
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,120
It's true.
It's true for a cigarette.

729
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:07,590
And,
uh,

730
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:12,590
we became friends and I was traveling a
total of to work there wasn't even cool.

731
00:48:13,861 --> 00:48:16,350
And I was just like,
I didn't even see,

732
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,450
I just saw this person's
going to be my friend.

733
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,390
So in, in college, she just walked out to
you? Yeah, that's how we met Sarah Burns.

734
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:25,920
I'm Shauna, who also
called in to this show, uh,

735
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,900
who you filled her head
with lies. Uh, yeah,

736
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:32,630
she walked up to us in San Francisco and
we just became friends. Literally just,

737
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,950
Hey, do you have a cigarette? And I,
we never meet people that way. Yeah.

738
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,440
And so you and you and Shauna
where together walking together,

739
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:39,550
we were walking to Pfm,

740
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:42,280
the name of the cafeteria back then
and we locked up but we see burns.

741
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:46,240
She's wearing a denim overalls. This is
like the Nice picture of her. Yeah, Dude.

742
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:51,110
That's exactly right. The day you met her
all she wore those overalls on and uh,

743
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,460
we, I saw her and I remember going,
oh, that chick's fucking cool.

744
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,430
Like she looked all crazy and cool like
we did because we were a goth, you know,

745
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:59,530
and I was like, this chick's
weird too. Let's go talk. Let's,

746
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:03,250
I want to talk to this weird chick. Yeah.
She came out to us. Hey, hi. What's up?

747
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:05,270
Do you have a cigarette?
And then that's it.

748
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,620
We walked in the cafeteria together and
the three of us were BFFs since then and

749
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:12,550
that was 1994 and that's
how long we've been friends.
Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

750
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,480
I wonder who she likes more.

751
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,990
She is my friend and she's like
my best friend and when she, she,

752
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,210
she found you.

753
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,270
I was so happy for her
and I just felt like

754
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,480
she's going to get it together

755
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,780
and she's going to be happy and Tom's
going to help because you come in,

756
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:43,560
you come into a room and it's just like
you're so funny and you're just like,

757
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,720
Christina is so funny.

758
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:49,470
You guys together or like I
can't keep up with you guys.

759
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,853
Is this the,

760
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,460
she's really suffering when
you're calm and you're so glad.

761
00:49:58,461 --> 00:50:03,290
I know you am so glad you Christina.
Yeah.

762
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,350
So you've got a better personality then.

763
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,770
I think we all know this.
We all know.

764
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:15,210
I don't want you guys to fight about it
because you guys are so good together.

765
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,400
How dare you,
Sarah,

766
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,600
and your child is so beautiful. Thank
you. And just petty shit has got to stop.

767
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,720
I'm sorry to, um, I love you guys and, oh,

768
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,620
just burns by the way,
trader.

769
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,730
I can't see us. Do not do that. Sarah,

770
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,730
is she out? She's done. She's dead to me.

771
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,360
Sarah Burns was in a big
little lies recently. Yeah.

772
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,230
She's like, I love you man. That's
her murder. Yeah, yeah. Yes.

773
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,040
Machine that went to, I
know she did that. Uh,

774
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,940
the second seat she does drug history.
You know how wet hot American summer. Yes.

775
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,550
Yes, yes. That's her. She's
just, that was the last thing.

776
00:51:02,551 --> 00:51:05,370
I don't know if it's out
yet though. Yeah. Wow. Well,

777
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:10,190
I mean I'm usually proud of such my, both
my accomplished friends, Mary Lynn. Uh,

778
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,700
and so yeah.
But not anymore.

779
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,740
I'm going to have to rethink those
friendships and Joe for that matter. Wow.

780
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,750
I like how it shows.
Like does she even have a personality?

781
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,220
I mean these are people just speaking
from the heart. Right. Clearly. I mean,

782
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,390
Sarah's, that was emotional.
It was excruciating.

783
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:31,320
It was hard for her to say the truth.
Yeah. The truth. Yeah, it was really,

784
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,850
how much did you pay my friends?

785
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,390
Nothing. Nothing. I just,
it's just, it hurts.

786
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,163
Oh,

787
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,630
there's a Midwest 11, Tina. Mommy,

788
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,470
you got the looks good on me though.
John and Kate hair.

789
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,770
Not so far from the road rules,
haircut. I had not that far.

790
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,890
There's just a little cool thing
on top there in the back. Cause I,

791
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:57,280
Alan gave me that cut back in the
day and it was the exact front,

792
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,980
but not that spike. Would you do that?
Harrigan are no road rules here. Yeah.

793
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,310
Now I'm not cute enough. What do
you mean you're not cute? I mean,

794
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:07,810
you gotta be 20 to have that
cute ass haircut. Really?
Not as a 40 year. My Mama,

795
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:11,590
you gotta be young and cute.
I remember that when that show blew up.

796
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,940
John and Kate, I'm talking
about, yes, not rural.

797
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,100
Definitely as somebody with little
interest in women's fashion.

798
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:23,070
Every time I saw her I'd be like,
the fuck is up. It's so bad. Yeah.

799
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,700
She really, she really trademark that
haircut. That is the Midwestern mom. Yeah.

800
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:32,910
And her outfits were just super
k Marty like super khaki shorts.

801
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:38,260
She had eight children. The hair
was inexcusable, inexcusable.

802
00:52:38,261 --> 00:52:42,130
Arable and also a haircut that's
like stay away from my vagina.

803
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,960
Stop fucking me. Patrick made this by.
Thank you. Very nice. Thank you Patrick.

804
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:51,100
Very nice.
That is a haircut that does repel penises.

805
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,880
The only reason you get that
is to be like, knock it off.

806
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,110
Somebody said this is overwhelming
evidence. God, you're not

807
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,230
mommy. That's not, oh, it's a old
ass picture. Yeah. And guess what?

808
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,630
There's only one person in
this group not wearing jeans.

809
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,340
Look at this. Denim,
denim, denim. This is 1990.

810
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,330
This is, you know, denim.

811
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,730
This is such a weird time.
Those late nineties were beautiful.

812
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:25,110
Women were really baggy pants. Such a
waste of eye candy. Thank you victor.

813
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,430
And Jonathan's opposed to this seat.
Photo evidence. Tina can't be in Maine.

814
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,390
She's the only one not wearing jeans.

815
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:38,080
I'm not wearing jeans under those
cargo pay. What are you really? Me?

816
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,110
I'm wearing denim underwear.
You ever thought about that?

817
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,890
Jesus even know what the fuck I
got. Wow. That's really something.

818
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,190
Can we talk about our,
uh,

819
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,820
our romantic shower this morning?
Yeah.

820
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,060
It was big progress from the Hobo or

821
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,250
the infamous Hobo shower. Uh, gosh,

822
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:03,520
that was over a year ago. No. Yeah, it was
a year ago. We lived in that old house,

823
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:07,050
another house, the Hobo
shower. You came in,

824
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,180
you started peeing and it smelled
like coffee, coffee, pot, a cough,

825
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:15,570
just pure coffee. And that's when the
dehydration thing started. Cause I'm like,

826
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:18,370
dude,
you even drink water because it's hours.

827
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,380
I have coffee and spread the cheeks
clean that burped blue snot rockets.

828
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:29,400
Yeah. Um, feel like I maybe
farted course she did.

829
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,960
And then I don't know if there
was burps him maybe sexy.

830
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,780
And you know what's funny is that
we haven't showered together since.

831
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,070
Yeah.
It's been a minute.

832
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,420
And this morning you were in the shower
before me and I thought why not try to

833
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:48,180
spice things up romantic,
you know,

834
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:52,650
Time Nannies here I get in the shower
with you and I start, you know,

835
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,040
grabbing your cheeks, playing
with you, whatever playfulness,

836
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,470
trying to make our nice
romantic married moment.

837
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,970
And you started blowing your nose.
Yeah.

838
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,930
This is like, I'm trying to
like, hey, let's be playful.

839
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,310
Maybe the sun was somewhere what I was,

840
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,750
I know you're still sick so I'm not going
to force anything here. I was playful.

841
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,760
But then you started to blow your nose
in the shower, your hand in the shower,

842
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,440
and then the part that's really special
with you is that your beard collects all

843
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:26,460
your boogers. So it's not like the
boogers end up on the shower floor.

844
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,380
They're all in your beard. It's
not okay. I rinsed it off him.

845
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:35,370
No you don't because you can't see the
bookers rinsing until it goes away.

846
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,720
I had to keep telling you there's
still boogers in your beard.

847
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:43,170
They still boogers in your beard and
then you kept renting and rents. I got,

848
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,210
I'm going to throw out,
get out of my fucking face.

849
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,700
I had to kick you out and
then you go and then you,

850
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,760
and then you made me wash your asshole
number. Oh we got it. That was Kinda neat.

851
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,790
So I watched her be whole,
like I do Ellis and your beans and stuff,

852
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:58,130
but then you,

853
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,210
I consider that super progress by the way.
For what?

854
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:08,211
For the ultimate goal of you playing
with my be whole because I got you.

855
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:09,570
Yeah.

856
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,150
Cause I got you to kind of run your
finger along it a little bit. You know.

857
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,060
Oh my God, you guys are so disgusting.
Ew. I head up the crack a little bit.

858
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:21,040
And you did it. Very cursory kind.
Of course. I'm not getting older.

859
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:25,540
Really get in there like I do for my son.
Yeah, but for you, there's so much hair.

860
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:30,310
I know that I couldn't find the behold
if I wanted because it's covered.

861
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:33,150
There's a real wall of
hair and you're cracked.

862
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,540
I need that bottle washer.
We have. Yeah. I'm kind of,

863
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:42,310
I'm kind of on board with the waxing
now because, yeah, right. Yeah.

864
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,130
I think it's too much hair.
Maybe make an appointment for me.

865
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:47,290
Will you as the president?
Sure.

866
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,810
From my 40th 41st birthday
for my birthday. My relax.

867
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:57,190
Your asshole. Yeah. It's bad Tom.
I know there's a lot of hair.

868
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,060
I know. I didn't realize until I put
my hand in there today. I was so happy.

869
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:05,840
I was like, dude, there's so, it's so
much here. But thanks again for, um,

870
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,920
blowing your nose in the shower.
That was really special.

871
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,540
I didn't fart and I didn't burp.
That's big progress. That's true.

872
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,110
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

873
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,750
But you'll notice it's been a
year since we showered together.

874
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,670
Think about next year, what's
going to happen a year?

875
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,670
One next year.
Oh Man.

876
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:35,130
One of the symptoms I had before
was discovered with crones disease.

877
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,640
Interesting. Well, let's just say

878
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,240
I knew something didn't feel right
down there on the crotch. Chile,

879
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:50,960
Crotchety Coctel Carter my area.
And uh,

880
00:57:50,961 --> 00:57:53,930
anyway, uh, in mid p mid stream,

881
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:59,000
I hear a very strange sound.
Okay. That emanated from my,

882
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,090
my penis.

883
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:03,990
Uh,
and the sound,

884
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:09,600
I the only way to describe this, let me
just demonstrate on paying. I'm paying,

885
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:12,580
I'm paying, I'm paying,
everything's fine. All the payer,

886
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:18,920
the fuck was that.

887
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:20,903
Yeah.

888
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,120
So I stopped paying for
a second, you know, uh,

889
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:27,530
okay.

890
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,170
I don't know what to do. I was like
almost afraid to start paying again,

891
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,460
but now I'm starting to burn, you know,
cause if you stop yourself men pee,

892
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,233
it's uncomfortable.

893
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,280
Imagine that. And he wasn't
even sure yet though, but yeah,

894
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,960
what's a deal and Homie,
you're here.

895
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,200
Okay.

896
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,240
So you start letting little droplets out.

897
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:52,160
Then I get up the confidence to lift
that stream flow again and starts to flow

898
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,200
again,
son.

899
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,413
I mean

900
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,430
I freaked out. Yeah. And uh,

901
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,340
because the sound sounded
like it sounded like a fart.

902
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,013
I sounded like a,

903
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,020
a fart
sound was coming from my penis.

904
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:17,780
That's

905
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:22,130
bananas. Never even heard of that.
Well, fart sounds out of vaginas.

906
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,470
That's different though because air
is getting pushed into there. Yeah.

907
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,290
How do you fart out of your penis?
Wow. It's Kinda normal for us,

908
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:33,490
so I can't really, right. But
you understand why that client,

909
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,230
how does the Air Get into Your pee hole?

910
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,590
But that's what we are exactly what
I'm saying. This, this is so strange.

911
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:44,850
Then I got up early the next morning
to do my morning pee and then the same

912
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:50,450
fucking thing happened that same.
I'm like,

913
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,110
God man,
I was guy.

914
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,480
So I had to tell someone because I would,
if it was a major medical problem,

915
00:59:58,481 --> 00:59:59,314
I dunno.

916
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:04,970
So I went into my mom's bedroom
and I tried to explain to her that,

917
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,960
uh, after Ip that there's a
sound that comes out of my deck.

918
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,641
And she asked like,

919
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:17,641
what kind of sounds and I'm live with
kind of what kind of sounds like a fart

920
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:18,903
ma.

921
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,630
Jeez, ask them, will
you ever date your mom?

922
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,140
And she said, well, is that normal?
I'm like, I said, I don't know.

923
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,270
I mean, I don't know. I don't know if
it's normal light. You mean the scars?

924
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:35,280
Farcical Penis. You ever hear of
anyone falling through the penis?

925
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,780
My is anyone. She's like, I don't know.
I don't have a penis. I have a vagina.

926
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:41,460
I don't, you know what? I forgot

927
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,533
vagina.

928
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:48,030
So she said, you know, you know,
maybe I'll, um, maybe I'll call Rick,

929
01:00:48,031 --> 01:00:49,350
you know,
a call Ricky's mom.

930
01:00:49,351 --> 01:00:52,550
I'll ask him if it happens to Rick
was one of my friends. I'm like, no,

931
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,850
don't tell anyone here. Of course, Santo
Scott, my brother, don't tell anybody.

932
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,250
This is some crazy shit.

933
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:05,310
By the way, as a kid, there's gotta be
nothing worse than confiding in a parent.

934
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:08,480
And they'll like, I'll go call this other
person to tell them all about it. Yeah,

935
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,050
that is the one.
I remember so many conversations.

936
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,410
Can you fucking not telling anybody this?

937
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:17,430
My Mother did that to me constantly to
the point where I stopped telling her

938
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:19,680
things, but that's what
happens. Yeah, of course.

939
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:25,080
So many secrets because she would
constantly backstab tell everybody,

940
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,480
tell my step Dad taught my dad shit
that I don't want people to know.

941
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,100
It's a really bad thing to do as a
parent. I know. It's really fucked up.

942
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,430
I was really annoyed by that is I
have a lot of empathy for this guy,

943
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:41,250
Scott Scott
boy's penis.

944
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,710
Your penis.
Is that a wrap?

945
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:55,040
What Bobby? No, nobody. Fuck.

946
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,860
Should it be farther your ass hole.

947
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,720
Next thing I know he comes
running into our room. Todd. Dude,

948
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,750
you're fighting through your Dick Christ.

949
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,830
This is my life.

950
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,310
Yeah, so it was Crohn's disease I guess,
but I still don't know how that happens.

951
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,530
Pre diagnosis. He was farting through
his deck, but how does that happen?

952
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,590
I have no clue.

953
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,750
Sounds Bananas.
The air has to find its way into what?

954
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:29,580
Your bladder, I don't know. That's,
I mean that pocket of air has to,

955
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,420
in our, there is air in your
bladder that needs to come out.

956
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,460
That's what I'm saying. Right. So either
the air gets in or out, I wouldn't know.

957
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,390
Ears not getting in your Dick Hole,

958
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,540
Ms. Dot. Happening. So air somehow
is seeping into his bladder.

959
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:47,580
Oof. Okay. Hey. Terrifying. That's, yeah.

960
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,620
Well thanks for playing that. Yeah,
no problem. Can we talk about,

961
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,310
oh, about, um, so for the,

962
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:04,260
we haven't had a clocks on
both of our bedside tables.

963
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:08,670
Now what happened was when we lived in
Redondo and you had the alarm clock on

964
01:03:08,671 --> 01:03:13,620
your side of the bed and I never had one
on mine because I didn't have an outlet

965
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,390
near my nightstand. And so I reasoned, my
reasoning was, well, there's no outlet,

966
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:22,980
I guess I can't have a clock on my
nightstand rather than getting a battery

967
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:25,650
powered one maybe. Uh, so stupid.

968
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,610
So for years I didn't have one on my
side because I couldn't figure out how,

969
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,310
and then we moved twice since Redondo

970
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:38,330
did in the last place. We also had
one charger for a phone on one side.

971
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:44,120
And then one day we had a breakthrough
moment where we said, you know what?

972
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:49,810
We could plug an extension cord and then
there could be a plug for you on the

973
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:52,430
other side, and we were like,
wow, this is a really big moment.

974
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:57,230
She'd extension cord idea was,
you know, there's no outlet there,

975
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:01,100
but we could put a power source there
through an extension cord. It was a big,

976
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:04,790
big breakthrough. It took months
and months to put this together

977
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,960
and then that was a thing
where we're like, oh yeah.

978
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:12,350
Just because that thing's not there
doesn't mean you can't figure out a way to

979
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:14,450
make it work.
This time

980
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,860
I am constantly asking
you what time it is.

981
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,620
You see me leaning over to see the clock.

982
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,630
I caught you at four in the morning.

983
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:26,960
You went to take a piss and then you
walked over to my side of the bed and

984
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:31,750
leaned over me to look at my clock and
that's when it occurred to me. This,

985
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,540
I woke up that morning and I go pour.
Tommy is walking to my side of the bank.

986
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:36,374
I go,

987
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,910
I know I'll buy him.
His own alarm clock.

988
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,450
And guess what?
I got it.

989
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:49,470
I can now tell the time on my side
the fuck is wrong with was take us.

990
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,660
And you've been without a side clock
for how long? I mean we're coming up on,

991
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,430
I mean in this home, what, five, six,

992
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:01,540
seven months or so.

993
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:06,541
And then in the last place and other
close to a year going on two years where I

994
01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:12,031
don't get to see the time at night
when you want to know is it midnight,

995
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,590
is it three six?

996
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,080
Right.
And

997
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,810
then before that I lived that
way in Redondo every night.

998
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:27,970
And I wear a watch. But
during the day, at night,

999
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,840
I remember him in Redondo beach going,

1000
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:35,530
why don't we put a clock on the wall
so we can both see it from the bed?

1001
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,060
And then like that,
that theory,

1002
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:40,850
just like what is wrong
with us that we both die.

1003
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,080
It doesn't encourage you just for, you
know, a few bucks. You can buy a fucking,

1004
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:48,190
you don't have the figure it out.
We have deal with it.

1005
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:53,110
You deal with what you got.
There's a workaround for that.

1006
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,910
God Damn it.
How does it feel though?

1007
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:58,300
Like last night was your first night
being able to tell time whenever you want.

1008
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:03,670
Is that crazy? It was really cool. Like
I knew what time I was going to bed,

1009
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:09,510
going to bed now and then you woke
up in the morning and I go, Tom,

1010
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,880
what time is it? We're trying to go
six 20 yup. I knew it was awesome.

1011
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:15,050
Felt empowering.
Oh,

1012
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:18,770
hello and welcome to how to
create a perceptual map using x.

1013
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:21,720
So my name is [inaudible] is the worst,

1014
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:25,390
worst hate excel as an alternative.

1015
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,493
By the way,

1016
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,950
there's nobody more arrogant than
someone that's mastered excel.

1017
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:36,610
They talk about it like, Oh, you
don't know how to make toast.

1018
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,070
You just fucking put the bread
and he pressed the button.

1019
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:43,420
Excel is so hard and
they already showed you.

1020
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:44,800
Once God,

1021
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:49,801
you highlight in his control l seven
you had to highlight the column and then

1022
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:55,120
it's the sum of all these things
you can make in minutes and that's

1023
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:59,800
available@sexualmaps.com.
The first thing you need

1024
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,360
to flashback made a list of brands,

1025
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:10,150
at least two attributes.
The attributes schooled fuck off.

1026
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,980
And if you want to,
this is optional.

1027
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,460
Well it's definitely boring,

1028
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:21,190
but you think they would have created
a program more intuitive than excel

1029
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,770
because excel is so counter intuitive.

1030
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,400
You have to take a fucking
class to learn how to do it.

1031
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:32,050
So how is that a useful program?
It's so hard. It's very hard. God,

1032
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:35,530
I almost fucking flunked
that class every time.

1033
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:39,340
I mean of when did they start teaching us?
Um,

1034
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:43,120
do you remember that when
they started teaching us, uh,

1035
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,920
Xcel things,

1036
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:50,320
I was in college and I had to learn it
from my statistics class and my friend

1037
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:51,730
Bronwyn was good at it.

1038
01:07:51,731 --> 01:07:56,620
So I paid her in beer to do my homework
because I could not figure out excel.

1039
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,770
By the way. Did you see this? That, uh,

1040
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:05,130
Steven Seagal and band of course
people have been sending this to me,

1041
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,510
not to stop.

1042
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:13,150
The last time I asked the CIA to
provide me with people in answers,

1043
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:16,760
they gave me people in
answers that my questions

1044
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,130
the way they wanted it to be answered.
Me,

1045
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:24,370
the Ukraine has banned Steven Seagal
as a national security threat,

1046
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,700
making him the latest of several
cultural figures to be blacklisted.

1047
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,400
The Ukrainians Security Service said
it had for bidden Seagal entry to the

1048
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:39,250
country for five years.
Wow.

1049
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,440
And a letter published by the new site
apostrophe the services press secretary

1050
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:49,870
later confirmed the band to other media
letter said such as made when a person

1051
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:57,671
has committed socially dangerous
actions that contradict the interest of

1052
01:08:57,921 --> 01:09:00,380
maintaining Ukraine's security.

1053
01:09:00,381 --> 01:09:03,800
The move comes after the
accuracies citizenship and Russia,

1054
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:09,080
which has backed separatists in a
simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine.

1055
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,560
President Putin handed Seagal a Russian
passport and told him that he hoped

1056
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,840
their personal relationship will remain
and continue during a meeting in the

1057
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:23,870
Kremlin last year.

1058
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,420
So there you have it,

1059
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,960
Mr Steven Seagal is no longer
welcome in the Ukraine.

1060
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,530
That's a pretty big,

1061
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,190
and I am the king of in province for free.

1062
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,270
I do forgive you. Good for the Ukraine.
Yeah. Good thinking. Oh, why did,

1063
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:48,700
why does he need Russian citizenship?
I mean, well, he's a Russian, um,

1064
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,380
ethnic origins. Yeah. I had no idea.
Well then that makes sense. Yeah.

1065
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:55,660
But it's also because I
think it's a big part,

1066
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:59,620
the big part of it is that in
certain parts of the world,

1067
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:04,180
he still feels like it's 1992. Yes,
baby. Yeah. I know. Eastern Europe,

1068
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:07,590
they still like, fuck man, you
kick a lot people's house. Yeah.

1069
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:12,140
I still get excited by him.
Um,

1070
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,180
want to see this woman
speaking of [inaudible].

1071
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:19,040
Oh my guy yet listen to this woman.
Oh Wow.

1072
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,130
That's a woman during out karate exhibit,

1073
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,513
feeling it,

1074
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,600
feeling that shit.

1075
01:10:59,030 --> 01:10:59,863
This is awesome.

1076
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:04,370
She's great. I hope she won.
She deserves it for that level.

1077
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,460
Why are you screaming like that?
It's not necessary.

1078
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:15,420
It doesn't, it's weird. They don't
tell you to scream like that.

1079
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,551
And usually the,
you know,

1080
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:21,551
the funny thing is her screams don't align
with the point of impact was to go to

1081
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,400
the, it's like as punchy
as you, as you move.

1082
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:29,570
She's like screaming right
before she moves. Very peculiar.

1083
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,260
Timing's off.
It's crazy.

1084
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,410
[inaudible]

1085
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,013
okay.

1086
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,470
All Right Sarah,

1087
01:11:56,710 --> 01:12:00,480
this really looks like some bullshit.
Most of these moves.

1088
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,430
All Right Sarah, like that doesn't look
like that could kick anybody's ass,

1089
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:16,100
but she, I don't know. I agree.
Cause it's like fucking dancing.

1090
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,510
I remember when I took Kung Fu and
then they'd teach you like the dragons,

1091
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,430
whatever movements,
you know,

1092
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:27,960
it's really just to say a dance movie.
Five people like that.

1093
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,651
They just showed,

1094
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:33,651
I saw a video of like a traditionally
trained MMA guy against some Kung Fu

1095
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:38,250
master. Oh, you don't
want to see it? Oh my God.

1096
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:43,590
The MMA guy just pummeled him and
it was like really bad. It wasn't,

1097
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,520
it wasn't cool for guy was like,
you know,

1098
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,390
trying to deflect some of it
and the guy just beat him.

1099
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,490
Like they had to pull
them off and they're like,

1100
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:58,140
this guy's gonna die if you don't stop
doing this. He was a Kung Fu master,

1101
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,730
you know, no match for MMA,
which is what I'm saying that,

1102
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,760
well that's the guy obviously
got involved because he's like,

1103
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:12,240
this makes sense. Let's see how
these two schools of fight, you know,

1104
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,260
do against each other. It was
bananas. I mean the guy just,

1105
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,880
he punched through the guy's ridiculous
deflections and just fucking beat him,

1106
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,670
beat him, beat him on the ground and just
kept pummeling him and it's like, um,

1107
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:30,930
okay. I think we know, which is
the better. All right, thank you.

1108
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,610
You know, you far through your
asshole, you know what I mean? Yeah.

1109
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,630
That's the whole point I think.
Yeah. A Dad boner fishing,

1110
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,390
what's going to happen to that classic
gets 10 pounds. I just made up my,

1111
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,890
I just made up my deference

1112
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:01,050
at the windows 10 pounds.

1113
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:05,630
I just made up the difference
Mark Zola.

1114
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:17,610
Okay, okay. Yeah. That's
a deadbolt or, yeah.

1115
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:21,630
But again, I feel like, you know,
it makes sense why he's excited.

1116
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,740
He was obviously behind, like he was
like this is making, in other words,

1117
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:28,500
he probably caught something earlier.
It wasn't as big.

1118
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,820
He won whatever competition
he's in. Yeah. So you know,

1119
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:36,360
I celebrate his Dad Boehner ranch with
them too. I like those sporty glasses.

1120
01:14:36,361 --> 01:14:39,780
Those are always a real dad
fashion move and sexy. Right.

1121
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,880
Definitely the multicolored shiny,
the rope. Oakley only with the rope.

1122
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:47,790
Yeah. You gotta have the rope. How's
the fishing? You got to have the rope.

1123
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:51,330
That's what, that's why you wear them,
you know, cause you're fishing. Yeah.

1124
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:54,480
Because they could fall off. That's
right. That's the road I'm saying.

1125
01:14:54,481 --> 01:14:58,080
I like the dads who were at just
like walking around near port.

1126
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:00,450
That's what I'm saying.
It's awesome cause he doesn't want,

1127
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:04,810
dad doesn't want to lose it. But on
the boat it makes the most sense. Yeah.

1128
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,560
But it's cooler when you carry
it off the boat. Certainly.

1129
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:12,750
I also like the dads who put the
glasses in front of like on their chest.

1130
01:15:12,751 --> 01:15:15,480
Like you were him backwards.
You let him hang on. I'm sorry.

1131
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:20,460
You let them hang backwards on your back.
So the back shirt. Yeah. Yeah. Like you,

1132
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:24,120
they talk them into the back. You
can see that. Yeah. That's Kinda,

1133
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:26,310
I wasn't even thinking or if
you want to go to the Guy Fieri,

1134
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,850
that's what I put them on the back
of your head. That's what I'm saying.

1135
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:33,050
Glasses facing backwards guy
kind of patented that move. Yeah.

1136
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,130
Really sexy look.
Yeah.

1137
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,580
Yeah. The real dad reaction right there.
Seriously. Um, let's see here. Seriously,

1138
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,880
seriously. Uh, let's see.
Guy Fieri, you know what?

1139
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:51,360
A douche bags on glasses. So
that's kind of what, like,

1140
01:15:51,361 --> 01:15:54,900
I don't have anything against
Guy Fieri personally, of course,

1141
01:15:54,901 --> 01:15:59,150
but as an aesthetic, it's a really douche
bag here. It is authentic, right? Yeah.

1142
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:03,930
Yeah. Isn't it? So see how it
puts them on. That's crazy.

1143
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:08,640
The back of this. Yeah. It's like, he's
like the poster boy for a douchebag.

1144
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,330
Just aesthetically. I mean, again,
I don't know him as a person,

1145
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,790
but the whole vibe is like, I'm
a fucking, I know it's weird,

1146
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,330
right? That he embraces the Douche
bag. Look, I think, you know,

1147
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:24,300
that's just who he is. Right? And
I, and also, here's the weird thing,

1148
01:16:24,301 --> 01:16:28,560
when you want to talk about this, this
whole thing has really worked for him.

1149
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,350
Yeah. No, he's, he's
really successful. I mean,

1150
01:16:31,351 --> 01:16:35,640
that's why I'm not shitting on the
guy, but as the look, the look is like,

1151
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:39,780
and I think, I don't know if
this is true or not, but I heard,

1152
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:44,850
please tell me this is true.
He has a car collection,

1153
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,890
um,
where they're all like the same color.

1154
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,830
Are they all fire like fire print?
I'm sure he likes flames.

1155
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,840
All yellow bright. Yeah. It's like,

1156
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:03,570
it's a real attention seeking color.
Yeah. He needs a lot of attention. Yeah.

1157
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,320
So here you see like an old
corvette. Yeah. More recent corvette.

1158
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:11,390
There's the flames, like I
said, yeah, there's the flames
on everything. Wrangler,

1159
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,970
there's a Camaro back there,
a big pickup. What is this?

1160
01:17:14,971 --> 01:17:16,830
Here are some dodge maybe.

1161
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:20,910
Yeah.
Fire Ozek look at his car collection.

1162
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,870
I can't believe he makes that much money
on that show. It's amazing, isn't it?

1163
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:28,740
Yeah. Oh good for him. I mean, that's
great. That's great. But man, it,

1164
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:32,700
it's totally him to have them all
in yellow. Yeah, it's a douchebag.

1165
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,560
I'm definitely really

1166
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,573
weird men.

1167
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:41,660
Really bizarre that he would have
that many fucking yellow cars.

1168
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:47,980
You think that like one yellow would
kind of be part of it would be your

1169
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,260
collection,
right?

1170
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,960
You'd be like, I got one yellow.
Great. You want to, I mean, I,

1171
01:17:51,961 --> 01:17:55,330
you think you'd want to vary it
justice to be like, I've got a,

1172
01:17:55,930 --> 01:18:00,280
a red corvette. I've got the Yellow
Hummer. I've got whatever. Dammit.

1173
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,970
What a fucking check. Yeah. We should
tell him how to collect his cars.

1174
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,070
We should tell them it's up to us.

1175
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:11,380
I want you to start reaching out to
guy and can you please play the flight

1176
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:16,360
attendant? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So you
sent me this, uh, audio file. This is,

1177
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:18,610
um, well, why don't you set it up?

1178
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,440
While I was flying back home from Bart
next and I noticed that the woman doing

1179
01:18:23,441 --> 01:18:28,300
the rules, the FDA, whatever has
the FDA food, Drug Administration,

1180
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,410
Faa, I'm reading the rules, safety stuff.

1181
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,060
She was really mushy mouth and marveled
and she wasn't pronouncing the words

1182
01:18:37,061 --> 01:18:38,140
they all jumbled together.

1183
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:41,950
So I recorded her and at first
like really weird sounds normal.

1184
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:45,070
But then as you start
listening you're like, oh yeah,

1185
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,440
like she's just kind of like right.

1186
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,950
Oh for us is and then with their mouse
to use the mouse Cutler customer advisors

1187
01:18:50,951 --> 01:18:53,020
here that supplemental
oxygen is no longer needed.

1188
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,120
A Volvo, Volvo, Volvo

1189
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,321
sausage of gender.

1190
01:18:58,321 --> 01:19:01,040
The laboratories are held in a plastic
retainer clip to use the mouse,

1191
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:03,890
take the of the mouse out of its plastic
retainer clip and breathe normally.

1192
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,980
What was the burden Laurel?
Yeah,

1193
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,560
we have meant to him a water line in
your seat on a Christian is be careful.

1194
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:12,490
It is learning as a
flotation device to use it,

1195
01:19:12,491 --> 01:19:15,100
pull it up and take it right to the
nearest usable exit when exiting the

1196
01:19:15,101 --> 01:19:17,310
aircraft, your arms to
the shops. I get to yet

1197
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:21,390
tell you what's going on here. This
is my theory. This vicious sick. Yeah,

1198
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,740
reading that thing.
Yes.

1199
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:26,970
And she also knows by law
she has to read it. Yeah.

1200
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,620
So her feeling is,

1201
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:32,940
let me just get through this thing as
fast as possible because she's not a slow,

1202
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:37,560
she's, what she is doing is she's reading
it really fast. Yeah. She's not stopping.

1203
01:19:37,561 --> 01:19:39,690
We're sentences and commas over it.

1204
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:43,680
She's just like [inaudible] and
so she's running through it,

1205
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:47,250
but also this other role is full time.

1206
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:51,480
You know what happens is like if she
doesn't even pronounce some syllables,

1207
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:54,240
she still gets through it faster. Oh
yeah. First thing is like finished

1208
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,673
fucking thing

1209
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,080
and felt life Vassar located in a former
cabinet in the event of a water line

1210
01:20:01,081 --> 01:20:05,490
and your fight isn't over in the
adult. No pause. Permission Card.

1211
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:11,580
New parents exercise for this aircraft
they made north or to enter in our

1212
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:15,790
service are directly across from us for
additional emergency exits are located

1213
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:19,930
over the wings. Mid Cabin to any side. X
designs are already identify these axes,

1214
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:26,310
nihilism Rosie escape mouth finding or
if we were to those lights to the nearest

1215
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:29,800
exit, keeping them on an exit.
Maybe looking at blogs by the way,

1216
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,520
definitely has some Vogel from Megan and
I have been together for nearly three

1217
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:42,240
years. I will say sense. What's a
blocker done? Instructions for about,

1218
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:43,074
about your crew.

1219
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:46,650
Regulations prevent you from tampering
with disabling or destroying the smoke

1220
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:50,060
detectors for two laboratories. There's
no urban of boats, American loud.

1221
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,740
Because what happens is some
of them can understand her.

1222
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:56,160
I think some of them it's their
time to shine. In other words,

1223
01:20:56,170 --> 01:21:01,170
the performers and they say exits
are located in above the wings,

1224
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,200
right and rear and the
front of the aircraft.

1225
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,450
Take a moment now to look around and
locate the nearest exit. And they,

1226
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:14,050
they, they read it like they're,
they're reading southwest.

1227
01:21:14,051 --> 01:21:17,350
We used to do the jokes like in
the event of a crash landing,

1228
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:21,880
of course there won't be one
like that. That dumb shit.

1229
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:26,470
I fucking hate the joke reading due to,
I don't need to be entertained,

1230
01:21:26,471 --> 01:21:29,620
but I do need you to
enunciate a little bit.

1231
01:21:29,621 --> 01:21:34,170
I mean that was just marbled
mess next to me going

1232
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,790
to good one. Really, really
fun to really ham it up.

1233
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:43,360
I guess they stopped doing that.
Uh, used to be a lot fun. You know,

1234
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:47,050
they still do it.
They laugh and then a number,

1235
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:51,400
they throw the peanuts down the aisle on.
The plane is on an incline on and I'm,

1236
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:53,950
they go turn off your cell phones,

1237
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,170
your blackberries or
blueberries or strawberries.

1238
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,073
That's a sound.

1239
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,830
You hear people like that really,
really

1240
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:06,950
laughing it up. That blueberry job
that, that left with the black dice.

1241
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:11,720
Whenever you're a comedian and you, you
have moments of self doubt, you're like,

1242
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:14,920
am I funny? Am I, is it
worth what I'm doing? Yeah.

1243
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,080
Go on one of those southwest flights.

1244
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:22,450
Watch people laugh at those stupid fucking
instructions at the flight attendant

1245
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:26,370
does and then you'll walk away like I'm
one of the funniest fucking people world.

1246
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:27,930
Yeah,
right.

1247
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:32,720
That'll give you all the confidence you
need to have somebody do a fucking a

1248
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,320
seat belt joke about,
make sure if you don't know,

1249
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:38,320
I can come over and I'll click it
on four and you just pull like this.

1250
01:22:38,321 --> 01:22:41,010
You don't click it over your head.
I can over your waist.

1251
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:43,910
Can you hear people

1252
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,960
like that on the plane? You're
like, you know what? Yeah,

1253
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:52,880
I'm funnier than this compared to this
dummy. I have to interrupt real quick.

1254
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:57,380
A call just came in,
don't know what it says,

1255
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:02,390
but I feel like it's worth, I think
you're a liar. No, I'm serious.

1256
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:04,040
I don't know what this is.
I think I know what it is.

1257
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,640
It,
it's burned again.

1258
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:13,290
It's some kind of eating me up since
I left you that message last week. I,

1259
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:19,840
um, you know, I've been thinking
about it and honestly I don't,

1260
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,510
I haven't known you as long as Christina,
so

1261
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:28,090
I haven't known her you as long as her.

1262
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,720
So like I'm just thinking
about it and I'm like, well,

1263
01:23:31,721 --> 01:23:34,510
I've known you for a couple of years
and you've been very charming. And

1264
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:38,920
I think I love the time and you know,
I'm,

1265
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:44,110
there's nobody in a world that's better
suited for each other than you and

1266
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:48,940
Christina and you know,
I'm not knocking your personality,

1267
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:52,510
but I was like, wait a second. It's
like the law of averages, you know,

1268
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:57,010
a known her for a million years and she's
been consistently amazing and awesome

1269
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,170
and she's been such a good friend to me.

1270
01:23:59,171 --> 01:24:02,740
I can't call you up on the
phone and tell you that

1271
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,200
you guys better personality
because Christina, she's like,

1272
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:13,320
she's so quick and she's so generous
and she's so bright and silly.

1273
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:18,670
And then sometimes she says something
like, Hey, my brain was like that.

1274
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,540
So I'm calling because,
well,

1275
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,650
I don't even like being this to this
and the honestly, because I feel like,

1276
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,510
you know,
like very difficult.

1277
01:24:28,511 --> 01:24:32,080
It's been very emotional and
must a message in my first
thought was like, shit,

1278
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:35,860
I should have just kept my
mouth shut. And then so, okay,

1279
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:40,950
so I'm calling because I want
to change changed eight. You,

1280
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,260
Christina has the better personality.
That's that.

1281
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:50,610
I don't know actually. No, I think,

1282
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:53,850
I think,
I don't know.

1283
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:59,740
This is so difficult.
No,

1284
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:04,290
it's Christina. No, let's do, I dunno.

1285
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,190
Um,
you better him.

1286
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:21,140
She did have some doubt though.
That's got to feel good.

1287
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:25,300
Does she felt a little bit of doubt about
what are you paying my friends not pay

1288
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:28,520
him anything. Don't even know
Mary Lynn, especially Mary Lynn.

1289
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:34,280
She heard about it and when I started the
store she goes, oh, uh, heard about the,

1290
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:38,720
the personality salmon ship. She was your
hands down. She did. And she did. She did.

1291
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:42,820
I'm going to have to do my research.
She's 100% said that whatever.

1292
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:47,510
I'm going to have to call these
friends. Yup. That top dog laugh.

1293
01:25:47,511 --> 01:25:50,250
I love so much. His blonde joke labs. Yup.

1294
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:53,600
Does that bum you out that your dad thinks
that stuff so funny and you're like,

1295
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:57,560
you're like the best working
comic out there. And he's like,

1296
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,480
I love those blind joke buddy

1297
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,140
is like the best. Do you know the
world? But I of course you are.

1298
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,430
But he, um, I of course, God, I
had this conversation with people.

1299
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,510
Well,
I mean we've talked about it,

1300
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:15,650
but I talked to other people all the time
about how I met with this great writer

1301
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:20,030
last week and he was
telling me how he wrote it.

1302
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,370
I don't want to divulge all these things,

1303
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:27,371
but basically he wrote an amazing episode
of television that is really highly,

1304
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:32,420
you know, celebrated and it's
really smart and really funny.

1305
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:37,220
And His dad was like,
I didn't know what you're doing.

1306
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:41,870
And His dad, his dad's a
successful smart guy, but field.

1307
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:46,790
But then his dad told him about the bore
at scene where he brings the poop down

1308
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:47,770
the stairs. He goes, now, that's right.

1309
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:51,570
Right.
And he's like,

1310
01:26:51,571 --> 01:26:56,520
you don't think that this
like Emmy nominated thing I
wrote? No. It was like, no,

1311
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:58,860
but see that's why you're
in comedy. Yeah, of course.

1312
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:01,710
If your parents approved
of you, yeah, you'd have,

1313
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,670
there'd be nothing compelling you to
tell jokes to strangers and get that.

1314
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:07,500
Of course,
you got to get it somewhere.

1315
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:12,600
You got to get it an eight
from your folks. I know, I
know. Man. It crazy. You know.

1316
01:27:12,601 --> 01:27:16,940
Could you imagine who you would be if
your mom and dad approved of you? You,

1317
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,550
we certainly wouldn't have this
show. No. Why would you do it?

1318
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,360
There'd be no reason.
Yeah.

1319
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:27,780
To cultivate a personality to go out there
for 15 years after week in the clubs.

1320
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,260
I know amongst my dad.

1321
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:36,850
Yeah. So I can shape something and
I'm not talking about a blonde joke,

1322
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:41,680
I'm saying within my wheelhouse. I know
what kind of thing would make him laugh,

1323
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:45,400
but every once in a while I'll lob out a,

1324
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:50,050
I genuinely think this is funny.
Let me see if you do think it's funny.

1325
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,060
I thought never. No silence.
Total silence. Yeah.

1326
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:59,100
And then like, I'll be like, do you, he
goes away. I have never mind. I'll like,

1327
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,860
I'll read them. I'll say,
I said this about this,

1328
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:09,310
right? Yeah, I will. Because
you're like, oh yeah, so,

1329
01:28:09,311 --> 01:28:13,510
uh, I was talking to your mother and he'll
just, I'm like, wow. I get bombs so hard.

1330
01:28:13,511 --> 01:28:16,630
He's still, it just doesn't, it's
not, it's never going to be the thing.

1331
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:17,800
It's never going to be it.
Well,

1332
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,360
you know what?
Thank God for it.

1333
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:25,120
Otherwise we wouldn't have the life
we have today. Of course. Thank God.

1334
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:28,150
Our plane. I got on a proof. I've
got a big thing this weekend.

1335

bad bike. Got a bad bite this weekend.

1336
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:37,150

think. Oregon, Oregon, Oregon, Oregon.

1337
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,230

I know the early show in Portland
is this sold out at revolution hall.

1343
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,010
There's still tickets
left to the late show,

1344
01:29:00,011 --> 01:29:04,500
which I think is at 10 30 revolution
hall Saturday night. Uh, Eugene,

1345
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,160
Oregon.

I'm there Friday night and there are
still tickets left to the late show.

Then optimum Straya and of course a
live podcast with my blue Jean on,

1365
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:40,140

1366
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,160
I don't know. August
23rd. In addition to that,

1367
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:49,310
we have added two more alive podcasts
in Irvine on separate months from vine

1368
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,230
burned by separate months.
Here's why.

1369
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,870
A tough to make it go all the time.

1370
01:30:57,871 --> 01:31:00,480
So we just added them a few months apart.

1371
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:05,430
We're doing one July
9th that's on sale now.

1372
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:10,470
And another one, we're doing it
a click on this here. October,

1373
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,090
October eight which is obviously
a long way away, but we've,

1374
01:31:14,091 --> 01:31:15,120
we've added them already.

1375
01:31:15,121 --> 01:31:20,121
So July 9th and October 8th there's
7:00 PM shows at the Irvine Improv.

1376
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:22,830
We're going to do a live podcast.

1377
01:31:22,831 --> 01:31:26,940
I'm hiring sound engineers
to come record know.

1378
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:28,920

1379
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:31,860
why don't we have a clock next to our bed?
We should be hiring.

1380
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:36,570

So those will be,

1381
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,460
they'll sound a lot
different than the last time,

1382
01:31:38,461 --> 01:31:42,010
but also there'll be a lot of
fun to come to the live show. Um,

01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:30,220
purples.
I love how he says mushy

1396
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:35,210
purple proposal. Hunches. The PR.
Yeah, it's a good mushy purples.

1397
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,440
Um, money. This has been in
my, the thing here for a while.

1398
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:44,060
It says a weird MMA interview.
I'm not sure what's going on.

1399
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:48,200
I don't know the details,
but we can watch whatever this is.

1400
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,560
Let's see. Does Dean, the president,

1401
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:55,280
fat TV and we're here at Jagan
House and I'm here with Matt Major.

1402
01:32:56,150 --> 01:33:00,620
Okay. Matt looks maybe like you
should be 51 50 or something.

1403
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:03,010
Right. And also your opponent. Non Binary.

1404
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:07,070
Uh, I prefer not to know
anything about my opponent. Okay.

1405
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:10,190
I guess that's what motivates
you in the [inaudible].

1406
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,750
Let me tell you what motivates me.

1407
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:16,610
What motivates me is staying in the dark
tunnel. Okay. I stay in a dark tunnel.

1408
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,850
Cause when you were in the darkness,
you can't see shit anyway.

1409
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:25,520
What fucking difference does it
make to know who this man is?

1410
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:29,720
Right. I get it. Is
that eye shadow? It is.

1411
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:33,730
That's why I was thinking it might be
a Zimmer [inaudible] situation. So, um,

1412
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,580
that if, uh, I don't know what your
opponent's going to expect from you.

1413
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:41,570
I don't know what to expect from you.
Uh, but what, what school do you find it?

1414
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,860
Format? I find the dark tunnel. Hey,

1415
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:49,170
starts on. No Man. That's kind
of scary. Yeah, that's right.

1416
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:50,280
That's a good analysis.

1417
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:51,420
Yeah.
So

1418
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:58,950
this kinds of stuff in the dark little,
do you know what to do? You know what?

1419
01:33:58,951 --> 01:34:00,060
The beavers and the holes are

1420
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:06,060
zoinks this guy was reportive
of committing a horrific crime.

1421
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,990
It would not be that surprising,
right? Yup. Yeah. Yup.

1422
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:15,910
If you were a snake and you were in a
tunnel on the hole and a big fat beaver

1423
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:17,650
came in,
there were two books,

1424
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:21,150
sharp teeth were there
with just flew through yas.

1425
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:26,020
You think you're going to make it
out of here? I don't think so. Matt.

1426
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,180
I'm the beaver in a hole.

1427
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:32,270
Oh dear. Yeah. It's a chemical imbalance.

1428
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,710
See how much funnier though Kevin Weeks
is talking about taking a nap. Yeah.

1429
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:40,460
It's different. Yeah.
Cause this is not, see,

1430
01:34:40,461 --> 01:34:44,150
he's not aware of his world. Right. You
gotta stay grounded for it to be funny.

1431
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,190
It's true. He need to have one
foot in the door of reality.

1432
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:50,930
So how do you see this fight ending?
It's not that I see an ending.

1433
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:56,540
I don't ever want it to
end. Oh, for it to begin.

1434
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,800
Oh, you're, this guy is smiling
and you're fucking terrified.

1435
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,420
I don't know nothing about
this guy either right now.

1436
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:07,310
So it's kind of a scary thing.
So, uh, yeah, my prediction.

1437
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:12,620
Other deer grass. Don't ask any more
questions. The rapture. Oh, Christ. Okay.

1438
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,050
I predict that the vampire aliens going
to get in the middle of this whole thing

1439
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,020
going to be like, we don't
want the priority is on, on.

1440
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:22,630
Okay.
Wow.

1441
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:29,230
I am the reason for it all the
reason why silver side his ass down.

1442
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:31,690
He doesn't want to burn in hell.

1443
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:36,310
He's either acting like humble your
ass mother fucker. Any last words?

1444
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,290
Thank you so much for me. This
opportunity. That's hilarious.

1445
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,760
A lot of people don't want
to give me an opportunity man

1446
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:48,140
fucking free.
I don't know why

1447
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,220
I'm a bit scared of myself,
man.

1448
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:57,940
That's hilarious. Yeah. So Matt,
Major Bella, Taller fighter, uh,

1449
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,200
reputation and one of
the strangest men see,

1450
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:03,240
can't tell if it's a performance
or if he's generally the strange.

1451
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:06,980
I want to see if since the
time this has happened, if, um,

1452
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:12,000
anything with this guy, I mean, I
don't know anything about him. Matt.

1453
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:16,860
Let's see.
Major seems real.

1454
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:21,870
I don't know. I shadows
a nice touch too. Yeah,

1455
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:26,250
that's what I'm saying. Like you
can be playing a role, you know,

1456
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:29,900
possibly interesting choice.
Uh,

1457
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:35,030
what does say this interview with
homeless MMA fighter is really weird.

1458
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:37,630
Okay.
There you go.

1459
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,670
So fucking a man say
no more and that major,

1460
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:46,671
not actually reading the posts on our
next door app about the homeless guy and

1461
01:36:48,001 --> 01:36:50,400
is under carriage by the bank.

1462
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:54,240
The white people around here who were
real freaked out by him. Yeah. And it's,

1463
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:56,910
by the way, that next door
thing, someone got me onto that.

1464
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:01,200
It's super fucking just racially
motivated. People are just like,

1465
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,660
there's a black guy driving.

1466
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:07,320
It's kind of depressing when
you start like, cause you,

1467
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,800
what they do is they build up and then
you can like see them and they're always

1468
01:37:10,801 --> 01:37:14,370
black Saab Brownish guy and you're like,
okay,

1469
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,280
okay.

1470
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:19,840
Either that or it's really benign like
raccoons or eating trash in my yard.

1471
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,650
Anybody having trouble with the wind?
Right.

1472
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,520
But then there was that really funny
one that you shared. The Black Guy,

1473
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:34,060
a black guy wrote, he's like, ah, I'm new
in the neighborhood. I am black. It'd be,

1474
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:36,880
see me walking around, I like to get
fresh air from time to time. Yeah. Yeah.

1475
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:41,210
No need to post. Yeah. It's like good
one dude. Yeah. Cause they'll be like,

1476
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:45,950
there was a guy sitting in his car and uh,

1477
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:49,110
not doing anything but he was black.
Just a heads up.

1478
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:53,240
They'll phrase it, you
know, they'll, they'll,

1479
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,950
they'll try to make it sound like
they're not being scared. Yeah.

1480
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,920
But they'll be like,
uh,

1481
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:02,150
African American males were just deriving
and then not even doing anything.

1482
01:38:02,371 --> 01:38:05,490
They're just driving. Just, I
don't know if anybody's seen them,

1483
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:08,700
but they're in a white car
and they're just driving like,

1484
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:12,060
what's the story though? The drove. Yes.

1485
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:16,800
Silly silliness. There's nothing going
on guys in the neighborhood. Nothing.

1486
01:38:16,801 --> 01:38:20,160
Not a fucking thing. Nothing
to report. All right, Jean,

1487
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,690
we should run j e a n s no,

1488
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:28,500
as it's singular is right.
It is a, do you want to hear,

1489
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,740
um,
I think we already did Chinese eyes,

1490
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,300
British accent, that song.
That's yesterday's news.

1491
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:39,650
Gotten to come and those farts, dude.
All right. I think we played that one.

1492
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:44,460
You nasty but DJ. Huh? I don't know.

1493
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:48,810
There's a bunch of songs, but I don't
know which one's been played. Uh,

1494
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:53,390
pushes theme. Oh my gosh. Pushes theme.

1495
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,370
That's you push.
You want to hear that?

1496
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:01,890
All right. Thank you guys for listening.

1499
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:16,410

Irvine shows we did a couple of months

Big words.

1506
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,610
They love to,
to chatter.

1507
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:58,770
You're going to get stabbed.
It's crazy.

1508
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:22,200
I didn't make it up.
And that's when he's saying.
