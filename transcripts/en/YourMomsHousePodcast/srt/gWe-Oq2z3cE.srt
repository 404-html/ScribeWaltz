1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,433
Christina.

3
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,083
Wow.

4
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,343
Y'All were just blessed.

5
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
Holy smokes.

6
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,660
What came up here

7
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,650
home all
along here.

8
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,600
Pretty good, Huh? Oh good. Wow.

9
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,963
Gotcha.

10
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,520
Uh, it was guy Higgins. Jeff
Glass. Well that's great.

11
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:07,521
Apropos hour week cause we've been singing
the last glass song over and over in

12
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,850
the last one. We can't stop
singing it. The song was,

13
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,150
so we're talking about it on three 75.
That one was excellent too. It's glass.

14
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,530
Let's glass.
That was fine.

15
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,650
Yeah.
Which um,

16
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,360
this glass I'll go to all
the moves were his three 75.

17
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,410
So funny. So good. Where does
that, did you, did you steal it?

18
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,960
I bought it in my pocket. You put in
your pocket, put it in my buckles here.

19
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,660
A downloads three 75.
There it is.

20
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,940
Um, replace it. There
you go. Hmm. There it is.

21
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,670
So it was there and I didn't see it here.
Is this a song?

22
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,740
It's a very cold day today.

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,970
46 which can
go the Moose.

24
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,433
Let's

25
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,340
go ahead and
pick out a moose.

26
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,140
That's Joseph Gee. Wow. Good work.
Yeah, that's glass to Greg Glass.

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,680
It's so it's just glass and it's such
a great phenomenon because now it's

28
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,890
replaced. Chillin. Yeah.

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,770
People say I'm just glassing what's glass?
It's glass.

30
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,770
Here we go.
Yeah.

31
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,380
After the first exercise that you want
to do after dislocated your shoulder and

32
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,970
after you've been mobilized,
it is,

33
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:51,990
you're gonna do this some range of
motion and the range of motion you do.

34
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,160
It's just up to 140 degrees of collection,
which is like how the Hitler

35
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,200
just 40 degrees of external rotation.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,353
Huh?

37
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,950
Don't bring anyone mothers. Well, no,

38
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,690
go to your mom's house.
She,

39
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,363
Christina.

40
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,213
Okay.

41
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,100
Um, I don't know why that
sounds distorted. Yeah, it
doesn't sound good. I know,

42
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,550
but I don't know why. Well, we'll fix it.
I'll put that on my list of things. Well,

43
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:14,050
can't blue band figure it out?
No, he's not an audio guy. Oh,

44
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,380
you said that because it
was a copy of now it's not.

45
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,120
Now this is the original song. Yeah. Then
I don't, I don't know. I don't know why.

46
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,960
I feel like, cause it's going,
this must be like, I dunno,

47
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,400
some setting or something, something
going through that board. I don't know.

48
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,170
Is it volume too high somewhere?
No, because it wasn't too high.

49
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,150
It just was super distorted.
Yeah. It's really weird. I Dunno.

50
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,250
Well here come the emails. Here's
what's wrong. Oh, I love watching.

51
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,380
People are going to tell me right
now. Oh No, no. Cause it's always, um,

52
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,900
like when something goes wrong
audio wise, yeah. People go, um,

53
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,970
uh, you know, you get like, like
when there was the, um, remember the,

54
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,040
we had the, the old
monitor here, I got like a

55
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
hundred emails and it's all like one
guy was like probably that you're htmi

56
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,730
cable is in plugged in all the way.

57
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,390
I know that sounds silly that you should
try it. And then the next guy goes,

58
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,140
do you have this input? Do you have
this output? Do you have the setting?

59
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,891
It's not that,

60
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:16,280
it's not like everyone tells
you a different thing that
makes you really upset,

61
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,500
you know? No, it doesn't
make me upset. It's, um,

62
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,620
it ends up being like they ended up
proposing 50 different things that can be,

63
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:29,531
so what'll happen is that sounds a
store did that someone's going to be,

64
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,730
it's this channel. It's this cable. Yeah.
It's this thing is this dial. It's, it's,

65
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,100
it's going to be 50 different suggestions.
I'm saying.

66
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,770
No one can know without being here
what the actual problem is. You know,

67
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,570
luckily we have the Hitler
therapist to help us. So this guy,

68
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,170
um, I dunno, this is just
what he does. He's a, he's,

69
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,220
I like how these guys
introduce themselves. I don't
know if you saw this or not,

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,113
but this is how they entered it.

71
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,980
Hi, Bob Schroth physical therapist,
Brad Height and physical therapist.

72
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:03,460
Together we are the most famous physical
therapist. I'm here. No. All right, Brad.

73
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:07,390
Today we're talking about top three
exercises that you want to do after just

74
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:08,470
okay.
In your shoulder.

75
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,500
No, I saw that and I go, is
that accurate? And then I go,

76
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,840
I actually can't dispute that.
I don't know who the most famous,

77
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,310
maybe they are the most famous on the
Internet. Yeah. Are they don't know.

78
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,100
But they're exactly the coolest
that you can claim to be. Sure.

79
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,670
We're the most famous,

80
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,560
hi Bob Schrider physical therapist.

81
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:31,040
Together we are the most famous physical
therapist. I'm the there. All right, Brad,

82
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,960
today we're talking about top three
exercises that you want to do after just

83
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:36,010
okay.
In your shoulder.

84
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,360
So Bob and a fucking whatever his name,

85
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,320
they're the most famous
physical therapist. Yeah.

86
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,370
Can we claim that we're the
most famous fart therapists.

87
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,470
Therapists. Uh Huh. Yeah. You think
more than anybody on the Internet,

88
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,770
I think were the most 40 and a
shitty show on the podcast world.

89
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,260
I definitely wear the shittiest
show on the Internet. Yeah.

90
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,190
What can I see that guy's reaction again?
The guy goes,

91
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,090
you just give like a hail Hitler
and the other guy was like, Yup,

92
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,150
try it after the first exercise that
you want to do after dislocated your

93
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:18,180
shoulder and after you've been mobilized
it cause you're gonna do some range of

94
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:21,240
motion. Okay. Like how the
range of motion you do.

95
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,290
It's just up to 140 degrees of flection,
which is like how the Hitler,

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,510
you can do just 40 degrees
of external rotation.

97
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,890
[inaudible] just like roll with it.
We have it dropped

98
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,000
blue ban and anticipating the
needs. Oh, I love that. Good job.

99
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,980
Which is like how the hit an artery.

100
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,800
Yeah. Interesting. But what I guess, what
else would you call? That's true. Yeah.

101
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,340
Move.

102
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,450
You know, I think if you're
thinking with your brain, you just,

103
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,800
it's just funny that like,

104
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,880
I don't know if for the guy that I'm is
the most famous physical therapist on

105
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:06,330
the Internet,

106
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,360
I don't know if you realize what you're
doing when you put that on the Internet,

107
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,890
like you're putting, you're
putting yourself saying,
Heil Hitler on the Internet.

108
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,230
Let me know what's going to
come to that perfect gift.

109
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,230
A little Photoshop stuff's going to start
your, uh, your outfit's going to change.

110
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:26,190
First of all, familiar with swaps. It
goes, but they're going to be all over

111
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,310
the other guys like you are.
That's the way to do it.

112
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,350
You got a Heil Hitler and you know that.

113
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,710
That's what he says in
our private sessions too.

114
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,050
If you want that elbow to
heal a dislocated shoulder,

115
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,490
do it Tom. You do it.
You've been doing it.

116
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,180
No, I'm making sure that my dislocated
shoulder is back in shape. Yeah,

117
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,650
there you go. It feels
good. Can you lend a now?

118
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,153
I didn't say

119
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,470
I know.
Let's say they called these niggas

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,490
always. Yeah, always setting
me up. I'm not setting you up.

121
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Okay,

122
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,050
interesting.
We should bring this up.

123
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,200
So remember last week I put out a call
to our English or anybody in the United

124
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,800
Kingdom to let us know if they still say
fags, right. For cigarettes. Someone, uh,

125
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,010
Lee writes in, I'm writing
to confirm that. Yes,

126
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,450
we still call cigarettes fags. Quote,
can I bum a fag off you translates to,

127
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,750
can I have one of your cigarettes?
I haven't actually,

128
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,850
I haven't actual fag as a friend.

129
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,570
The other day I asked if I could bum
one of his fags. He was fine with that.

130
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,190
No confusion.
He gave me a cigarette.

131
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,420
Interesting. There you go. So it was,

132
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,710
I held that position that it
wouldn't change that, that slide.

133
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,150
So I'm challenged. Yeah. Okay. Consensus
is I, it's unchallenged because,

134
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,990
but they also, they don't say he's a
fag. She's a fag or something like that.

135
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:04,824
Right.

136
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,533
Okay.

137
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,800
I was waiting for this and I'm
surprised it took this long

138
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,130
show up.
So if we could review real quick,

139
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,860
where is this photo even from? That
looks like it might be from the, uh,

140
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,480
that show that those two put on a
couple. Oh, the super serious show.

141
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,750
Super serious picture. Um,
and so a good one for a while,

142
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:32,750
I've been suggesting a hairstyle
or Christina to stand out,

143
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,200
to stand out from the rest,
stand out from the crowd.

144
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,760
And I know that she's been developing
this hour and you know, working on,

145
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,000
on getting an hour shot.
And I go, man, how about,

146
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,520
how about for the special than a year? No,
I know you're going to end up shooting.

147
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,280
Yeah. You do something that really pops
like to the crap, right? You're scrolling

148
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,740
through. Well, who specialists
that I watch and then,

149
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,990
and then you land on this. Imagine
you're, you're paging through, okay,

150
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,800
who do I watch? Who Do I watch?
And this is the cover art.

151
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,670
Tell me you're not clicking play well.
What's the title?

152
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,570
The title is Farc Shit.
Ah,

153
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,650
no. You know, I look like
their Benjamin Franklin.

154
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,800
You do look like Benjamin
Franklin. Yeah. Kind of similar.

155
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,720
He did kind of, yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

156
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,850
The coloring and the expression.
So would it be electricity please?

157
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,980
That'd be the name of your special.
Yeah. Oh, how about I'm electric.

158
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,660
Okay. Look at that picture. That right
here. It says I'm, and here's the,

159
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:43,240
now for the people listening,
we're looking at,

160
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,910
unfortunately it's Photoshop
that I wish it were real,

161
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,040
but it is the skull at style that I was
encouraging you where there's no hair on

162
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,550
top. It's completely shaped, but
on the side, your full length,

163
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,740
and you have an expression that says,

164
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,710
I got something to say or something
interesting going on. What?

165
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,360
Anything married just fine.
I think it's boring.

166
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,880
And then I get to see
a nice picture of me.

167
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,370
Tell me what's wrong with standing
out with something like this.

168
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,100
You know right now I go, Oh, you got a
nice head of hair, so right here I go,

169
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,400
whoa. Plus, then you're going to be
like just another female comic, right.

170
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,750
She talking about her period. I don't want
to hear that, but this chick has shit.

171
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,310
This is raw. This chick's
a little out there. Yeah.

172
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,020
I mean I wouldn't even need to put
caution tape over the over my mouth and

173
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,410
what's already there. The
caution tape is, is, is,

174
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,870
is there without being that I don't
even need like a comedy shirt.

175
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,110
Flames on it. Yup. It's a really nice
look. Thank you, Tom. You're welcome.

176
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,390
I'm glad that you finally could see why
I've been, sometimes we'll be married.

177
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:54,880
You, I swear to God, I remember I
was talking about this yesterday.

178
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,860
We were sitting in the nursery with our
son was one year old now who is just

179
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:04,861
winding down for the night and you're
sitting in your robe and your dad boxers

180
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,050
and your slips slips and it just a
filthy shirt and your legs are open.

181
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,400
You're sitting in the one proper chair.

182
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm sitting on the fork chair and
you're farting and you're, you know,

183
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,820
your guts are hanging out and you go,
who could meet married to you?

184
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,210
I was like a lot of people when
you were like, no, it Kinda,

185
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,520
here's why a lot of husbands fart.

186
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Burb make photoshops of their wife with
a skullet but very few husbands really

187
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:38,560
unleashed with the fury that you do.
Like who of your friends that are married?

188
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,583
Yeah.
Ha.

189
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,670
Like who unloads as hard as you do
on their wife in terms of like the,

190
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,860
the burbs, the farts, the spread.

191
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,890
You spread your ass cheeks
and Fart. Oh, you did this,

192
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,800
you got it from the dinner table.
And our kid and I were sitting there,

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,390
you bent over,

194
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,660
you put your hands on the table and you
bent over and you went and then you,

195
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,870
you farted as you stood up. Yeah. Do you
think a lot of men do that? I think so.

196
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,560
Yeah. Well wait, why did,
I don't think many do,

197
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,670
but many don't do that because they
want to be seen as sexually exciting.

198
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,610
We're talking about Ku
Gaucher savage to their wife,

199
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,200
and then we agreed that Bert,
definitely,

200
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,710
that's true that Burt takes it
to that level. Well, what you,

201
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,590
the stories you've told me
it's pretty heinous. Yeah, no,

202
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:31,250
I know that he clips his fingernails
and then puts them on a piece of scotch

203
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:35,900
tape and the tape. Some under a
coffee to coffee table. Yeah. Raw.

204
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,660
That's Herenton told me about one
time he was toying with his asshole.

205
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,620
I don't like the story at all. Oh my
God. And laying in bed and was like,

206
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:46,670
what's that smell? So she was like, this
smells like garbage. And then he was like,

207
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,950
oh my God, could you now that's
really vulgar. Like that's, that's,

208
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,040
I don't care if I ever get
laid again. It was bart. Yeah.

209
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,150
But most of my friends, you're right,
they do dial it back a little bit.

210
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,170
They dial it back. Why do
you think that is? I mean,

211
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,520
it depends on which friend
you're talking about.

212
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,800
Some of them just have different,
some of them,

213
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,270
their wives will fucking kill them. Yeah.
Yeah. But you know, that's what I mean.

214
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,700
We get emails from people
that owe me and my, you know,

215
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:15,410
my spouse or like you and this and that.

216
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,790
So we have people that definitely the
people only know the the show version,

217
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,680
which is not far from the real version,

218
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,430
but I'm saying that they don't actually
get to see you in your boxers with your

219
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,860
nuts hanging out and not only that,

220
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,770
modeling some pretty great behavior
for our one year old. Oh yeah,

221
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,220
he's really going to, because
it's, it's in high gear now.

222
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,760
He's waving hi and I'm laughing a lot now.

223
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,750
The little jokes that we have and it's
coming where he's going to start ripping

224
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,970
him and then laughing and then
wanting to be like, oh shit.

225
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,020
Oh we have to pick up poop word.
We've been talking about that.

226
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,320
That's the whole thing is
when you have a one year old,

227
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,340
you start thinking about potty
training's coming down the line.

228
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,540
I've been reading in a book about infant
psychology that the way to lead into

229
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:08,360
potty training is you come up with a
word that signifies what's happening very

230
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,490
early and you don't make
a big deal out of it.

231
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:13,510
So when you say that he's pushing out one,
because our son grunts went out today,

232
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,420
he got on all fours and grunted went
out. It was gnarly. And you're like,

233
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,330
well what do we call that? Do we say, Hey,

234
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,480
are you making a Kaka Booboo,
booboo?

235
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,260
Or we thought Megan
Brown Brown since that's,

236
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,170
but then you think about him
in school being like, teacher,

237
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,440
I got to make a brown or mommy,
I got to go make a brown.

238
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:37,250
Actually thought today I
realized if he can say dump,

239
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,230
um,
because

240
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,710
I would love to hear a child,
Yo, I got to take his job.

241
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,020
Like it's cause it's not actually crude.
It's not a curse.

242
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,970
No. Yeah, I have to dump. I have to take,

243
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,630
or do we teach them the whole phrase?
Yeah.

244
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,800
Teacher,
I gotta take a dump,

245
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,610
excuse me.
And he's like,

246
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,730
I'm going to dump right now
if I don't get to a toilet,

247
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,560
here's what's going to make us laugh more.

248
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:22,440
Because you have to think about how
long it's going to take to toilet.

249
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,900
Train takes months.
Oh dump would make me laugh.

250
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,440
Brown's also fun.
Yeah.

251
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,110
I got to make Brown and then we
can teach them brown and yellow.

252
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,320
Do you have to make yellow too or
Brown? Is it yellow and Brown? Yeah.

253
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,910
Now we go with dump.

254
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,130
He talking about this size.
I had a big dump.

255
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,960
Right then what do we go with for PG?

256
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:48,120
Do we say then like peachy. Peachy? Yeah.

257
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,630
Yeah I dunno.
It's interesting.

258
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,640
That's Hungarian too.
Well you say peachy.

259
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,850
Peachy only the same say in Hungarian.

260
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
I like,
well it's for Nina for me right now I've,

261
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,490
I've narrowed it down to making a brown.
I got to make Brown.

262
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,780
Yeah or taking you down.

263
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,730
It's funny making Brown is one of
those that he can get away with it more

264
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,060
because he's so small that people
won't think that it's us teaching.

265
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,020
Also figure out like it's
going to be an extra beat

266
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,760
cause no one else will
say it, right? Like Brown,

267
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,430
Brown. And they're like, oh, okay.

268
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,710
By the way, this was saying, you know,

269
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,330
make a brown dad.
I haven't make a brown.

270
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,040
I gotta make a brand. My Dad, I'm
done. Browning come white meat. Wow.

271
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,160
That's going to be fun. I can't wait for
him to start saying this kind of stuff.

272
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,800
Do you know, um, well,
glass was quest. Let's go.

273
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,850
Somebody sent this,
uh,

274
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,310
this video is a Hungarian
guy. Oh, I saw that.

275
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:06,780
I was watching him watch it part.
It's really colorful. Is it?

276
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,090
Will you explain what's going on?
I'm trying,

277
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,610
I'm trying to wrap my brain
around how hateful it shit
is. Is it really bad? Yeah.

278
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,450
Okay. Well, a lot of the
stuff you hear Your Dad,

279
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,780
my dad sang and Hungarian
growing up like this one.

280
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,943
Where's he,

281
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,910
those are immigrants that he's running.
They're

282
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,930
called the tig and are Gypsies.
He's

283
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,550
right. So there's like, these are
refugees and cheese and he's a,

284
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,950
he's a hung go. Yeah. What was he saying
back there? Well, he's saying, you know,

285
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,930
core devine. Yeah, I'd
get the fuck out of my,

286
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,450
he was actually trying to teach and
he's trying to hit them. Yup. Yup.

287
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,000
Well they'll secret some
Hungarians are very racist. Yeah.

288
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,280
I wonder if just a little,

289
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,310
they have travel. Travel

290
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,750
did play it again.
I thought he said Midland Mamane.

291
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,843
Oh,
he's saying,

292
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,553
yeah.

293
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,100
I don't know that word that he's saying

294
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,000
or some immigrant, I'm sure. But yes. But
I don't know if that's a Hungarian word.

295
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,520
A Latin or whatever. They are like, he's

296
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,420
here.
Here's the children.

297
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,410
Hello. So he's being a douchebag.
Samar star. It's like sarcastic

298
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,230
and I don't know if it translates to sons
of a bitches, but Qubein. Yeah, not, yeah.

299
00:21:58,231 --> 00:21:59,970
I mean loosely fuckers go back.

300
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,583
Yeah.

301
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,040
The reading this for them.
For the listeners. What?
Yeah, we should, sorry guys.

302
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,310
I mean, we're just reading it.
Yeah. So there's a Hungarian driver,

303
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,490
I think it's one of those dash cams
and there's these immigrants and he's

304
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:22,590
screaming like a,

305
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,570
your wives pick up guns and fight isis.
You just fuck around you. Filthy dogs.

306
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:32,280
Parasite dickheads. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.

307
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:36,060
Yeah. I was just like, I'm, I'm
enraptured by this man's level of hate.

308
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,210
You fuck around.
If you felt the dogs,

309
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,990
there's a lot of people walking on
the highway. Yeah. This is usually,

310
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:52,050
I've only seen in the Middle East.
I've actually never seen this in Hungary,

311
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:56,940
so it says it's in France. Oh,
trucker Ramsar refugees. Geez.

312
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,950
I didn't know people walk
on the highway in France.

313
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,853
Yeah.
Muscle build up.

314
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,860
He definitely has your fucking
musical tastes too. I liked it.

315
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:09,270
All this racism is through a dance
like house music due to the dude

316
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,753
your address

317
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,170
fighting against terrorist
with machine guns

318
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,220
rotten,
but I dunno.

319
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,220
It is insane.

320
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,683
Those

321
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,350
plastic craps on the road.

322
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,970
It's not necessary now
because this truck jam is six

323
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,520
diagonal showing up on the IGA

324
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,770
translate. Really what it is is the
immigrants are filthy. They make trash.

325
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:52,860
They're horrible. They
ruin everything. Yeah.

326
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,100
That's a gay session.

327
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,080
Falash one bossman compulsive hair type
person. There's so many people walking

328
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,280
and they're like,
I think trying to climb on the back.

329
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,800
I think we're trying to hitch rides.
Yeah.

330
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,940
Oh my God.
Come down from there.

331
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:25,260
Come down from there.

332
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,190
He is behind me. Oh. So one
of them jumped on his trucks

333
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,320
classic off
the tractor and the trailer.

334
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,180
I liked the beginning. I was
like, I'll go to the highway.

335
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:52,800
I know what this is terrible.
This poor, these poor people.

336
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:55,430
Fuck man. Well that's
good to know. You know,

337
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,860
the Hungarians are super sweet and
just really welcoming energy. You know,

338
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,260
kind of have that rep in Europe.
Yeah.

339
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:04,680
A lot of anti immigrant policies.

340
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,370
They don't like Albanians. They don't
like to guidance. They don't like

341
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,900
Gypsies. They call them
Gypsies. They don't,

342
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,660
they don't like anybody. That's not
Hungarian. Not, I shouldn't say everybody,

343
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:22,080
but slot. Yeah. Don't, don't
like gays so much either.

344
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,740
It's your tribe.
I know.

345
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,630
Speaking of tribe, I got an
email from a guy about, um,

346
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,890
I fucked up on that crumpets thing.
Um,

347
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,220
this guy's Ronan from Austria and,
and he's right. I fucked it up.

348
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,420
The Guy I was thinking of,
it's named a Sverre to Pete.

349
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,170
Which guy you're talking
about? Um, these European,

350
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:52,140
why was Santa Claus white is what we're
talking about. And I was like, oh,

351
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:55,170
maybe because he's a
Nordic st or whatever.

352
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:57,690
So this guy from Austria
wrote in and said that, no.

353
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,880
So Saint Nicholas is actually from Turkey,
so he may have been darker skin.

354
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,261
Yeah.

355
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:08,100
And then in the u s I think there were
like caricatures drawn of him in the 18

356
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,180
hundreds that drew him white in the US,

357
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,250
which is probably why we
came to adapt to learn.

358
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,510
My cousin who listened to I think a PBS
thing that the modern day depiction of

359
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:24,381
Santa Claus as in the fat guy in the
red suit from a Coca Cola ad campaign in

360
00:26:25,081 --> 00:26:27,240
1938 wow.

361
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,300
So before that he had been depicted
as thin and just, you know,

362
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,800
normal like whatever was Saint
Nicholas is thin because I'm hungry.

363
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:39,801
It's like a modern depiction of the fat
guy in the red suit was in line with a

364
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,520
Coca Cola. Interesting, isn't it?

365
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,190
That advertising how we see it like a
saint by the way, he's the same speed.

366
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:49,900
The same. Yeah. And so also, so the,
the black guy that I saw in Amsterdam,

367
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,920
right ride toy, that they're like
chocolates of him and everything.

368
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,940
It's not [inaudible], it's the
black guy is called severity Pete.

369
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,180
And it's like Sanchez
homeboy is what that is.

370
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,420
It's like his companion and he's a more
from Spain, which is why he's so Daro.

371
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,500
The more, the more. So there's
that and yeah, I've totally,

372
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:12,450
I'm sure it's totally racist, right?
It's fucking probably calling now. Um,

373
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,340
okay. So then it's in November six
St Nikolaj comes to your house.

374
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,130
Remember I told you this and you'll
leave your shoes out. This isn't hungry.

375
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:24,720
It's November six. And if you're good,
you get candy and toys and your shoes.

376
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,420
And if you're bad,
then the devil comes.

377
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,590
And that's named crumpets in
Austria and some other countries,

378
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,380
but I don't know what the fuck they call
it a hungry and they put culinary shoes

379
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:39,330
and then they hit you with a branches
and sticks because you're a bad kid.

380
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,300
And your parents tell the guy in the
village who dresses up like the devil,

381
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:47,220
the common hate. You and my uncle got
hit a few years in a row. Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,450
And then on, no, no.
December 24th Christmas Eve.

383
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,220
It's baby baby A's. Wishkah who brings
you toys? Not Santa's. Oh really? Yeah.

384
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,240
So the 24th is our Christmas
and baby Jesus brings you twice.

385
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,210
You hear it's different. Yeah.
I know American holidays.

386
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Most Americans do it where you know
the kid for the whole month is told,

387
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:12,060
you know, saying it's coming
soon is coming. Yeah. You
know, you meet him at a mall,

388
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:14,610
he's just on break.
How do you justify the mall?

389
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,030
How do we explain that it's traveling?
Dude is the only,

390
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,270
he's only in town today and then he goes
back to the North Pole and then on the

391
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:26,271
24th most American kids are
taught that he's out now.

392
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,290
Toliver world to gifts. Yeah. They look
out in the sky. You see up there? Oh yeah.

393
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:34,020
You see him up there.
He's going to fly all over the world.

394
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,520
So that's why you leave out the cookies
in the milk. You do all that shit.

395
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,950
And then he's supposed to come down the
chimney the night of Christmas Eve so

396
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:47,660
that when you wake up Christmas Day,
the treats, the treats are there. Yeah,

397
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:51,480
I know 24th and my house was Christmas,
but he,

398
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,310
my dad didn't tell me
yeas which got brought it.

399
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,110
It's Santa like just came on the 24th.
So we kind of meshed those two holidays.

400
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,280
Yeah. And uh, we go, he'd be like,
let's go for a drive and look for Santa.

401
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,750
And then he'd be like,
I forgot something.

402
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,750
And then he'd run back in and put all
the gifts out and then we come back for a

403
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:10,380
long drive. You to figure
out like 15, like 16 yeah.

404
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,800
Yeah. How long did you, how
long did you hold out for?

405
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,430
I think by third grade there was a
Jewish kid in our class, Eric Friedman,

406
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,410
and he told all of us, he's like, Whoa,
whoa. I went to a Christian school too.

407
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,650
And he was like, guys, the
Santa thing's not real.

408
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:30,420
I saw the presence in my parent's
closet and we were like, what? Who Ha?

409
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,710
Who ruined it for you?

410
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,450
Who Ruin it for me. I
think, I don't remember.

411
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,160
I really don't remember how it was ruined.

412
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,680
Um, probably Maria. Probably Maria.
Yeah. Like, oh my God, he's such a kid.

413
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,710
Um, guys, I didn't know
what I do remember.

414
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:54,550
It was one time Christmas Eve,
she goes,

415
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,700
I saw him standing out the window
and I looked out the window.

416
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:01,890
I didn't see anything. So I said
that I saw him too when he was like,

417
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,750
I saw my parents were like,
really? And she was like, yeah,

418
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,090
she didn't talk like that that
you did. And I go, I saw him too.

419
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,550
I was so upset that she saw him.
Corey, he's lying. He's a liar.

420
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,863
Liar face.

421
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:22,110
And now here's what I couldn't imagine
as a kid is being forced to sleep on the

422
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:27,250
most exciting night. That was a thing
too because the older the kids get,

423
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:31,450
you know, a young kid you can just,
you know, the kids passed out.

424
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,770
But when you start to get a little older
you can fight those incidents. Yeah.

425
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,920
So did you stay up till like I would
stay up till four in the morning looking

426
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,520
for him. I couldn't, I wouldn't be
able to sleep. Yeah. Did you sleep?

427
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,780
I um, I mean I remember
crashing pretty hard, you know.

428
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,840
I also remember actually when
I finally knew what was up,

429
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,820
having fun playing that game
to my younger sister. Yeah.

430
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,650
Like being in on it because it's fun. It
is fun to do. Yeah. So we, we kept her.

431
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,880
Sure.
We tortured her for a few more years.

432
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,600
How's it can be fine next year when
Elis gets it a little more. Yeah.

433
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,590
This year he doesn't know what's going on.
Yeah. I liked that photo. We got out of,

434
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:13,330
um, my, my niece, our niece
crying eight months old,

435
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:17,020
just terrified of Santa Cruz is
like, they always are. At that day.

436
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:21,390
We didn't take our son to meet Santa
yet cause it was that new fucking Kylie.

437
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,320
Well some stupid store.

438
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,370
It popped up in our neurons are our
mall here and it was just swamped with

439
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:30,910
people. Yeah. And we couldn't even get
in line for Santos. Too many people.

440
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,230
Way Too many people. Lightweight too much.
Yeah. I don't want to scare my kid. I'll,

441
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:39,220
I'll wait till next year. Um, this, I
know it was going to make you happy.

442
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,410
So
this is a

443
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,070
from the Netflix.

444
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,460
This is a clip from Netflix.
It's a toilet, toilet

445
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,910
and uh, in an apartment. I mean,

446
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,780
how would you describe the toilet
for our listeners and nightmare?

447
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:01,490
Somebody made Brown a lot, you know, it's
like the train spotting toilet. Yeah.

448
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,750
It's pretty bad. Look at that whole
area though. I wouldn't shit there.

449
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Even if I had really bad diarrhea.
I don't think I would go there.

450
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,220
Would you hold it? No, I don't like
that. I don't like that shit outside.

451
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,300
If I had diarrhea, I would go out of my
living room before I shit there. Yup. Yup.

452
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,820
One more. One Hand. The
toilet was all plugged.

453
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,140
They said they haven't used it for a year,

454
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
so I'm going to take this
up and try to unplug it,

455
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,120
see if there's something stuck
in it or anything. It's called,

456
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,230
here comes your lunch.
And Mikey,

457
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,100
he stuffs it in the time

458
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,330
to get what's going on. How's, what is it?

459
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,710
No. Do. How do you let it get that bad?

460
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,550
Yeah.
Or they said these people said they,

461
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,290
they didn't use the toilet for years.
So why would you,

462
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,870
why would you not?
You know,

463
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,570
how are you just going to neglect
the whole a toilet for a year?

464
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,810
I'd say that's priority in the house
at the toilet's not working. Yeah.

465
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,600
You should probably call. It's kind
of a day one phone call. Right?

466
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,920
Day Two at the latest. I'd
say minute one. Yeah. Hey,

467
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,850
the toilet's broken and all. He's gonna
do his snake, that thing. So what?

468
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,550
You know what I mean? You're paying
to guide is to snake it. Well,

469
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:14,384
let's see where it goes.

470
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,340
Oh my God.
Yeah.

471
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,230
God bless this man for doing this job.
Or did you call it

472
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,810
or his leg?

473
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,740
What the fuck is in there?
I'll share.

474
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,720
This won't go on the toilet
and the toilet.

475
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,600
We find toys in there sometimes.

476
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,560
Yeah. He's got one lonely
two, one, two feet.

477
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,180
And he just touches that
bare handed the snake.

478
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:58,100
He picked it up and then he's like,
you did, Bro. How about gloves?

479
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:00,740
Like, not fucking on
sanitary doesn't give a shit.

480
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,030
Zero shits given him about anything.
You were wearing gloves. I mean,

481
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,640
wearing a hazmat suit
does gnarly is real gnarly

482
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,870
cars to find a lot of those in there.
Or Feminine Hygiene Products.

483
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,640
Oh, that girl, what's up? Rented. When
I pulled the toy, I can fill out. It's,

484
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,250
you suck right there, right? Wash
your fucking hands. Vacuum is start,

485
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,190
smell it again.

486
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,500
This dude knows that the vacuum, he
is going to trigger this smell. Yeah.

487
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,200
So now he's vacuuming up with toilet.

488
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,340
How do you let it get over it? Yeah.

489
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:54,270
That's so gnarly. Dude. Look at his school
haircut too. What do you call that luck?

490
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,880
That's a pretty much a military
cut. Cop Cut, you know? Yeah.

491
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,660
See Brian's. It's real high and tight.
Yeah, it's a reverse skull. It you like.

492
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,700
I love it. Yeah, Dude, this
guy is disgusting. I mean, I,

493
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,050
I'm sorry I can't get over
just he's covered in feces.

494
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:13,080
Like it's what he does for work.
He's a busy guy.

495
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,140
Okay. Would you rather 30
seconds. Hold on. Hold on.

496
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:24,110
Would you rather do this guy's job?
Yeah. Full time is your Gig. Yeah.

497
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,160
Or be a deck hand on below deck out crew.
Outdoor crew.

498
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,053
This guy's job,

499
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,000
we've been watching a lot of below
deck but this uh, the deckhand,

500
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,190
that's it's,
it's 24,

501
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,730
700 of labor. I know. They
clean, it's so hard. Deck.

502
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,600
The windows they get in the water,
the Barnacles,

503
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,110
they scrape it off the hall bitch
work. They do. Then they do,

504
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,650
you know they set up this the toys though.
Inflatable thing.

505
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:57,300
They fucking carry this lift that
and it's all in out in the sun.

506
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,180
A hundred degree temperature.
But you'd be in such great shape.

507
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,130
Eby you we so rep so fast doing that job.
Damn.

508
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,390
Heat stroke. Definitely. I
can, this is terrible. No,

509
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:12,240
you would definitely rather be a deck.
I know. I think I would flush toilets

510
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,720
six days to flush the
toilet six days a week.

511
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,240
I can't in look at this from the way and
with Bart, how are you doing? I Dunno.

512
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,400
I mean I'm feel like I'm one of the
thinner guys out there right now. You.

513
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,660
I'm just, I'm not going to,
I know what your number is.

514
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,890
I'm not going to reveal that right
now, but you look amazing. Yup.

515
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,300
You've been a,
you've been very vigilant and I think,

516
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,750
I think the rewards will show, you
have to admit, you have to admit. Yeah.

517
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,640
In the last week,
incredible amounts,

518
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,190
I was shut out of h two o y propaganda.
Why would you look what I'm doing?

519
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,880
I've got a full pint and I've just
finished off a sham meal. Tea.

520
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm seriously drinking so much water.
You know why you're bringing it up?

521
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,890
Because it's the first time
you've ever drank that much. No.

522
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,570
And you're so stunned by your brand new
thing. This new thing called hydration.

523
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,780
I get it. You're, it's another level.
I get it. Here's what happened,

524
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,390
and this is also look at the toilet.
I went to her talking spa.

525
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,750
Had a massage. Yeah.
Oh, stop at the story.

526
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,600
God,
why do you drink a lot of water?

527
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,670
I turned and I was like, yeah, it's
pretty well known and she goes,

528
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:34,260
your muscles feel very hydrated.
I swear on our son's life.

529
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,350
Look in this Iraj well
that's what happened.

530
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:40,110
I can't roll my eyes far
back enough and my hand goes,

531
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,650
you should just keep that up.
I know.

532
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,440
You know it was a real water champ at
the House that we don't talk about is

533
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,320
bitsy dog drinks. So much
volume of water. Yorkie sips.

534
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,100
She drinks out of her slipper in
the crate and she empties it daily.

535
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,240
I have to refill it and
I'm not exaggerating every
two days. Yeah. Otherwise.

536
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,800
And you know who's not the water champ.
Fif No drinking water.

537
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,580
The other big time water
champ though is our son,

538
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,280
two pounds sippy cups
because he's related to me.

539
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,860
He's just trying to like give it to
them in the morning. He goes boop.

540
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,210
And then when he puts it down,
it's down. I'm like, Holy Shit Man.

541
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,450
My son, he kicks off his day
like that. Just like his dad

542
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,900
[inaudible]

543
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,880
wear a mask,
you know it's going to smell.

544
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,020
That was fantastic.
I think we have to get into the show.

545
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,890
I know you don't call your ta
provider to get the super today.

546
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,480
And I think someone said they
got it on Netflix. Uber off.

547
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,830
You know it's going to stink.
You know it's going to be dirty.

548
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,750
Where I'm asking where your gloves.

549
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,050
Well, we are the shittiest show.
You told me earlier that um, Hitler,

550
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,283
Hitler Guy,

551
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,260
let me a refresh everybody's
memory of what, uh,

552
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,490
an enthusiastic fellow. This
guy is, uh, this guy here

553
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,920
exercise. Okay. In your shoulder
and after you've been mobilized,

554
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:20,461
it is,

555
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:24,500
you're going to be just some range of
motion and the range of motion you do.

556
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,530
It's just up to 140 degrees of flection,
which is like how the Hitler.

557
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,410
Hmm. Um, you, you said,

558
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:37,890
you know who this guy reminds
me of the Evie. Micah.

559
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,960
Just how boring those two
are. God, those two bores.

560
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,030
And if you don't remember
any, my guy, this is him,

561
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,090
33,000 views now.

562
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:54,660
This was our blood is other views

563
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,360
Kevin writes, Hey Rick, thanks for the
great programs. I'm really learning a lot.

564
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,470
I'm thinking about buying an Ori
Three 20 for my studio and live shows.

565
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,840
Thanks so much for asking which take
a look at how the capsule is very,

566
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,703
here we go.

567
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,350
Here I have no you already 20 and the
three 20 as you can see they're quite

568
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,184
different.

569
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,210
You already three 20 uses the same
capsule design is in the Ari 27 and d each

570
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:25,660
had Barry will de fe sports do
you already? 20 zero external

571
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,400
twenties are integrated
into the capital structure.

572
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,510
Theory 20 uses a standard gas
magnet to create a synergy,

573
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,780
uses a neodymium magnet to create a
scope three 20 we'll have a brighter and

574
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:40,620
higher output.

575
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,420
The Ori 20 sensitivity is 1.5 millivolts
per pascal and the Ori Three 20 says

576
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,710
2.5 mommies and they
both have humbucker coil.

577
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,690
Microphone is best for farts and burps.

578
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:55,890
The Ori Twenties is an enclosed throw
non binary lines of the abdomen and the

579
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,440
already have about his
variable d explained video.

580
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,140
Yeah, Mike Guy. Thanks for watching.

581
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,890
Reading through our viewer mail and came
across this one. Virginia we can ramp

582
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,540
writes. Hey Rick, I love
you series in my Ed Mike's.

583
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,180
I keep seeing variable d
mentioned in some product specs,

584
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,800
but I'm not really clear on what it is
or what it does. Help me out please down.

585
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,040
Sure. Brent, that's a great question
and thanks so much for asking.

586
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,810
I want to know variable d is an exclusive
ed teacher found on our Ari, Ari,

587
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,850
Ari 27 d and r e three 20 premium mix.

588
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,350
The quick answer is that it's a magical
technology that stabilizes the Mikes

589
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:42,190
tonal performance throughout an
extended working distance. Yeah,

590
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,720
there's a lot more to it than just that.
Now to know more.

591
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,610
First thing about polar patterns.
Okay.

592
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,380
If the core element of any Mike is fixed
in the front of the element is exposed,

593
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:51,740
right?

594
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,930
You'll be the direction with the character
sounds arriving from all direction.

595
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:57,720
Got It. So Mike, yeah, that's
what we want. He's so into this,

596
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,820
which is that exaggerated bass response
you hear when you get right up on the

597
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:03,450
mic.
Got It.

598
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,580
Had proximity effect in cardio
or just do it in some situations.

599
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:12,280
Proxy queuing that I've done to these mix
all three of the world show you, um, uh,

600
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,600
they're flat,
there's no additional Sweden.

601
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,500
And then, um, this, uh, so anyways,

602
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:21,070
that's the evening Micah boring video
in the world. Um, you know what,

603
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,340
this reminds me of marching him.
Hmm.

604
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:28,210
Being in high school and trying
to take chemistry. Oh yeah.

605
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,420
Well you're just like
chemistry and physics.

606
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,840
I got big solid ds and ds.

607
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,630
I dropped out of chemistry. That's how
stupid. I was like, nope. One of my,

608
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,550
my physics teacher had like chemistry,
chemistry teacher. He liked me so much,

609
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,470
like on a personal level
and he was just like,

610
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,540
basically he talked to me about one
time. He goes like, are you retarded?

611
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,850
Because I, I just, it was like this,
it was like the cardioid actually,

612
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,230
it's a covalent

613
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,650
bond. Oh my God. I'm ready.

614
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,110
Hi Baby.

615
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,470
I love him. Oh my God. This is, um,

616
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,410
lady money made.

617
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:23,330
This is the Evie Mike Song Guy

618
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,010
made a song

619
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:49,560
TV. Evie, my guy, Steve. You,
Micah. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

620
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,400
Poor guy. I know he's just doing
his thing. He knows someone

621
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,390
march about microphone.
So now this is a cardioid dynamic like,

622
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,460
and I'm going to get
my lip right up on it.

623
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:05,000
Now I'm directly in front of the mic
with my lip is touching the grill and a,

624
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,400
you hear what it sounds like.

625
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,780
Now I'm going to come out about three
inches on three inches authentic on axis,

626
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,080
three inches off axis. When you go other
side, three inches off actions. No,

627
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:19,660
that's six inches off
at six inches on axis,

628
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:24,910
six inches off axis. I'm out to about
10 inches off as I back off of the mic.

629
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,010
Jesus Christ. Do you
think Mike, the Mike Guy,

630
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:35,210
do you think that sits in a chair with
his legs spread open and boxer shorts and

631
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:39,000
farts in front of his wife and son?
Maybe into microphones.

632
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,380
We've got to find out which microphone
is the best to pick up farts,

633
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,280
which is the best part. Like,
Hey, this is a call to Rick.

634
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:50,400
The Mica is the best part.
Mike,

635
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,700
if we wanted to set up a couple of Fart,
Mike's in our studio,

636
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,480
should we get a cardioid mic?

637
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,870
Something with Variable d please,
please let us know.

638
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,490
And very important. Can you make a video?
Can someone email him that question?

639
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,100
So it's in his inbox,
which is the best fart Mike,

640
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,490
he's um, he's a good guy. This guy,
I think he's a nice guy. Oh yeah,

641
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,490
yeah, definitely a good person. Yup.
Probably nice to his wife. Probably does.

642
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,383
What is your thing?

643
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,090
Nice isn't push farts out and
smile at her or stuff like that.

644
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,040
You did give me a lot of head scratches
last night. I'm very thankful for us,

645
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:37,800
so thank you for that.
We in our household,

646
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,940
I make Tom buy me things for eating
dog food and memory bought me the ring,

647
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,510
but I also,
my other currency is head scratches.

648
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,510
Every time I ask for something you go,
how many head scratches am I going to get?

649
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,680
But you did. You should be more
thankful. All you tell me you go,

650
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,940
I woke up today and there was
a lot of knots in my hair.

651
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:59,370
Why don't you go like extra tank? You, I
love you. I did. I did. No, you're like,

652
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,530
good job, good job. But you get one a day.

653
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:07,140
That's how it goes in this house. That
was one good job a day. That's true.

654
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,570
You can't just keep giving him out
and increasing your self esteem. Yeah,

655
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,280
that's true. Good job. Good job.

656
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,730
My Dad and his brother
came over for Christmas on
Christmas Eve and what did you

657
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:26,250
think? Did you have fun? I enjoyed them
actually. I really had a good time.

658
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,220
I really respect.
I think I told you this,

659
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:34,221
that what your uncle went to learn a
language and went to learn Spanish and he

660
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:38,970
went, he did the program where you live
with a family and he's like 70 years old.

661
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:42,060
How cool is that? Actually, when he was
telling me about it, I was like, man,

662
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:47,061
I hope when I'm 70 I have that sense
of adventure and you know what the best

663
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:51,570
part is is that as my uncle was telling
us about his experience in Nicaragua,

664
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,660
my father's eyes couldn't roll far enough
back into his head. It was so funny.

665
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,100
Really funny to him. My Dad's just like,
come on man, this is fucking bullshit.

666
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,740
Your, your, your uncle
was sitting in the kitchen

667
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:10,350
obstructing the walkway and Jack was get
the fuck out of the way when he shoved

668
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:14,700
the chair. I know my dad wore
his Christmas track suit.

669
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,830
It was a Ferrari tracksuit and he
made no Kelly for the chicken Paprika.

670
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:20,550
I should just really nice then to do,

671
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,340
you posted a photo of him
so he only side of his head.

672
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,150
I should post a better one of
him. I will eventually. Uh,

673
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,010
but it's crazy to watch my,
my dad

674
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,390
and my uncle now as, as a four year old
woman with a kid and you're like, oh,

675
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:38,770
I fucking grew up with that. Like these
guys are, they're just so different world.

676
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:43,210
Right? Like I feel like they didn't have
it. Another universe. Oh, they're animals.

677
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,890
Three animals are savages. Yeah.
My Dad told me, he goes, Oh yeah,

678
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,260
maneuver a Ellis his age.

679
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:55,410
I one time I was cutting films together
and you ate a piece of film and I go,

680
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:59,320
did you call the doctor? He goes,
no, we just waited a little bit.

681
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,310
That's it. Didn't call it
then what? I just shut it out,

682
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:08,120
I guess you're fine. You're fine. Uh,

683
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,260
swallowed fucking cleaning solution.

684
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,230
Oh yeah. Swag it off. Yeah.
Um, I think the, well my,

685
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,980
the highlight of the dinner was that we
got to talk shit about my ex step mom's

686
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:22,660
cooking. That was actually really
fun. And you really liked that part?

687
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,560
Yes. Because I, um, here's
the thing. So you know,

688
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:30,640
when you date somebody from a culture
you hadn't been exposed to before,

689
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,970
you know all your impressions and opinions
about something and become specific

690
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,000
to like what that person teaches
you. Right. When we started dating,

691
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,700
I don't even know if I had met someone
who said they were Hungarian before.

692
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,270
Right. And then, you know,

693
00:48:44,271 --> 00:48:48,190
you introduced me to a Hungarian
traditions and obviously food is like the,

694
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,440
you know, the big part
of a culture. You know,

695
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:52,330
if you start dating a Dominican person,

696
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,230
they're going to cook specific meals
and be like, this is what we eat.

697
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,670
And same thing goes for anywhere, you
know, German, a Peruvian, anything.

698
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,450
So you, the, the big, you know,

699
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:08,230
the flagship meal among Hungarians is,
uh,

700
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:11,120
basically chicken poppy. Gosh,
that's, that's, you know, that's,

701
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,130
that's the signature dish. Yeah.
Yeah. But I was only exposed to your,

702
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:18,760
it's now I love yours.
I always laugh,

703
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,170
but I'm saying I didn't know
what to expect. Like it,

704
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,380
it's the only thing I have exposure
to. So when you go like, oh, now we,

705
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,290
the first time we went over to your,
your dad's,

706
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,650
when he was with your stepmom and you go,
she's making shipping public hush.

707
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:37,330
And I was like, Oh shit. Yeah. Because
it, not only did I go do I love this dish.

708
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,960
Yeah. But now I'm, I'm going to eat it
from an off the boat hunger. Right. She's,

709
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:42,080
she's from the old country.
Yeah.

710
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:45,790
It's going to be like him over 20 or 30
or something. Right? Yeah. So I was like,

711
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:48,510
this is going to be off
the charts. Yeah. It was

712
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,440
dog shit, dog sharable. I hated
her food. I hate those hook land.

713
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:55,470
Terrible. That whole dinner
was terrible. Terrible.

714
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,640
And there's no flavor in any of the stuff.
She had no flavor,

715
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:00,780
no love in her food,

716
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,760
just like, but the alarming thing to
me was that even that they're split.

717
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,650
See sometimes you know, people divorce.
So they split up and then they go.

718
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,550
And how about the fuckers cooking?
Yeah, I had to live with that.

719
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,580
We're having chicken poppy.
Gosh. And your dad goes,

720
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,650
you know who's a cause you were
talking about your grandmother. Yeah.

721
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,010
When you're like, you made a
good one. Yeah. And he was right.

722
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,630
He was saying he didn't care for it,

723
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,890
which is crazy because my Nana
is, was the vest my, she was an e,

724
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,690
like a terrible human. Yeah. But her
food was really good. Sure. But anyways,

725
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,980
that comes about. He hates his
mother's, you love, you love it.

726
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,300
And then he goes, I'll tell you who's
was good. Yeah. Is x disgusting.

727
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,390
And I couldn't because it was one of the
things that I've held onto for like 10

728
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:50,540
years was, you know, I
mean, I told you obviously,

729
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,470
but I felt comfortable because they've
been divorced for a while now. I go,

730
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,790
I got to tell you I didn't like that.
And he was like, really? I was like, no,

731
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,300
I didn't like is it feel liberating to
talk shit about the former step parent?

732
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:05,691
Oh my God.

733
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:10,691
I hated her food because I was to
the point where it stood out to me.

734
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:15,090
How bad it can. I tell you other
shit that she messed up like some,

735
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,260
I'm not saying all her stuff
was bad. There's some dishes
she was really good at,

736
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,320
but her stuffing dude,
she used to,

737
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,750
you know like the bag entered
so that they give you,

738
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,270
I know some people put
them in there stuffing,

739
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:30,620
but hers were like hardened giblets so
it was like you'd be eating like awesome

740
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:35,180
stuffing and then they'd be like hardened,
I don't know, appendix or whatever.

741
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,360
Acute like a cooking type.

742
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,080
No shame.
Like no loving,

743
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,430
nurturing now. Damn. It
felt good to tell him,

744
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,470
oh my God.
I also wanted to go like,

745
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:51,650
why are you acting like that was
good because his is terrible too.

746
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:55,880
So my dad's so chicken public, gosh,
it's just pepper, Paprika, onion, garlic.

747
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,280
It's red chicken dude.
It's not, it's a steal.

748
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:02,630
It's a stew and all he does
is put the chicken in there,

749
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,030
some garlic and then Paprika.
Right public on there.

750
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,470
And then it's just oil and
then it just looks, it's oily,

751
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,490
greasy cause the chicken juice and
that's it. No, it's disgusting. Yeah.

752
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,170
It's just Greece. Yours is the
dog's minds to vest. You know why?

753
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,760
Cause I got it from uh, this girl
woman named Mcgee. M. E. G. D.

754
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:27,260
I think she's on the Internet.
And you guys can Google Mug these recipes.

755
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,740
I have a book that she gave me years ago,
but I know she puts out line pasta.

756
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,960
Yeah. Cause the, no, Kelly's
hard to make all my dad did
that. Dumplings. Yeah. Good.

757
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,800
Yeah, I like that too. That's my death
row meal. I could eat that every day.

758
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:44,210
Oh yeah. And Sour cream. Sour
cream on everything. Fuck man.

759
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,020
She could share. That's one of those
meals to wear. So if you've never had it,

760
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,710
you know, somebody who just is, you're
like, what is all that? What is going on?

761
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,220
It's a lot first bite. It's cause it's
poor people food. It's poor people.

762
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,850
And that's where people, Hungarian stuff
is poor people. Stuff like [inaudible].

763
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:00,890
It's all,
it's all stu

764
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,210
is the same as me. Like NASA. Mila Nasssa,
right. Which my father loves stammered.

765
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:13,050
A fried piece of beef. Beaner Schnitzel.
Same thing. All the cultures fry.

766
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,760
I think they fry the, it's the bad
bits so that you can eat the bad bits.

767
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:21,420
Taller fly. Same with stews. You can
put anything in a stew and you know,

768
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:25,960
we'll eat it kind of thing.
I'm theorizing, I know
you have these blue jeans.

769
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,920
Uh, can I get, um, uh, number four
as a medium meal with peach sprite.

770
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,050
Ooh. Peach spray a note. That'll be
it. Okay, great. That a medium meal.

771
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,130
Yeah. Right. Thanks. Lot.

772
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,680
That's Anthony Fontez

773
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,380
says here,
how can I help you?

774
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,240
They didn't want me. Can
I get a plane with a,

775
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,200
um, let's see. We'll make
that a large with a, a sprite.

776
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,183
Anything else?

777
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,340
Okay. Was there anything else?
Yeah, I could also get, um,

778
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,560
you guys want to to to uh,

779
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,620
get it to 10 piece chicken mcnuggets I
think he's smiling through it. I love it.

780
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,730
Um, honey, honey mustard. Yeah.

781
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,920
And could also get a large French
fries on the side with that.

782
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,800
And I immediately put shake.
Wow.

783
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,840
It's a lot of food. You know, fucking
Tom died on his birthday. No, Geez.

784
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,130
No Shit. This bride's not quick on the
draw. Yeah, no shit answer already.

785
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Two
10 pieces. That's correct.

786
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,040
I love nuggets too. All right, thanks.

787
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,340
James
said,

788
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,650
what's your, I don't think there is an
entree. I don't like it. Mcdonald's. Yeah,

789
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,630
Mcdonald's is killer. I maybe I've
never had the chicken sandwich,

790
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:03,250
but you like that. Well, which
one though? The mic. Chicken.

791
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:03,821
Well,

792
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:07,570
when the grilled one and then Halan and
I used to have that when I was actually,

793
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,680
you know, going there, I'm talking like
15 years ago and try and eat healthy.

794
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:16,030
Get a grilled piece of chicken at you.
Tell them nothing on it, but mustard.

795
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:18,780
So you know that they're making
it specific to you. Oh, smart.

796
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,870
Or let us know two minute.

797
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,100
And then I would just basically take the
bun off and eat a piece of check. Wow.

798
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,870
But that's a, that's that's a, uh,

799
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,470
a move to make when you have no
options. In other words, you're like,

800
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:35,510
I'm starving or there's nothing
around here are the to right late.

801
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,280
That's how I would go there. They
have birth and salads now? Yeah,

802
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,210
their fried chicken sandwich. You
don't need the, the one that mattered.

803
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,130
That's what I'm thinking. I'll
eat the fuck out of that. Um,

804
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,610
now the chicken that's on
their chicken sandwiches,

805
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:52,190
is it the same chicken that's in the
nuggets? Like the poster mash shade.

806
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,640
Chicken nuggets. Oh, all of it. I mean,

807
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,270
one guy that worked at a fast food place
told me never get anything but beef.

808
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,640
Really? He said that beef the, he's like,

809
00:56:00,641 --> 00:56:05,260
if you saw where we're getting half
the stuff, Ronnie goes at least beef,

810
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:10,150
you know, he, he said it was better to
get beef. Now when are you going to eat?

811
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:10,870
When you,

812
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,820
hi, what can I get for Ya? Hi Mommy.

813
00:56:12,821 --> 00:56:16,150
I'll do venti iced coffee
with milk and sugar

814
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,240
and a Venti Mocha. Anything
else? Nope, that's it. Eight 51.

815
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,373
Okay. Thanks. Jeans.

816
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,790
CNA. They never say
anything. Never say anything.

817
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,630
It's the perfect crime or like the uh,
the lady earlier. Who are you guys?

818
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,490
Thanks Jeannie. She's like,
you're welcome. Thank yeah.

819
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,300
Well I think number one, the guy was
like, Hey Jean, he heard Jean was my name.

820
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,420
Yeah. Did you kept calling
me jeans? It's hilarious.

821
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:48,730
So what are you going
to eat after the Diet?

822
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:52,390
Let's talk about it for people that
don't know, you know, the Bert, um,

823
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:57,510
burnt Chrysler and I are in a weight loss
contest and it's all about who weighs

824
00:56:57,551 --> 00:57:02,551
less essentially January 2nd and third
is we're going to call it because the way

825
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,200
it first, yeah, the first I fly
back, I mean we could still win,

826
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,090
but it's essentially going to
be about January 2nd and third.

827
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:14,560
And the reason we're doing back to back
stuff like that is so that like if you

828
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:18,360
did a big weight cut on the second, you
know, you'd have to continue it for them.

829
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:21,130
You have to do a two day wait.
Cut. Yes. What you're saying,

830
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,470
you'd have to dehydrate yourself.

831
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:27,220
So actually like I think on the first
we'll probably call in our ways like, hey,

832
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:29,320
you know,
maybe stand on the weight on the scale,

833
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:34,180
take a take a picture and then you know,
we go,

834
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:37,210
okay, so now, now you know that you
have to do with it for two more days.

835
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:38,044
You have to weigh in.

836
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,260
Well I was top dog.
I'll take them off.

837
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,180
Hey Buddy.
Hey Dad,

838
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:46,883
how you doing?

839
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,590
Good. Um, I am in the middle of
something. What are you doing?

840
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:57,280
45 minute power walk. I mean

Um, I brought my can go ahead.

842
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,440
Did you take a big Christmas
ship by any chance?

843
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,060
No, but I had one today at the
mall and I texted you about it.

844
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,980
Oh that's right.

stall is like flying first class.

846
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,380
Oh yeah. You have all the room
you want. You got shrunk shank.

847
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,310
Hm. Um, dry are there, you know,

848
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:30,870
you don't have to worry about being your
elbows tight cause you got room on both

849
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:32,770
sides. Yeah. You know,

850
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,900
and so I try to use it
is like flying first.

851
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,110
She hasn't like first class,
right?

852
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,240
Yeah. It's like shitting
and yeah. It's nice.

853
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,490
Yeah. And I went in there
and had a real, my real big,

854
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:48,760
but it's just nice.
Slide four. Okay. Yeah.

855
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,720
Bristol,
Bristol school stool scale for

856
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,580
yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. It just, you know,

857
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,230
and basically it was,
you know,

858
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,760
I went for whites before
you went three wide.

859
00:59:02,761 --> 00:59:07,200
There was a little bit on the
fourth white. Yeah. And good to go.

860
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,910
It's got to get the toilet.
Yeah.

861
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,830
Yeah. You got to get that washlet you
know what it to clean your asshole.

862
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,060
Yeah. Yeah. But it was a, yeah, I was,

863
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,840
but I tell you that I bought
my calorie look today. Yeah.

864
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:24,380
It's got calories for every
food and every restaurant item.

865
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,830
That's awesome. Oh Hey, I wanted to
tell you a, I got a joke for you.

866
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,380
What,

867
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,050
what did the policeman say to his stomach?

868
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,613
I don't know.

869
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,070
You're under a vest.

870
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,710
You know what's funny? My Day Joe, just
how horrible it is. Okay. That's fine.

871
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:52,900
Yeah, I'm on the phone
baby. Okay. All right.

872
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,140
Um, what did I gotta call you
back? Okay. Okay Buddy. Let her,

873
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,430
you have a meeting to go to.

874
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,280
It's yelling your mom.
So he's starting to get fitness too.

875
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:09,350
Yeah. Well I've been a, I inspired
him. He said when, when I saw him. Um,

876
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,990
so dogs are really going on. What I know
they're playing. What's your first meal?

877
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,631
That's what I'm saying though,

878
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:18,560
to tell people we're doing this big
weight loss thing and I haven't fucked

879
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:23,540
around in a while now. Like I haven't
had many cheat meals or snacks.

880
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,540
I mean, yeah. Even when you had
those treats out on Christmas Eve,

881
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:28,850
but you gotta try, I didn't
even try it. He didn't try it.

882
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:32,030
So I haven't had sugar starch.

883
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:37,160
Any like real carbohydrates? No. Yeah, I
get carbs from vegetables, but that's it.

884
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,330
And um, no, I haven't had desserts.
No treats, you know, none.

885
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,300
I tell you, I think the thing,
it's not hard to like, like,

886
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,820
cause once you're focused
on it you're like, yeah,

887
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:47,920
I'm not having them that in that,

888
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:52,030
I think what I really want
to have is a waffle waffle.

889
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:57,620
What do you get on the waffle? I'm
kind of a purist, you know, I like,

890
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,400
I like a Belgian wall. Like
a thicker, yeah, me too. I
like real maple syrup. Yeah.

891
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,160
No, I like aunt Jemima. Fake. I like it
to be, have a little bit of crunch to it.

892
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,450
Yeah. What I mean like, like a little
bit, not burnt, but a little crunch.

893
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,870
Um, and I'll, I'll even
do something where like,

894
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:19,850
I'll double up or I'll do the syrup and
whipped cream. Oh, I like it like that.

895
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,220
It's like a fucking cake. No fruit, no
chocolate. I mean, I'll do that too.

896
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:30,110
I'm not a, I'm not the biggest fan
of fruit on, on pancakes and waffles.

897
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:32,450
Right. You know, some people
would think that's the big treat.

898
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:36,470
To me it's not that appealing. Well,
because fruit is like, it's good food.

899
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,050
Well it's also, you're,
you're wanting to be bad.

900
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,690
I think it kind of takes away from
the taste that that you're going for.

901
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,790
In other words,
I want the waffle syrup taste.

902
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:51,920
The fruit then detracts
from it. It doesn't really,
it's not the thrill for me.

903
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,440
Now I know I brought this up to you
probably a million times in the last 10

904
01:01:55,441 --> 01:02:00,280
years, but we got to go to Belgium.
Belgium. Yeah. That's spelled the M. Yup.

905
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:04,530
Uh, to get a Belgian waffle. You've
told me this. Yeah. Yeah. You will.

906
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:09,000
I kind of want to fly there just for
this and do it because you will shut your

907
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:12,810
pants. How much better those waffles are
than the American shit you have here.

908
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,750
Yeah. Cause there though, their
waffles are like really thick,

909
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,920
crunchy and you get them on the street
and the streets just smell that wonderful

910
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,340
waffle

911
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,140
smell. No. Oh my God. Go to remind
some other people. Let's see.

912
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,613
MMM.

913
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:31,610
What's going on? The stakes
of the, of the bed. Okay.

914
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,530
If I lose,

915
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,420
I have to take Bertrand to the
Superbowl in Houston on February 5th.

916
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,460
Oh, that's coming up. Yeah. So I
have to buy tickets. Air Superbowl.

917
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,120
It's expensive. Yeah, it's
very expensive to go to. Um,

918
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,340
so that'd be February 5th. And I also,
if I lose, I have to shave my beard,

919
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:59,000
which is such a hassle to hassle.
I mean, I like having a beard,

920
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:02,270
but he just had Allen trim it up.
It's going to be so annoying.

921
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:06,050
It's going to suck if he loses.
I chose,

922
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,000
I want it because it was
about go to a sporting event.

923
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:12,170
I've never seen Barcelona play
soccer and they're like, you know,

924
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:16,220
they're like the 96 Chicago Bulls.
They are superstars.

925
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:21,260
I decided I want to go see Barcelona
play Paris, um, in this like,

926
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:26,030
I think it's the one of the cup
finals or some stage of it. Um,

927
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,340
February 14th, Valentine's Day,
which we don't give a fuck about,

928
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,010
so I'm fine with that.
Thanks jeans. But, um,

929
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,350
that means he has to take me to Paris.
Great.

930
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:40,190
And buy tickets to the game flight.
And so to me,

931
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,100
if he loses his shave his beard too.
Oh my God.

932
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:46,910
So we're going to see just how fat his
face. Yeah. How long has he had that?

933
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,030
He's always had a beard. No, he
had a goatee for a long time. Oh,

934
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,340
remember you don't remember?
Yeah, I do. I do. I do remember.

935
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:59,990
Oh Wow. That's exciting genes.
So you love a football? Yeah.

936
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,590
How exciting. That'll be fun. They
go nuts for soccer over there, man.

937
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,990
Oh right. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
sure, sure. I'm like wait,
did his first special. Yeah.

938
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,330
Yeah.
Well,

939
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,780
Ooh.

940
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,280
Yeah. And then there isn't it. Yeah.

941
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:22,040
I like his beard veteran at the beer
is better than the goatee. Yeah.

942
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,940
They go to you, like you said, just looks
like heroin around an asshole. Yeah.

943
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,900
It makes your lips look
like an asshole. Yeah. Yeah.

944
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:32,750
Plus it cuts in the
most unflattering place.

945
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,240
See how has Chan is not,
yeah,

946
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,800
it creates a double Chin or accentuates
kind of created the double chin,

947
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:44,750
but yeah, I know what you're saying.
I'm trying to be, you know, kind. Yeah.

948
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,840
Well, well Burt, um, wow.

949
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:50,930
You mean you're going to
take him to Paris Shit. Yeah.

950
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:54,080
I'm tagging me to Paris as well.
We're going to hear a lot of,

951
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,250
I know I can't and we should get
Leanne involved in this more.

952
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,720
I need to hear her. Her side. Yeah.
You should try calling your call. Yeah.

953
01:05:02,721 --> 01:05:06,200
Let's see. Let's see how he's doing.
Let's, let's talk to Leanne. Okay.

954
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,930
Set this up real quick. I have
her number. Do you have it?

955
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,290
I might actually have it,
but just give me one second.

956
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,510
Um,
hoof.

957
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,010
I don't think it's even on this phone.

958
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:22,240
On this computer. Let's see.
Oh, it's on the other computer.

959
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,250
I have it right here. What do
you see? What? Just using this,

960
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:32,210
Oh,
here I have her number of uni.

961
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:36,110
I'll send it to share contact.

962
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:40,340
Um, Miss Lean crash.
You may use my name. Uh,

963
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:45,430
what's Burt doing right now is
I'm showering in the backyard.

964
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,380
My Pay Shit. He does, right? He does. He,

965
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:52,430
he hoses himself down in the
backyard after a workout. Oh,

966
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,990
so while you're doing that,

967
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,190
I would like to update the
listeners on a little English thing,

968
01:05:58,191 --> 01:05:59,240
the Internet stuff.

969
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,680
There was a clear last week and I was
perplexed by the [inaudible] in it and

970
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:07,190
that thing because it didn't make logical
sense that they would say, isn't it?

971
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:11,720
And I got a tweet from
someone from Raz. Oh, Raz,

972
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:15,530
Ra's Rac. Uh, hey gene, just
to fill you in. I like that.

973
01:06:15,531 --> 01:06:19,730
I'm gene now just to fill you in,
in it as both a short form of isn't it?

974
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,380
And an alternative. No, I'm saying Gotcha.
So that would make sense in a, in a,

975
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,480
you know what I'm saying? You
know what I'm saying? Yeah. Okay.

976
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:29,530
Very cool in it.

977
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:33,200
And a m that amen and amen.

978
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,240
Okay.

979
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,700
Let's see if we can get a

980
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,870
and to comment on Bertrand's eating.
Oh,

981
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,633
here we go.

982
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:51,970
Okay. I hope she likes me
too. She's probably good.

983
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:55,543
Yeah.

984
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,620
Okay.

985
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,230
Okay.

986
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:01,050
She might pick up for you. She loves
me. This is coming from a Skype.

987
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,230
Oh.
Should I text her?

988
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,003
No.

989
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,633
Shit.

990
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,260
She's not gonna she's not gonna Answer.

991
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,213
Yeah.

992
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:18,190
Your call has been forwarded to an
automatic voice message. Says, oh wow.

993
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:22,640
Do you think we can, uh,
hold on from Skype. Hey,

994
01:07:22,641 --> 01:07:26,390
Tom and I are calling you from Skype.
She's not Leanne so busy.

995
01:07:26,391 --> 01:07:29,690
She's not the type to have her phone
on her all the time. Yeah. She's like,

996
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:33,070
I'm real mom. Well let me know if she,
if she writes back here and minute,

997
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,920
well yeah,
two children,

998
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:39,200
one phone around if a child,

999
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:44,420
if she had one morbidly obese adult
child, if she, if she will actually,

1000
01:07:44,421 --> 01:07:46,820
um, you know. Okay. In the meantime,

1001
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:51,410
I also had an epiphany,
like a big one,

1002
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,420
like you remember for the longest
time I didn't know that. Fage younger.

1003
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,950
Yeah,
that's good one.

1004
01:07:57,951 --> 01:08:02,951
And then five that you can tilt the sweet
part over and put that the fruity bart

1005
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:05,151
on your yoga.

1006
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:07,880
I didn't know that for the longest time
I was scooping out and then putting it

1007
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:09,830
on the yogurt, the Greek yogurt. Yeah.

1008
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:13,630
Then smart and final happened
member where I go, I,

1009
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:17,990
I thought it was like an office store
when it was late. Yeah, you're smart.

1010
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:22,520
But all sales are final. And then
we looked up what it was, wait.

1011
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:26,090
And I had no idea of smart and final is
like a grocery store still doesn't seem

1012
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:29,390
like a good name.
You thought it was corporate,

1013
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:32,870
a corporate board set of a
store that was like, yeah,

1014
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:36,380
you're smart for shopping here,
but all sales are final.

1015
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,860
I thought it was like a final sales place.

1016
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:44,420
It was like essentially consulting their
customers. Right? It's smart and final.

1017
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,580
No,
like it's you're smart to shop here,

1018
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:50,000
but all sales are final because this
is like a close out discount store.

1019
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,253
That's what I thought.

1020
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:56,300
Smart and final one is your last chance
to get this item and then El Torito.

1021
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,090
Yeah,
we were El to,

1022
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,790
we're not what and where they were in
the parking lot and I see El Torito and

1023
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:05,270
then I see the little symbol of
a bull and I put it together.

1024
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:10,470
El Torito is the little bowl.
Toto is,

1025
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:15,710
yeah. Now did you know that or I never
thought of it. I really didn't. I really,

1026
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:19,370
three years I was like, Oh el Torito l
three I thought it meant like El Tortilla.

1027
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:23,870
I thought of a Tortilla for some
reason. Not a tiny bowl. Right.

1028
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:28,160
I mean, sorry. It's a big deal
for me. I guess you are not blown.

1029
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:29,360
Are Real excited about it.

1030
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:34,300
I do remember that you thought it was
like some significant breakthrough,

1031
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:38,690
but you don't think that's crazy that
for 40 years of my adult life I el Torito

1032
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:42,080
just didn't make sense to me really.
It was like a Mexican name. Right.

1033
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,620
And now I get it. I fucking get it.
No, now you get it. No, I get it.

1034
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:46,460
That that's pretty cool.

1035
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:49,050
And actually it was my mind open
for someone that speaks, you know,

1036
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:52,720
pretty good Spanish. I never thought
of El Torito being the little, little,

1037
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,540
little thing. Just like your
roots Chris's. I get bothered.

1038
01:09:56,541 --> 01:10:01,270
You like this is kind of on par
with Chris Ruth's. Chris is Chris.

1039
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,780
Chris.
It's Chris Steakhouse and Ruth bought it.

1040
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:09,130
It's a Ruth's Chris Steak House.
Yeah.

1041
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:17,730
Yeah. Our third son, Carl's Jr.
No, Tom's Ruth's Chris. Tom.

1042
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:22,750
We're not going to name our next son tells
Ruth's Chris third son will be having

1043
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,130
a third song.
Chris,

1044
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:29,510
I can will be Carl's Jr Ellis is going
to feel super left out cause he's not

1045
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:31,790
food themed. Yeah, we'll just be like,

1046
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:35,600
well you know you should have been born
later. No. Can we call him a in and out?

1047
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,500
You want to just call him that?
It's a double entendre.

1048
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,380
That's how he was conceived.

1049
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,290
And I ate an in and out twice a
week when I was pregnant with you.

1050
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:48,080
Love some in and out.
God Damn. Yeah. Well,

1051
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,040
do you love it more than your Western
Bacon Barbecue? I do because it's fresher.

1052
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,580
What? Carl's Jr Western Bacon there.
The meats frozen. It's no good.

1053
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,050
But I do love the onion rings and the
barbecue sauce, the cheese and the bacon.

1054
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:02,420
God Damn, man. I got to talk in a couple
of funny things to play for you. Oh yeah,

1055
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,500
thanks Jean.
And money.

1056
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:09,190
This guy gets convicted of a crime and
then he sings and apology and court shit.

1057
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,130
I'm sure he's totally
sane, right? Oh Shit.

1058
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,590
It looks good.
I'm fucking up already.

1059
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:22,560
Forgot to switch the audio back. Oh
No, it's okay. No, I mean, oh no,

1060
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:26,880
this guy, he's probably not pleasing
the judge. Isn't that a good,

1061
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:32,800
um,
can you reveal Facebook?

1062
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,670
Yeah, dude, he uh,

1063
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:43,010
uh, no. I want to see how I'm sorry,

1064
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,290
father

1065
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:47,130
things
you're not,

1066
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:49,310
try and be stronger.

1067
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:50,210
Okay.

1068
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,160
And this life shows,
but I want you to know

1069
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,840
no,
that close.

1070
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:02,590
Do you think his, his, uh, his
attorney is cringing or just a, well,

1071
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:06,170
I'm trying to figure out
what Satan's doing here and
the suit. Yeah, that's fine.

1072
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:10,790
Can your honor, I'm sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1073
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,320
Voice, right? Yeah, he does

1074
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:14,780
to my mother.
I'm sorry.

1075
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,550
My son.
It's a nice song.

1076
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:23,220
Tell him I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1077
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:27,810
Sorry. Yes, your honor. I'm sorry.

1078
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:30,120
You saw,
you saw you saw him.

1079
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,010
Uh, thank you, your honor.

1080
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:39,220
That's so weird. It's weird, but it was,
it was kind of heartfelt now. I mean,

1081
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,730
it was heartfelt, but I don't know
if the, if he said to the victim,

1082
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:46,990
I don't know if they want to hear a song.
Yeah. It's kind of a weird Kelly. Yeah.

1083
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:52,600
Speaking of choral singing, George
Michael Died. I know. I hate it.

1084
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:55,930
And they gave you that weird thing of
like, oh, his, he had heart failure,

1085
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:00,600
which just means he, he took too many
pills before. Usually it's all guys. Yeah,

1086
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,160
no guys. Yeah, we can't, by the way,

1087
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:07,090
just for people that are under
basically younger than me. Um,

1088
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,870
if you didn't, if you know,
if you're younger than 35,

1089
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:15,400
you probably have no recollection
of how massive this dude.

1090
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:19,780
Wow. I mean, I Miss Sarah was a
stretch where he dominated MTV.

1091
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,730
It was just oh, phases. But I mean,
it wasn't, I was looking today I go,

1092
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,010
I want to look at some of these, you
know, George Michael's songs freedom. Ah,

1093
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,130
it's a good one. Yeah.
Faith. I want your sex.

1094
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,880
I mean those like those songs right there,
each were number one hits.

1095
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,640
Don't forget careless whisker.
Ah, well here's the thing.

1096
01:13:39,641 --> 01:13:44,641
We can't play them because youtube
will take you down for copyright.

1097
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,880
But I was thinking was I could throw
in an earpiece just for some people and

1098
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:54,670
give you, you know what I mean? Some
flavor of it. Well, I mean, I can,

1099
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,030
I can make it so in case
you're not familiar, what
song did you want to saying?

1100
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,800
Well, what do you want to
hear? That's fairly careless
whiskers. Okay, let me see.

1101
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:07,510
Um, I'll pull up the lyrics.
Careless whisper lyrics.

1102
01:14:07,511 --> 01:14:12,450
Here we go. And okay. I put this earpiece

1103
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:16,810
in such a heartfelt memory.
He was so serious. He's never
gonna dance again. Yeah,

1104
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:20,620
it's really good. Guilty
fee. See who. Okay.

1105
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,270
And you have such a good voice. Can I
sing it? Just music, man, man, man, man.

1106
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,050
Right now it's just a keyboard.
Oh, I'm trying to pay tribute.

1107
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:30,820
So if you don't mind
having a little respect,

1108
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,950
go ahead and just have a little respect.
I'm trying.

1109
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,060
It's still music and it's
just kind of building.

1110
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,590
Ah,
so ah,

1111
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:49,210
show is that, it is a really
long buildup for this to start.

1112
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:54,450
We'll sing it right. 32nd
them. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1113
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,380
Uh,
uh,

1114
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,270
uh Huh.

1115
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:15,060
To the right. Mm hmm.

1116
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,640
There's no comfort in the truth,

1117
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:22,803
Huh?

1118
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,390
Okay. Pick a song. You know the words
to, I had the lyrics in front of me.

1119
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,670
That was really good to know.
Okay.

1120
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,410
Do you like it or no? Nope. Okay.
Which one would you like to hear?

1121
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:45,540
Shane Lee does a better job than
you. That's really insulting. Well,

1122
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:50,430
he's the master if you want. I want
your sex, faith, freedom to faith.

1123
01:15:50,431 --> 01:15:55,410
That's a hard one. Okay. It's
fast. It's really fast. Okay,

1124
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:58,740
well I guess it would be
nice, right? Yeah. Let's see.

1125
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,960
Know you don't know the
words to fucking faith. Well,

1126
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:05,460
I'm trying to do you a child

Yeah, of course. Did or
bug. Okay. Just went boom.

1128
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:14,310
And then my farts. Boop, boop. We're
trying to pay tribute if you don't mind.

1129

God gave her farts into my file here.
We good.

1130
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:24,990
God. Little Oregon, little church Oregon
playing right at the beginning of faith.

1131
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:27,210
Everybody knows that.
No,

1132
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:31,890
we're doing this for the people that
don't know that experience right now.

1133
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:34,730
They're going to get the George
Michael Experience through me.

1134
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,950
A guitar and yet the
Acoustic Guitar. No, Oregon.

1135
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,780
Tom, give us the experience.
I'm about to. Okay, here we go.

1136
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:50,690
Ready? Here we go. Shh.
Quiet dance, dance, dance,

1138
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,150
Cause it would be nice
if I could touch it.

1139
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:01,710
I know not everybody has got
a bad luck. You, there you go.

1140
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:05,720
That was nice. We'll
sing the rest twice, kid.

1141
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,270
Mahana ah,
the Games you because I play,

1142
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,990
but uh, you need some time, Huh?

1143
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,770
Stop looking at me like that.
Horrible. You're terrible

1144
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,053
Stan.

1145
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,750
Thank you Tom. That was
wonderful. Thank you. I'm

1146
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:36,500
showing you the door at the floor.
Okay.

1147
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:41,400
And thank you for the retarded version.
By the way. You remember a time,

1148
01:17:41,401 --> 01:17:43,920
I didn't know he was gay when I was right.
I was going to say,

1149
01:17:43,921 --> 01:17:46,680
so wham was a band he came
out with like come out,

1150
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:50,490
but he was in a band called wham.
That was like, that was colossal.

1151
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,680
So the song is wake me up before you go.
Go.

1152
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:56,880
It's a really catchy and in
the video. Yeah, go ahead.

1153
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:01,310
Write me up before you
go. Go. There you go.

1154
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm not planning on go and
so low. Okay. Right. Yeah,

1155
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,610
yeah, that's it. That's it.

1156
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:12,710
So it was him and his band mates and
they were wearing the shortest of shorts

1157
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:18,150
and there was a catwalk on a stage and
they were wearing shorts that said choose

1158
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:18,984
life.

1159
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:22,980
And they were like clapping and they're
short sleeves were rolled up and the

1160
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:27,540
short shorts and they're clapping. And
it was the 80 so people were in the boy.

1161
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:31,930
George was popular too. And everybody's
like, are they gay? Is that gay? They,

1162
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:36,840
we don't know. We don't know. And
then surprise, he's totally game.

1163
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:42,780
Well, even at the height of this
stuff, like I want your sex faith.

1164
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:46,620
That's when he was a member of the
tight jeans and the left. Yeah. Yeah.

1165
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,710
And he had the real,
the [inaudible].

1166
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,120
And I still remember women would lose
their mind. I had a crush on him.

1167
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:58,880
My sister and Maria and her friends
thought saw Ha's Sysa sets up by a lot.

1168
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:02,910
He was super high. And I was like, oh,
that's what like, because in my mind,

1169
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,280
you know,
at that age,

1170
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:10,140
my only idea of gay had to
be a super feminine like

1171
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:15,780
that. So I couldn't comprehend.
Yeah, I think most of us,

1172
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,480
not that I couldn't comprehend, it didn't
occur to me. I was like, Oh that guy.

1173
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:22,200
But I think that's why we were so like
a merit. We were so under there, we,

1174
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:26,310
he was so under the radar with us because
we thought of gay dudes like Liberace

1175
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:31,020
was gay, exact, not George because George
Michael, the women loved him. They loved,

1176
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:35,010
we all loved him. And so, and then his
HBO had all the naked models. Oh my God,

1177
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:38,190
that was the best one. They
all said later like, Oh yeah,

1178
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:40,430
of course we all knew him.
We all knew. You know,

1179
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,460
it's so funny cause back then
being gay was such a big deal.

1180
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:49,020
Even when Liberace died,
he died of AIDS and right.

1181
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,470
The couldn't even really say it. They
didn't want to say it. So sad by the way.

1182
01:19:52,471 --> 01:19:55,440
And I mean this sincerely. Rest in
peace, George. My ground. It's very,

1183
01:19:55,441 --> 01:19:59,850
it's very sad. He's 53
years old. So young. God,

1184
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:04,290
that's just fucking suck.
We don't have many of our legends left.

1185
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:07,980
I think we have Madonna.
Yeah, we have, uh,

1186
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,000
is is uh, Boy George still alive?
He is right. Yeah. As far as I know.

1187
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,420
Um,
so this is apparently the United way.

1188
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,700
Do you remember Frankie goes to
Hollywood, relax, don't do it.

1189
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:24,810
We didn't know he was gay
either. Yeah. You want to come.

1190
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,380
He got away with saying
that and it is Lou. Yeah.

1191
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:32,760
What you don't want to come because it
used to be every fucking dad would play

1192
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,360
that. Yeah. In the car. I'd be like,

1193
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:39,380
well my dad and I let know Bob is Bob
his head and then all of a sudden someone

1194
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:42,900
just tells you, Oh, do you know
what this song's about? I Dunno.

1195
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,080
It was just real quick cause it's so good.
That's the thing about catchy. Catchy.

1196
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:47,360
We'll lose you.
Yeah.

1197
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,660
He made a hit song about busing
nuts not busting that right? Yeah.

1198
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:55,990
I mean I bet most so Chris, you
know, Middle America was like,

1199
01:20:56,030 --> 01:21:00,590
oh it was such a cadre. So relax, don't
do it. It was a great song. And you get,

1200
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,730
wait when you want to
stock to it or whatever.

1201
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:07,440
Why do you want to come?
And he's all,

1202
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:12,590
and at the end he's all ah
Hah, I need you Shira. Him,

1203
01:21:12,591 --> 01:21:15,720
he fucking big ox at the end of the
time. Sure. That was a little girl.

1204
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:20,340
Leah loved the song, the song. So
those dudes were totally gay too. Yeah.

1205
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:24,540
There were just like the case
and are like,

1206
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:27,630
would you ever want to marry your mom?
So I was like,

1207
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,920
really good county.
When did you marry your dad?

1208
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:41,630
Oh, never easy. Um, it's something that,
you know, as a team you just gotta Kinda,

1209
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:45,140
you know, I guess you want to
take a breath and uh, you know,

1210
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:51,260
refocus and, you know, look
back to what made us, you know,

1211
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,790
when those games

1212
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:58,240
we're just going through, your nose is
glass and he had some dip in his lip.

1213
01:21:58,241 --> 01:22:01,820
He sure did. I used to ride her dip like
that. Can't see you doing that. Yeah,

1214
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,380
I did. I don't like that. Really.

1215
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:07,810
Yeah. Stay on the same level and,
you know, get back to, you know,

1216
01:22:07,811 --> 01:22:09,670
the simple things that,
you know, made us win.

1217
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,190
Okay.

1218
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:15,160
Well I guess I haven't really paid
attention, I guess enough. But you know,

1219
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:18,160
you always say like, you know, it's
a score on the road and, you know,

1220
01:22:18,161 --> 01:22:21,670
keep it simple and, you know, we should
be doing that at home too. It's, uh,

1221
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,800
you know,
yeah.

1222
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,970
Yeah.

1223
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:27,570
I think it's just, you know, just for the
whole team, it's just, you know, another,

1224
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:32,670
another guy that you know, brings,
you know, leadership and you know,

1225
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:36,060
everything that she feels, you
know, on the ice. He's a, you know,

1226
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:40,200
one of the hardest working guys. You
know, a good center man. For us that's a,

1227
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:44,580
it means a lot. And just, you
know, in every aspect of the room.

1228
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:49,260
Yeah. So what's this
professional microphone? Oh,

1229
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:51,960
a lot of journalists do that just drive.
Yeah.

1230
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:55,750
Well they're not playing on the air it
so that they can right there. Oh, oh, oh,

1231
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:00,930
I'm there Brad. And you always made
the very important distinction many,

1232
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:04,170
many years ago. Thank
you. That, uh, you know,

1233
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:07,000
and you know what I'm saying are
very different. Totally different.

1234
01:23:07,001 --> 01:23:11,500
You would agree that as far as you knows,
this guy's killing it, killing, you know,

1235
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:15,820
game. I haven't counted them,
but it's a lot. Let's see if we,

1236
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:21,060
no, you know, you know, you
know, you know, you know, like,
you know, New York, you know,

1237
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:25,690
you know, you know, you know, you don't,
you don't see, you know, you know,

1238
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:28,370
you know, you know, you
know, and just, you know,

1239
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,090
I would say it's about 20. Yeah.
Yeah. It's a lot of, you know,

1240
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:36,800
Sandy Canadian submission gets
extra points. Dustin, what is it by,

1241
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:40,760
by Fugley I said his name. I don't
know. I played for the jets. Winnipeg,

1242
01:23:40,761 --> 01:23:44,720
the great city of Winnipeg. Um, yeah,

1243
01:23:44,721 --> 01:23:49,370
we don't get a lot of canal. This might
be the first, you know, but you know,

1244
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,800
uh, as far as you know, counters go, I
feel like this guy is near the top. Yeah,

1245
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:58,280
yeah. He's in the, in the, you know, game.
He's at the top of his game, you know.

1246
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,470
I know, I know, I know.

1247
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:06,840
Then there's that one that was the
only, cause, you know, you know,

1248
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:07,660
you know,

1249
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:11,560
you know, it doesn't look very nice.
Um, yeah, I know what you're saying.

1250
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,440
You know what I'm saying? I know what
you're saying. You feel me? Don't,

1251
01:24:13,441 --> 01:24:15,100
I'm talking about,
you know what I'm saying,

1252
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,740
that who was the guy that did the triple,
you know what I'm saying? If you don't,

1253
01:24:17,741 --> 01:24:21,890
you're only talking about
the trip was saying that.

1254

don't have my fucking board set up, but

1375
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:15,610
apparently there's a really
crazy vocal fry in a commercial.

1376
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:19,750
It's everywhere.
I'm Maureen Petrosky entertaining expert.

1377
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,650
Wow.
It's terrible.

1378
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,170
She is a entertaining expert,

1379
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,840
entertaining expert. Listen to that. You
guys know what we're looking for, right?

1380
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:38,060
Vocal fry is when you do that,
it's actually forced you,

1381
01:32:38,061 --> 01:32:39,370
you don't do it naturally,

1382
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,370
but some people get so
accustomed to talking like
that, that they, um, you know,

1383
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:49,380
they talk like it all the time and it's
prevalent amongst younger women to sound

1384
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:52,230
smarter.
Like some of the Kardashians.

1385
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,300
I'm Maureen Petrosky,
I'm entertaining, expert

1386
01:32:57,350 --> 01:33:02,150
bearable. It's insecure sounding cause
you're not projecting. And she goes,

1387
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:05,200
she also did that,
that

1388
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:10,710
Bob's are perfect for cooking outdoors
over the grill or an open fire.

1389
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,660
How I is extended by fire.
She said fire.

1390
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:17,840
Yeah.

1391
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,340
And it's up talk at the end if
there's fire or an open fire

1392
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:26,690
cooking outdoors grill or an open fire.

1393
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:31,340
One way to combine dessert and cocktails
is to add a shot of whiskey to your hot

1394
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,500
cocoa and hot cargo God
or vocal fry is terrible

1395
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,040
shot of whisky cookout.

1396
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:44,630
You sound really dumb when you talk
about toasted marshmallows and Graham

1397
01:33:44,631 --> 01:33:49,260
cracker crumbs thing to a night
around a fire line and grom caulker

1398
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,620
grom monchago crime.

1399
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,410
And you have a sweet ending to a night
around the Graham cracker crumbs and you

1400
01:34:03,411 --> 01:34:07,100
have a sweet tooth at night around a fire.
Uh,

1401
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:13,500
hi. So prevalent. It's really,

1402
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,320
you know what you've been
making me laugh by hi. Yeah.

1403
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,480
Around the house so much is when you're,
when you curse at Bitsy,

1404
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:26,030
cause you really get mad at her.

1405
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,830
You're like Bitsy,
you asshole.

1406
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,740
Well, if she's, look, she's adorable.
She's the sweetest dog. Fuck off,

1407
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:39,990
but he's so dumb.

1408
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:44,760
She's the dumbest dog I've
ever been around and literally
I'm holding our son or

1409
01:34:44,761 --> 01:34:47,650
I'm carrying a box and I dunno.

1410
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:52,570
Most every dog I've ever
had or been around like sees
you. And they go like, oh,

1411
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:54,510
I'll go here.
She does the exact opposite.

1412
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:58,020
She sees you and then steps in front
of you in front of your feet. Slip on

1413
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:02,120
her. I step on her. I'm always
like, what the fuck are you
doing? And she's like, ah,

1414
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:07,600
it's unnerving. And whenever the
kid drops any morsel of food,

1415
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:12,140
anything Fitzy chews it up.
Immediate doesn't choose feathers,

1416
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:16,970
plastic rocks, glass Christmas tree
tree, and she barfed it right up.

1417
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:21,480
I'm sure that's not good
for dogs on real late plan.

1418
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:27,440
Okay,
you're more for Kit Kat.

1419
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:29,930
Can I hear it again though?

1420
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,500
I'm entertaining expert.
Oh my God.

1421
01:35:34,501 --> 01:35:37,860
These are perfect for cooking outdoors
over the griller and open fire.

1422
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:42,660
A fun way to combine dessert and cocktails
is to add a shot of whiskey to your

1423
01:35:42,661 --> 01:35:43,494
hot cookout.

1424
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,930
Top it off with some toasted marshmallows
and Graham cracker crumbs and you have

1425
01:35:48,931 --> 01:35:50,730
a sweet ending to a night or on fire

1426
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,790
of how many calories is. I would think
that a director would just be like,

1427
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,470
you need to stop talking like that

1428
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,390
when we were going to shoot this
whole thing again, stop going by air.

1429
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,240
Sound like an idiot. Yeah, you did

1430
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:08,370
a really nice treat for your open
fire would be to talk like a person.

1431
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,020
Just project. Cause what you're, you're,

1432
01:36:10,021 --> 01:36:14,550
you're like intentional and kind of going
down. You're right. It's intentional.

1433
01:36:14,551 --> 01:36:18,870
It's lazy speed. Cause you're like,
uh, it's like you just woke up.

1434
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,330
I'm just getting up man.
So Lazy.

1435
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:29,630
So Lazy. Stop talking like
that. You asshole. Oh there's
more, there is more. Yes.

1436
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:30,843
Yeah.

1437
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:33,830
Yeah. Don't have to stress
out with last minute guest.

1438
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,570
Just look and see what you have and work.

1439
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,670
No Shit.
And the device

1440
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:40,680
for me,
I'm serving a Jack Daniel's single barrel.

1441
01:36:40,681 --> 01:36:45,600
Select the barrel proof and also the Rye.
So there's something for every taste.

1442
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,613
The batter,

1443
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,350
the ride. You do hear that. The Barrow,
it was ridiculous. She's a bad though.

1444
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:57,010
You know what, I think it might be
okay, here's a theory because she

1445
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:00,480
appetizers can be as easy as assembling
some things from your pantry.

1446
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,670
It looks fancy but it's so easy

1447
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:06,010
cause she's,
she's actually talking really soft.

1448
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,570
Maybe cause that's an ADR. Meaning
she had to go and record a voiceover.

1449
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:15,580
Maybe she's not used to being on a
microphone and hearing yours cause it is

1450
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:20,110
louder than normal. So maybe it's
just like being Tim and work with it.

1451
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:23,470
Oh our
pantry

1452
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,263
pantry.

1453
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,130
That's bad.
The really strong,

1454
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:36,520
the barrows way play the beginning of it.

1455
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,400
She got the Barrow and the Ry.

1456
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,050
You don't have to stress out with last
minute guest just and look and see what

1457
01:37:43,051 --> 01:37:44,310
you have and work with it.

1458
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,370
Oh stupid advice.

1459
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:49,350
No Shit.
I'm serving a Jack Daniel's single barrel.

1460
01:37:49,351 --> 01:37:52,500
Select the barrel proof and also the Rye.

1461
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,360
So there's something high taste

1462
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,040
a horrible.

1463
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:01,390
So we got oh funny
youtube comment ready I,

1464
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,640
one of our videos about Steven
Seagal. Oh yeah. So they sent us this.

1465
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:09,210
Who are these about us? Who are
these two ass clowns? Exactly.

1466
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:13,890
They are playing the video of an
interview conducted by someone else and

1467
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:17,190
interview, neither of them could
ever hope to conduct themselves,

1468
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:22,710
even if they somehow did both would
sit there silent as the grave,

1469
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,110
as Steven Seagal towered over them,

1470
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:29,670
reverberating the same answer as
he did the real interviewer. Why?

1471
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:35,120
Because he is Steven Seagal and they
are a couple of nobodies who hosted a no

1472
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:39,840
name talentless radio show that features
talking about other people who have

1473
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:43,950
accomplished, seen and done more
than they could ever hope to do.

1474
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:48,990
The entire premise of this
video is ridiculous and I'm
annoyed for even clicking

1475
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:49,800
on it.
Oh,

1476
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,120
Steven Seagal could or could not
be the biggest joke on the planet,

1477
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:58,290
but no matter what plant he is on,
these two are far below him.

1478
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:03,390
It's not even funny. Try
getting a real show Bozos. Wow.

1479
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:08,210
So he's not even really at the end.
It sounds like he's not defending weird,

1480
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,760
but just that we are below Stevens ago,
so he needs to let us know.

1481
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:16,530
Thank you sir for letting us know
and if I have any unexpected gas,

1482
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:21,600
uh,
the Ra in there.

1483
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:25,750
Um, and then the, another comment was
this is about you that big. It's like,

1484
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:29,370
I need to hear that that bitch was to
throw up because the Stevens to Gaul.

1485
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:33,990
I want to throw up at that grime inside
her Coffee Cup. It's a good point.

1486
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,420
There you go, dad. Bitch. Yeah.

1487
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:42,330
Do you talked about uh, Oh, you
talked about Black Santa, right?

1488
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:46,830
Yeah, that's why I know. Oh,
so you're ready. Read that.
Okay. Okay. Um, would you,

1489
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:49,230
do you want to do the, would you
rather they sent, I haven't read that.

1490
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:51,890
I don't approve of it if I haven't
read it. Oh, okay. I won't improve.

1491
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,540
Chris genes is a racist. Yup. Here we go.

1492
01:39:55,830 --> 01:40:00,830
She said cowboys not diarrhea is the
most racist thing mommy see us ever said

1493
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:06,030
when talking about Indians cowboy.
Oh, right. No, no, that's wrong.

1494
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:10,290
I said diarrhea, not cowboy. Right.
So if you're going to quote the joke,

1495
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,680
at least get it correct. That's not what
I said, right. You were saying, yeah,

1496
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,530
it's uh, go ahead and so
wait, where am I racist?

1497
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:21,240
Because that was the way you specify
to which India and you were talking.

1498
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,150
Oh, okay. Thank you for
pointing that out. Yeah.

1499
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:27,000
Maybe I could drank over I

1500
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:33,750
in
the pantry

1501
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:40,140
pantry. Um, so what,

1502
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:43,720
we've got to wrap this up. What
is your thought on the skull? It,

1503
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:48,780
we didn't do our dates. Oh, okay.
Well Shit. Fucking do them now.

A bunch of those are going to sell out.

1524
01:42:08,561 --> 01:42:12,420
We've added a third show in
Boston at the Wilbur. Um,

1529
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:31,710
So you've got to hop on those
tickets. Just check out the
page. Tom, cigarette out,

1530
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,050
Donald Blah Blah. Thompson, grow.com/tour.

1531
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,890
Um,
that's said jeans.

1532
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:43,810
[inaudible] go. [inaudible]
Oh, I didn't address this.

1533
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:48,530
I want to address this. Uh, this is
heartfelt. This really bothered me.

1534
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:54,710
The first round of glass
and shirts that went out,

1535
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:58,220
I thought you were saying we're
in Israel. I was like, I said,

1536
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:01,900
you're gonna tell me something. Put
me on blast. No, call me a racist.

1537
01:43:01,901 --> 01:43:06,740
Like that other person just did the first
round of glass and shirts were below

1538
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:08,480
our standard.

1539
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:14,020
And it upset me greatly because we've
worked really hard to establish a,

1540
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:20,570
um, you know, uh, a consistency where,
you know, when you get a shirt from us,

1541
01:43:20,571 --> 01:43:24,770
that is a certain level.
And so now do I want to apologize.

1542
01:43:24,771 --> 01:43:28,310
The people who got, everybody
that has ordered one now,
it's already been changed.

1543
01:43:28,311 --> 01:43:33,020
It's been upgraded to a better shirt.
We started working with a new company.

1544
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:36,230
They've done a fantastic job.
So I'm not throwing them under the bus.

1545
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:41,500
There was just a miscommunication when
we placed this order because basically

1546
01:43:42,171 --> 01:43:46,790
what happens is you get a design,
you, you know, you email. Yeah, yeah,

1547
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:49,610
yeah. Order this quantity.
Do this, do that.

1548
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:54,230
The previous of shirts had sold out.
They sent me a thing.

1549
01:43:54,231 --> 01:43:56,810
Do you want the same price for this?

1550
01:43:57,110 --> 01:44:01,610
And in that we lost that it
would be a quality difference.

1551
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,580
So it's super bummed me out.
Um,

1552
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:09,440
I want to make it up to people that got
the lower quality shirt and I've been

1553
01:44:09,441 --> 01:44:10,880
trying to figure out a way to do it.

1554
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:16,390
One thing that I thought of
was if you send an email,

1555
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:21,140
um, and maybe I'll set up a new
email address for it, you know,

1556
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:23,450
so it's just for that,
I'll do that.

1557
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:26,600
I'll set up a new email address for the
next episode and I'll tell you what it

1558
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:31,340
is. And if you have one of
those first glass and shirts,

1559
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:36,110
that's a Gildan shirt, um, you're
going to send an email to this address.

1560
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:38,630
It'll just confirm that,
that you were,

1561
01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:43,250
you ordered one and it was sent to you
and then I'm going to send you a small

1562
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:47,990
makeup, a Freebie. Nice. Very good.

1563
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,470
That's what we're going to
do. All right, so again,

1564
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:55,850
a hundred apologies if you've ordered,
you know, if you're ordering now,

1565
01:44:55,851 --> 01:45:00,650
it was restocked at a higher quality
shirt and I apologize and we will make it

1566
01:45:00,651 --> 01:45:05,600
up to you and we won't do anything
like that again. There's that.

1567
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:10,850

1570

jobs.

1572
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,510
I heard her say a word that I know
is distinctly on parliamentary.

1573
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:02,613
Mark.

1574
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:11,690
Nobody wants to talk about pardon?
What is it like,

1575
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,150
you know what I'm saying?

1576
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:30,100
Whoops. Hot, hot,

1577
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,550
sloppy.
