50
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,060
the reason I had to move a few things,
we haven't set it on the show.

51
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,410
I'm doing the odd ball tour.
Oh,

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,910
a lot of great comics on the lineup.
Uh,

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,290
Sebastian Maniscalco I know
a Gaffigan's doing a date.

54
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,590
I think Brian Regan's doing a date.
Uh,

55
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,990
John Oliver's doing one of
the dates and then Malanie um,

56
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,490
a bunch of people are on them.

57
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,230
Even they even created a space
for board Chrysler to come on.

58
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,770
You're kidding. More Chrysler. Yup.

59
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,370
Fattest working comedian and yeah.

60
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,100
How are they going to find a jet for him
to fit on? Oh, no, no, no. Yeah. Yes.

61
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,430
To Dry.

62
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,230
That's why I was only doing it for you
because they can't all link someone local.

63
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,610
Yeah. Yeah. Um, but uh, yeah, Eliza,
a couple. It's a lot of people.

64
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:51,230
So Eliza Schlesinger,

65
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,950
she's doing it and it all starts August
25th in West Palm Beach at the vodka

66
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,800
amphitheater and we go all over man.

67
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,250
Of course I'm only doing short sets.
That's the way this stuff works.

68
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,530
Explain to people. Yeah. The way,

69
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:14,150
the way that this works is that there's
like a big name every night. Um, like a,

70
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:18,410
you know, a bigger comic, big name
comic. I mean some nights, like I said,

71
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,940
it's bigger isn't it? No, it's a,

72
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,680
you know, a bigger ticket drop. So some
nights it's like Sebastian, like I said,

73
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,514
Brian Regan,

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,990
Dane Cook's doing a few go to oddball
and you could check out all the links are

75
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,450
on my site.
So you can see that.

76
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,070
And the way it works is that all the
comics that are kind of not as known,

77
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,050
we do 15 minutes sets,
usually something like that.

78
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,090
And then the big, there's an
intermission, it's a long show.

79
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:51,260
So there's intermission. A guy does
like 30 or 40. They take a break,

80
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,910
you come back the uh,
the rest of us do like the 15 minute sets.

81
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,290
And then, um, then the, the big name,
we'll close out, do a 40 minutes

82
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,370
fun show.
I mean Joey Diaz is doing a few.

83
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,540
Yeah, and we're doing, like I said, West
Palm, Tampa, Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto,

84
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:13,680
Hartford, all over the place.
Man. When that finishes,

85
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:18,510
October 2nd, I go to Charlotte,
North Carolina on the October 14th,

86
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,580
and then I go to man Fran Disco.
And that's more names for that.

87
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:24,540

120
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,640

for what? Oh, it's our baby. Oh my God.

126
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:40,970
I mean, he's in the crate. Right? You left

What were you in for your tonsils? No,

130
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,500
a colonoscopy.

131
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,480
It's quite a farming.

132
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,270
Do you ever, do you have
a game tonight? Yeah.

133

No more in you fast for the entire
day. We do on this pretty soon. Yeah.

anyways. Oh fart like that regularly.

146
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,120
Come on like that all the time. You
sit around and you heard it last night.

147
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,740
Even though I'm a little congested.

148
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,620
You farted a lot and I smelled
it through my whole time.

149
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,190
There wasn't last night, those
daytime? No, it was during the day.

150
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,940
It was after I got off the flight. I had
like some, some pretty Raunchy farts,

151
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,010
but that was like no sleep coffee,
you know?

152
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,890
Okay. That was pretty gross. All right,
so wait, when are you going to do this?

153
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,070
Um, I'm scheduled do it the 16th. I might
not do it anymore. I was thinking about,

154
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,650
I'm sorry. Why? Um, I just don't
think I need to do it. Why?

155
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,660
Because I don't think I have
anything to worry about. Sure.

156
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,310
Okay. I'm serious. No,

157
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:42,670
I know you are. That's, see this is the
problem is you are a serious, but then,

158
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,890
then you shit your brains out
every, every day. Every week. Go to,

159
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,880
I don't shut my brain shit all the time.

160
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,350
You need to get to the bottom of this
Mr. Out of my butthole. Yeah. No,

161
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:58,210
I think you should stick to
it. All right. All right.

162
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,940
Maybe I will. Maybe I will. I
haven't decided yet. I might
cancel. Please tell him.

163
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,870
I think I might cancel.

164
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,180
Nice version.

165
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,460
That's a whole new level of what do
you think she'll do your mom's house

166
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,610
Christmas album.
I really hope she,

167
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,450
she will kill our baby.
We uh,

168
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,640
we would love to have her a part of it.
Like Hitler Baby Danny.

169
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,450
Will you do the Hitler baby for the
your mom's house Christmas album?

170
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,780
It's really cool.
I think she would do it.

171
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,500
I think she might think we have to have
maybe a couple adults signatures on that.

172
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:58,334
A contractor,

173
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,920
a couple of guardians need to sign off on.

174
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,680
Well Danny and a few other voices
in her head to get on board.

175
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,170
Isn't the band you'll
going to shit in the album.

176
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,630
Catchy Hitler

177
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,940
oven tonight

178
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,100
certainly is critical.

179
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,160
The talent's there. It just needs
guidance. You think it's a good producer?

180
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,840
Well, Quincy Jones, her
and Dj dad mouth together.

181
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,170
Oh, check off my Christmas. I
heard the same thing you heard.

182
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,450
Oh my God. Oh, by the way, I
should point out to our listeners.

183
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,640
Um, they can't see me right now. To those
of you that don't know where on Youtube,

184
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:30,650
we are always on youtube. Every
episode. I'm dressed very nicely today.

185
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,000
I walked in the room and then blue van
and you were like, Hey, now you look nice.

186
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:40,890
And then I was like, oh, I'm out of clean
clothes. That's always the way it goes.

187
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:45,300
Right? Like the dirty or your
clothes, the nicer you dress.

188
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,880
There's a lot of layering of posters.
Interesting choices.

189
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,980
That messy right there.
That's what I see. I'm sorry.

190
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,730
It looks like Lionel Messi.
I don't know who that is.

191
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,280
You don't know who the fucking most
famous soccer player in the world.

192
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:02,190
Isn't that okay?
That's what I see.

193
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,530
I see a sweet little argent time.

194
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:08,400
Boy Jonas brother could be,

195
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,370
but I have my eyes on foodborne football.

196
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,760
She's a soccer fan,
I think d well she's an inhaler fan.

197
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,540
Argentina. Hello? We just tied
it all together. It's true.

198
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,490
That's how she discovered.
Interesting.

199
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,670
Can you like football?

200
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,950
I had the song you like
called it for Jesus' birthday.

201
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,780
Are you a massive fan?

202
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,940
Their dire then

203
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,420
maze by it? I really can't. I can't
joke about it yet. I'm still processing.

204
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,940
It's a lot. What I just
saw, it is quite a bit. Um,

205
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,940
he's pretty bold to put himself
farting on the inner webs,

206
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,230
but he was always like that. Right? Like
he always put Ari's asshole and his Dick.

207
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,210
Everybody pulled his dick out.

208
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,390
He did it at the Irvine proud
when they banned him for a while.

209
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:09,060
They just temporarily though.
Just never, I remember I did,

210
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,150
I've told this story before. I,
we're talking like a few years in.

211
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:15,840
I didn't really know. I knew who he was.
It's kind of intimidated by how like,

212
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,700
you know, dark and like his personality
was, you know, he was a Weirdo.

213
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,270
Ari and I was doing some west side show
and one of these little rooms with like

214
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,490
13 people and Mike Black was onstage.

215
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,120
And then Ari walked into the
room as Mike was onstage with a,

216
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,940
is that your phone? No.
No. And he walked to Ari,

217
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,240
walked on stage with his, uh,
with a tee shirt, but no pants,

218
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,710
no underwear. So just naked from
the waist down. Oh, your phone?

219
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,210
I don't think it is. Of course it is
right there. That's not it. It's too,

220
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:57,420
it's too far away. It's not too
far. Mine's normally down here.

221
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,883
I hear it.

222
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,830
It's gone now though. You have
to put it like on the floor. Oh,

223
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:07,160
here's the Ra right here. I texted
him. Shut up. What does he say? I said,

224
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:10,210
how are your results? Because
we didn't get to talk about
the results. He said, um,

225
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,850
you know, they don't know. It doesn't look
like there's anything. Oh, good. Yeah.

226
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,600
Those assholes. Good. Yeah.
Um, great news. Let's see.

227
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,640
Should we try calling him? Yeah. Why not?

228
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,060
Maybe I'll just see if he wants
to talk for a second. Yeah,

229
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,410
I like to hear more about those farts.

230
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,130
I'm going to call you right now.

231
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,780
MMM.

232
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,260
I think our audience needs to know too.
Yeah. And what's your IBS situation?

233
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,470
Mine. Yeah. I currently I'm
in, I'm doing real well.

234
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,190
That's why I don't feel like going.
Interesting. Why do you think that is?

235
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,580
Just eating healthier. That's why
I think it's just like food based.

236
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
You cleaned up your diet is what you're
saying and now you're not browning as

237
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:56,380
much. Yeah. Huh. That's interesting.

238
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,693
I know.

239
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,093
Okay.

240
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,180
How's yours? Because you have
some smelly rounds too, you know,

241
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:08,640
I wouldn't mind doing a wide on
smoothie work lately. A lot of um,

242
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,660
smoothies and that,
that's been helping me cleaning up.

243
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,510
Well it will be out of the
country for sure. I'll be back.

244
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,730
Oh my God. An asshole. He
just called. He just called me

245
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,183
man

246
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,040
friends of the worst.
I know.

247
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh he wrote I'll get off with your mom.

248
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,240
[inaudible] asshole. Okay.

249
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,700
We try it again cause he showed us, he
is so weird about his phone. You know,

250
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,800
he has a flip phone. Right? You know
that about him had, I do know that. Yeah.

251
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,903
Why does need one

252
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,043
great,

253
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,870
hello? Hey. Hello.

254
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,680
Hey, you're on a recorded line. Okay.
Do you remember recording line? Yeah.

255
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,180
You're on a recorded line because we were,

256
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,400
we were just playing clips
of you on our podcast.

257
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,970
We were playing clips of you farting
and I was talking about how um,

258
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,440
hi Ari. There's Christina.
She's a high. Um,

259
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,090
but like can you take us
through the process? A little
bit of a, the colonoscopy?

260
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,930
Yeah. Okay, sure. So do
you get there or not all?

261
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,870
Let's back up. Let's back up. Yeah. The
whole day. But what are you getting here?

262
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,480
August 16th. Unless I cancel.
You're not going to cancer. God,

263
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,590
I'm always careful.

264
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,400
Don't cancel it cause I just don't feel
like I need it anyways. So go ahead.

265
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,750
Tell us about like the prep.

266
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,670
Oh,
okay.

267
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,050
So two days before or more you
got other stuff by rite aid.

268
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,810
You got to pick up this stuff.
Mira lax.

269
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,980
And let me see what else, if I still
have the effect that makes you sure.

270
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't, don't collapse.

271
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,560
And you got up to the double whammy.

272
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:59,500
Going back to one of
those is powerful enough.

273
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,130
So does that give you like PR
like powerful diarrhea or what?

274
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,320
It makes it just turned everything in
your, in your bowels into just water.

275
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,370
Ooh.
No,

276
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,500
didn't take a lot of the beer.
And then you like push it,

277
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,370
you know liquid shit? Yeah.
It's just that all day.

278
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,790
You can't eat anything that
day light you can't eat.

279
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,410
Then the midnight the night before.

280
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:30,920
Okay.

281
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,320
And then no solid foods
the whole day before.

282
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,210
And then he saw the light.
So to this point,

283
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,830
so the light and then
the whole day before,

284
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,790
that's fine with me. Okay.
You're a nibbler. Yeah,

285
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,770
I'm like a fucking bird, so yeah,
that's fine. And then wait, so wait,

286
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:55,280
one more thing. Can I ask you what
prompted you to want to do this?

287
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,210
I didn't ask you why.

288
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,390
Oh well what I shit I bleed a lot.
Oh No.

289
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,670
Is it red blood or dark blood?
Yeah. What color was it? Red Blood.

290
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:10,810
So the doctors haven't bride.
Okay. Getting metamucil button.

291
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,300
Let him do some things
like an old person thing,

292
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,940
but it's not like pools of blood. Right.
Cause this is your last phone call ever.

293
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:16,774
If it is,

294
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,000
it's not pulling the blood.

295
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:23,110
But although when I was in some hotel
somewhere I notice like drops of blood

296
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,170
from the bathroom,
the toilet to the sag.

297
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,910
Oh, all right. That's, that's a scary man.

298
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,260
How, how long has it been that way?
A couple of years. You know, Ari,

299
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,933
Jesus,

300
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,060
you're dropping the drip.
The dress wasn't only like a few months.

301
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,650
So we're doing it. We're
doing biopsies though. Right?

302
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,833
Okay.

303
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
Wait, what book? The biopsy?

304
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,190
Like they're, they're testing like,
uh, you know, um, from within.

305
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,340
You like your tissue tissue.

306
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,490
Yep. What did you want to look at it
when they want to do is just look at it,

307
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:03,740
get a good look,
and then they found one polyp.

308
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:08,300
So we're going to buy off the that.
Okay, look, that didn't look like guy.

309
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,870
We got to do a Kickstarter
already. All right. So, um,

310
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,620
oh dude. Okay. So halfway through the
day, if we split that mix, half a bottle,

311
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:17,240
half that mirror Lex bottle.
Yeah,

312
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,560
like a 400 milligrams until like
two different 32 updater. Right.

313
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm drinking every 30 minutes.

314
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,100
So you start,

315
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:30,910
then 30 minutes later you take another
quarter of it and then 30 minutes later

316
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,370
get another quarter. Yeah, like you're
an hour and that's when you're like,

317
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,140
oh my God,
I hope that

318
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:44,570
square hawala home. But like 30 minutes.

319
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,850
Wow. I meant just opened
up. Just a dam just opened.

320
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,470
So you go in there and you're
completely empty. Right? When you go in,

321
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:54,340
you're totally done.

322
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,340
You can drink liquids they
before so that could come out.

323
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,870
The liquid keeps coming out and keep
dragging away. Any like any retina,

324
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,710
anything have left in your,
in your bile.

325
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,970
Keep shedding and shedding
and shedding and shedding.

326
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,040
So why were you so much? That's
after the colonoscopy though. Why?

327
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,740
I don't understand. Because there's
air being pumped into you. Oh, I see.

328
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Rdo, they, Greg, you go into a
hospital gown and then they, they,

329
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,870
they put you in the room,
they turn you over on their
side, they give you the, the,

330
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:30,100
they put you out through your wrist
or something at the back of your hand.

331
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,830
I'm happy to, she called it when
they put you out, they put you out.

332
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,380
Yeah, they should. You don't want to
be in the one would be there for it.

333
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,040
So yeah, I did not know that. And I mean,
it was, it, was it like a turn on at all?

334
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,120
Like were you aroused at all?

335
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,910
Oh, I had a normal Boehner had,
wasn't like out of the ordinary.

336
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,870
Right. And that's all it
was. And it was one of the,

337
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,950
if it's something that Michael Jackson,
the good stuff.

338
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah. It, so when you come to,
you're just like, oh, we're like,

339
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:04,680
we're done. And then, and
then you're just full of air

340
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,930
30 to 40 minutes later. I
was like, Oh shit. Because I
didn't take it. It's all day.

341
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:13,810
The day before I had been shitting, I'd
be like, I don't have to sell, you know?

342
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,350
Yeah. So I'm like, no, I really got to
ship. It's not shit. It's just a hair.

343
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,720
And how long? Cause those
parts were awesome. How long
does those farts last for?

344
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,090
About two hours.

345
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,730
Wow.

346
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,520
Down though. Like really force it
out. I felt like it was Shitty,

347
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:31,010
but I looked at it a
toilet and it was nothing.

348
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,080
Oh Wow.

349
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,640
You're going to have to come with me
to this thing and bring the camera and

350
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:35,474
stuff.
Okay.

351
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,440
Yeah, for sure. It should do that.

352
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,060
Um, so wow. Well, I hope you're okay. Hey,
where did you have any dates this weekend?

353
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,380
Where are you?
Where are you going to be next?

354
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm going to be an, um, I'm
going to be in or whatever.

355
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,530
I'm going to be in Montreal this weekend,

356
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,180
but then I want to Edinburgh
for the whole month.

357
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,550
Oh God. You're crazy for
doing that. Oh my God.

358
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,580
Yeah.
And then Scandinavia.

359
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,000
Nice. All right buddy. And we'll, you're
traveling the world. You're living it up.

360
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,050
We hope you were assholes. Okay. And

361
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,030
it's great and it gets such clear
pictures of the inside of your rectum.

362
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,690
Really Nice frame those.
Yeah, I'd like to see that

363
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,900
like a tunnel. You know, doctors who
when he goes through the tunnel in time,

364
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,870
it looks like that.

365
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,060
Good. I'm glad you're
assholes. A beautiful tunnel.
I can't wait to hear more.

366
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,830
I'll let you know how mind goes.

367
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,220
Yeah, I can't wait for you to do.
It will be a will be fun buddy.

368
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,330
Yeah, I can't wait. All right
buddy. I'll talk to you later.

369
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,700
Right?
Very

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,320
good luck. Wow. That's what you have to
look forward to. I'm stoked. I Dunno.

371
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:44,130
I might cancel.
So anyways,

372
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,460
do you now, do you see red in the bowl
too when you go potty? No. No, no.

373
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,110
It's where do you think
you have hemorrhoids?

374
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,080
Um, no, I don't think I have.
I mean I don't have hemorrhoids

375
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,560
problem. It doesn't hurt. No.
Okay, well that's good. All right,

376
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,120
that sounds like that could be a problem
when he's got going on. I think so.

377
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,040
Dripping blood was that.
It's,

378
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,090
if it's bright blood that's supposed
to be better than dark blood,

379
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:14,300
they say cause it's like star
last phone call for second.

380
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,800
Poor Ari Aries. Guys, pray for
Ari's butthole. Pray for it,

381
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,160
send him butthole wishes and
compliment them on those farts.

382
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,920
Hence,
by the way,

383
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,790
a bunch of people told me they were doing
my line to like their girlfriends and

384
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:35,930
stuff. Want to hear a cool fart and
they're going want to hear a funny fart.

385
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,980
That's how you say it wrong.
It's want to hear a cool fart.

386
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,533
And then when

387
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,330
they like turn Fart,

388
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,560
sometimes people don't say yes
so that you still wait a beat.

389
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,880
But it's always you want to hear a cool
fart and then for our end it's just for

390
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,150
the women listening. You
can say no, you can say no.

391
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,180
I say no almost all the time. I want to
hear a cool far now. That's how you it.

392
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,030
That's actually how it goes in
the house. Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

393
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,070
You know I really appreciate your fan
next to the bed that you man, turn on.

394
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:16,071
I hate your fan so much cause it makes
me feel like one of those tower tower

395
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:21,771
fans feel feverish and sick when I
sleep with a cold air blowing on me all

396
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,920
night. I angle it so it doesn't go on.
It still trickles down. Someone, man,

397
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,000
it doesn't make you feel sick or weird

398
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,950
or weird. Like I have a fever or
something, but if you feel cool,

399
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,750
hate it. I like it. Men Do
that and we have this thing.

400
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,810
I know my dad has slept with
a fan so gross like our baby.

401
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,960
Um,

402
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,960
my wife is convinced it was cold even
though even when it's 106 outside.

403
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,520
Yeah.
So the air conditioning,

404
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:01,410
which I would have down to
like 66 is that like 75 so,

405
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:05,100
yeah. I need the fan. He's a baby
though. He's, he's, they need,

406
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,850
they need one more layer
than you do. He's fine. Okay.

407
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,710
No he is fine cause I keep it
nice and warm in the house.

408
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,390
Every time I pick him up
from a nap or something,

409
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,610
it's just like heat just coming
off of his body. Yes, I do.

410
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:20,850
I think you should drop it another degree
or two. Seriously. All right. All right.

411
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,900
We'll do it tonight in the 60s but
I think you sent me three is fine.

412
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,590
I usually do 73 chocolate.
Let's do it.

413
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,170
Yeah.
All right

414
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,433
baby.

415
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's talk about the fact that
I'm wearing a Danny shirt,

416
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,560
even though it almost all went to shit.

417
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,450
You're going to talk about that
on the air. Should I not? I mean,

418
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,280
unless you want to her Danny's
feelings. No, I don't want to have days.

419
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,410
You can't do that. Okay. He
basically just did. Long story short,

420
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,830
there was a miscommunication on the order.
Yeah.

421
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,820
You're going to get mad at Danny about
it. He said he's trying to fix it. Yeah.

422
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:03,920
I mean we, we in a shame,
the guy was, it was an honest
mistake. I think jeans, he's,

423
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,830
it's a language barrier thing.
He speaks English. Yeah.

424
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:12,370
But not perfect. It's a second
language for poor Danny. Yeah.

425
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,160
What's his real name?
I mean,

426
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:18,240
as good as the real Eric and I,
his name,

427
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,200
big words.

428
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,910
Um, his real name. I don't know where
you go actually. I deal with Alex.

429
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,330
Oh, so it's Alex's fault. Yeah,
but he speaks fluent English. Well,

430
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,380
it's fine. We're all good. We're all good.
You're right. I shouldn't try to make it.

431
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm not trying to, I'm just going to
tell the story, you know, and I know,

432
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:41,040
but yeah.
Fed Ju Ju yeah.

433
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,220
Can we talk about our Sushi experience,
please? Okay, yeah, go ahead. Well,

434
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,340
we went to a new place
in our new neighborhood.

435
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,580
It's supposed to be like a really nice,
and it is a really nice place in the,

436
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,170
the fish was amazed,
like it was so good.

437
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,330
Yeah. It's, um, it's also like
very popular. This is one of the,

438
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:05,710
uh, I would say it's on lists, you
know, it's like on the foodie lists.

439
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,730
Write it up.
Yeah.

440
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,590
Which is why we were so
excited to go in and try it.

441
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:14,300
And we got a babysitter and all that stuff
and we went in and we did all Mcausey,

442
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:18,710
which is where the chef brings you
what he select. So we're like, great,

443
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,120
let's keep a common bro.
Like, and we should point out

444
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,230
that when we do usually go to Sushi,
we never do.

445
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:30,430
I'm a Casa because, you know, we know
what we like. Is that what I said?

446
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,220
I think that's what you said. Oh
my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um,

447
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,090
we always know what we like and we
go, no, do you know, we'll do this,

448
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,730
we'll do this or, but this time we handed
it over, we go, do you guys do it? Yeah.

449
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:41,970
Yeah.

450
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,900
Well what happened was everything
was great. It was great. Amazing.

451
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,940
But they parceled it out
like two bites at a time.

452
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,750
They're like, here's two more bites. And
you're like, I'm fucking, let's eat man.

453
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,860
When are we going to eat?

454
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,520
And it would be like,
they were like, okay,

455
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:59,160
so you're going to get
all these things right.

456
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,870
So the first thing that
comes out as a plate,

457
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:06,310
we'd get a plate and it has two pieces of
fish on it. Delicious. So eat two bites.

458
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:09,960
Yeah. And you're like, great. And it
kind of sits like five minutes. Yeah.

459
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,680
Take it back. A new
plate too and too, God,

460
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,600
bye bite. Yeah. And then
these are a few more minutes.

461
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,080
Next play.
I was like four pieces.

462
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,600
Oh my God.
I'm infuriated.

463
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:30,050
And you got even the bigger,
even me as a Nibbler, I even,

464
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:33,470
I was hungry as a leveler.
Yeah. Yeah. And you got the,

465
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:36,850
the extra helping of it,
even dude.

466
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,050
And it was not enough
food. It's so, it was

467
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,980
clearly not enough. So when it was done,
I was like, hey, we need that menu. Yeah.

468
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,100
And they came back with it and they're
like, oh, well what do you need?

469
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,060
And I was like, a bunch,
a bunch more Sushi.

470
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,280
And then there was a table
next to us of this big, uh,

471
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,930
big, like Ozzy broad. And then her, um,

472
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,190
Japanese friends, Japanese friends, and
they're like, oh, isn't it great here?

473
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,760
I was like, yeah, it is. It's really
good. But you know, it's just not enough.

474
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,710
And then pork or goes, uh,
uh, uh, you don't think so,

475
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,190
right? Clearly thought so too. Yeah.
She's like, she's like, I think it's an a,

476
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:22,850
and I go look fatty. You're not fooling
anybody. You're, you're on my team. Right.

477
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,690
We both know this is not enough food.
You're not satisfied.

478
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,250
Don't act like you're satisfied.

479
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,520
Because she started to try to
like make it seem like, oh,

480
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,700
you don't think it's enough food.
I think it's plenty of food. Right.

481
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,960
It was like you're way over to bills.

482
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,480
There's no way you think
this is hungry as shit too.

483
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,190
She looks hungry at all hours of the day,

484
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,910
but the only person that looks satisfied
was her Japanese friend who's used to

485
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:49,060
probably eating that way and was like,
oh,

486
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,720
everything's pretty looked like she was
came out of an internment camp though.

487
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,930
Right. She's just like,
oh, we get our ration.

488
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,900
Right.
Yeah.

489
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,100
That's how I felt like they were throwing
a scraps and I had to eat it so fast

490
00:33:59,101 --> 00:34:00,150
to get to know him the next day.

491
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,450
Just scrap was going to come.
Sushi wise I do.

492
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,030
My whole thing is just keep it coming.

493
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,620
Yeah. We order like a
trough. I need, I need,

494
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:12,650
I need them to just keep
dropping the plates, you know,

495
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,030
so that the table is just covered in
snow and then we just eat our way through

496
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:20,210
it and then we,
we waste because we can't even finish it.

497
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:24,080
That's when I'm happiest. Yeah.
A few pieces left and they go,

498
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,720
you want that and you can, I can't,
but the roles are the ones that I've,

499
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,090
I don't feel bad wasting roles. Yeah.
You don't want to waste the fish.

500
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:37,330
Yeah. I will go back to that place and
now we know the rule. We go absolutely.

501
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:41,370
Alica yes. And we go, do you
have a pen and paper? Because
you're going to need it.

502
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,260
Yeah.

503
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,540
Can I tell you what? I don't either. I
like Amaa Ebi. That sweet shrimp. Yeah.

504
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,060
But I liked him to fry the heads.
Don't do then they didn't do,

505
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,860
it's a weird thing.

506
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,400
That was very upsetting because I like
those fried fish heads. Yeah. I know.

507
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,950
Anyway, that, oh gee man.
Yeah, I'm Asian. I know. Uh,

508
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,450
but that was so far. I know. I've
never, I've never eaten somewhere.

509
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:06,140
And then Anne, and I mean this in all
seriousness, how do the full meal,

510
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,900
and then I was ready to go to in
and out. You were right. I was like,

511
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,720
let's go to the fucking Internet.
But we didn't, but we didn't. Yeah.

512
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,340
Well, pat on the back of that.
Yeah, I was. I really wanted
to, but I didn't. I know,

513
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,090
cause I knew that somewhere that
actually said it like four or five times.

514
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:23,150
I know I'm serious,

515
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,840
but that's how normal people eat is
they just eat one meal even though it's

516
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:31,610
parceled out, like you know you're in a
refugee camp. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Yup,

517
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,660
Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup. What do
you think your dad would have done there?

518
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,850
Oh my God. Well first of all, you

519
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,270
Sushi a buddy.

520
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,230
We went out with your dad for dinner
so that we had dinner with your folks.

521
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,150
Just the four of us,
two nights in a row,

522
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,980
everybody left after Ellis is baptism
and your parents stayed behind for a

523
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,040
couple of days and we had them over at
the house one night and the next night we

524
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,860
went out.
And what I noticed was your dad,

525
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,200
there's a few topics your dad
loves to. Favorite ones, murder,

526
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,780
killing and death. Actually three
favorites. Yeah. Killing death.

527
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:14,010
Murder. Yeah. It was pretty intense.
He talks about death the first night.

528
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,370
Well he goes, yeah, what was the
first night that was, but I'm on his,

529
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,880
his brother passed,
right.

530
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,380
Brother dying and details and like I a,

531
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:27,290
I went to the funeral home and like
picking out the casket and all of that.

532
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,760
My mom was like, come on like weird.
Like this is a nice meal about like,

533
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,990
all right. Then the next night he goes,
uh, what kind of gun are you going to get?

534
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:40,130
Ellis? And I go, he goes like for
his first gun. And then I got,

535
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,690
uh, I don't know, he was
probably 22 or something. I
go, yeah, you don't step it up,

536
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,200
you know, and then get them like, I dunno,
maybe a glock at some point and then, uh,

537
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,820
you know, 45 I get what I really want to
get them as a 50 caliber. It was like,

538
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,750
ah, and it like prompted something
in him. He goes, Vietnam,

539
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,860
we had these 50 cows too,
too heavy to carry.

540
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,230
She put him in the back of like a,
I don't know,

541
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:07,400
some type of a truck or something. One
day, like sky coming out over the field.

542
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,090
And you just kind of launched these fee.
I was like, Oh man, like he just gets,

543
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,980
he gets lost in this story.
And then something did it.
Like somebody cut them off.

544
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:19,550
Like my mom said, oh we've got to
go do this. And I was like, Hey,

545
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:23,270
you didn't finish that 50 caliber
story. And he was like, Huh?

546
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,620
I go the story about the 50 caliber, the
guys on the field. He's like, Oh yeah.

547
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,770
And I go, so what happens if you
hit him with it? He goes, oh,

548
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,280
you hit him in the show where
they die. Oh my God. Like

549
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,980
I still want like

550
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,470
the full story. That's another phone
call we should make and be like,

551
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,940
what's up with the physical it? Well,
and then it was a nice treat, a dinner.

552
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,470
We went to the final dinner,
the final dinner and you know,

553
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,510
we had pictures from the baptism
and it was beautiful and we,

554
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,030
we had this wonderful week, actually,
your whole family was great. You know,

555
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:55,260
my family. And, and then
he starts talking about

556
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,030
hospital deaths,
malpractice suits,

557
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,870
and all these horrific stories.

558
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,560
And they're all about like pregnant women
giving birth. I'm like, could you not?

559
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah. And then he goes to put acid on
a woman's vagina by mistake. I'm like,

560
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,480
yeah. And then he's like,

561
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,360
guy brought her daughter in and then my
mom was like, and what happened? She died

562
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,010
anyways.

563
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,110
How are you going to bite that kind bite

564
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:32,290

565
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,010
I'd have loves talking about
that course we don't want. And

566
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,060
that's where you get it from. That's
your love of murder and stuff. Yeah,

567
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:41,940
that makes sense.
You're becoming your dad.

568
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,620
Yeah.

569
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,380
You're red dead. Hope he
answers. Please answer.

570
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,880
Are you asking about the Vietnam story?

571
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,750
Want to hear about the 50
caliber cause he didn't,

572
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:53,040
he didn't really finish the story.

573
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,003
Oh yeah.

574
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,390
Answers. Oh No. Bummer. Okay.

575
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,453
By the way,

576
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,090
I just need to sit down with you
and do it. It's been forwarded.

577
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,240
It's going to be an audio only episode.
Yeah,

578
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,140
but we have a full top dog
Charlie episode. DEPA right.

579
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,350
We're going to release it like a
regular episode. We'll talk before it.

580
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,050
It will only be audio cause this
doesn't make sense to like, yeah,

581
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,030
I have video of us just introducing it,
you know? Yeah. Or so that'll hopefully,

582
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,260
maybe I will try to do that for next
week or so. Okay. Um, yeah. So yeah,

583
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:27,250
he does love death.

584
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,370
A lot of death. Chad. That's on
his mind a lot, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

585
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,620
It's really killing, killing, killing
cat and he drinks. It's so funny.

586
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:39,130
He was over here. They came from
the airport and I was like top dog.

587
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:41,920
Do you want to go back to the hotel and
change into something more comfortable?

588
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,480
He's like, I am comfortable. Always.

589
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,970
Always wasn't Khakis but down shirt.
Yeah.

590
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,930
Tie loafers, loafers. You
want to get some control?

591
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,110
I am comfortable buddy.
It sounds funny.

592
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,840
If that's what he wears
it on a Sunday afternoon.

593
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,570
You know what I love about your dad is um,

594
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,450
anything could be going on and
he doesn't give a fuck. Like,

595
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,420
he'll still just sit on
the couch and watch CNN,

596
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,650
even though there's a house full of people
and dogs running around and like any

597
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:14,410
kind of event, if he hasn't feel like
paying attention, he doesn't. Yeah,

598
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,390
I really respect that.

599
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah. And his whole thing too. If you
go like, what's the why? You know,

600
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,150
what are you, why aren't you like
over here? He's like, I'm bored.

601
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,840
Which is true. Yeah. I
agree. I get bored too. Yeah.

602
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,020
I'm going to start doing that from now
on. Just pulling the top dog. Yeah.

603
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,780
I just want to watch Netflix right now.
I want to fucking talk to you guys. Yeah.

604
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,530
And you go,
I'm going to do that.

605
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,830
You don't want to talk to
you go. You don't wanna talk
to so and so. And he'll go,

606
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,700
they bore me straight up.
We'll just tell you that right

607
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,680
person bores me. Yeah.
He keeps the 100 genes.

608
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,890
Do you want me to play this
song you say? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

609
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,210
Um,
so as we all know,

610
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,310
there's a problem with people
sharing too much on social media.

611
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,320
And finally somebody wrote a song
about it and this is it right here.

612
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,943
Um,

613
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,230
I could love this.

614
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,130
I mean they really wrote a
song. Yeah, it's a good song.

615
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,320
Your Business.
Facebook,

616
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,190
there's a oversharing problem for sure.
Talked about it for a long time.

617
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,620
Many years we've discussed this problem.
Yes.

618
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,740
And a shout out to the s CG church
version of Qbo business off of Facebook.

619
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:30,170
I love it. Yeah, it's, yeah.
You don't need to share
everything. That's interesting.

620
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:33,290
There's really no shame left
in our society now. I mean,

621
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,060
everything is on the table all the time.
It's so crazy.

622
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:39,500
How are we going to
teach our kid about that?

623
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,910
You have to tell him not to send Dick
pics to people. That's a big thing now,

624
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,930
but imagine doing it. But I may
have done it if I had, well,

625
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,120
if I had a healthier hog on me,
I would have.

626
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,410
Here's the thing about photographs is
that you can't really tell scale of decks,

627
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,310
but if I had a real hammer on me,
there's no way you could keep keep it off.

628
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,030
You know,

629
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,840
you couldn't have convinced me to not
send it if I was like really equipped.

630
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,630
There's no way you could been like,
now do you understand?

631
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:11,190
It's only the shame of like somebody
seeing this petite little lights that I,

632
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:16,550
uh, I wouldn't, wouldn't send it so silly.
It's not a petite light switch babe.

633
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,340
Yeah, it is. It's not,
it looks like, it's like,

634
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,040
it's a little noisy.
It's like,

635
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,420
you know how when people get a hair on
their tongue and then they go and they

636
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:31,010
pull it off?
That's like my whole deck

637
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,000
was that I was like, I got the fuck. Am I
talking? Yeah, that's my Dick. Yeah. Yeah.

638
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,750
I don't think so.
Oh,

639
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,820
gross is my vagina. Now that I've had a
child, like how disappointing is it now?

640
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,060
That's great. It totally different.
I feel like it's totally different.

641
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,110
It's all blown out and no,
no,

642
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,120
I got ma meat sandwich. Yeah.
Loose meat sandwich. Yeah. No,

643
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:00,080
it's great.
It's great.

644
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:05,000
Well then your tiny painter and my loose
meat fits together. Well, you know,

645
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,560
that's how it goes together.

646
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,940
You would have sent your Dick Pics
to checks if you had the technology?

647
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:16,970
Oh my God, Dude. No, I had, uh,
all joking of size aside, I,

648
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,420
I have a, um, you know, a shame,

649
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,010
a nude shame. Maybe it was all the
Catholic upbringing. I wouldn't have,

650
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,630
I don't think I would have. Interesting.
I would never do that. I wouldn't know.

651
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:34,430
But I would, I think in terms of also
just blackmail, you know, like I said,

652
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,070
in my mind,
I wouldn't ever do that to somebody,

653
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,280
but I don't trust that somebody
wouldn't do that to me. Oh, right.

654
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,500
So you're saying,
yeah,

655
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,600
I feel that there's enough fear in me
that somebody would use that against me.

656
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,690
Yeah. They would scare me into not
sending it. But that's the thing.

657
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:54,030
If you don't put your
face, thank you, Betsy.

658
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:58,260
If you don't put your face in the
picture, then who cares? That's true.

659
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,390
I think that's the one, the
one way you have to do it.
I don't know. Yeah, I dunno.

660
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,890
Blue Banner of this generation.

661
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:08,480
Your friends are sending their Dick
pics everywhere. Did you ever send it?

662
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,930
Uh, I've never sent one. I have
had friends that sent it. Yeah,

663
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,340
I have the diverse, uh, so whenever
requests for you to send one,

664
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:21,900
like they go send me a dick pic? No.
No. Hmm. Have you ever seen like,

665
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:26,870
has anyone ever been put on blast so to
speak and then you saw their dick pics

666
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,960
and they didn't want you to

667
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,630
actually found out that
one of my best friends,

668
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,140
I went to a comedy show with uh,
one of my friends,

669
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:37,770
girlfriends and uh,
found out during the show,

670
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,780
the comedian asked if anyone had sent
like how to dig book sent to them and uh,

671
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:49,410
my friend's girlfriend like rose her
hand or raise your hand, raise your hand.

672
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,750
And uh,

673
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,880
it turned out that she was talking
about my friend and I found out at that

674
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,700
showed that my friend sent her a dick pic.

675
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,390
Hmm. I'm a little confused. I
didn't follow that and say that.

676
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,020
I just pretended like I did.
Yeah.

677
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,650
Well I found out during your show that
my buddy sent his current girlfriend

678
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,490
addiction.

679
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,450
Okay. Yes. Now. All right.
My last girlfriend. Yeah. No.

680
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,700
Was it like how he quartered her? Uh,
it was in the very early stages. Okay.

681
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,020
And had been going out for a
very long time at that point.

682
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,080
From what I understand, a lot of
women don't care about the Dick Pic.

683
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,860
I personally, I've seen, you know, what
you see all the time on social media.

684
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:31,430
Don't send me a dick pic in bias.
Yeah. Black people are like,

685
00:46:31,431 --> 00:46:32,890
don't send me a dick pic.
Yeah.

686
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,160
So I think women get bombarded with Dick
Pics and they'd probably just trashed

687
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,950
them. Oh my God. I don't
think it's a thrill.

688
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:44,870
It's only maybe something to get really
into it. You definitely know sending it,

689
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,940
there's something
intriguing about the person,

690
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,840
but if you're just getting
unsolicited Dick Pics, I'm
sure you're just like, okay,

691
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:55,340
I am, I don't get sent. Never
got careful what you say,

692
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,760
please don't send me your deck pegs.
I really don't want them. Yeah. Uh,

693
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,890
but I feel like it's a particular type
of lady. Maybe you get, yeah, yeah, yeah,

694
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,470
yeah. Not In the married 40
year old kinds. You never know.

695
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,380
You never know. That's where it had two
girls send their snatches, their snapchat.

696
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:17,240
I think it's far less. I mean,
I'm sure that that happens,

697
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:20,730
but you don't really see, I mean I've,
I haven't seen any of my friends by,

698
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:25,430
I was like, stop with the pussy
pierced. Yeah, yeah. No, no,

699
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:30,010
I don't see that. Um, I don't
know. You see nudes? I Dunno.

700
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,690
I've had friends be like, oh, I'm this
girl that I'm seeing just sent me this.

701
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,480
But it's usually not like my leg
open. It's like a girl, you know?

702
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,900
But it's not just her snatch
isn't it? It's not just, no, no.

703
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,630
It's not like here's this
pussy for no, no, no. Yeah,
because women don't, we don't,

704
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,730
I don't think that way.
I think dudes are like,

705
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:52,840
you're in my dick because the other
guys that's enticing to gay men,

706
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,980
but not women to be a gay guy. Oh,
I know. And just be like, look,

707
00:47:56,981 --> 00:48:00,440
it was cock this guy just,
I mean,

708
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,470
when Grindr happened, do you think the
gay community, just as your backflip,

709
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,600
like this is what the movement's about.
This is what we've been wanting to do.

710
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,580
I mean it started in the gay community
and then came, what's that shit? Tinder,

711
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:19,210
but it started as grinder was first. For
sure. You could just be like, who's in?

712
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,980
Who wants to fuck in my neighborhood?

713
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,760
Who was five miles from here or two
miles at once to blow me? Oh, that guy.

714
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,830
Yeah.
I mean like for the casual,

715
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,420
I got to get this load out.

716
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:36,610
That's is the most magical because he
used to just have to go down to the park

717
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,670
and stand in a particular area.
Right foot,

718
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:43,660
three times restroom stall
and just see what happens.

719
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,440
I know now it's like, yeah, those guys
get to go like, here's what I look like.

720
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,540
And you know how judgmental too. It's
like, it's like, look at me, I'm yoked.

721
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,660
Oh my God, you better be looking
like this too. Oh my God.

722
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,880
Then you'll find that like
your equal and you're like,

723
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,920
you can blow me so much pressure to
be a gay man. I don't think I can.

724
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,730
Thank God. Lesbian seemed to be a bit
more forgiving. If I ever, I could not,

725
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,880
I could not hang. No. Well,
you'd have to be a bear. I could,

726
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,080
hey in my lane,
but I couldn't hang with like,

727
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,900
you know the guys pretend if you age,

728
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,530
like you can't be over 30 and the gay
community as being a straight woman,

729
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:23,320
you see so many,
especially in La,

730
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,710
older gay guys that look like older
straight women as far as the other crazy

731
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:33,910
face backs and the lip and you're
like, dude, you look insane.

732
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,750
But it's because of that pressure probably
the more so than anything pressure on

733
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:42,160
yourself. Right? So to maintain the
look. But you see that a lot in la,

734
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:47,380
like old, older gay guys with
ridiculous plastic sir. Look, amaze.

735
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,890
No. Who looked, who looked
like it? They went too far.

736
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,680
I would say in south beach
it's even worse. You're right.

737
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,890
Go down to Miami and everybody that
roller blades by everybody that roller

738
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:02,020
blades by, they have calf
implants, ass implants,

739
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:05,980
the cheek and then everybody
looks so fucking weird.

740
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,840
I was in south when I was in south beach.

741
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,690
Everyone was on the beach and I saw
somebody vomit and I go, what happened?

742
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,900
They go,
I just looked at your body.

743
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,580
You and I so disappointed. We used to
go down to Miami. We were like the,

744
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,550
you know the Canadian pigs.
Oh look,

745
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,800
the Midwestern couples slobs.
Are

746
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,050
you from Indiana or so? Yeah.
And then now you see like so tan.

747
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,480
So lean. Yeah. Girls are
topless wearing thongs that are,

748
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,350
that are like sheer, like
it's see through thongs. Yeah,

749
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,510
and they have just perfect bodies.

750
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,280
The dudes are super yolked jogging
on the beach. It's Puerto Rican guys.

751
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:53,120
What their gold chains jogging.
I remember every morning that heat,

752
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,870
the sweltering heat, it's 102
out there. It's just to show off.

753
00:50:56,871 --> 00:50:59,750
Your body plays all day every day.
Remember, if you can't get laid here,

754
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,130
you can't get lazy. That's my dad told
you. My Dad called. Your Dad told me that.

755
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,520
Yeah. When we went to south beach
together. Told me going to get laid here.

756
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,210
You calculate anywhere.
That's nice,

757
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,520
but I can't get laid to your father in
law. Yeah, that's good advice. Right?

758
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:25,883
Facebook.

759
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:49,910
Did you wish

760
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,690
you could sing like that? Absolutely.
I can. I do. You want to sing something

761
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,900
now you have another song? Oh my Africa.
I have to get it up. I have to pull it up.

762
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:04,380
You don't have it. I'll pull it up
right now. Um, hold on. Alright.

763
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,560
You know what I was going to say about
la though, at least our saving grace,

764
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:12,440
because there are a lot of good looking
people in Los Angeles. Yeah. Is that,

765
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:15,440
there's also a lot of really not
good looking normal people here.

766
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,830
So if you go to our beach,
like you'll see fat people,

767
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,960
you'll still see people that
like to eat and stuff. No, we're,

768
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,580
we're here and we're not going
anywhere. We're eating Sushi. Yeah.

769
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,860
Next to the imposters. Okay. Ready? Yeah.

770
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:35,330
So now we had some issue last
week with the toto song Africa.

771
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:37,780
We wanted to come up with
alternate lyrics. Yeah.

772
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,650
This is submitted by how do
they come with the hurricane?

773
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,900
How did it come about that? Cause our bid
day is called a toto. Oh, that's right.

774
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,960
And then we talked about,
you know,

775
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:52,340
how great it is and we were singing and
then basically the day songs. Right,

776
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,010
right. Yeah. And I did. I
didn't tell us on the air,

777
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:59,690
but I actually used to give a girl from
high school ride home every day whose

778
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:03,200
dad was in the band. Toto move. You
left that out? I forgot about it.

779
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,620
And then she and I found each other on
the Instagram because of the show or no?

780
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,320
No, totally random. Okay. Ready? Now
this is a submission from Taylor cane.

781
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,230
We can't play the music under it,
so I'm just going to sing it. Yeah.

782
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:20,060
Well you got voice my Gospel. Okay.
Ready? Yeah. Wait, can you do,

783
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:24,590
can you leave me in with the Braxton's?
I'd like to practice a little bit. Okay.

784
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,160
I just wanted to figure out who I am

785
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,140
today and kind of find my voice and
then I'll go into it a little bit. Okay.

786
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,210
Let me see.
You got it.

787
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,330
Uh,

788
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,610
I can only do the loss divorce yet.
Ah,

789
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,300
AH,

790
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,980
uh,
I don't know.

791
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,873
Oh Man.

792
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,200
Yeah,

793
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,640
it's gonna take a practice for me.

794
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,930
That's the original song then.
Those aren't the lyrics. All do.

795
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,213
No.

796
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,823
Okay.
Ready?

797
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:03,663
Please.

798
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,710
So, which fraction are you before
you do this? I'm feeling Tamar. Wow.

799
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,690
Cause I feel like I got my life and
I feel like I'm ready to get my life.

800
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,350
How about you?
Just shared is nice.

801
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,700
So I feel like the Tony.
Oh, okay. You don't,

802
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,680
I feel like I'm a superstar
of the family of the day.

803
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,050
You are Tony. Okay. Ready? I'm
just going to do the chorus.

804
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:45,650
This is submitted by Taylor cane,
so thank you Taylor. Thanks Taylor.

805
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,560
Can't play the whole song. I'm
here. It goes. Ready? [inaudible]

806
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,440
it used to take to
clean away all the pain.

807
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,980
There was nothing.
Not a hundred

808
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,680
but now I'm up.
A day has come and

809
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,560
the washlet gives me time
to do the things we never,

810
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,340
Heh.

811
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,380
Ooh,
I like it.

812
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,860
Really like that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

813
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,240
so it wasn't in this one that it
goes as I brown. I cry out in the

814
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,653
right.

815
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,910
Liz Longing for its soothing spread.

816
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,010
I know that. I must do
what's ride. Sure Bro.

817
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:42,010
Chrysler so fat.
My main mommy is non-binary.

818
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,400
There we go. That's really good. Now you
can't do it perfect. It's not perfect.

819
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:49,100
I got a practice that's really well done.
Thank you.

820
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:54,620
So I want to play this for you.
Yeah, I think you'll really enjoy,

821
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,940
um, these clips. Are you ready?

822
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,873
Yup.

823
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:07,300
Oh my God. If you would like a free
sample with no strings attached,

824
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:09,430
you can test drive the sports model.

825
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:13,750
I'm willing to consider any kind
of strictly friendly sports.

826
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,610
You can decide how strictly or how
friendly I want to. Tough chick.

827
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:22,450
Who's not afraid of guys?
If you get urges to beat a man,

828
00:56:22,451 --> 00:56:24,790
I might get yours to let you win.

829
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,080
If you're willing to practice strictly
friendlies Fords until you achieve

830
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:32,050
perfection.
The fucking Tom for a challenge.

831
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,600
What the fuck is he talking about?
What does it look what he's talking about?

832
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,160
Why don't you describe
this guy to our list?

833
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:44,320
He looks a little like a skinny Lemmy.
And what's he wearing?

834
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,140
He looks a little GGL Anish
just on black tennis shoes.

835
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Tennis shoes with white socks and just
some black black like biker shorts.

836
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,260
And he's got on some really
cool sunglasses. Right?

837
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,030
And he's got the Lemmy from Motorhead.
Creepy. Uh, like Fu Manchu. Yeah,

838
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,990
it's on. And he's got a paddle in his
hand and he's got fingerless gloves,

839
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,980
which is always a sign of sanity. If
you're wearing fingerless gloves. Yeah.

840
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:13,630
You've got your life together.
Everything is going well. Exactly. Yes.

841
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:14,410
I agree.

842
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,370
I was thinking about wrestling and
spank you, Frisbee out the public park,

843
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,990
you and your friends can they have a stone
rope and contest if you're willing to

844
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:25,850
make and use the left.
So one layer,

845
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:28,810
Susan Haag ties me the fastest wins.

846
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,510
I like a lot about this
guy. First of all. Yeah,

847
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:39,580
I do like that he is putting out there
what he's into and just he just going to

848
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:45,020
take right. What do we know
when he gets back? He'll have
his choices. No, no, no, no,

849
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,870
no, no, no. This is, this is
his version of swipe left and
right. Right. Cause I, I'm,

850
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:54,920
I'm all good. Thank you.
Um, and he also is, is uh,

851
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,350
you know, gear wise
he's on top of it. Yeah.

852
00:57:57,351 --> 00:58:00,980
There's a very specific audience that
this appeals to and he's going to find it.

853
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:05,690
He's going to find it. It
sounds like there's a lot of
codes, code, wording that I,

854
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,100
I'm not really understanding.

855
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:12,030
Like this guy needs a high population
city by the way. Yeah, they are. Yeah.

856
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,890
Yeah. Yeah. South La.
What code words are you,

857
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,610
are you struggling with like Lasso?

858
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:22,700
How I understand that's what it feels
like. There's some code in there.

859
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,230
It's implied that um, we're not,
we're not going after cattle, right.

860
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,020
One after me. Right. So he's um,

861
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:34,190
he has his own version of sports,
right? Yeah. Right. Oh boy.

862
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:36,980
You got that paddle too and saying,
oh boy,

863
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,530
I might be inclined to let
dad was under this stuff.

864
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:43,070
This is probably someone's dad for
sure. I hope it's someone's dad. Who's,

865
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,600
who's listening to this show right
now. They're like, where did they hit?

866
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,820
You can have a bring your own belt party

867
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,870
belt blindfold me.
Then take turns with in me nothing.

868
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,010
And I'll decide which
woman has the best skills.

869
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,290
Maybe it's the cadence that's an alarm.

870
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:05,970
It's annoying and he knows
so much what he wants.

871
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:10,050
And I know these aren't the
fantasy was like, you know what,

872
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:14,790
I've always wanted a woman know what me,
he's done this hundreds of times and uh,

873
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,670
he just can't get that adrenaline
rush anymore so he's just like,

874
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,470
I'm putting it out there man. It's opt
in. Opt in up. Yes. Yeah, you're right.

875
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,280
This is a very specific, this guy.
No requests. I want you to last.

876
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:29,450
Oh me and we're nine inch heels
and leather and yeah. Yeah.

877
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,340
Grass. I like my is you
can make a special request.

878
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,220
You can practice self assertion with me.

879
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,740
What do you like to tough enough
when you're a sissy, check it.

880
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,600
This is why I don't understand.
You definitely need self
assertion encouragement.

881
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,380
I'm sorry you're still undecided.
There's more hands after this.

882
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,850
Now let's get to tell you

883
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,640
what's self concerns.
Oh Man.

884
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,770
There's definitely some dead
animals in his house and I will say,

885
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,910
I will say, yeah, I like
his background choice.

886
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:10,010
I like his audio. There was no birds
chirping. Yeah, he is a good mic.

887
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,640
It was a clean video. So he had some
help with production as I mentioned.

888
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:19,550
I think he has a clean diet. I mean that's
not a bad body. He's definitely fit. No.

889
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,350
Yup.
Would you,

890
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:25,320
would you think a date with him would
be absolutely terrifying for me? Yes.

891
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,800
A self assertion? Is that what you're
talking about? Self insertion? No,

892
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,770
the fuck you're a sissy
check or a shot chick.

893
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,630
You definitely need self assertion
encouragement. So it's like dom stuff.

894
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:41,880
Okay. Now let's get tell you. Oh Man,

895
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:42,850
this guy's guys

896
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:47,580
big time. Yeah. Huh? I guess,
um, when BDSM people go, well,

897
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:50,350
why don't we get a bad rep? Well, I
would say because of the time right here,

898
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:55,480
I think Tom is the type of
guy that gives you a bad rap.

899
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:59,740
He won't respect your
pronouns. Oh Man. Oh Man.

900
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:04,900
But he would love for you to whip him and
stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I, again,

901
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:07,840
I see myself, I could do that,
but I don't, I don't know.

902
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:10,450
I don't need it to be sexual
for somebody else. Right.

903
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:13,870
It's just an anger thing for me. Maybe.
I don't know. But what if he's just like,

904
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,720
yeah, but I get off on it. So I
liked that part and I want them to,

905
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:18,600
Tj's on me or anything he's
not going to do is on you.

906
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:22,570
He do it on the floor or something.
That part creeps me out. Why

907
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,510
Tom came all this way.

908
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:29,890
Okay.

909
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,540
He can't just crank one out in the carpet.

910
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,760
It's a very,
it's a very specific world to inhabit.

911
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,770
You got to know a lot of lingo. There's
a lot of, a lot of stuff you have to buy.

912
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,240
Yeah,
it's too much.

913
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:53,350
Hi, nick hoc here and the star of

Shafter. This baby is six inches.

920
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,710
It's one and three quarter

921
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:22,170
It's made up of [inaudible] free PBC

The bill will also has
its 30 Suction Cup base.

924
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,410
By the way. Every time I
see, well he's about to,

925
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:35,710
as they go up inside of you to episode
where the guy was saying women want

926
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:40,130
smaller balls. It's a good, maybe
he's right. He's right. These guys,

927
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,070
they know women. That's one
thing. These guys know women.

928
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:49,160
Every time I see him or
his name in our copy,

929
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,960
Nick Hodge in my brain, it goes
a j hawk. I was like, wait,

930
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:58,540
we're about to see AGRX dildo.
Did you imagine age ain't doing this?

931
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:02,330
No Way. It would be the best if
he did a parody of this, so hey,

I'm going to do it hard. Cincinnati
Bangles in the off season,

933

I've crafted a dildo
after my own payments.

934
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,840
Do you guys want my cock and
movable balls inside of you?

972
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:38,050
You know, imagine the possibilities

985
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:22,480
I may not. This is my nine
inch dildo with movable balls.

986
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:25,590
Oh,
toms is a girl with a big one for me.

987
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:30,440
I would love to villagers be, this
is my light switch model. Yeah.

988
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,690
We'll movable type four inches too much.

989
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:38,700
I got the mold for you and it's
just flat out and it lays on that.

990
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,370
Imagine the possibility you can
use it to rest things on papers.

991
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,930
Uh, cause your baby teething. Use
the Thompson. You're a Dick Model.

992
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,580
Are you gonna buy me? I'm
nick a Jay hawks. If you
want it a little balls. Nick,

993
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:59,414
don't say

994
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:04,260
it's definitely nick. Uh,
do you want, do you want it?

995
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:09,290
No, I'll get it for you. Wears braces.
Did the other guys have one? No,

996
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:13,230
I don't think so. Oh, by that one? No,
I'm strictly friendly. I want you to,

997
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:17,160
I want you to, to meet that Guy
Tom, the guy with the paddle.

998
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:22,120
Yes. Yes. I want you to send
him a message. Would you? Yeah,

999
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:26,440
it's so it's a, I think it's always
interesting to me that people are so,

1000
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,010
so sexual. Like they, they, they're,

1001
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:33,820
they're comfortable making
videos at the world. Can See.

1002
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:38,470
Is that just me being uptight
genes about just about life,

1003
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:42,250
that I don't make videos about stuff
that I, I like if like if I were single,

1004
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:46,090
I don't think I can make videos
like that and be like, hey guys,

1005
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:50,290
who's into spanking? Or
No, no, but you have to,

1006
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:54,160
I guess if you're into
something this specific, right.
Is that why he's doing it?

1007
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:57,430
Because it's not like you can just go to
like a regular bar and meet people that

1008
01:07:57,431 --> 01:07:59,980
are in this crap. Yeah.
Yeah. That makes sense.

1009
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:04,790
Of course. Um, by the way, so
last week we played this, uh,

1010
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:08,900
the pathwell guy. Yeah. And he was, um,

1011
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,190
he was,
we were trying to translate it.

1012
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:16,760
It's probably the worst
version we've ever done. We've,

1013
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:21,710
we didn't come close to getting any of it,
you know. Well, I mean we couldn't, uh,

1014
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:25,490
we couldn't understand anything.
Yeah, it's tough one. Yeah. I mean

1015
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:31,950
for John Wilson.

1016
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,150
So
now you only have to be able to gain

1017
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,590
weight.
I prepared these

1018
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:49,390
and is English too. That's the crazy
part. It's yeah. Yeah. But yeah,

1019
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:54,160
it's um, it's pretty crazy. Heather. A
translated it for us. Oh cool. What is,

1020
01:08:54,161 --> 01:08:58,840
what is he saying? So she says
to my mommy's I'm Heather,
uh, Janine from Twitter,

1021
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:03,070
the girl that occasionally tweets like
my tweets making me feel like I got the

1022
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:07,720
highest and tightest jeans in
the universe. First thing's
first, Chris Jeans, uh,

1023
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:11,410
is the main mom and water champ.
No doubt about it.

1024
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:15,730
Tom, your great, but the lies must stop

1025
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,970
your Yorkie sipping lanes
like her already. Well,

1026
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:27,060
we're never accepting emails again
and now it's top of the line.

1027
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:29,290
Know now about the machete man.

1028
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:33,100
He is a Jamaican and I'm assuming that
people are recording him because his

1029
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:34,420
directions are horrible.

1030
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,340
I had to call my actual mom who's from
Trinidad to help them with the ending of

1031
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,910
this translation.
She was crying from laughter at Youtube.

1032
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,800
And if you find any more videos like
this one or the Trinidadian, um,

1033
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,720
from last year, we will be happy to
help. This is what we deciphered,

1034
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:54,580
guiding the car says, just tell me
one time again. Machete man says,

1035
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:56,020
yeah,
you have to go back.

1036
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:00,820
So in past the station and go
over the bridge and go back.

1037
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,030
So go down union, he passed. So, but he
goes, he passed so past, sorry. Right.

1038
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,980
Soap, go down, union, keep
following the road straight.

1039
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:12,580
Go across the bridge and go down
and keep going. Straight. Go on.

1040
01:10:12,581 --> 01:10:15,970
Don't bother to turn. And then the
guy in the car says, just go straight.

1041
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,440
Just past the, uh, the back,
the Balaclava, not sure.

1042
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,350
Balaklava station,
that's what I said.

1043
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,080
And go over the bridge and go
straight and you're going to go down,

1044
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:30,010
you're going to pass something,
uh, and you're going to go further.

1045
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,760
So that's basically what's going on here.

1046
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,020
Tell the one demo,

1047
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,170
go
suboxone

1048
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,530
candies.

1049
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,980
Classic Bridge.
Don't,

1050
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,690
nobody does go over

1051
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,363
Monday.

1052
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,070
I just want to heat up and go,
Shit.

1053
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:19,800
Fuck Outta here. Go Stalk you.

1054
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:24,090
Your Ego. You. Yeah.
Yeah. That guy's a male.

1055
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,300
Live in the same world. Isn't that
crazy? Yeah, it's the same language,

1056
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:31,830
but the different parts in
there. That's so wild. That's so,

1057
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:35,650
I still feel like that's a crazy one
myself for like the Irish people are you

1058
01:11:35,651 --> 01:11:39,870
reminds me a little year, right? Yeah.
I was thinking the same thing. You know,

1059
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,360
kind of built the same way.
Like I'm real muscular too.

1060
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:47,210
Um, oh, fit. Uh, here's another
email. Let's see. Watergate,

1061
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,950
2016 theory. Hey Mom, a couple
weeks ago, Tom Aka the water champ,

1062
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:54,970
wrong drop the bomb regarding
his Jewish ancestry.

1063
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:59,200
It makes so much sense. Ever since
wandering the desert for 40 years,

1064
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,480
the Jews had been a very thirsty people.

1065
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,600
No one or Tom drink so much fucking water.

1066
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:08,410
Most of the countries dealing with this
heat doe right now and we should all

1067
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:12,100
follow your lead and drink shit. Loads of
water. You're an inspiration. Keep it up.

1068
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:16,510
Shalom, Oakley and Shalom to
you Oakley. That's very true.

1069
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,100
Mm
hmm.

1070
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:26,410
You're such an imposter. Um, okay,

1071
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,660
so there's a,
I guess we should,

1072
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:32,100
by the way, when I did the
ice house this weekend, um,

1073
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,580
people were shouting that I was
the water champion. Okay. Whatever.

1074
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:39,220
I got so much more than you.
By the way,

1075
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:44,530
the spark let's machine was
out this morning since about
9:00 AM and then we sat

1076
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:47,140
down to record at ou
noon and you were like,

1077
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,320
can you bring me some water?
And I was like,

1078
01:12:50,321 --> 01:12:53,470
the spark let's machine's been
empty for hours. No, no you didn't.

1079
01:12:53,471 --> 01:12:58,471
No you didn't because you haven't been
hydrating since 9:00 AM three hours have

1080
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:01,510
gone by without you taking a sip of water.

1081
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,190
That's not true. I was, listen,
I was in the shower gulping down,

1082
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:11,220
shower water is disgusting phone
ring and it was La DWP and they said,

1083
01:13:11,411 --> 01:13:13,360
we're cutting off your water
supply because you drink so much.

1084
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,550
You're lying. No, I'm not. How
come you lie? Just so you know,

1085
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,270
I'm drinking backup water.
Mark Chrysler.

1086
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:24,000
I had drinking backup water that I just
had here for the last week and until the

1087
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,960
sparkle Bark Chrysler. Okay. Christ. So

1088
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,950
real quick update on that.
First of all,

1089
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,890
huge thanks to everybody,
uh,

1090
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:39,210
sending in, um, or buying a dispatcher.

1091
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,210
Really appreciate it. Thank
you so much for that. Um,

1092
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:49,410
I haven't released the tally because
I wanted to do it with Bertrand.

1093
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:54,030
I thought that'd be a fun way to do
it. Um, well, well we can, we can,

1094
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,280
we can end the,
the mystery.

1095
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:01,730
It is not a battle as a blue
band said it is a massacre.

1096
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:06,090
So wow. Uh, I can't give out the stats,

1097
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:10,500
but this shit is no
longer time. Yeah. Yeah.

1098
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,670
But I feel we all knew that in our hearts.

1099
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,520
Of course we knew it to Burt is
the fat one. Of course. Of course.

1100
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,800
So that's a real quick thing.
Also, aside from Bertrand,

1101
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,470
thank you to everybody
that got a double pipe,

1102
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:26,470
classic shirts turn restocked.
Uh,

1103
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,950
it's a beautiful shirt and it's a special
thing to celebrate with people in your

1104
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:34,610
life when you Bourbon Fart at
the same time, the DPC. Um,

1105
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:35,930
bye.
Can I tell you guys,

1106
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:40,730
I had a meeting with some executives
and a network and they're like,

1107
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:42,230
tell me about your mom's house.

1108
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:47,570
And I was like a Nice Lady and some Nice
Gentlemen, Gentlemen, Gentlemen. And um,

1109
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,550
and I was like, well,
you know, it's like say

1110
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,003
like,

1111
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:02,970
but I told a room full of executives
about the Cincinnati Fart and about bird.

1112
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:08,510
It's fat. It's less than a month away.
The number for the way. August 20. Yeah.

1113
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:12,080
What is the 20th? The 20th?
It comes out. Yeah. Anyway,

1114
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:16,910
I just thought that you'd like to
know that in your phones. August 20th,

1115
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:21,200
2016 the year anniversary
of the Cincinnati far. Yeah.
Yeah. It was pretty fun.

1116
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:25,240
Yeah. Describing it. You're
telling executive executive,
they're laughing, but no,

1117
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,010
they loved it. But it was like,
I can't believe I got to do that.

1118
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:32,090
How many times in your life do you get
to share a ridiculous story like that at

1119
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:33,920
a business meeting?
Did you lead in with

1120
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
a yeah,

1121
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:42,090
here's some, uh, some bird updates.

1122
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:47,670
Well, Joey fucked up to the
gills already understand me.

1123

That's okay.

1129
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,570
By the way, do you see
this haze around? Yeah,

1130
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,300

1131
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:18,830

early he gets up at like five 45,

1132
01:16:18,831 --> 01:16:23,180
six eating gummy bears and
just smokes like power.

1133
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:26,570
And this is before he had a baby, right?
Yeah. Always. Always been like this.

1134
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:30,500
But then does he go to bed at a reasonable
hour? I think reasonable, but yeah,

1135
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:34,140
but not, he's not a sleeper. He's one of
those people that can't sleep. Yeah, he's,

1136
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,280
he's a maniac.
But this is the best,

1137
01:16:37,281 --> 01:16:41,270

1236
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:02,280
The best piece, right? Yeah. They just do
