1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,413
Christina,

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,360
and here we are.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,910
Hi Bobby.
Hi Mom.

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,690
Hi Mom.
Hello.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,100
Disturbing.
I'm going to put that on Dr Drew's list.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,120
He would definitely have a
lot of empathy for that guy

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,260
because he was homeless. That guy. Yeah,
he's the homeless voice. Great Voice Guy.

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,110
Yeah. It's funny. Like
I was just going to go,

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,920
well what happened to him and then like
I know it's something bad. Right? Well,

11
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:54,820
I mean he probably got a big break and
manage your money and then he blew it on

12
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,760
drugs and now he's homeless again.
So yeah, it's kind of predictable.

13
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:00,730
You kind of pick up on these patterns.
It's pretty sad. It's pretty sad.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,430
It is sad. It is. That's pretty
sad. I mean, sure. It's hilarious.

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,050
Is it funny or sad? That's
Kinda, yeah, no, it's actually,

16
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,170
that should be the theme of all our
clubs. Is it, is it funny or sad?

17
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:18,300
I think it kind of is. Yeah. Um, yeah.

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,390
I'm going to ask me how my pee went.
Yeah, I'm sure people are dying to know.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,910
That's good. Thanks for asking.
Great. Seven months pregnant.

20
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,340
So I go a lot.
Yeah.

21
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,660
You didn't think well I was going to
add more toilet paper or the bedroom.

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,930
I knew you were going to bring this up.
I knew you were going to bring this up.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,010
How dare you. First of all, I had,

24
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,040
I keep that thing stocked all the time.
I bring up about,

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,050
I bring up an entire fucking case of
toilet paper. Yeah. You know what I mean?

26
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,430
I got back from dropping your kid off
and there was none there. Yeah. Well,

27
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,300
did you use the tissue?

28
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:55,130
There's a backup tissue box that
I put there for a reason. Yeah,

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,990
it's a backup system.
Why not stock it with the TP though?

30
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,340
Oh my God.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,340
Because we just ran out like this morning
at 4:00 AM I took my last wipe and

32
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:10,840
then I woke up at six 45 with a kid. It
wasn't the first thing on my list, Tom.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,900
Oh, why does it, why am I the
keeper of the 12 panel? It was gone.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,480
You're the keeper of the House. I,
I can't, I can't keep up laughing.

35
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,770
I got other stuff. I got dogs
diarrhea in the middle of the night.

36
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,560
I got seven months.
I'm so much pregnant.

37
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,330
I got toddler and my friend
visiting. It's a lot. All right,

38
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,710
so you want to,
God,

39
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,080
I should tell the story that I
want to fucking murder her. Yeah.

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,630
Christina proposed that.
Um, we kill our dog, Betsy.

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,780
We don't kill it.

42
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:45,370
All we need to do is let her loose in the
hills around here and there's a lot of

43
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:49,250
coyotes and if something were to
happen, I'm the psycho. I'm the psycho.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,080
I'm sitting here like, no babe, we can
figure it out. And you're like, no,

45
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,310
I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.
I'll tell you. Here's why. Uh,

46
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,790
the baby keeps me up a lot of nights too.
Like they cry a, I'm, I'm tired already.

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,030
You've been gone a lot.
This month has been hard. At
least once a month. This guy,

48
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:09,610
damn dog gets diarrhea and then now I'm
up at night taking her out two or three

49
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,970
times it,
I don't know what been the vet.

50
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,690
She's eat special food to
balance this problem out.

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,420
She gets diarrhea about once a month,
once a month,

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,960
and I don't know more than other dogs
had been. Of course the diarrhea,

53
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,740
but it's usually not that frequently.
It's not this consistent.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Got Dogs that I've been fif might get
it once every year and they eat the same

55
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,350
stuff that falls on the floor.
And here's the thing.

56
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,420
Yesterday is when she must've gotten it,

57
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,830
but I kept her away from all the
droppings from the foods a table. She,

58
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,630
there's no like,
I don't even know what she,

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,070
she can't get into trash because there's
no, there's no supply around her. I know.

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
I don't even know what she's doing.

61
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,170
She finds her way into things though
that you don't even think about.

62
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,870
I'm sure there's no access.
She has no access to these things.

63
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,020
I'm beginning to think it's
something inside of her that's wrong.

64
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,640
I don't think it's a diet.
I mean killer.

65
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,300
We'll definitely do away with
the problem like you're saying,

66
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:09,301
or letting her into the hills a little
14 pound Brussels Griffon just for a

67
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,250
night. If she survived,
she's, you're gone. Then she's
back. She's back in the fold.

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,680
She wouldn't live an hour outside of this
house. Now. I Know Eagle would get her.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,060
Oh so fast squirrel snatcher write up I,

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,550
I'm at a loss. I really don't
know. I don't know what is wrong.

71
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,780
It's like I can't, I can't be
up at night with two babies now.

72
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,990
And the fucking dog. That's the
thing. Yeah, I'm going crazy.

73
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,040
Some of you are probably watching.
You're noticing my Mickey mouse shirt.

74
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,130
Nobody's noticed it is real.

75
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,610
I do it because my son has taken to
loving Mickey mouse and it's a way to bait

76
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,060
him into affection.
So I bought a bunch of Mickey Mouse.

77
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,570
He really did this right
when I walk around the corner
for the first time in the

78
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,530
day, he's like Mickey and I
go, yeah, yeah, of course.

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,310
Of course. He gets all excited and it's
worked so far it's work. He's like,

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,090
and then every once in awhile
he'll read notice and be like,

81
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,760
you got Mickey on your shirt. And
I'm like, yeah dude. It's how I roll.

82
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,540
He loved it and then I don't wear it. And
he's like the fucks up with your shirt.

83
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,730
Yeah. Cause he's strictly making
right now. Yeah. Pretty cool.

84
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:24,670
And he sleeps nothing like segway
from that into our opening clip. He,

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,110
Ms Tom Leykis. Okay, perfect.

86
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,980
There it is. Did you like the
clip? That was it. That was it.

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,760
You liked it. Let's try that again.
Let's try it out. Try it out. Try it out.

88
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,890

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,280
a lot of us veteran guys could give
this speech ourselves if we want.

97
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,460
It might be better for you to hear it
from one of your kind, you know? Yeah.

98

Hopefully you'll take notes. Yeah,

Hopefully you'll eating ass.
Also known as tossing the salad.

Rimming cleaning the kitchen,

anal Lingus and Colo sex is
actually pretty simple. Step one,

102
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,420
ask your partner your ass hole.
The next time I go down on you.

103
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,670
How would you feel if I made out with
your butt while you masturbate? Wow,

104
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,920
she's cool.
I like her.

105
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:52,450
You know it's interesting to me is people
that call themselves sex experts now,

106
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,160
he's not even really necessary.
I mean given the internet,

107
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,590
you can just Google like just like this.

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,310
I want you to ask me exactly the way
she said this one. Sure, go ahead.

109
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,370
Whereas I go down on you.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,600
How would you feel if I made out with
your butt while you masturbate? Yeah.

111
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,840
How would you hold on.

112
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,610
How would you feel if I made out with
your butt while you masturbate? Cool.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,220
Let's do it right now like that.
That'd be my answer.

114
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:23,221
How would you feel if I made out
with your butt while you master,

115
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:24,580
but I feel great about it.

116
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,940
Did you ever think that I would put those
words together in a sentence like ever,

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,050
ever. I never 41 years.
Never said that before.

118
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,890
He's a super cool chick so she
doesn't look like the type to eat ass,

119
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,750
which is might be a she.

120
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,740
She kind of comes under the radar like
you meet her for a drink and you're like,

121
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,740
oh maybe she'll kiss. And then she's
like, well we didn't make out what you're,

122
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:49,480
but while you dropped off, how'd
you feel if I may go step two,

123
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,550
once you have consent,
it's time to get ready.

124
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,880
Avoid giving anything bad to their asshole
and getting anything bad from their

125
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:57,610
asshole. Here are the infections
that can go from mouth to anus,

126
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,240
anus to Matt herpes, gonorrhea
and chlamydia, HIV, syphilis,

127
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:05,530
hepatitis a and hepatitis B. Lastly,
gastrointestinal problems and parasites.

128
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,640
Light basically the things that cause
food poisoning might be hanging out and

129
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:13,340
you don't want to put those in your body.
So here's a good heads up.

130
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:17,560
But what's I could, I wish I had like a,
these things right here make me think.

131
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,460
Don't necessarily just eat
a stranger's ass. Yeah.

132
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,720
I mean without this I would have been
like you should, but now I feel like shit,

133
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,330
you should, you should meet people
right away. But now I'm like, oh,

134
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,670
I didn't know you could get all these
things that you should discriminate a

135
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:36,790
little, a little bit, a
little bit, but not that much.

136
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Where are you the kind that would just
toss salad willy nilly with girls it out?

137
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,320
No, I'm not just handed out for
sure, but I mean, I dunno if she,

138
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,690
you know, she looked like she
didn't have those in and then, yeah,

139
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,500
if she looked like she doesn't have
those, well here's the thing. I mean,

140
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:57,780
I wouldn't ask for a blood panel. I would
see this nasty girl. She nasty as hell,

141
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,890
but he's not nasty, but she looks like a
nice girl. So this girl, you'd be like,

142
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,720
she's,
she doesn't even do all this stuff,

143
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,250
but she does and she doesn't do a lot
of want to know. I mean, I can just,

144
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,230
I don't have any STDs. I wonder. Yeah.

145
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,150
I wonder how, I know it was quite common
to have a lot of these things. Yeah.

146
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,260
Do like, do you just like,
uh, do you volunteer it?

147
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,900
Like when you feel like it's about
to go down? I think you have to,

148
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,490
I think he knows that
that's gotta be like,

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,440
I feel like that'd be an immediate
does then that just kill the queue. Um,

150
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,670
no because I mean I know people that
have these things and relationships and I

151
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,150
think, I think it's more the relationship
talk. Well yeah, that's what I'm saying.

152
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:38,640
That's different though. What about when
you just meet someone and you're like,

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,680
it's each other's asses. Wait,
but I've got hepatitis A, B,

154
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,680
syphilis, HIV, chlamydia
and gastrointestinal.

155
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,810
I got all these things.

156
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,550
Well I think there are people out
there that are like, that's the,

157
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,270
that's the risk I'm going to take.
I remember this,

158
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,040
I remember how upset he got.

159
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,060
He hooked up with somebody that we
knew and then after they were done,

160
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:09,380
she was like, I got to tell you something.
And he was like, what? Because I have, um,

161
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,070
no, that's not a big deal.
He was like, what? Oh my God.

162
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,110
Cause I have that thing that everyone
has. And he goes, what do you,

163
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:21,030
what do you have? Herpes? What do you
mean everyone has, she goes, well,

164
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:23,910
a lot of people have it and he's like,
why don't you say it before we get it,

165
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,760
before we did it, but then he didn't. He
got, he didn't get anything. Let's see.

166
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,100
Yeah.

167
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,460
Some people say that's just the calculated
risk you take for being with that

168
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:35,730
person and you just wear a condom
and that's the risk. Not a big deal.

169
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:39,290
I don't think in a relationship. I'm
talking about one night stand. Yeah,

170
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,920
the one night stand.
It's a calculated risk.

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,380
It tells you how this maybe I'm not
broken out right now. There's no outfit,

172
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,510
but at least saying it is a big thing.
Disclose.

173
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,630
I think it's your moral duty
about a lot of people don't.

174
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,850
That's how things get spread.
See,

175
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:57,000
that's why I wasn't promiscuous
in the nineties before I met you.

176
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,540
I swear this is the only reason I
was in a hoe. I mean not the only,

177
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,560
but I was so afraid to get in all
this stuff, man, and now look,

178
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:08,840
now we're two virgins together. You sure
got hoes fucking uniform. All right,

179
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:09,870
let go that next one.

180
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,810
Step three set of time.

181
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,470
I'm sure you don't want to go down on
someone and find a dingleberry of poop and

182
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,040
pubes sticking your ass hole.
Watch your bowel movements.

183
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,770
Healthy ones look like this.
Unhealthy ones look like this.

184
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,630
Shower and wash your
whole bucket with soap,

185
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,260
especially the anus and all those little
crevices that make it look like a star.

186
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,120
Stay outside though.
Don't go inside.

187
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,230
Oh again, she's with the, she had to tell
you to stay outside. Just like that guy.

188
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,630
He's like,
you want to figure us?

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,290
Don't put your finger in your
household setting at time.

190
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,740
Feel like a little bit of a mood killer.
What are you talking about? She's like,

191
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:46,760
set a time like fake, like I want to
your ass. Cool. Do it at seven no,

192
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:51,480
I think that's really cool because I feel
like you've demanded things like how I

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,630
want to put my mouth on stuff. I'm
like, hey bro, I just came from a hike.

194
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,990
My crotch smells like a zoo.

195
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,080
Do you think you could not put
your mouth on my parts right now?

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,270
Can we make an appointment and then
you can do this when I'm clean. No,

197
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,110
because I remember the last

198
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,210
peg that I did that too.
You know,

199
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,300
I just met her at a bar and you
know we had more drinks and then,

200
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,270
but that was probably a big
contributor was drinking. Yeah, no,

201
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,620
that I think about it.
Yeah cause you don't,

202
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,400
you lose your sense of taste and stuff
and judgment and your, your brain,

203
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:28,720
you're like, yeah go for it. Go, go
for it. Go for it. Doesn't matter.

204
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,373
My brain done.

205
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,490
It's funny cause like my brain didn't
when I was in college and stuff.

206
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:37,000
I never sacked guy's stuff just willy
nilly. I'm never, do you know that?

207
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:41,020
I've never put my mouth on just
a rogue, a painter. I've never,

208
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,530
not once. Not only a
stranger's Dick. Okay,

209
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,310
well one of us is not
very adventurous stuff.

210
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,710
Four, acquire some dams
for a layer of protection.

211
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,190
They reduce the risk of all the bugs I
mentioned earlier and cover up the smell

212
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:54,090
and taste of asshole.

213
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,920
Well, there's the, isn't that the
biggest deterrent of them all?

214
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,360
The smell and the taste of the asshole.

215
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,801
The,

216
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:03,480
you mean it's the biggest
fucking seducer of Brill.

217
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,980
Yeah, of course. What do you mean if you
don't have the taste, what are you doing?

218
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,370
You want it to be doing a little Tang.
You don't necessarily want,

219
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:18,720
it's super tiny, but
ah, you just want to go.

220
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,400
Why can't you just have like a clean ass?

221
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,350
It's not possible for you.
Cause I know where this is going.

222
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,800
This is all for you,
but you don't have a clean ass.

223
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,760
There's no way you can because
of the amount of hair and
sweat cleaner right now.

224
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,290
It's not possible.

225
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,350
Trim it too. And then you can
just do what's possible with you.

226
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,880
You're so Harry, Harry and gross. Hmm.

227
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,540
Step five with all preparation in place,
play, play with all sorts of body parts,

228
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,960
kiss, massage, whatever it takes
to get all riled up before.

229
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:52,900
Okay,

230
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,120
go for step six.
When you lightly blow on the Asshole,

231
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,730
the blowing will not only
light up this sensitive spot,

232
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,290
it will walk the smell toward you.

233
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,530
So you can evaluate whether or
not you want to proceed. Oh,

234
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,960
that's okay. That's actually
a good tactic. You see that

235
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,010
I'm too, I blocked it out. What
did she say? She's saying yes

236
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,720
below towards it and then
as you blow towards it,

237
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,640
your airway hit the asshole.

238
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,830
Some of the air will come back
and if there's a a scent to it.

239
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,790
Yeah, I mean I just generally I engage
in practices where there's like, no,

240
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't have to do that. What
do you mean preliminary? Well,

241
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,370
how would you know then? No,
I'm just saying that I don't,

242
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:35,200
I just stay away from activities that it
has to do this much preparation for any

243
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,910
activity that does this.
What it sounds like,

244
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:40,270
it's a lot like I have to find
out if this person has STDs.

245
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,920
I have a fine after
that to clean their ass.

246
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,330
I think the worst was the dental dam and
she's like, Hey, like imagine you're,

247
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,220
you're like, I'm going to eat
that ass. And I'm like, hold on,

248
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,470
let me get this dental dam out.

249
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,900
Why? Oh No, just see. That's how I would
prefer to do it. On somebody. All right.

250
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:59,420
Why don't we start with that?
I'll get a dental dam and then

251
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,360
can I wait until I'm not pregnant?
I don't want to do, I'd throw out.

252
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,710
I mean that's kind of the real for me.

253
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,120
That's a whole genre of porn, right?
Pregnant lady eating some guys,

254
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,100
but I'm sure I'll look
it up later to confirm.

255
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,280
So nasty. What's wrong with people,
man? Yeah, but she's right about that.

256
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,550
That's a good tactic.
I can't blow a little air towards it.

257
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,700
It just seems so labor intensive for loop
and put a dam in place and had enough

258
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:34,000
lube to keep things soft, but not so
much that the anus thinks it's leaking.

259
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,430
Yeah. It's a lot of thinking. It's too
much. Yeah. What? I just do it to them,

260
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,760
it's do normal things.

261
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:45,180
Step eight don't literally eat ass unless
your partner is into a poking feeling

262
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:48,570
out of nowhere. I recommend working
your way to the anus from the buttock,

263
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:51,390
from the genitals to the
paraniem inner thighs and up,

264
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,700
kissing and touching
with your hands licking.

265
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:57,300
If you liked writing the cheeks and going
straight in for asshole can feel quite

266
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:58,134
jarring.

267
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,710
Hmm. Sounds like you've experienced. No,
I just, I did feel that it's from her too.

268
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,100
I was like, Ooh, she
really knows what she is.

269
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,240
Once you're at the site, think licking
gentle sucking, kissing and tickling.

270
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,960
Even making contact and not moving
at all can be incredibly arousing.

271
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,120
The anus is densely
packed with nerve endings.

272
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:21,050
That's part of a concentrated area of
erogenous tissue and it's slightly taboo.

273
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,170
So there's a thrilling adventure and
doing something pleasurable that society

274
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,010
tells us not to.

275
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,630
How many people you think that are
watching her really need to wash her?

276
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:33,820
In other words, do you need the full
lesson of how to do this? I guess a lot,

277
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:35,710
right?
So that means somebody who's,

278
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,820
who feels like they're really benefiting
from it. I clearly, but like I said,

279
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:42,040
like do we need another
sexpert in the world?

280
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:46,420
I feel like you could just Google this
shit. How do I eat acid? It comes up now,

281
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:48,850
but it's been covered. You
know what I mean? I Dunno.

282
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,610
I've never heard of discussed this way.
So there was,

283
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,230
to me it feels pretty intuitive. I mean,
except for the blowing thing. That's a,

284
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,093
that's a tip.

285
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,530
But a wash your ass wash your ass is
if you don't know to do that. Yeah,

286
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:06,880
don't eat. Don't literally eat someone's
ass. It's kind of intuitive. No Shit.

287
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,710
Yeah. Choose someone's be
whole. Yeah. I don't know, Eh,

288
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,060
it's not my thing, Tom. It's just not my
thing. It's never going to be my thing.

289
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:16,894
We're going to get you into it.

290
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,930
Check in. I'm not staring. Ask Your
partner questions wetter deeper.

291
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,320
You could ask any
questions like how is it?

292
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:28,660
But getting a yes or no answer means
you're not caught up in conversation when

293
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,640
they likely want your mouth getting
back to business. Okay. I have,

294
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,490
I'm getting a little nauseous
from licking butts holes.

295
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,230
I can't even fathom
how many fucking steps this woman have.

296
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,840
Anal Lingus is hopefully
pleasurable for everyone involved.

297
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:50,160
If you're not into it,
consider 69 so you're getting oral sex to,

298
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
or any new position for that matter.
You know what she,

299
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,050
she should have talked about the,
uh,

300
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,420
the squat and sit where like you lay on
your back and then a guy steps over your

301
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,610
face,
squashed down,

302
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,750
puts his mouth parts disaster
directly in your mouth. And then

303
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,510
I can't think of anything more
overwhelming. Can you even imagine?

304
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,070
That's a beautiful thing.

305
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,030
I remember my parents telling me
about it the first time. Can you,

306
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,230
I can only imagine because I
have like, I have, you know,

307
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,820
just like squeeze your butt cheeks and
stuff and I have felt the heat that comes

308
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,170
out of that region with you.

309
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,700
Like I can just imagine like
the heat that and the hair. Oh,

310
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,133
it's nice.

311
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,840
I can sell and that you have to
hold a squat for a while. Yeah.

312
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,640
Yeah.
You got to hold it for awhile.

313
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,380
Why don't we do the Hammock trek that
that guy did? And Venezuela. Oh yeah,

314
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,860
the macafee the,
yeah,

315
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,040
you cut a hole out of the hammock and
then you can kind of squat on that.

316
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,810
And then that's just to make brown though.

317
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:56,280
He wanted the girls to Brown in his mouth.

318
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,430
And the way you can also do it for Butler
taking I guess there's a tip she liked

319
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,740
to watch these really gross.
That's a whole other level.

320
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:08,230
Speaking to Browning. Um, lot of people,

321
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:12,270
a lot of people weighing in on the
poop pile. Your time is over man.

322
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,830
Defecation and yeah cause
you've been found out. Uh,

323
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,950
you know some people
said Oh you there was a,

324
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,930
would you rather when you said you
didn't want to poop outside and yeah,

325
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,270
cause I'm thinking of of it as
open up the side of the street.

326
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,140
Like,

327
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,920
like that's what we were talking about
in India as people just shitting on the

328
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,210
side of the road. That to me is
different than the poop pile,

329
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:40,740
which was just like a almost
like a spiritual event.

330
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,393
Yeah.

331
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,660
You know what I think is the most Yana
compelling evidence against you poo poo

332
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,690
pile is the way that
you described the setup.

333
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,620
Now I would like one of our listeners
to go back into the vaults and maybe dig

334
00:19:55,621 --> 00:20:00,621
up the audio of the first time you
described exactly how the poop pile wet

335
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:04,170
because I'm pretty sure you've
described it differently. No,

336
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,090
it wasn't this time. You said there was
a uh, uh, steps hammered to a tree. Yeah,

337
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,760
that's true. The first time you
just said, you said it was a ladder.

338
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,730
What's a makeshift ladder?
Oh,

339
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:19,710
so is it a tree with steps cut put into
it or a make shift lumps and calling

340
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:23,100
that a makeshift ladder?
The steps nailed into the tree.

341
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,420
That's to me is a tree ladder.
That, that specific thing.

342
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:31,830
It's a tree that we put steps on. Well,
yeah, that's true. It is. In essence,

343
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,150
it's a tree that you
guys would shut out of,

344
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,740
but there was no mention of a tree
up until this last time. He's a tree.

345
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,810
That's what we had the tree. What do
you mean there's no mention of a tree?

346
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,480
I don't, Yana, I don't recall any
mention of a tree. Well you don't,

347
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,240
luckily for you, for me,
for all of our listeners,

348
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,590
I was able to spend time this weekend
with somebody I live with during the poop

349
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,650
highlighter and I brought
it to his attention.

350
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,920
You mentioned to me like bring
it to his attention. So I did.

351
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,060
And he's just going to lie to

352
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,270
all right case.
Um,

353
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,510
there's been a lot of controversy lately
about whether the poop pile is real and

354
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:15,370
as somebody who lived
with me in that time,

355
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:20,170
can you comment on too as to
whether it was racial or not?

356
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,230
Poop pile is definitely real.
Um,

357
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,530
I mean it was something
that everybody took part in.

358
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,370
It wasn't just me and Tom
and Justin had a roommate,

359
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,570
but it was like a neighborhood thing.

360
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:35,470
Kids would come over and
that I get excited and tell
their kids they come around

361
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,720
over. But we had, I mean,

362
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,340
we had the ladder and kind of in the
back where the tree was the climb up,

363
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,010
everybody would take a dump pile up.

364
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,670
I mean Poopa yeah,
I mean,

365
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,800
now what about the accusation that
it as guys are that age in college,

366
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,360
there's no way we would do that
because it would deter, you know,

367
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,260
girls from coming over. So we were
trying to get late. No, definitely not.

368
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,570
It never happened.
I mean that was,

369
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,820
that was what that was our
thing is what we're known for.

370
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,130
Never stop you just for,

371
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,740
it's like that's the poop
powerhouse. Yeah. Let's go get laid.

372
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,083
Yeah.

373
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,950
And sometimes even they would
want it definitely happened. Yeah.

374
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,440
The definitely some ladies
goofed off the poop pile ladder.

375
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,330
It's not as gross or crazy as it
sounds to me. It was normal. I mean,

376
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:31,570
everybody did it. So it was just
what we did. So I never felt out of,

377
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,020
I never questioned anything.
So, yeah. And how often did you,

378
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,230
what'd you say you participated?
Because sometimes it would happen.

379
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,390
I remember I wasn't there. You
can't force your shit. Right.

380
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,730
So when they call the poop
pile call and they just,

381
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,060
the pill that poupon was stolen or
whatever, you want to take a shit,

382
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,120
you don't go, just stay up
there until you mean you just,

383
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:51,240
you don't anticipate that time. But there
was so many poo piles. I mean, yeah,

384
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,100
it's like everybody got a turn that was
for sure. Like everybody got a shot. Yeah.

385
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,630
And um hmm.
I'm trying to think.

386
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:01,840
I mean logistically I was
trying to explain, you know,

387
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:06,040
the kind of the makeshift ladder in
the tree and you climb out. Yeah.

388
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,850
We had like the, like we had an actual
toilet seat at the end of the tree. Right.

389
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,040
And then it felt totally normal.
I mean,

390
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,600
you sat down and told that you
had the bar to hold on to poop.

391
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,250
I mean it was just, people
don't realize it. Like for the,

392
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,340
for kids it was really a fun,
like come on, do it. I mean,

393
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:25,170
what kid doesn't love to just drop
a poop, right? Yeah. It's like,

394
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,290
I was like going on a rollercoaster.
You have it to you.

395
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,080
You have an almost two year
old and a three year old.

396
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,850
What happens when you say the word Fart?
Yeah,

397
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:35,560
they laugh or poop like so they loved
it. They loved it. Kids loved it.

398
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,200
The other neighborhood, like
men definitely loved it and
I almost feel like, yeah,

399
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,640
I think women were intrigued by it.

400
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,800
It was a pretty cool for sure.
Thanks for verifying this stuff.

401
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,440
Poop pile dude. Can you do,
can you remember the call?

402
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:56,210
Like what does it sound like when we
left the whereby? No, I feel like I,

403
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:59,930
for some reason I feel like Justin
called out the most like, cause he had,

404
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:02,180
he would really have a,
he had a good like yelling voice.

405
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,450
He was he a yeller and he would be like,
Oh I probably just screaming

406
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,260
like that. People would dark, dark. It's
like the ice cream truck came through.

407
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,360
Exactly. And they were just were like,
I gotta do this too. Yeah. Very cool.

408
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,010
Not a farm mark.

409
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,880
Yana allow me to present
Casey's testimony,

410
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,480
if I may quote him verbatim.
Now you presented the poop pile,

411
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,170
last week's drawing such that there
were steps nailed on a tree. Yeah.

412
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,130
So as you put it,
a make shift letter.

413
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Now Mr. Casey and his testimony right
now said we had the latter kind of back

414
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,800
where the tree was. Now those are two
separate items. I rest my case. No,

415
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,700
he's saying there's a separate ladder
kind of bad saying there's a separate lab

416
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,910
quote and I quote,

417
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:02,710
we had the ladder kind of
back where the tree was.

418
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,390
So now in Casey's reminiscences
recollection if you
will about the poop out

419
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,140
there was a ladder kind of backward. The
tree was now in your drawing last week.

420
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,890
Yeah. Nail Lubeck can bring it
up. Yeah. As I'm saying this,

421
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,120
you had individual steps like a
tree house nailed up. Yeah. Now,

422
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:22,660
which wasn't liar pants. No.
Here's the thing. No, no, no, no.

423
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,670
Those are two separate ways.
No.

424
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:28,900
Cause you could lay a ladder
against the tree as well. You could,

425
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:32,260
but you didn't know. I always use the
steps that were nailed to the tree.

426
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,570
But if you wanted to join somebody up
there, maybe somebody who was climbing it,

427
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,020
you put the ladder against the tree.
No two people going up.

428
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,320
He didn't mention that.
Now Casey's testimony did not say that.

429
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,170
Sometimes there was two of us up there.
First of all, there's no mention.

430
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,900
Never have two people pulling.
Oh, sometimes there was half.

431
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:48,130
Or how is that possible?

432
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,850
Because you would all hang off of that
branch and wait for wanting off of that

433
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,430
rent there.
You said there was only one bar right?

434
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:55,670
That you could hold onto throwing.

435
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,930
You're telling me that two grown men
are going to share a little bar and hang

436
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,600
their asses off one branch.
No, you're misunderstanding.

437
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,200
Somebody is sitting on
somebody's sitting to shit.

438
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,510
Persons facing him like watching him.
Okay. They switched seats. One one's done.

439
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,680
So one person's holding in their
Shit and coaching the other. This is,

440
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,461
first of all,

441
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:21,460
this is the first time
you've ever mentioned this
scenario happens all the time.

442
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,900
All the time. Yeah. Uh, I'm
just saying that right now,

443
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:30,901
Casey's testimony of what
it even physically looked
like doesn't sound or what

444
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:35,440
you like, what you drew. You mean I'm
going to get video of it at some point.

445
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:38,890
I'm sure video of what? People
pooping off of it. So you can,

446
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,060
you think of hoophouse still exists.
Shut up. It was legendary. Where is it?

447
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,290
Where, where it's in North Carolina. It's
in North Carolina, was where I lived.

448
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,730
Where, where else would it, do you,

449
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,760
you think that the person who now lives
in this place maintained this ridiculous

450
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:00,270
thing? I'm sure when they heard stories
about it, they wanted to see what was up.

451
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,373
Yeah.

452
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,230
I like to interview these alleged children
that ran to the scene number pile.

453
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,460
Okay. Why don't they come forward?
I'm sure somebody knows somebody.

454
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,020
The magic of the Internet.
Sure.

455
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,740
You found the bikes kid through
the magic of the Internet. Um,

456
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,320
somebody wanted me to bring up your Moose.

457
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,930
Is this your unbelievable
the lies and this house.

458
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,940
Somebody submits their market. I'm
going to get a metal, a metal detector.

459
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,230
A lie detector. Yeah. We're going
to get to the bottom of this.

460
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,170
I'm over it supposed to be an impression
of the moose soup lady. I remember her.

461
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,923
Okay.

462
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,350
So let's see if this guy
has a good impression.

463
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,180
It's pretty good. Except that the
audio doesn't line up with the video.

464
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,640
I was confused if he was playing the real,
but that was good.

465
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,880
I thought he was playing the real, I know.
That was really, why does it line up?

466
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,000
Because that would indicate
that it's not real.

467
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,433
Hmm.

468
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,790
That's pretty. If it is
him, that was really good.

469
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,243
I know.

470
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,990
Tom, you're there. Yeah, that was great.

471
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,690
Good job, Austin. Before I forget,

472
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,550
I forgot to put it on our
show last week only online.

473
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,320
I posted it and it still blew up
the fucking new try it out. Shirt.

474
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,800
It's right. Yeah. So I didn't even realize
it because the guy was like, he uh,

475
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,600
he messaged me, he was like, oh, people
are 11 to try it out shirt. And I go, oh,

476
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:01,700
I only posted it online. We
didn't. Uh, there it is. Try it out

477
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,600
your mom's house podcast.
Try it out in the middle.

478
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,250
We also made a women's shirt,
so try it out.

479
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,360
Women's cut, try it out. Shirt is
that, it's kind of trot out inside Joe.

480
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,160
Work friendly. It's kid friendly.
You can wear it anywhere.

481
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,010
Nobody's going to be offended or you
know, creeped out. Just trying to,

482
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,170
it's very life affirming. Very positive.
Yeah. And it's also shows like,

483
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,120
have you not listened to this
podcast chart out the shot? You know,

484
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,240
it's interesting Tom,
is that the try it out.

485
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:38,241
Guy has made his rounds into our
heart over and over and over again.

486
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:41,860
And before you left for
this last trip to yeah,

487
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,220
we kind of rediscovered him
as a couple. Yeah, it's true.

488
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,900
It's like some clips that the over time
they kind of unfold and give us more and

489
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:54,280
more meaning why you're right. And I also
realized that there was parts of, uh,

490
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,870
what he was saying that I was
glancing over, glass it over.

491
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,260
So that's another blast. Like I really
need to pull. Here's the deal, man.

Well, it's going to be,

512
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,450
and it's like he's really
been ruminating on this. Yeah.

513
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,040
And you know when you're fight,
like you,

514
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,790
you lay in bed at night and you sometimes
think of a confrontation you're going

515
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,270
to have with somebody in the next day.
Yeah.

516
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,820
And you're a kind of lining
up your arguments. Like
that's what he's been doing.

517
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,350
Good. Sitting on this brand on a minute.
I think we should do a quick pause.

518
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,210
Our friend a wheeler Walker Jr is Co.
Okay,

519
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,770
so why don't we take a quick
pause and go see what, try it out.

520
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,150
Try it out with them and we are back.

521
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,820
We uh,
of course you don't know we po.

522
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,370
I like how I act like a little
time has passed to them. Um,

523
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,490
but we are rejoined by,

524
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:49,200
our friend of the show has been
here before Mr. Wheeler Walker Jr.

525
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,960
Thanks [inaudible] up guys.
Thanks for having me Christina.

526
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,310
So excited to have you back. Jay Dad
mouth. That's correct. I want to champion.

527
00:31:56,311 --> 00:32:00,220
Good to see you. Good. Hey, wait,
what did you just say? Water champion.

528
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,750
He's a water champion. Of course. I
saw on the news you slept on the news.

529
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,740
What News? It's, it's been on the news
before. Have you heard of the poop pile?

530
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,040
You're from the south. The poop pile? No,
I don't know. I mean I know it. Poo is,

531
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,070
I don't want piles are done.

532
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:17,071
You ever heard of grown men building
like a tree house ladder and then hanging

533
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:20,760
off of it and pulling in the same pile
together? What do you think of that?

534
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,890
Sounds like a good weekend. We did and
guess where I did it in North Carolina,

535
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,750
which, yeah, I mean, I mean I had never
heard of it, but I'm like, if you,

536
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:31,770
if you said let's do it now, I'd put
the microphone down, we'd get weed.

537
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,860
I didn't do it. And if I told
you he existed in the Carolinas,

538
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,060
you probably be like, that sounds
believable. If you, if you guessed me,

539
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:40,070
which state I probably,
what does it do? You Play

540
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,970
Carolina. You must, right?
Yeah, we've done a few times.
I'm going back there, um, uh,

541
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,490
soon. I told you before
we started recording, I'm,

542
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm talking with kid rock in the fall and
I think we're doing somewhere in North

543
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,130
Carolina. I forget. They told me the dates
and then that's going to be a fun tour,

544
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:58,160
man. Yeah, it's crazy. What's,
what's cool about it for me,

545
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:02,030
which is a new thing for me,
is there, it's country artist,

546
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,820
which is probably different. I don't
know what it's like for, for Comedians,

547
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:09,630
but it's, we do, it's weekends only.
Yeah. So I'll be in Nashville. Oh wait.

548
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,940
You know, so we get on the bus Thursday
night or Friday, whatever. So yeah,

549
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,490
it's just like a living a normal life
and then you get to go to her on the

550
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,570
weekends. It'll be fun. Yeah. That's going
to be awesome, man. That what you do,

551
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,190
you guys do

552
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,720
pretty much. Pretty much.
Yeah. It's a weekend. Yeah.
Weekend Gig. Yeah. Which, ah,

553
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,950
fuck, that's, that's what makes
it tolerable. Really. Yeah. Well,

554
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:31,350
years be like week after week after week,
or would it be like,

555
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,910
right. Yeah, I think we're, it's, it'll
be total of three months of three months.

556
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:40,380
Yeah. Wow. It's a long tour, but it's, uh,
it's going to be fun man. Cause I mean,

557
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:44,250
that's why I give, I'm giving him some
credit because you know, when I, you know,

558
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:48,630
I was in, you know, making
the first record, I'm playing,
you know, fuck you bitch,

559
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:51,000
sit on my face to me these
sound like arena songs.

560
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:54,750
But then the reality of the world
kind of kicked in. I'm like, Ma, you,

561
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,300
I started playing clubs. Like, you know,
maybe arenas aren't going to happen.

562
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,210
And then when they got the
call like you can't, you know,

563
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,610
you didn't how much they're
going to laugh it off.

564
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,420
And also the coolest thing will be people.

565
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,170
There's going to be people for
sure at the show who were like, oh,

566
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:13,390
like who's his opening act? Who
is that you got? And then holy,

567
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,600
there's gonna be people
who get there early,

568
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,950
just who want to get, you know,
situated with their fucking hot dog.

569
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:18,800
And they're absolutely,

570
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,530
they're parents and they're
going to hear me singing like,

571
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,420
what the fuck is going on?

572
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:27,060
Like when they hear the pussy king,
um, I dunno. I think you're going to,

573
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,140
you're going to win a lot
of new fans on this thing.

574
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,831
Yeah.
And that's a,

575
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:32,700
that's a good thing about music because
I either win the fans over or I,

576
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,900
when you, if I don't win them over,
I certainly make an impression. Yeah.

577
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,210
They'll know. They'll know your name.
Yeah. Yeah. They'll, they'll, or they'll,

578
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,750
it was like the old hat, you know, I think
it was the Howard stern thing, which is,

579
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:45,780
you know, the people like you,
you don't tell one person,

580
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,430
people don't like you
tell it like 50 people.

581
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,270
Yeah.

582
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,220
I'd be going nuts if I was at a show and
I didn't know who you were and I heard

583
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,860
these songs, I would be the
guy who was like, I got,

584
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,930
I'd be buying your album in the fucking,

585
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,040
in the audience that right then and there
or do you have any songs about eating

586
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,250
ass?
Can we just,

587
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,750
um, no. Uh, well look, I'm going
to be making my third record soon,

588
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:09,000
but I've got to get into that,
right?

589
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:09,971
Yeah.

590
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:13,690
I mean we were just talking about this
and one of the things we talked about

591
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:16,960
that we saw a sexpert give advice on,

592
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,390
like bringing it up and
preparing for it and she,

593
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,200
she suggested like a dental dam and I was
like, that kind of is a, I don't know.

594
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:28,360
I think that's kind of a mood killer.
Yeah.

595
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:31,930
I mean it seems like you're not
really doing it well. I don't know.

596
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:35,920
I didn't like her approach to the
ask. It was like, how did it go again?

597
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Do you mind if I make out with your

598
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,230
butt while you masturbate? That was
one of her ways of bringing it up. Yes.

599
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,080
Explain to me what a dental dam is.

600
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,000
Isn't it just a piece of plastic that
you put over a vagine or an a hole and

601
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:52,930
then you, that's how your tongue, your
tongue, Lex plastic or rubber latex.

602
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,200
I don't know the definition of be nice,
but I can't count.

603
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,610
He must be just crushing box on the road.
You're a musician.

604
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,270
You have all these songs, uh,
that are sexual in nature.

605
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,310
Is it everything you dreamed of?
Well, I got a girlfriend so it's not,

606
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,440
and um,
I'll be honest,

607
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:14,010
I thought that was kind of a thing in
the industry that you're not supposed to

608
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:16,570
say here with a woman. Cause well I
think John Lennon wasn't supposed to.

609
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,410
He had a wife, but I ain't
the Beatles. I'm not,

610
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,580
you know how long you been with
this girl? Over a year. I mean it's,

611
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,970
and it's actually real, like I was talking
about, it's nice to, you know, yeah.

612
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,260
To not have to deal with,

613
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,910
he's like fucking road skanks getting
backstage and shit like that. And

614
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:39,490
then it's just like, you know, so,
so and so wants to go backstage,

615
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:40,540
told him to fuck off,
you know,

616
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,330
I can't imagine how be
different, I mean, stand up.

617
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,410
It really, you know, there are
Comedians who their, their act

618
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,850
is basically,
it's cording get like they're,

619
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,780
it's an attempt to get laid with
their whole thing is, I mean it's not,

620
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,880
it's not laid out as in I'm
doing this to meet chicks,

621
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:05,310
but that's what they're doing,
you know, and, and they,

622
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,240
they do their set and it
is an attempt to get laid.

623
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,760
But it's so different
than music where music is,

624
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,450
it cannot be in your idea of your
mindset of this is why I'm doing this.

625
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:22,310
But I think when people see musicians
perform, you know, men and women,

626
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,870
yeah,
just do it.

627
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,800
It's probably just different
audience people screaming
and drunk and stuff. Sure.

628
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,760
But I'll bet who are the like, you
know, what's the word I'm looking for?

629
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:32,610
Puente crushers and not, you can't
say their names, but it's probably,

630
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,840
it's probably like the dudes
that you would never imagined.

631
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:43,250
I heard that a Cosby was well
before he had a trick to that.

632
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,570
Legit like other than those,
those things.

633
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,610
Women, sometimes it's a, it's a
PR. I know a couple, I mean, yeah,

634
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:54,040
I can't say it on here,
but when we stop I'll tell you,

635
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,110
I'll tell you three verified
absolute just hounds that

636
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,690
that's their whole people said
that to me before, you know,

637
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:04,960
like man you just did this music
just to get late. And I was like,

638
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,780
in a way I was kind of like,
it kind of annoyed. I was like,

639
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,460
you don't feel the fee.
You know,

640
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,870
you don't feel anything in this music
other than just like a guy and who needs

641
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:17,880
to get laid, you know? Yeah.
No I think you said that,
but I'm just saying like it,

642
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,790
no,
it annoys me when people say like,

643
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,850
like that's a lot of work to get late
record. Right. They expect that if you're,

644
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,430
if you're a musician that it isn't
worth it mean. Yeah, that's probably,

645
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,940
does she ever get jealous?

646
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,680
Cause you also have a lot of really good
looking women in your videos and you're

647
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,250
singing about like hot

648
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,210
chicks. Like is she like how'd you
meet her? And she ended this stuff.

649
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,580
[inaudible] mutual friend. She, I mean,
she as she loves what I do. We get along.

650
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,170
I mean, we haven't had any problems
with that kind of stuff. Oh, okay.

651
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,540
No jealousy or no, no, no. I mean
I'll bet if you sat her down and said,

652
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,170
would you rather him not call
himself the Pussy King? I'll,

653
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,010
my guess is she probably say, you know,
yes Mr. Walker. Yeah, I prefer that.

654
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,380
Yeah. Or the, you know, the sit at home
watch TV came we'd probably before,

655
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,680
cause I'm, I'm kind of a, you know,

656
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,740
so what I got,
I get rid of me left and right,

657
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:10,070
but I always there you got to
push it off. Yep. We always

658
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,560
like the women that come up to me w when
the guys ask for Pictures, Oh my God,

659
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,490
when I do stand up,
you know,

660
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,530
I would say 89% maybe more
when my audience is men.

661
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,500
But you also obviously see couples
majority of the time when I meet a couple

662
00:39:30,261 --> 00:39:33,740
after the show, a guy, I'll
be like, hi man, fucking,

663
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,490
it's so great to meet you had a picture
and then I'll be like, sure man.

664
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:42,290
And then he'll be like bay, but she'll
go, I'm good. I'm all right, fucking here.

665
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,430
And then he'll like, insist, come on, get
back. She's like, no, no, no, I'm fine.

666
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:46,970
I'm fine.

667
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,010
Well, they're holding up. My thing is, is
there's a lot of couples, they're in law,

668
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,870
you know, it's like,
it's the same thing, but,

669
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,470
and then he gets a picture and
she's like, you know, it's,

670
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,730
this is my birthday gift to him. You
know, I did is I did it as a favor.

671
00:39:58,731 --> 00:39:59,410
I don't need shit.

672
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,330
Yeah. You know, I get, I hear
it a lot. He's been dying
to see you and I go, thanks.

673
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:06,100
Yeah. And she's like, yeah, yeah, no,

674
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,810
he was really excited tonight
and he really laughed at,
like, she tells me like,

675
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:11,660
it's a report,
like making sure I know that

676
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,540
question a lot too.
Like,

677
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,190
how do I convince my girlfriend or wife
or whatever it took to get her to go to

678
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:21,220
a show with me? I'm like, I don't
know if she's not into it, you know,

679
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,840
she doesn't like it. Don't just
go do something else. Yeah.

680
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,550
Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah,
it's, it's, it's very weird.

681
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:30,310
But this is a tour is going to be,
I think bananas for you.

682
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,430
You're going to pick up so many
new fans. Yeah. Geez. Yeah.

683
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,840
What kind of venues are you doing?
You know,

684
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,950
I think it's, I think it's amphitheaters.
Aha. Yeah, it'll be, it'll be big,

685
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,620
big places. They've got other guy,
Brantley Gilbert who is really big.

686
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,570
He's doing those songs that you,

687
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,810
you have like in those
venues is going to be,

688
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,680
and it's a real cushy gig too
cause you know, we, you know,

689
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,750
we go on so early so I'll be like done.

690
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,580
I'm used to getting done
in fucking midnight.

691
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:58,290
I'll be done early and it's
the best way to, you know,

692
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,380
get on the bus and walk off and yeah,
cause I'm trying to thank you.

693
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:08,090
I have your if your latest album,
I have old wheeler on my phone,

694
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,670
man. Finger up my butt. Yeah. I really
love, I'm excited for the, you know,

695
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,940
the kid rock fans who don't know who I am
to hear finger on my button. That kind.

696
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,110
Yeah. I mean, I guess summers
in Kentucky would be what?

697
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:24,430
Too slow to play on something
like that. Right? To Open. Yeah,

698
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,150
shorter set. So I just try to
just know pounded down it. Yeah,

699
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,890
maybe I'll probably do fuck you. Bitch
is my one valid. That's a great song.

700
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,190
You had to try to play it on here before

701
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,040
I think so your dog.
Yeah,

702
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,610
and I think that'll get some hopefully
get a couple of lighters even though it'd

703
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,320
be probably light a little
lighter outside, but yeah. Yeah.

704
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,810
That's fucking dope man. That's
really, really good news where we've,

705
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,400
we've supported you and we're just so
thrilled that you're doing so well in your

706
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:53,930
music and you're really talented
songwriter, singer. Great. On the guitar.

707
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,910
Do you ever scan,
do you ever seven debit debit?

708
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,580
How it knows a Scott and I thing a thing.
Oh,

709
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,310
you're not feeling familiar with God.
I know it's getting yes, but it's like,

710
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:07,340
is it something you guys are into?
We've been getting into it,

711
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:13,550
trying to figure out whether it requires
skill or if any two year old I was,

712
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,780
I would go for the two year
old angle. But yeah, for me,

713
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:21,140
I mean the only time I would ever do
that as if I'm working on a song and I

714
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:24,790
didn't have the lyrics radio I on to
record the melody, I'd do though do it.

715
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:29,050
Did you know? Yeah, that's
more Babel than a scat. I mean,

716
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,230
what training would you need
for scat? I, it's such a racket.

717
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,310
I don't believe it.

718
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,980
I mean other people who pay way or
there are people who pay you to go see

719
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:41,600
people's scat. Yeah. Like six
farmers. I think so. Yeah. Uh,

720
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,450
oops. Um, yeah. So anyways, yeah, we,

721
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:50,451
we mocked somebody that did it on our
show and then most people were into it.

722
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,650
But then we've got a few push
backs about, um, you know,

723
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:57,410
how talented this person was.

724
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,160
And then we found a woman who won a
grammy for her skin and she was like,

725
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,520
you know, I'm going to have
you won a grammy for. So the
categories, I don't know.

726
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,110
She's like, you know, I don't, I don't
play the Trump, but I am the trumpet.

727
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,080
Yeah. It's like a, what's his name?
The don't worry. Be Happy Guy. Yeah.

728
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,090
Bobby McFerrin. Yeah, I'll
bet he won a grammy for some.
Oh, you're probably right.

729
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,060
Yeah. I mean, here's a little
taste of something else.

730
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Jesus Christ singing is a form of vocal
improvisation using nonsense syllables

731
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,970
imitating musical instruments. You have to
explain it. Sign Jazz. Yeah. And that's,

732
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:39,220
you don't,
I don't have to go after my,

733
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,990
each side I'll go country music is the
thing where you play your guitar and you

734
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,163
say, you know, it's like,

735
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,310
if you have to explain it to prove that
it's actually music, it's not snowing.

736
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,090
Yeah, man. I just watched, what it
looks like to me is a guy who's like,

737
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:55,060
I love music, don't want it, don't want
to spend the time and get learning guitar,

738
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,950
Mandolin, piano, whatever, or base.

739
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,440
I'm just going to stand up against the
wall and just start fucking babbling.

740
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,750
I can't remember remembering lyrics is
tough to, yeah, if you just scan it,

741
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,593
just like,

742
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,340
and I noticed his snaps were
kind of off with his scouting.

743
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,170
It wasn't very rhythmic
duet Scott member or,

744
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,010
yeah.
You match

745
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,680
each other's like last note,
take it somewhere else. Yeah.

746
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,370
I mean half their life is probably
proven that there are musicians.

747
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,070
So it just like, it's like I've
never, I don't know anything.

748
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,160
I've never heard of the sketch

749
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,150
show or you know

750
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,880
now how long you're pretty damn good
guitar player. How long it takes you,

751
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,280
you figure it out in like a
day and afternoon. How long
did it take you? I promise

752
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,520
took me, I will say there's a, cause
everyone asks that there's a learning.

753
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,260
It was like a learning curve.
Definitely.

754
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:50,620
It's like the first week you're just like,
fuck this, I don't want to play. Yeah.

755
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,850
And then there's just a, there's a time
maybe few months and we're just like,

756
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:55,980
it starts to feel normal and then not,

757
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:58,320
then you get to a point where
you're just picking, you know? Wow.

758
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,860
But you started very young, yo.
Yeah. It was probably, you know,

759
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,840
11 or 12 or something.
What was the first song you wrote?

760
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,890
Do you remember when you were
11 first song I wrote, um,

761
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,010
I wrote a song with a buddy
of mine back in Kentucky. Um,

762
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,600
my buddy Tyler who,
um,

763
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,460
I won't say his last name because I
think he's got like a normal job now.

764
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,610
We wrote a song called big woman
and it was really bad, but you know,

765
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,140
big woman and we were trying to
do like, um, I think it was quite,

766
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,280
I'm like a big bottoms
like smiled tap guy.

767
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,780
Yeah. Like her, but her butt was
big. I think she was all around big.

768
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:35,810
She could have been into scad. Definitely.
Well, let's get into it a little more,

769
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:36,644
Scott.
Lesson.

770
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,290
Things you need to do to scat number
while you need to listen to a lot of jazz

771
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:43,884
recordings.

772
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,260
Shirley Horn players like the trumpet or
the saxophone because Horn instruments

773
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,600
are very similar to voice. Oh. Since,

774
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:55,200
because they use a breathing number two,

775
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,950
you need to transcribe.
You don't have to write the notes down.

776
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,490
Just try to sing the solo that you like.

777
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,350
If you can find a track that you like,

778
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,770
you don't have to really
use too much effort.

779
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,960
You will eventually see the Solos.

780
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,230
You understand what he's
advising, right? Yeah.

781
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,240
So mimic the right like
some Sax Solo and then you,

782
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,040
yeah, I can do that.
So he's claiming it's,

783
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,880
I think he's trying to claim it as if
like a cover. What isn't that? Yeah,

784
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:25,630
it's that kind of plagiarism. I mean
you're not coming up with your own songs.

785
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:27,700
So is it, what's the talent?
Here's another example.

786
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,290
What do we think?

787
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,340
He basically just singing along
with that, having a little bit, why

788
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,360
should we call it singing along

789
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,420
along with the sound,
because that's a singing along with that,

790
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:47,750
having to learn the lyrics. Yeah.
He's singing along with like the dark

791
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:55,790
does just mimic the stuff.
It is crazy that somebody won a grammy.

792
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,930
I want to know this grant. I want to
know that Scott and grammy singer Scat,

793
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:02,930
grammy, can you think of a worse
thing to have to sit through?

794
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,540
How many they should put it like it
should be the last award of the night and

795
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:10,330
then our final award, this scat
album, that album on the year. Yeah.

796
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:17,420
I mean it really is exactly what you
do when you're a little chunks all the

797
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:21,800
time. A tree, I love my
tree. You've got to create,

798
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:23,630
is it practice

799
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,270
stage?
And I forgot my lyric

800
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,280
practice, the nonsense syllables.
If you use a best choice

801
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,520
syllables, then it will stutter
your phrase. For instance,

802
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,070
did Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee
or Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba,

803
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,360
some of them love and they
shut the baffles. Listen,

804
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,740
you can't tell the difference.

805
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,740
Thinking are do up Delia [inaudible]
and my God and number five you get a day

806
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:52,220
job. Yeah, yeah.

807
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,713
It's a skillset.

808
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,230
Leave it up.
It do.

809
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,700
Maybe that's a sign of something.
You know, something shitty.

810
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:07,120
Is it for you took like you
took the three best scatters,

811
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:10,330
I guess maybe do you call them in the
world and then put just two people who

812
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:11,710
just had learned it two seconds before?

813
00:48:11,711 --> 00:48:15,270
What'd you be able to tell the difference?
It's a great, a great way to, you know,

814
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:16,104
if you,
if you took,

815
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,370
I think right grace gets put cloud or
next to a guy who just picked up a guitar.

816
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,170
Yup. Yup. That's, that's, see, that's,
that's right. That's the whole thing.

817
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,080
He'd be like, I think that cloud
the guys better than the other guy.

818
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,250
But in scouting you might be
like, I dunno. Yeah. That's
been doing it in a week.

819
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,830
It's pretty fucking good.
I mean, he'd be probably,

820
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,840
I'd probably be more fun to watch.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It just, um,

821
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,410
yeah, it seems kind of like
an insane thing to do. Um,

822
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,580
how about there's a whole scene, you know,
like, yeah, like underground, you know,

823
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:49,450
like, yeah, I think they think it's PR.
I think. I feel like he's got the vibe.

824
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:53,020
He thinks it's like some new form
of jet, you know, it's like jazz.

825
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,150
It's like the millennial
version of fucking shit.

826
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,240
People have been doing this
horse shit for a long time.

827
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,160
This is all bullshit racket, this
bullshit, man. It's all old stuff. Yeah.

828
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,150
People have been scamming the scat
thing for a minute. Feel like didn't

829
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,190
a song or David Lee Ross like
bat, but dd, but oh yeah,

830
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,950
I ain't got no.
Yeah.

831
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:21,140
So that would that make him
the world's greatest? That's,

832
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:25,590
that's gotta be a big scat hit.
Yeah. Cause then there was the,

833
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,690
then he fucked it up by singing, singing
all good and stuff. There was the, um,

834
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:34,590
the scat man song that was,
was that one, um, the scap man,

835
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,440
you remember that?

836
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,020
But then there's the actual music
around that. That's right. Right,

837
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,090
right. That's breaking the
rules, the free form also,

838
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:49,560
because there's no structure to it.

839
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:51,930
The fact that there's no
cost at all structure,

840
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,400
it kind of doesn't make it a song. Right.
I mean, you're a songwriter or wheeler.

841
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:57,840
It can you just willy nilly,

842
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,330
wow. There's gotta be some
kind of, yeah, that's what I'm,

843
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,270
that's what I keep being confused
about it. Like if you're in the studio,

844
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,490
he goes and the guy goes, let's
try it again. He would be like,

845
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,390
I don't know what it did. What do you
mean try it and try it again? He goes,

846
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:12,780
the new one will be a new song.
So it's just like whatever.

847
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:14,550
Like if you had a 10 song
album and just be whatever,

848
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:17,010
10 pieces of shit you threw out there,
you know,

849
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,850
I kind of think we should try to make
us got album. I think so too. Yeah.

850
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,260
Great idea. Make It, you could do with
these two mikes. Put it out online.

851
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,260
You can make a lot of money. Yeah, we get
a lot of money. Yeah. Scott, the album,

852
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,040
Scott,
maybe we could open for you as your duo.

853
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,400
You too scattered.
You can open every fucking show.

854
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,380
You want them to all sit down with
kid rock and say, I know I go, I know,

855
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,800
I know openers can't have openers,
but I got these two.

856
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,480
Got To get these guys to at
least Scott for a minute for me.

857
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,770
How quickly before we got.
Yeah,

858
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:55,310
you get hit with for sure.

859
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,450
You know, it would start like
there. People would be like, Huh.

860
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,250
And then once it hit maybe like minute,

861
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,420
although I guess you know, bow with
debar was kind of a scattered a little,

862
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,770
Oh yeah we did bang the bank,

863
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,620
but it probably breaks the rules
by being the same thing every time.

864
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:18,480
Music. But he always sings, he's
doesn't, he doesn't just go,

865
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,360
sometimes they go Scott,

866
00:51:19,361 --> 00:51:24,150
but did you know Scott
a lap pop his crowd,

867
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:26,290
we go on him, turn on
him. If he was just sky

868
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,290
the vehicle thing. Because when I
get ready for a tour, like the main,

869
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,200
my main thing, everyone has to get
their voice ready or whatever it is.

870
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,130
My main thing is learning the
fucking lyrics takes me forever.

871
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:38,090
So scatting would be,

872
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,150
I mean probably probably do scat every
once in while learning your own lyrics.

873
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,030
Learning my own lyrics
is fucking hard because,

874
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,770
because of the way I write is like, you
know, cause people have to, you know, my,

875
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,310
my band has to sing harmony with me
so far. The FIS single wrong line,

876
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:55,100
they got the wrong way. So it's like
there's some, there's a song called,

877
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:58,070
can't fuck you off my mind where I
just like while read is blowing me.

878
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:00,700
I mean it's like I got to
remember who's doing what.

879
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,770
Girls don't want to who to what.
It's like gotta have him all right.

880
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:05,320
And in order I always, you know, I'm uh,

881
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:10,340
I have zero musical skill and
when I would do, I can scat.

882
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,660
But when I think that that statement's
doing very basic stuff, you know,

883
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,310
years ago like learn these
four keys, the idea, you know,

884
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:21,260
I had to put so much
thought into doing it.

885
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,210
One of the things that
seems terrifying is you,

886
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,930
you realize at the time that when
you're doing it and you're like, wow,

887
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:30,620
I finally got this together,
that to sing while you're doing that,

888
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,520
for some people it would be like, it would
be impossible. I would not be able to.

889
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,650
Yeah. I didn't really sing that
much until I had the guitar to,

890
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:40,290
I'm pretty good cause I was too shy
about singing and when I first started.

891
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:42,660
But yeah, I had the guitar
down good enough. So I would,

892
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,100
I actually was when I was a
kid, you know, you could sing.

893
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,520
I knew it but I was too scared to really,
you know,

894
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,200
growing up with a bunch of big family.
I was too,

895
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:57,250
I was too shy to kind of belt
it out. Um, your siblings? Yeah.

896
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,250
Two brothers do a,
what do they think of your,

897
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,350
I was going to say mixed
things and my mom came,

898
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,710
my mom's from national so she
comes to national lots of sheet.

899
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,510
We had a record release show I think for
the last one and I think that was um,

900
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,620
well the oddest things I've ever done.
She was for the first record,

901
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:20,850
she came up to the show and I'm
obviously you play no matter what your,

902
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:23,700
just your eyes. Cause I've always
wear shades on all the time,

903
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,630
but mainly on special on for the lights.
And so I'm playing and I just couldn't,

904
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:31,320
I had to watch, my mom was thinking,
fuck you bitch. I've never, I've never,

905
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,510
in all my years I've never
seen this look from her,

906
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:38,511
which was this weird kind
of like proud giant crowd.

907
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:39,630
You know,
people,

908
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:43,060
people buying and tee shirts and singing
along and his other like half of our

909
00:53:43,061 --> 00:53:47,380
faces, like, what the fuck did I do
wrong? I was like, mom, this ain't song.

910
00:53:47,381 --> 00:53:48,840
It ain't about you.
You know,

911
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,890
I played the whole song and washed
her face the whole time and I would,

912
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,050
it's not something I would
advise anybody to do.

913
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,670
I don't like having my mom at shows
because you know, I don't sing.

914
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,660
Obviously a bank should come to shown
she's come to shows and usually she'll,

915
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,040
it's some version of
a, that was great. Um,

916
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:12,800
and then at some point she'll be like,
yeah, why do you the God you say,

917
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,960
I was going to say it's probably exact
same thing, which is I get a lot of,

918
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:20,820
you know your voices so pretty, you don't
need to say the bad word is, you know,

919
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,740
but that's like, well, all right,

920
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,190
she'll point out another
comic. You're like, you know,

921
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,200
who doesn't even say the F word?
Like, yeah, she's, yeah. She's like,

922
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:32,070
Garth Brooks doesn't need to say that.
It needs,

923
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,410
it doesn't need to talk about
sitting on people's faces.

924
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:37,890
I'm why if he did he'd be
even bigger. Yeah, he's sure.

925
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,580
He sure. Here we go. We followed it.

926
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,700
The dream still lives and my dream
is for us to love one another.

927
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,350
All of us.

928
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,830
Oh Gosh, isn't that weird? Oh Oliver,

929
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,850
what dreams still is this was this,
was this the MLK one? Probably,

930
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,200
but also its most generic thing
like you won't even mention MLK.

931
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,660
Just like the dream. Everybody's like
not a lot of emotion and those are

932
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,050
all of us.
And wait,

933
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,060
he leans in and he doesn't really connect
with a while ago cause this dirty.

934
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,993
That sounds like it.

935
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,920
Just for us to love one another.
All of us.

936
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:27,010
Yeah. Fuck I fucking hate that guy. I
mean it's weird because you say that now.

937
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:30,490
I mean just because country music
has gotten so shitty, you know,

938
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,540
cause when I was a kid there was all that
good country and Garth came along and

939
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:37,150
he was the pop sellout.
So I'm still from that era.

940
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:39,070
But nowadays when there's
such this horrible shit,

941
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:41,170
people you've probably
never heard of like Florida,

942
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,490
Georgia line and you know all this other
fucking dog shit. It's like pop, pop,

943
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:46,960
kind of like Florida Georgia line.

944
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,350
We've just got off a tour with
backstreet boys and Nelly have fun.

945
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:53,830
Have Fun at that one. But I'm saying
like that's the people I hate now,

946
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:57,130
but at the time it was Garth was
the out. You know, there's a,

947
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,610
there's a famous quote attributed
to Wayland, but we don't,

948
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,650
nobody knows if I'm Waylen said it
or not, but the quote was, you know,

949
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:11,490
Garth Brooks did to did to country
what panties did to finger fucking,

950
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:18,070
which I think, I mean, it's definitely
a quote because I said it, but yeah,

951
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,820
definitely a quote, but I don't know
that. And everyone says, it says,

952
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:24,820
everyone says it's a Waylon. Whoa.
But I don't know if it's a cool quote.

953
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,770
That's a good quote. But it kind
of is, you know, it was like, yeah,

954
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,180
he really just kind of
sanitized it for everything.

955
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,860
It's the most fucking generic.
Oh, that's terrible. Like,

956
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:34,930
if you didn't wear the cowboy hat would,
you know it was country.

957
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,520
Wow. I, you know what bothers me the most,

958
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:39,350
cause I don't know much
about country music,

959
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,380
but I just find him to be so insincere
and such a fucking phony baloney.

960
00:56:44,421 --> 00:56:47,390
It's just weird because that's what
country's all about. His sincerity.

961
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,770
What I know is that yeah, you're
supposed to be real and you keep it real,

962
00:56:51,771 --> 00:56:54,290
even if you have a big millions
of dollars. And I just,

963
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:57,740
I just don't sense that from him. I
just, I don't connect. I don't know.

964
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,570
He seems like he's a sociopath Karma.

965
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,540
It seems fucking crazy because we,
you and I,

966
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,940
you guys and I both watched
those fucking g alerts.

967
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:09,270
Neither does the g breaks in with the GL
or it couldn't be any less important or

968
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:14,170
anything. G alert. He's
playing fucking Tulsa.

969
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,120
Yeah.
Glr Taylor let the conversation

970
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,280
creepy. So creepy. And
he's also, he's, he's,

971
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,580
he's just, you remind
me a little bit of, um,

972
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,080
I was just think about
prince today when that,

973
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,030
that other than news kind of came out
about him, uh, whatever they figured out.

974
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:36,050
What kind of drugs he was on,

975
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:38,990
but kind of that thing where he
just kind of lost in his own world.

976
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:43,970
Like he won't, he's not on iTunes. I
don't know if you knew that prince. No.

977
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,560
Garth. Oh, I knew prince. While
you couldn't buy a lot of history,

978
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,130
I didn't know about Garth and Garth will,
first of all his um,

979
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:54,230
Chris Gaines is wiped from the
Internet. So good. Yeah, but,

980
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,940
but Garth is not on iTunes
or any of the other places.

981
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,880
He's only on Amazon.
Why?

982
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:06,320
Because he made some fucking giant, well
first before all that shit. He's like,

983
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:11,210
fuck iTunes man. I'll just make like
Garth's p threes and so on myself.

984
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,060
Yeah, it's on his website. You could
buy like, I really think it was called,

985
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,650
I think it really was called like GP
threes and you get five directly from him.

986
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,680
Like he likes his own initial a lot,
but yeah, exactly. It's like, no dude,

987
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:23,600
that's not how this shit
works. You know? And it's like,

988
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,640
it's like the idea of
like in the old days,

989
00:58:25,641 --> 00:58:28,520
he would build like a Garth records next
to tower records thinking and people

990
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:32,210
would just go in there. He's like, I'm
not playing this fucking game. He's like,

991
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,140
I'm only going to make my own versions
of MP three and some on the website.

992
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:38,340
But people don't go to
people's websites and buy no,

993
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,570
you gotta be where everyone else is
buying albums. But now you finally,

994
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,390
and I'm sure Amazon paid him a shit load
and now here I am endorsing is telling

995
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:49,460
people to go to Amazon.
But yeah, to own you.

996
00:58:49,461 --> 00:58:51,920
Only way you can listen to in
digitally is Amazon. That's crazy.

997
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:56,030
What about in the studio? G me Studio
G's. Got It. Let me ask you this about,

998
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,520
I'm still curious cause I know
nothing about it. But you know,

999
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:02,870
in comedy if a huge comic,
um, once you to open forum,

1000
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,370
it's usually a personal connection.
Um,

1001
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,240
like you would actually talk to the
person or maybe like their assistant or

1002
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:11,750
something.
But when you book a major music tour,

1003
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,520
like this kid rock thing,

1004
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,340
is that a purse like d does he call you
or is that just like your agent talked

1005
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:21,230
to his, yeah, my manager talked to
his manager, but I did, I played,

1006
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,310
he has a thing called the fish fry.
He's like kid rock fish fry.

1007
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,510
It's like a summer festival was in
Nashville and I played that last year.

1008
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,300
And uh, we, you know,

1009
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,030
talked for a few minutes and he mentioned
maybe torn with him and then he went

1010
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:38,240
on tour and I never heard, like, I was
just like, oh, I guess, yeah, it happened.

1011
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,060
Let me call it for this fall
tour. I was just like, obviously,

1012
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,880
yeah.

1013
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,990
Came around or you know, something opened
up and um, yeah, just got the, you know,

1014
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,110
do you want to do it? I'm like, hmm, yeah,
let's play some fucking, you know. Okay.

1015
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,950
It's like I was saying before, I can
always picture this music in big places.

1016
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,680
To me, they sound like fucking
anthems. So just to even,

1017
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,200
even if the crowd isn't true,

1018
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,980
my guess is kid rock fans probably get
to the show early and start drinking.

1019
01:00:02,981 --> 01:00:06,100
But even it was an empty fucking empathy
or it's still be cool to plug and play

1020
01:00:06,101 --> 01:00:06,900
those big fucking

1021
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,610
oh yeah, yeah. I bet they get there early
and party. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way,

1022
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,500
empty.
There's still thousands.

1023
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,890
Exactly. That's the thing too. I got it.

1024
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:18,110
Probably get used to which is
looking out and seeing empty seats,

1025
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,010
knowing that still 10 times
the audience I usually play.

1026
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:26,080
It's a pretty crazy, pretty nuts
man. Um, so this is a, I dunno,

1027
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,710
this is an anti drinking.

1028
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,800
What is this anti drinking
ad from New Zealand.

1029
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,860
Okay. I don't know how to, I haven't
seen it yet, but let's see what it is.

1030
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,473
Want

1031
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,760
it just killed again.

1032
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,570
I guess that is a reason not to drink.

1033
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,400
It's doesn't seem like
near the top of the list.

1034
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,620
No, I mean he was swinging kids
around when they get hammered. I mean,

1035
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,040
yeah,
it's not my first,

1036
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,750
by the way. I do that sober.
I also wouldn't go crying.

1037
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,640
You're crying. Just sit outside. Right?

1038
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,040
Sissy. Well, you know,

1039
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:36,780
it'd be interesting is to get a wheeler's
reaction on those videos from last

1040
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,890
week. Oh, please. Just which
ones? I know which ones.

1041
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,380
Okay. Yeah. I want to see it now

1042
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,070
just to tell him I to just watch.
Yeah.

1043
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,540
[inaudible]

1044
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:07,420
it actually, that's, he turned out better
than I thought he was going to. I mean,

1045
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:11,780
okay. Face, it's kind of funny, but
that scream, it's a funny screens.

1046
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,380
A great screen, but also when
you play it, I was like, fuck,

1047
01:02:14,381 --> 01:02:15,610
am I going to watch somebody die?

1048
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,920
You and like, that's like, that
guy needs to hit the hit the gym.

1049
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,440
That's a good scream.
It's so,

1050
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,330
so that's one verified funny. Yeah. Um,

1051
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,110
this is a nother one.
This is a guy,

1052
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,490
I always hold the cause the last
one then you'd think he's like,

1053
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,870
why exactly were they filming that again?

1054
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,120
Yeah, I fill him in the car. Come off.
Oh no, he didn't jump that far. I mean,

1055
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:47,050
that's an uncomfortable jump for sure.
But yeah, I mean his, he broke his leg.

1056
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:50,770
That's an off off the top
of a truck thing. You know,

1057
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:54,610
but I'm saying he didn't jump 20 feet,
you know, he probably jumped, what, six,

1058
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:58,900
seven? He played shit. That was probably
like the 12th time he broke his ankle.

1059
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,530
So this is a military exercise.

1060
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:07,480
A bunch of guys jump out of a plane
and this guy's parachute is open,

1061
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,310
but apparently it's not.

1062
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,650
Yeah,

1063
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:14,460
I dunno. Not a hundred percent the way
it's supposed to be. Okay. Okay. So,

1064
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,480
so you know,
he's looking at

1065
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,433
shit.

1066
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:25,790
How's he in there right now? Yeah.
See they're all, he just knows.

1067
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,420
I mean that, that, that's, that
means definitely verify. Funny. Yeah.

1068
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,910
That one you don't know sometimes
when you know you're going to get her.

1069
01:03:40,911 --> 01:03:45,290
I sometimes scream extra cause it,
I know it all. I kind of, yeah.

1070
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,650
I wonder if he's doing that. I don't,
I'm curious what happened to his parents,

1071
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,240
but actually supposed to be
called horrible are hilarious.

1072
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,100
And you're two for two
that they're hilarious.

1073
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,760
Yeah. But also anything with a
parachute if you're okay. I think yeah,

1074
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,840
you can use. Okay. Yeah. I don't think
this guy broke anything. Oh, he definitely

1075
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,390
leg. Oh, oh,

1076
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,450
it was army. Yeah. He knows.

1077
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,010
Oh
yeah.

1078
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:33,470
It's not as hilarious. Like I see the
sounds are funny like I get, yeah.

1079
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:37,500
Now by the,
you're laughing at more than that.

1080
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:40,390
Like you like that the guys
are getting hurt. No, I don't.

1081
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,760
I think those are a
little bit funny sound.

1082
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,600
It's definitely funny if someone is
hurting, it's not you if they live. Yeah,

1083
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,940
that's, that's, yeah, no, yeah, yeah,
totally. What I was thinking about that,

1084
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,780
I was on a southwest yesterday
and I'm like, I love,

1085
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:57,420
I always get the window seats that people
don't bother me and I'm just sitting

1086
01:04:57,421 --> 01:05:00,570
there next to the fucking window,
like looking to my right.

1087
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:03,180
Like does this guy have the
strength to pull me back in?

1088
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:07,710
Like in case it gets sucked down. Yeah.
Cause I actually, I posted on Instagram,

1089
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:11,070
I said, you know, hey southwest, if I get
sucked out this bit before I'm playing,

1090
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:14,430
took off, if I get sucked out this
window, you know, put this window,

1091
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:16,230
make sure this window goes
to the country music hall.

1092
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,260
Um, somebody, I dunno who is very, uh,

1093
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,830
expressive about pronouncing my name
correctly. I've never had somebody like,

1094
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:27,973
I don't,

1095
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,030
hey guys.

1096
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:34,030
So this is a Latin American comedian
that like I am obsessed with,

1097
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:38,980
named Tomas said goodbye and uh,
what's it like?

1098
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,000
I always hear people like,
there's a lot of people know him,

1099
01:05:41,001 --> 01:05:45,930
but they always the Tom's the girl.
I'm like, yes, I know my security.

1100
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,030
I, I feel like, are you lying?

1101
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:54,070
I'm so tired of her running around like
pretending that people's names aren't

1102
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:59,270
pronounced. Like, my name
is Joshua Brown. Okay.

1103
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,520
And that's not a hard one to do. Yeah.

1104
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:09,800
So Bert Kreischer no. Yeah, Joshua Brown.

1105
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,590

a new place in Nashville and I was the,

1115
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,190
the guy runs the building yet
it's like, Oh man, I'm a big,

1116
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:51,300
cause I was kind of hope they don't know

cause they do it.
Got To do background check.

1118
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:56,220
I think it's like they get worried about
maybe not getting excited about the

1119
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:59,850
place, but the dude was cool and
he's like, man, I don't know if you,

1120
01:06:59,851 --> 01:07:03,030
you probably get the same thing too.
There's a man I love Tom Segura. Yeah.

1121
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,043
I'm just like,

1122
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:05,370
okay,

1123
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,730
but you get probably get
about other people. I'm like,
yeah, well I was on his Po,

1124
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:12,960

1128
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:25,390
I had a part in a movie though,
so I've been flying back and forth.

1129
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,260
What's the movie? It's
a, a big family comedies.

1130

1132
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,780
So I'd be friends, man. Thank you.
I'm a flying back and forth and I,

1133
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,600
I added a couple of shows to do while
I'm in town because you have days off,

1134
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:50,410
you know, when you're shooting.
And so, uh, for the first one,

1150
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,090
Now did the Latins really claim you a
lot? Uh, you, you know what happens?

1151
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,370
People claim you,

1152
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:56,490
who enjoy you for whatever they can
claim you for. Sure, sure. Yeah.

1153
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,710
I spent time growing up in
Florida. Floridians will be
like, you're a Florida boy.

1154
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,970
I was born in Ohio, Ohio. People be
like, you're an Ohioan. Very true.

1155
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,040
So if somebody is like,
you know,

1156
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,970
I've had people come up to me like
Super Latin people after the show.

1157
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,360
You're one of us. Like, they are, you
know, they identify with that part of me.

1158
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:14,470
So they're like,
that's who you are,

1159
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:18,440
right? Yes. What? Everything,
you know, it's like, um, yeah,

1160
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:21,970
I get the Kentucky thing a lot too.
Like there was a map of like, you know,

1161
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,890
country stars from Kentucky,

1162
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:26,800
but I'm from central Kentucky
so it was cool cause I was,

1163
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,690
they put my face like they show like,
you know,

1164
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:30,730
Stapleton Sturge that everyone's from.

1165
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,820
My head's like right in the
fucking middle. Like in there.

1166
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:36,580
Everyone was comments like, you know,
why the fuck is he in the middle?

1167
01:09:36,581 --> 01:09:38,540
It's like they're just show him where
he lived, where he lived. Right.

1168
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,260
They're all so fucking surrounding.
Yeah.

1169
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:45,150
Well I got it set on Wikipedia. It
says I was born in Toronto, Canada,

1170
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:50,370
which is not true. I'm proud Windsor
native. Right. Windsor, Ontario.

1171
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,780
So much better. So much nicer. So much.

1172
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:57,070
What's that last one? I've never been to
Canada. You never been? No, we got it.

1173
01:09:57,090 --> 01:10:00,670
I get, well, yeah, we, we
do. The tour is going to hit
there, right? This tour won't,

1174
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,740
no. Yeah. No.

1175
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,960
I got a tour there sometimes because we
do sell a decent amount of records there.

1176
01:10:04,961 --> 01:10:05,300
I got it.

1177
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,470
How much of a will the tour hit the
whole nation? What they could arrive one?

1178
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:11,380
Yeah, I mean, I don't
know the exact, I do know,

1179
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:15,340
I know for a fact we're playing California
and I know we're playing New York and

1180
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:20,110
Florida, so those three alone makes me.
Is there an la show? No, there's um,

1181
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,930
I don't think or maybe one of the,
you know,

1182
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:27,010
like one of those things that I think
might be kind of considered out lately.

1183
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,040
Maybe some kind of, or shoreline
amphitheater. What's that?

1184
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,870
The shorelines that San Francisco?
Yeah, it's near there. It's massive.

1185
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,140
Like there's something else I've done
the shoreline, it's really crazy.

1186
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,100
I do like Riverside or San
Bernardino right outside.

1187
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,350
I W I don't remember.

1188
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,260
I want to open up for Ted Nugent
way back in the day and he had,

1189
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,500
he played like at near Riverside
or something like that.

1190
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:55,240
We open up for Ted Nugent a million years
ago and I was not qualified and I ate

1191
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:57,820
such shit. It was the worst thing
ever. It was like a hard gig.

1192
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,640
It's did in the old days. So far, a
lot of comedians open up for rock,

1193
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:04,030
like rock stars. So that
seems, that seems fucking hot.

1194
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,020
I would turn it down more than 100%
across the board. I should have.

1195
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:11,800
I just did it knowing it's not
in my audience at all. Dude.

1196
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,860
I've almost heard no stories

1197
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,650
about,

1198
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,510
yeah. One of my first shows, I did

1199
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,970
two shows for David Allan Coe and the
cause of the, I didn't get paid shit.

1200
01:11:21,971 --> 01:11:24,640
So the first show to, to pay
for a van, the second show,

1201
01:11:24,641 --> 01:11:27,790
I just did the first show acoustic by
myself, which is probably close to,

1202
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:31,600
you know, the point being, you
know, you can hear it, you know,

1203
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:35,890
you can hear the fucking crowd talking
to. I just, I just can't stand that.

1204
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:39,220
Yeah, no. [inaudible] has that
great story about opening from a,

1205
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,350
for Brendan flowers when the killers,
I don't remember. It's great. It's,

1206
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,240
but I mean, I'll let him, I think he's
told it. He may have told it on our show,

1207
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:47,830
but he's definitely told the story yet.

1208
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:51,260
Why Joey Diaz do a bunch of dates
out here with me. How was that?

1209
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,500
Was fucking great. That's different
though. It's different. Yeah.

1210
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:55,780
Because he can really get them
psyched. I mean, it was, it was,

1211
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,900
it was a perfect match and the shows
are great and people, you know,

1212
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,960
he gets heads kind of like a,
there's kind of a, you know,

1213
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,490
Rockstar rob where he's like kind of
screening people, you know, and to them.

1214
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,420
Plus you go on that podcast
and tell people you're
playing all his guys show up.

1215
01:12:10,421 --> 01:12:13,630
So that had to be fine. That
was really fun. Yeah. Um,

1216
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,620
was that at the Microsoft something here?
It was something, what was it called?

1217
01:12:17,621 --> 01:12:21,420
The Novo and Novo, I think it is. Yeah. I
remember seeing does that big venue. Yeah.

1218
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,890
I mean it was big for me.
It was like, um, I dunno.

1219
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:30,330
Theater like 1500 or something. Yeah. But
isn't that, it's a downtown area? Yeah,

1220
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:35,110
I think it, and they have an adjoining
other venue. Bikers. I Dunno.

1221
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:38,320
Here's all, he's the only thing I
know, which I've never made before,

1222
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:42,990
but it's a moms your moms house exclusive.
I hired off Craig's list.

1223
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:47,710
Um, I hired protestors to
hold up, you know, like,

1224
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,470
you know, screw wheeler, all this stuff.

1225
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:53,500
And we hired him and fucking
paid to these dudes, whatever,

1226
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:57,190
20 bucks a piece for half
an hour to protest my show
because I was going to film

1227
01:12:57,191 --> 01:12:59,590
it and go out there and then I was going
to fight them all. That's hilarious.

1228
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:03,460
And uh, because it's, it's like
that Kinda like downtown area.

1229
01:13:03,461 --> 01:13:04,570
It's like there's a bunch of,

1230
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:07,900
it's like across from staples is a bunch
of shit there and they fucking bus,

1231
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,700
they,
they wouldn't allow cameras and,

1232
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,940
and they made the protesters
leave and I tried to, I was like,

1233
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:15,790
you got to explain it. It's hard to
explain to the cops that it's a fucking,

1234
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,460
it's a bit, yeah, I paid
fucking paid them all.

1235
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:21,100
So I had a whole thing ready was
I was going to fucking, you know,

1236
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:26,650
she put him in choke holds and take them
out, you know, and then fucking, you know,

1237
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,010
and we, I'd called all the local news
stations to come out too. I'll be dead.

1238
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,650
I don't think anyone in my showed up
because there was nothing to show up too.

1239
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,500
Yeah, it's too bad. Um, this is a,

1240
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:41,400
if you've ever heard of the pink
preacher. No, this is a guy. I guess he,

1241
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,520
I don't know. I'll just, I'll
let you see what he does.

1242
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:51,560
Vino here and I'm joined by the
pink preacher. Awesome man. So, hey,

1243
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:56,360
it's great seeing you here and you look
incredible. I mean, you look awesome.

1244
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,810
Thank you man. Yeah, I love
your hair. I mean, thank you.

1245
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,180
It's, um, it's also,

1246
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,250
that's a such a indicator
when somebody says like,

1247
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:08,810
great to see you or something
and you start laughing. Like,

1248
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,280
what are you laughing on man? Why are
you laughing at that? What is your story,

1249
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,040
man?

1250
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,700
What's your story? A couple,
um, well, basically, um,

1251
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,540
three months ago I was in bed
around 11 o'clock at night sleeping.

1252
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:24,430
I'm a great sleeper and God
woke me up and says, uh,

1253
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:29,060
he had me go to my phone and on my phone
was a photo of a billboard that I've

1254
01:14:29,061 --> 01:14:31,760
said, read this and it made me
laugh and said, don't go to church.

1255
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,050
It's all fake news.

1256
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:38,360
This is, I guess, somewhat reminiscent
of people you see on Hollywood boulevard.

1257
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:39,150
Yeah.

1258
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:43,000
It's exactly to, anytime you hear,
you know, what's your story? This,

1259
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:47,150
this long story. The story begins three
months ago. Yeah, it's not, it's not.

1260
01:14:47,151 --> 01:14:49,640
This is not hit his life
calling. Really. Yeah.

1261
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:54,280
What happened is God pushed me in that
night. Now again, it's around 1115 then I,

1262
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,870
then I saw that in Oklahoma.

1263
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,230
I followed the links in the
article and they said that in, in,

1264
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:03,670
in March or having a atheist
convention. Well, God says,

1265
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:04,780
I want you to go to that convention.

1266
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,360
Do you fucking,

1267
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:11,820
I feel like there's people who went to
high school with him who were just like,

1268
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:15,360
oh, Ronny was a piece of shit. Like
they're watching this right now.

1269
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,760
That's the look of that guy does not
need to be near the Internet. You know?

1270
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:23,930
It's just like everything. Like God
had me click this link. You God,

1271
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:29,140
God asking me to buy this fucking
plasma screen on Amazon Shit.

1272
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:29,974
You know,

1273
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:35,690
God told me to go order these classes in
that stupid fucking piece of shit goes

1274
01:15:35,691 --> 01:15:37,000
to nightclubs and preaches.

1275
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,800
The reason I wear the crazy outfit,

1276
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:42,020
I do something called a
nightclub organization outreach.

1277
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:45,270
It's three and a half years ago. I
again, God stopped waking me up at,

1278
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:48,450
I'm not at 11 o'clock three and
a half years ago, I was sleeping.

1279
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,910
God woke me up and says,
gold a minister. I said,

1280
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,520
where God's seven 11 cause what's open?
He goes,

1281
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,170
you're going to go to the nightclubs.
Now Watch,

1282
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:57,930
this guys had been married 10
years. I go in, I said, Hey Ernie,

1283
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:02,250
I'm going to go to the nightclubs because
God wants me to. She says, she says,

1284
01:16:02,251 --> 01:16:03,330
okay,
I'll pray for you.

1285
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:07,930
I hate him so much.
He imagined is his probably his wife.

1286
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:10,990
Toni was bringing my weight,
was praying. Do is you want,

1287
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:13,190
you should go out at night to
night clubs and preach. Yeah,

1288
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,620
whatever gets you out
of the fucking house.

1289
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:19,420
It gets you away from God's will. Made
it go to strip clubs. Dance isn't Duke.

1290
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:20,100
Okay.

1291
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:25,100
So do you remember the guy that made
obviously the prank call your voice?

1292
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:27,960
So we had a listener make a call

1293
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,110
using Christina's voice,

1294
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:35,400
her actual voice recordings
of her call a sex line,

1295
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,830
and talked to the sec operator
that she was into scat play.

1296
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,550
Like I'm not singing, but
it was from fans. And uh,

1297
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:49,380
even when they had Christina go too far,
uh,

1298
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,370
like said something about Hitler
and the sex operator was like,

1299
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:55,410
that's a little too much for me. I'm
like, it was really, really well done.

1300
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:59,260
Now they are having,
uh,

1301
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:04,380
I guess this is a call that they used me,
my voice,

1302
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:09,200
I think Ari Jo and maybe Burt,
I haven't heard it.

1303
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,070
I just know that

1304
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:13,580
this is, is it the same dude? I think
that the same guy made it. Yeah,

1305
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,050
same guy made it.
Yeah.

1306
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:22,790
Hey. Hey. How's it going? Good.
How are you even joined the day?

1307
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,830
Uh, to tell you the truth, where
I live, it's 80 degrees today. Uh,

1308
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,400
we begin hit with a lot of snow and stuff.
So it's been beautiful.

1309
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,200
I've been hanging out on the back porch,

1310
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:35,300
drinking gin and tonics
to tell you the truth.

1311
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,470
Fantastic.
That sounds great.

1312
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:42,420
Me and the birds and the birds.
Well,

1313
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,530
you're sitting on the back porch listening
to the birds and I'm sitting here

1314
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,620
playing with this big
pecker and watching porn.

1315
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,020
Right? Yeah. When I sit outside,

1316
01:17:52,021 --> 01:17:56,150
I normally am my hand and I'm like
pants mine with pine nuts anyway, but,

1317
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,000
oh wow. Listening to
the birds. Yeah. Yeah.

1318
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:05,420
And how big your packer or by the
way? It's all right. Six and a half.

1319
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,390
But I got girth fixing.
It happened at night.

1320
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,970
I invited some friends over
cause we really want you to,
uh, to listen to us. Fuck

1321
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,200

like, man, you have a hot car.

1322
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:22,000
Oh Man, I bet your cock is beautiful. Oh,

1323
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:30,510
I think that's somebody coming

1324
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:34,620
Hey, how's it going man? Oh, hey Tom,

1325

Really good. What do you want to do,

1327
01:18:43,831 --> 01:18:48,540

In the same hall.

1353
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,210
At some point you don't need the
gun in the other end. I know, right?

1354
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,090
Great. Now it's a bird. Oh, I'm back baby.

01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,780
It's making my stomach. It's a lot
of noise, but it's really well done.

1357

She knew this guy is a math. I love
these people. Now people don't have,

1358

not that many people have
jobs, you know, they got shit.

1359
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:59,730
They just got so much time. Do you know
they learned, think about all that.

1360
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:01,050
They learn to be an engineer.

1361
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:04,890
So they learned how to like grab
clips from the fucking, you know,

1362
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,660
iTunes or the internet or whatever. All
that shit. Take hours and hours. Tom.

1363
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:13,110
Most of these clubs I remember from our
show. From your pumps. Yeah, I know.

1364
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,550
This is all on our show.

1365
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,650
Wow.
Oh my God.

1366
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,280
Was that,
I'm curious what joy was talking about.

1367
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:26,850
[inaudible]

1368
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,033
sorry.

1369
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:41,810
Oh my God, it hurts.

1370
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,590
Fuck, I got hurt so bad. This
card, what's the big deal?

1371
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,143

1374
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:14,950
guys just doing this guy's fucking
in the background. Really intense.

1375
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,980
There's one last clip I have to,
we owe them the respect to play the last,

1376
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,773
how does it end?

1377
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:21,500
Yes.

1378
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,500
[inaudible]

1379
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:06,500
your time is up for this
call. Goodbye. That's it.

1380
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:11,430
You don't get,
you don't really tie up the story.

1381
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:18,700
A lot of guys,
I don't even know that.

1382
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:23,260
It doesn't even say the name here, but
you really are a master of these. Jesus.

1383
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,900
Really, really impressed.
Thank you for doing that.

1384
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:31,210
They prayed to pay a ton for that
call too. Yeah, that's true. You know,

1385
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:35,200
my friends,
we'd get those like $100.

1386
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,600
Their parents will get those
hundred dollar bill, you know,

1387
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,480
you'd call sex operators.
We prank him. You know,

1388
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:43,420
cause I think it was kind
of like we wanted to,

1389
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,240
we were horny that we
actually wanted to call them,

1390
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:49,600
but we didn't pretend it was a prank, you
know? Right, right. You know, like tell,

1391
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,640
you know, talk about your boobs. You know,

1392
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,740
you get real sexual and we'd just be
fucking giggling and shit and then

1393
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:01,660
they call my parents and like, I wasn't
like 100 bucks a hundred bucks for that.

1394
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:05,530
It was always you. They're like wheeler
came over. Yeah. I mean it was, it was,

1395
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:10,010
it was fucking, I mean, well you're from
kind of a smaller place to was just,

1396
01:25:10,011 --> 01:25:13,510
there's just nothing. The fucking dude.
Yeah. I never did it. I never called.

1397
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:19,230
I think it was probably more terrified
of, of uh, getting in trouble. Yeah. Yeah.

1398
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:21,790
You do much print and print calling
though. We did some prank calling.

1399
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:26,260
I remember one time in the, in
the sort of the same way, uh,

1400
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,970
would prank call cute girl.

1401
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:32,920
Like girls we liked from school
call and hang up or like, you know,

1402
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:36,310
do voices. Yeah. It was fun
before caller ID and shit.

1403
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:40,900
I remember before Koller idea girl
knew that was so terrible. We used to,

1404
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:42,220
we had one buddy who had,
um,

1405
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,810
who was the first guy we ever
knew who his parents are.

1406
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,830
I think his dad was in some kind of
business. They had two phone lines.

1407
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,300
So we would do the,

1408
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:52,180
we would call two people at the same time
and if they picked up at the same time,

1409
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:55,210
they'd be talking to each other. So we
would call like a girl in high school,

1410
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,540
like a guy who had a crush on a girl in
high school and you just hook them up

1411
01:25:58,541 --> 01:25:59,290
together.

1412
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:03,200
So he thought she called and she thought
he caught and they're just like that,

1413
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,070
you know,
who is this?

1414
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,060
You know, that's really
easy. Oh it's Brad, you know?

1415
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,460
Oh thanks for calling.
I didn't call you anything.

1416
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,390
We just listened to them basically
because we were basically gels, you know?

1417
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,080
Of course, you know when this girl
told me, this is like fifth grade man,

1418
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:20,270
she was like, I know that you
called me. And I was like,

1419
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,370
I didn't call because we'd called
obviously and I don't know how they,

1420
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:29,720
I back then it was like you
have to ask the operator. We, I,

1421
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,400
we had busted a couple of times
people would, uh, call. Yeah.

1422
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:37,190
I don't know if it was the
cops or somebody within you
that I just got a threat

1423
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:41,020
on the phone. Can you yeah.
And you have to get like a,

1424
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:46,010
I remember you get like a, um,
like a reverse phone phone book.

1425
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:48,050
It tells you what the numbers are.

1426
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:53,620
Yeah. Um, yeah, I dunno. It definitely
the game changed for sure when,

1427
01:26:53,621 --> 01:26:57,510
uh,
when it became everybody has caller Id

1428
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,420
d oh yeah. Cause I, you know,

1429
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:03,100
I'm doing the wheeler podcast where
people calling on my voicemail and leave

1430
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:06,560
messages. So I did it, you know,
obviously I want it to be real,

1431
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:09,320
having a real phone and now it is
a real song, but got a new phone.

1432
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,420
So we're doing it when
people have cut podcasts,

1433
01:27:12,421 --> 01:27:15,270
people calling all answer the questions.
What line do they call it? You, you,

1434
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,750
you get a second line. Yeah,
I got a second line for me,

1435
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,490
but it's still my real name. This one's
don't want real number. Oh, it is?

1436
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,310
It's on my,
it's on my Twitter and my Instagram.

1437
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:25,790
You can call in and leave messages.
The messages wheeler,

1438
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:30,230
the Wheeler Walker Jr podcast. It's
just a season two coming up. Um,

1439
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:35,450
the same people, the ATC though seem
dude's you're working with? Um, oh yeah,

1440
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:36,970
they're great. They're
awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

1441
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:40,760
Helped me out a ton on it because I
can't do all that fucking shit. I can't,

1442
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,710
I'm not, this guy can't
edit and shit, you know?

1443
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,430
Yeah. Um, you don't have a,

1444
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:49,780
I've had a bunch of bets challenges
with Bert Kreischer and uh,

1445
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,470
and you fucking killed him on the
weigh loss. Oh yeah. Yeah. Let's look.

1446
01:27:53,471 --> 01:27:56,000
You're still keeping it off
to yeah. Try and men, um,

1447
01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:00,070
my workout four or five days a week.
Try not to eat dog shit all the time,

1448
01:28:00,071 --> 01:28:04,780
but this is a dog shit eating
challenge. So you know,
doughnut holes. Oh fuck. Yeah.

1449
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:09,190
We're going to see who can eat more
than 12 minutes. Who's, who's wheat?

1450
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,070
Burt and I. Oh, it's a contest.

1451
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:16,620
It's kind of the anti contents that you
had before. It is the anti contest. I'm,

1452
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,880
I'm gonna, I'm gonna. I'm gonna, I
dunno. I think I feel like births,

1453
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:23,200
the Kinda guy who could really wove some
food down and he feels like he's like

1454
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:24,750
been at a million parties where

1455
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:30,950
people have lost money betting against
him on and know somebody you prior to

1456
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:31,480
sing at all.

1457
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,780
Now this, this somebody said
here, this is a no suggestion.

1458
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,720
Famous drinking game of participating.
Call it power hour.

1459
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,620
It's the rules are simple.

1460
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:42,040
Drink one shot of beer every minute
for an hour straight. No more or less.

1461
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:44,530
I feel like this would be a great
dynamic for the donut challenge.

1462
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,210
Simply set an alarm to go off.

1463
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:50,710
Eat one or two doughnut holes every
minute until one of you taps out. No,

1464
01:28:50,711 --> 01:28:54,280
because that would take too long. I
don't want to fucking ass. No Fun.

1465
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:57,150
That was a horrible so you got to do one.
Yeah, you can do it on a podcast or sad.

1466
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:01,120
That's why we set a time limit. It's about
how many can you eat in a time limit.

1467
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,670
Do you think? Part of his thing
we'll be doing or either one.

1468
01:29:04,671 --> 01:29:08,190
Are you going to do more than like
show a bunch in at once? Well,

1469
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:12,540
I saw him yesterday,
I'm on Instagram on his stories.

1470
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:16,420
He was at the airport and he stopped by
a Krispy Kreme and he kept posting him

1471
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:20,040
self eating different donuts. Like yeah,
it's, it's a, it's a good question.

1472
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:23,490
Which is theory would work
the best because it's like
one a time you can go fast,

1473
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,760
but like five at a time, it takes
longer to chew. Figuring out the donut

1474
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,660
challenge, you know. And what are we
talking about now? Which part of the same?

1475
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,820
Like would you do multiple ones at once?
Like in other words it was called,

1476
01:29:32,821 --> 01:29:36,060
you could do like grandma, man.
Well it's time. The essence. Yeah.

1477
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:40,050
You're up against the clock. How
much? 12 minute time limit. Ooh. Yeah.

1478
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:43,260
And I think that's the advantage of
doing the doughnut holes is that you can

1479
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:46,260
train two at a time. You're
right, you can go one.

1480
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:49,560
I was gonna say maybe squash them
together and then that's a good idea.

1481
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:52,110
But that might be an unfair thing.

1482
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:56,910
What if it crumbs leave and then now that
that contributes to it being a lesser

1483
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:59,180
donuts and interest, that's
volume. Yeah, we got it. We got,

1484
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,680
who's the judge for this? I am.
She's going to be the judge.

1485
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,470
I'll have to think this
through. I got it. Yeah.

1486
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,250
Say the more I taught,
I've talked to people about it.

1487
01:30:07,730 --> 01:30:12,730
The more I realize how formidable
and opponent for eating Burdis no.

1488
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,810
Everyone has been saying and they're like,
I bet that Duke can crush them. Donuts.

1489
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:18,693
No,

1490
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:21,300
wait,
now have you two decided on the type?

1491
01:30:21,301 --> 01:30:24,840
Is that an old fashioned doughnut hole?
Chocolate. I'll call him after this.

1492
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,320
I think we should decide and you guys
should have to do the same type of donut.

1493
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:29,250
It only seems fair.

1494
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:32,980
Yeah. I'll let him pick. I
let him pick. Okay. You're,

1495
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,690
it feels like glazed would be the
one that's the old, the classic.

1496
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,270
I think that's going to be
less dense than the chocolate,

1497
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:41,140
but for some reason the chocolate
donut holes, chocolates.

1498
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:44,310
I think the other thing you're going to
think about is I think as I'm thinking

1499
01:30:44,311 --> 01:30:47,850
about, I think you're going to
realize how long 12 minutes is.

1500
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,750
Ooh, it's like a point you're
going to be shoving him in your,

1501
01:30:50,751 --> 01:30:53,220
I'm thinking like how much longer are
you just going to let you remember?

1502
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,340
11 minutes.
30 so it's a good point.

1503
01:30:55,341 --> 01:30:57,800
Cause how long is Nathan's
hot dog eating contest?

1504
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:01,340
It's like that's nothing for a couple of
minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Those guys. Yeah,

1505
01:31:01,341 --> 01:31:03,740
you're allowed to do that because that's
their big thing is water, right? Yeah.

1506
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:07,210
Yeah. You can, that you can do
water, get them wet and shoved them.

1507
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:09,830
Now do we want to allow,
that's a good point. Wheeler,

1508
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:13,520
do we want to allow water dunking
and milk or what do you want to,

1509
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:15,560
can you add hot to hot dog buns?

1510
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,190
I'm just thinking about
how long 12 minutes is.

1511
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:25,470
So you can do a lot in 12 minutes.
I mean, what's, uh, what's,

1512
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:29,840
I mean like the coffee, how long
was the Cosby show? I was like,

1513
01:31:29,841 --> 01:31:34,670
it's like half the colony to ice.
Does watching the Cosby show.

1514
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:36,590
I didn't do,
I didn't eat them nonstop.

1515
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:40,030
I have to show the last time

1516
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,750
I feel pretty full. And then you're
like, you got seven minutes left, so,

1517
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,750
so then maybe take a little break.

1518
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,810
Maybe the challenge here is not
so much cramming two at a time,

1519
01:31:50,811 --> 01:31:53,050
but pacing yourself.
Finding what that pace.

1520
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:57,290
Yeah, I'll bet the winners. If you
just one one one is the way to do it,

1521
01:31:57,490 --> 01:31:59,990
then you just,
if you eat a boy that's just not

1522
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:03,220
going to make yourself sick and you just
do it, you know, tortoise and the hare.

1523
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:06,290
But see that's the thing is I
don't think he'll go slow. No,

1524
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:09,340
I think he'll do three at a time
nonstop for 12 minutes. Yeah.

1525
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:13,030
I think the final score is going to be
some funny like 82 to six or something.

1526
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,820
I think you're right.
I think that Burke tends to go in excess.

1527
01:32:18,821 --> 01:32:23,200
He's good to do the Mickey Mantle
Jean thing and like really cramps.

1528
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:27,810
You know, people have told
me, you friends, men, uh,

1529
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:28,803
you eat fast.

1530
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:33,520
And then I've only been in awe of him.

1531
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,160
I've never even come close to his.

1532
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:39,720
Yeah. Here's my, here's my advice and
I don't like giving people advice,

1533
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:44,700
but you got to stop challenging
a guy whose name is the
machine. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1534
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:48,540
You know, he emceed and get them. It's not
some nickname that just popped up. Yeah.

1535
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:49,530
And he's a machine at every,

1536
01:32:49,531 --> 01:32:53,160
I mean he probably got them name
machine probably started somewhere with

1537
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:53,870
doughnut holes.

1538
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:57,170
Yeah. Well I'm a, I am
worried about you. I mean you,

1539
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:01,490
I think it's a certainty that you're gonna
get sick. Yeah. I'm going to get sick.

1540
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,590
I'm going to get sick.
Yeah.

1541
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:04,670
I think that's true.
I think that should be a rule that if,

1542
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,460
I mean diarrhea didn't yell, but
if you throw up, but you can count.

1543
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:10,670
I think that's how it is.
A Nathan's hot dog eating contest.

1544
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:14,140
There's a certain time you have to fold
it. The hot dog for a moment. Yeah. Yeah.

1545
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:17,290
So maybe we could do that. We have to
hold it in for a certain amount of time.

1546
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:20,110
I'm definitely gonna have
diarrhea 100% you think diary. Oh,

1547
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:23,560
you know, while I'm on the road, I
would say nothing gives me worse.

1548
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,151
You talking about what?

1549
01:33:25,151 --> 01:33:27,640
Why ladies don't show up my shows
because I had to want to talk about,

1550
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:30,670
but the worst, nothing gives me
the shit worse than glazed donuts.

1551
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:33,650
I don't know why. I don't know what
it is. All that sugar. It's just so,

1552
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,970
it's just like, it's just not,
we have not good for your,

1553
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,980
it doesn't affect me that way. It makes
my stomach hurt, but I don't shit, dude,

1554
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,520
can we get a phone before we wrap up?

1555
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:46,320
Yeah. I'll say, how have I seen
my new single? Oh Wow. Okay. Yeah.

1556
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,820
I don't really have
single ladies make videos.

1557
01:33:47,821 --> 01:33:50,250
Don't wanna tell you about the
video. So I was at it. There's this,

1558
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:51,960
there was this guy,
um,

1559
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:56,010
his name is Reginald big
black guy with a cowboy hat.

1560
01:33:56,011 --> 01:33:59,250
He calls himself wheeler
with a tan and he, he, um,

1561
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:03,420
lip syncs to my videos all the time and
I'm putting on Instagram and then he

1562
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:06,720
can't, he can't come do a show in
Dallas. And I just see it. I was like,

1563
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:10,920
it was like seeing my soup, my
hero come life. He's like, man,

1564
01:34:10,921 --> 01:34:13,320
I want to do a video video for
you. I was like, fuck. Yeah.

1565
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:17,610
Like I was number and is, this is a song
on my album called if my dick is up,

1566
01:34:17,611 --> 01:34:21,210
why am I down? Yeah. I remember that
song and then he made it. I was like,

1567
01:34:21,211 --> 01:34:23,160
if you could shoot this
video from a couple angles,

1568
01:34:23,161 --> 01:34:24,480
we'll edit it together into a video.

1569
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,193
MMM.

1570
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:30,030
And he did it. It was pretty fucking cool.
That's awesome. Well, thanks Reginald.

1571
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,290
You want me grab my guitar?
Okay, great. Yeah, this is great.

1572
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,550
Okay.

1573
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:38,010
How many of you think you could
eat in 12 minutes? I don't know.

1574
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:41,380
It's picking the number. Seems
really scary. How about one minute?

1575
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,920
I think about 60 seconds.
That's, what do you think?

1576
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,890
And then,
I don't know,

1577
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,550
five in a minute.
Oh No.

1578
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,410
25 25 yeah. 25 minutes. No.

1579
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:03,020
Yeah, I think you might get a
little sick one every 20 seconds.

1580
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,270
Maybe it's realistic. I, Tom,

1581
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:09,200
I think the key is to be realistic
here because then you're going to pace

1582
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:12,440
yourself. We've got to train
it, train on the pacing. Well,

1583
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,780
there's a difference between going for,

1584
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:18,820
there's a difference between going for
one minute and go on for [inaudible]. Uh,

1585
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,050
you can add to this point.
Just do whatever you need to do.

1586
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:22,703
Hmm.

1587
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,880
It's a little early for me,
so I'm not sure about my voice.

1588
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:29,210
Should I do my alarm ups?

1589
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:33,560
I went to a guy once for
the vocal training, not,

1590
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,830
it didn't seem to need to train my
wanting to learn how to like warm up every

1591
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:40,770
night and yeah, taught me my good. He
goes, you just go Google, Google, Google.

1592
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:45,050
And so I do like goose. Oh you do?
Yeah. I'll give him a little more Mike.

1593
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:47,920
We pull the mic a little closer.
You can pull it. You can move it.

1594
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:52,403
Yeah.

1595
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,213
Girls,
I use

1596
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:03,960
Jack off to ask him to class

1597
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:07,830
for a bag.

1598
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,050
Ladies get Rawlins town.
So if

1599
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:20,290
Monday

1600
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,150
women, none. Never man tits up.

1601
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:42,151
So why Track Brown?

1602
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:49,410
My Dick is up.
Tell me why I'm Ma

1603
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:53,880
wait,

1604
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:58,880
a girl show and her and
before we shake hands,

1605
01:36:59,891 --> 01:37:00,724
she started

1606
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,113
swelling.

1607
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:11,140
Matt Brown soap Monday

1608
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:23,640
may suck in mail route.
So

1609
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:31,940
one girl is believing
there's to walk through.

1610
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:39,690
Now I've learned a pussy
while I'm wearing frown self.

1611
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:40,853
My big

1612
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:51,180
[inaudible]
son

1613
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,080
ladies.

1614
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:02,080
I'm never Sam saying they won't

1615
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:09,000
sit down while named
Marine Shannon around.

1616
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:10,630
So my neck,

1617
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:20,180
my neck is up. Me. Why?

1618
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,143
Wow.

1619
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:33,110
Real man. Really good. That's really
great. Thanks. Really Nice. Beautiful.

1620
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:36,590
Well that be, you think that'll be a live
one to play the amphitheater tour now

1621
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:39,760
I want it worries a little bit on the
slower side. Right? Which one are you?

1622
01:38:39,761 --> 01:38:43,890
Queer is going to suck. My Dick is nice
rock. I think that's good one for the kid.

1623
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:46,860
Rock fans. They'll kind of the
rockers. He posey kicking ass.

1624
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:49,500
I'll probably do more up
tempo stuff. Would you? Oh,

1625
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:52,950
you got to open with a bag too, I
assume, right? Yeah, I think, uh,

1626
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,130
well I don't want to give too much away.
I don't know.

1627
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:59,720
I don't know how much the kid rock podcast
audience Crocker's crosses with your
