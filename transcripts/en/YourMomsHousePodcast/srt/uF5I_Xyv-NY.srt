19
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:29,470
Delphia I added a second
show at the nine 45 show.

20
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,890
There's some tickets left on that,
like a filler up.

21
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,590
Delphia gets your show
your tickets to that one.

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,400
And then December 8th Grammer
seat theater sold out late show.

23
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,370
We're gone.
It's all gone almost.

24
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:46,540
I think there's like 20 tickets left
on the leadx show and then January 10th

25
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,400

Christina p online.

35
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,030
All right. Um, that's great.
I can finally tell you this.

36
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,950
People have asked me and I believe me,
I have,

37
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,030
I've been the one trying
to find out the most, uh,

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,220
the Welmont show,
the Belmont theater show in Montclair,

39
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:45,221
New Jersey that I had to postpone
due to a sudden snow storm,

40
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,260
uh,
has been rescheduled.

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,710
The new date is Wednesday,

42
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,040
February 13th.

43
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,590
So it's official.
I like that.

44
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:04,120
I'm on Facebook now and we are going to
do that show Wednesday, February 13th.

45
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,540
Anybody who had tickets to
the show that was postponed,

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,640
the tickets will be honored at this show.

47
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,910
If you are not able to attend the February
13th show or no longer wish to attend

48
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,470
the show, you can get a full
refund at your point of purchase.

49
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,180
So there's that.
Um,

50
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:26,860
that means that there'll probably be
become a few tickets available since some

51
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,700
people won't be able to go to the
new day. It's now February 13th, um,

52
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,090
man for and disco. I should
tell you that the, uh,

53
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,450
the show that was added
January 4th is getting close.

54
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,680
We're not going to add a third.

55
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,030
So if you wanted to come to San Francisco
show at the May Sonic January 4th,

56
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,560
this would be the time to get it.

57
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,790
And the one other thing I can tell you
besides telling you that all the new and

58
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:53,791
2019 shows are at Thomson [inaudible] dot
com is we added a show in Nashville at

59
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:58,720
the Ryman Auditorium, the first
show, February, or excuse me,

60
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,380
April 14th sold out.
There's a few single tickets left,

61
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,700
but it's essentially a sellout.

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,010
So we added a late show
April 14th in Nashville,

63
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,680
Tennessee at the Ryman.

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,710
I'm very excited to go there.

65
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:18,580
Thanks for getting those tickets
and thanks for wearing your jeans.

66
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,340
So high and tight.

67
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,943
Yeah.

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,820
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Jean.

69
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,700
Let's get into it. Got a big show. Lots of
do. Lots of talk about ready. I'm ready.

70
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:33,680
Maybe put your phone down.
It's time to go to work.

71
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,590
We don't have time to like just text.
All right.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,040
No, we're not ready. Alrighty.
I'm listening to you.
Okay. But I mean, you know,

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,350
here we go.
If you want to do it.

74
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,390
Just spoke to Ashley and besides that
he said you were a class play in and you

75
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,950
let them alive in the first session.
He said that it will smelly on the stage.

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,610
I thought he had shut. Sorry. I
thought where's that factor then stage.

77
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,613
Did they

78
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,700
don't bring anyone in loving come in

79
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,620
to your mom's house.

80
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,360
He's looked professional darts.

81
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,250
Oh, is this what that is? Yeah,
that's pretty funny. He say, Hey,

82
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:26,700
look like he farted and
[inaudible] himself and like,

83
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,450
I think darts are the only
sport where they'd like be like,

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,760
let's keep talking about it. Yeah. What'd
you think? What'd you say? And he's like,

85
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,350
yeah, yeah, he did fart on stage. Yeah.

86
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,620
Well darts are crazy because
they put them in pubs,

87
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,000
which is probably the worst place you
could throw around sharp objects is when

88
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,760
people are drinking,
drinking heavily. It's crazy.

89
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,360
You can really not give a fuck about
your overall fee. I mean, look at this.

90
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,820
This guy is probably one of the best
in the world at this. Sure. Good. Um,

91
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,930
it looks like hot shit.

92
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,700
Same with baseball players look
good either. That's true. Baseball,

93
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,880
you can really let yourself go. Especially
if you're a pitcher or first basement.

94
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,350
You can really let yourself go. But
they do have to run in baseball. Yeah.

95
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,020
At times.
Certain puzzle.

96
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,050
It was funny that there are certain
positions where you kind of don't have to,

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,130
you know, like if you're a pitcher, you
never going to run through a catcher.

98
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,380
You don't have to run
really no first baseman.

99
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,030
You're never running during the game.
I mean during, when you're on diff,

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,100
like maybe if you are batting, obviously
you have to run around the bases,

101
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,470
but there's guys that just,
yeah,

102
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,260
they're just huge and out of shape
and they're good at baseball.

103
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,410
It's kind of this, you can, this is,
you can be far less happening. Yeah.

104
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,910
And be world class and look like this.

105
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,640
I mean this is a tournament. No,
this guy is not, you know, horrible.

106
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,720
But I'm saying you wouldn't see this guy
and go probably world class athlete of

107
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,400
some kind. No, no.

108
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,820
Just spiritual Wesley.

109
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,330
And besides that you said you were a
class play and you let them alive in the

110
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,170
first session.
He said that it will smell on the stage.

111
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,640
I thought he had shut. Sorry. I thought,
what is that factor then? Stage today.

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,530
Good day. Good day. Who the
fuck is watching darts? Man,

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,300
that's what you really got to ask.
I'm in.

114
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:13,180
It is one of those things
where if you've ever,

115
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,630
everyone's usually had at least a
go at throwing a dart. I've done it.

116
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,730
I've done it 10 times. Sure. I never like
was obsessed with it. And then when you,

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,770
you know, when you throw a
good one you're like Whoa,

118
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,590
but you feel like it's by chance.
Yeah.

119
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,710
And then ever we usually has a friend
that is actually kind of proficient and

120
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:33,910
you go wow, like you can actually
hit where you're aiming. Sure. Wild.

121
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,420
But then these guys really
are just unbelievable at it.

122
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,400
Are they, are they, are they just
drunks like these guys hanging out?

123
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,040
Why can't you be both?
Yeah, that's a good point.

124
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,500
And that is really the benefit of
being a professional dark player. Yeah.

125
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,770
You can be an alcoholic and a
professional athlete at the same time.

126
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,080
I want to see if he keeps talking about
shitting cause I think he might. Yeah.

127
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,580
No, no. I think he thinks
you did it. You compete.

128
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,170
If I ended up large, they'll be more smell
there. I thought he had shut and I. Dot.

129
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,690
T but this bad. What was
bad? Most think Catholicism.

130
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,460
This is a pro level interview. He said
you could put your finger up my ass.

131
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,280
No smell there.
You wish all starts.

132
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,770
If it football players were this
kind of stuff. I'd watch football.

133
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,360
I've talked about this for years.

134
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:29,160
I talked about how I would pay
so much money, so much money.

135
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:31,230
Really if they were like we're going to,

136
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,090
you can pay to hear the on field
mic on during the whole game.

137
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,450
Right. Like a pay per view extra.
Yeah. I would pay for that too.

138
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:43,000
Cause that would be, that's
the amount. Yeah Dude,

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,940
I'm writing the check
immediately. Seriously fucking
bitch. All that trash talk.

140
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,070
Ah, I don't, you know, but they have
to protect their wholesome image,

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,210
which is the Horse Shit. It's the,
it's due. I know. Violent fucking game.

142
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,430
We have bunch of slack.
Dicks.

143
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,770
That's why I liked rex Ryan so much
cause he was always talking so many big

144
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,730
words. There's a lot of big words
between the player. Yeah, of course.

145
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,050
I really like, what's the big word? Well
I'll just let you guess, but this here,

146
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,080
this is no,

147
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,520
well I think he thinks you did
it. You compete. If I ended up,

148
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,900
laughs there'll be more snow. Yeah. I
thought he had shut and I'm like stop to,

149
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,450
it was bad. It was bad. It
was bad. It was a stone.

150
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,760
Catholicism and they started putting bet.

151
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,560
I bet it must have knew that
to get so on Monday. Yeah.

152
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,140
What? What was the last part?
I'm going to spin something.

153
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,030
A window open the window. Is that
what he said? He went away to,

154
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,360
oh it was bad. It was us. Thank
Catholicism and they started putting bet.

155
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,960
I'll bet most of you
the tickets on Monday.

156
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,950
Oh you started playing better. You must
have needed to get some wind out. Yeah.

157
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,950
Yeah.
I liked that.

158
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,960
The interviewer feels the need to discuss
the FARC clarify things cause he's

159
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:56,080
saying you farted and he's like,
put your finger up my ass.

160
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,550
There's no smell there. Yeah,
that's fine. Better than you did.

161
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,960
Look how happy he is. He's like, yeah,
he farted and he started playing better.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,381
We'll see.

163
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:10,000
That's the thing about life and then the
representation of life on television.

164
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,450
Like why can't we just discuss
the guy that the guy farted,

165
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:17,110
it's not a big deal but your card you
right. But the NFL and then they're like,

166
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,390
well, we can't, we have a whole summit.
Well, it's this whole delusion stupid,

167
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:23,620
isn't it? Because you know
people at home are farting.

168
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,860
Everyone's talking to everyone at home
has been like when they watch like

169
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,510
football games here and there going like,
oh,

170
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,970
I'd love to hear what that guy
just said right there. Of course.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,970
And they're sitting there guessing.
They're probably saying like, oh,

172
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,010
he probably told him to
suck his fucking Dick. Yeah,

173
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,160
that's what they're saying
at home, you know? But you're
like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

174
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,640
We can't sell Buick ads if we do that.
No. Well that's because there's a,

175
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:47,410
there's a level of human out there
that's in, in denial about real life too.

176
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,010
Like they don't want to know that far.
It's exists on real things of that nature,

177
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,940
which is bizarre to me.

178
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,410
And he thought it was you or no, hands
up scaling my kid's life, so help me God,

179
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,220
nothing closed when it was smelly anyway,
it was smelly.

180
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,520
She'll just shit myself.

181
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,550
But you know that love towards you
in a documentary and scared to F it.

182
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,790
It smelled like that. I put
my hands up Google. Oh, sorry.

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,410
Yeah, that's great. Is that they're still
discussing the fart. Yeah. And he's still,

184
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,740
and he's saying, oh, going on. I'm
not ashamed to admit. Yeah, I do that.

185
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:20,520
I would have said I farted there.
Sure. But let's see. Sorry.

186
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,060
And he thought it was you. Oh No. Hands
up. Just get on my kid's life. So help me.

187
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,150
God, nothing closed anyway. It was smelly.

188
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,800
Usually have half out and still
just shit myself, you know,

189
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:34,390
like love towards you in a documentary.

190
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,740
Scared to f five five that
smelled like that. I put my
hands up the war. Oh, sorry.

191
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,560
That's great. It's great. Yeah, it's just,
just became my new favorite professional.

192
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,740
We got to follow darts.

193
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,200
Well don't tell me you will
not see. Boy, he's up there.

194
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,630
So I'll definitely keep the
was the other day and it was,

195
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,600
I was eggs rotten eggs.
Not from you. Not from me.

196
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,460
No, no, no. Okay. Thank you. And I be
telling me walk past it was a wife.

197
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,010
They're rotten eggs.
That's why I was thinking of some,

198
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,260
we're still discussing this year.
He's so sincere.

199
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
I figured this is what this
would be like Joey Diaz.

200
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,340
It'd be like if he was like professional.
Yeah.

201
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,430
I know at any of this he would be going
interviews about like you smell that

202
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:24,660
shit during the match. That wasn't me dog.
I would have told you I fucking fired.

203
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,580
Yeah, he would totally be
like that. Unreal man. Yeah.

204
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,530
I feel like it has to do with dark,

205
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,440
the world of darts and also
that they have a better,

206
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,960
they're more comfortable
with talking about, you know,

207
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,200
they're not so serious over
there. Yeah. I mean, oddly enough,

208
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:42,930
because the high society is very
serial. They're not high. Listen,

209
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:47,700
if you're and in darts, you're hanging
out in bars, but it's pub culture.

210
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,290
That's why these guys hang out in bars.

211
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:53,900
Get hammered and throw a throw needles
around. Yeah. Yeah. I will smell it.

212
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,400
Yeah. It's like watching shuffleboard
though. It's gotta be so God damn boring.

213
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,940
Yeah. It shuffleboard
professional. They're probably,

214
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,610
there's probably a pro level
of a, of everything. Well,

215
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:09,300
the at the dark guys will
actually, I mean, we're not
planning for like, you know,

216
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:13,270
NBA, NFL money, but they'll actually
make money in these terms. Sure. No,

217
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,150
the only thing more boring is that
curling at the Canadians do, I mean,

218
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:21,700
what the fuck is that? Even if it's
an Olympic event, you can be list.

219
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,800
So boring. What are we watching
the hockey puck going? No,

220
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,210
that's horrible. That is so fucking
boring. It's sweeping, right?

221
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:34,020
It's how fast you can sweep. Well,
you, you, they shut, you know,

222
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,530
somebody pushes it and then the people
sweep the ice right in front of it.

223
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,510
But then you also want it to stop in a
certain place, you know? Yeah. One knock.

224
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,890
That next motherfucker's out I think
too. Oh, okay. So it's like Shuffleboard,

225
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,890
I guess. Oh, nice.

226
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,830
That was how it was. Eggs. Rotten eggs.

227
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,970
Yeah.
Farts.

228
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,410
I had so many last night. We're just
coming out of Thanksgiving week. Yeah.

229
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,520
And that's a far,
it's all week.

230
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:03,640
It's probably the hardiest
weaken America for sure.

231
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,000
Imagine all the farts in
shifts have happened. I know.

232
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:11,370
And then this morning I made Brown
and I had the two I shed to shower at,

233
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,310
cause normally I rely on the
toto to clean up the remnants.

234
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,300
But there was so much of a
schmear on the toilet paper.

235
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,560
It was like a Hershey kiss
was melted in there and I,

236
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I just knew that I needed
soap and water the day I did.

237
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,550
I was telling you that. Yeah.
But I still get the leaky,

238
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:34,800
but it's like a never
ending wipe that caused it.

239
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,600
Mediterranean. Mediterranean. Yeah.

240
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,580
And then we had sausage last night,
like the, I'm sorry, the salaams right.

241
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,470
So processed meats on top
of Mediterranean. I did a
late night t j run. Yeah,

242
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,800
late night, but late for
the clock friends. Yeah. No,

243
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,340
it was like stepping back in time.

244
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,640
For some reason I didn't even
know there was one nearby.

245
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,560
They do a bad job of like
the sign is not even in,

246
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:02,420
they're very upset with their lack
of proper signage. I'm serious.

247
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,630
It's like it's tucked away. I
know. Even if you'd put the,

248
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,700
put the navigation on it tells you
to go off a side street to go into,

249
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,390
I mean it's just, it's weird. But
anyway, that used to be our spot.

250
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,080
Um, when we lived in
silver lake many years ago,

251
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,000
we had a TJ on our street, like a block
we could walk to it. And that was,

252
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,410
we lived at trader Joe Traders,
Joe Joe,

253
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:31,040
and then there was the same cheese
next door. Yeah, on Hyperion.

254
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,460
And that was great too.
Cheese store spend a lot of spend money.

255
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,580
We did not have it. Oh for sure.
But it felt like, you know,

256
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:41,950
seeing the old treats there, I was like,
oh, this is like a flashback. Tried that.

257
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,840
As Joe has an, especially, I
liked the seasonal items too.

258
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:47,090
They got that gingerbread
house you can make now.

259
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,830
My favorite are those Italian squares,
the chocolate wafer squares.

260
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,190
They did not have those lines out here.
Know the guy was like,

261
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,360
I don't even know what you're
talking about. I'm like,

262
00:15:56,361 --> 00:16:00,280
do not fucking work at trader's Joe.
I couldn't believe it.

263
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,180
And then I liked their pursuits.
The German for judo. I booed out.

264
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:08,120
We got to get your Gouda wheel.
I got to tell you each fan of that.

265
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,440
Good at really good prices,

266
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:14,210
Buddy Eddie Pepitone who was like,
yeah,

267
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,800
but five bags of stuff for $100. It's
true though. It's true. It is true.

268
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,240
I asked for a wine recommendation and
the guy knows his stuff and he's telling

269
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:28,100
him, you know, regions and this and that,
and he goes, this is a really good bottle.

270
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,570
It's got these notes, and
I was like, okay. I go, you
know, I'm not that particular,

271
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,450
but he's like, oh, you know,
when my cousin got married,

272
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,450
we actually brought a case of these and
it was, it's amazing. It's great wine.

273
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,600
I said, all right. It was, it's
like seven bucks. It was crazy.

274
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,330
You know what I really liked there?
The freeze dried strawberries, fever.

275
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,980
I had gotten a pouch full of those fro
freezing and frozen dried strawberries.

276
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,440
I have not.
The thing is they're just strawberries,

277
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:58,550
but they're prepared like astronaut
food, so they're crunchy. It's just fun.

278
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,570
It's like a silly way to each or your
bra stories. It was was a good time.

279
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,660
Now I also like,
they're dried apricots and,

280
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,310
and you know those give me intense farts.
They do.

281
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:14,390
I always like to leave when I know
you're going to have dried apricot or I

282
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:18,230
encourage you to eat them when I'm out
of town and those will make me shit.

283
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,580
Oh yeah, they will make you shit. What
makes you shit? Ah, so many things.

284
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,950
Fried foods make me shit back. That's
diarrhea. That's not really a farter.

285
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,730
It's like just, it's straight to seven.
That's what I call it. Take a bite guard.

286
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,710
This is a straight to seven.

287
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,370
That's just anything fried is what
you're saying. It's just really,

288
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,570
it's bad.

289
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,110
You ever shower after you don't like me
or you just let them a day? There's days.

290
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,290
Yeah.
I mean like I like,

291
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,030
I like to see if I can handle everything
with the bad day. I'll do two a day.

292
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,960
Full washes. You Know Tim? Yeah. But if
I'm doing, if it's a leaky, I'm like,

293
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,890
what's going on? And then I wipe
again. It's still a smear. I'm like,

294
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,960
I gotta take a shower. It bothers
me. How come though? And I'm

295
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,840
sure it's very serious
scientific question.

296
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,090
How come when you have like
a mushy wipe? Okay. Yeah,

297
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,010
but how come when I wash
it out with soap and water,

298
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,190
it stops the leaky. But, but let's
just say I just do a washlet,

299
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,780
but I do a thorough wash. It's not the
same. Why does, it doesn't make sense.

300
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,600
It doesn't make sense. I
agree. It doesn't make sense.

301
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,220
I'm being sincere. I'm being
sincere in the medical community.

302
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,650
Tell me why the soap and the wash does
a more thorough job. It stops the leaky,

303
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:45,390
but right in its tracks.
It's a great question. I'm
serious. It's a great question.

304
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,000
There are doctors that listen
unbelievable, so they can,

305
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,300
the question she's asking is how come?
You know what?

306
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,740
I think it might have something to do
with though standing up for a while.

307
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,000
There's a theory, you know? Like
my dad used to tell me, he's like,

308
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,070
sometimes she does stand up, let
everything fall back into place. Right.

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,720
Because when you sit down,
everything's kind of gate opens.

310
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,900
That's a really good
point. Yeah. Wait a minute,

311
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,230
you're telling me it's not the soap and
the water in the wash that's doing it,

312
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,040
but that rather I am standing in,
my muscles are kind of going back and I'm,

313
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,260
I'm interesting. It's all going
back. Wow. Now speaking of,

314
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:34,540
but topics, we had a guest
over at our home, um,

315
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,830
who is a physician's assistant and we
were getting to hear some cool stories

316
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,800
about working in an er as
a physician's assistant.

317
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,640
And this person was telling us that they
saw a lot of things in people's butts a

318
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,490
lot that it's, it never
stops. Isn't that funny?

319
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,430
A Plastic Cup.
A Plastic Cup.

320
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,980
How do you even get a cup
in your button in this case,

321
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,740
this guy just happened to stumble,
right Andrea.

322
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,500
But sometimes people put them in there.
Do you know how stupid I was?

323
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,260
Cause she made that
joke. She was like, oh,

324
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:13,410
he just fell out on the ha and I
was like, really? That can happen.

325
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,630
Like I totally didn't. And
you're being sincere. Why would,

326
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:21,600
but that's like a cop. Why would you put
a cup in your button? Like a Red One?

327
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,790
I like the color makes a difference.
It's like a type of,

328
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,200
I dunno, it'd be you just got us. I
just what's around and you're like,

329
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:36,060
I want something in my ass and you
finish. Well, I'm not using this anymore.

330
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,120
I want her a cycle. I don't want to throw
one of your favorite segments here. Uh,

331
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,500
drugs or mental illness.
Here we go.

332
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,453
I don't care.

333
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,223
Hmm.

334
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,260
I got you.
I got you.

335
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,540
No Bitch.
You fucking bitch.

336
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,953
Hmm.

337
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,280
Ain't nobody got 10,000 artists like me.

338
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,373
What's your theory?

339
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,140
Got a video. Well, look,

340
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,520
apparently that's a porn star. Oh, is
that right? That's what it says here.

341
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,730
What do you think? Drugs
or mental illness. She's a
porn star and a rapper. Hmm.

342
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,650
Oh, there's another clip of
her hitting her boyfriend

343
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,860
and that Jesus.

344
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,420
God. Well, I'll tell you what the,
the time of day, it's broad daylight.

345
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,820
I don't think that matters. I guess
people do drugs all day long. Yeah.

346
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,050
She's really heated though.
That's not a normal,

347
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,180
it's in the eyes and those eyes tell you
crazy. I'm going to go mental illness.

348
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Yeah. I think less drugs. More rage. More,

349
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,510
more emotion.

350
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,700
I'm going to go mental
illness coupled with drugs.

351
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,300
Maybe you're saying both a little
bit about little bit of everything.

352
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,190
The thing is they're
usually not far apart.

353
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,540
They usually like to hang out
together, so could be, um,

354
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,523
okay.

355
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,410
I tell you something. I was
thinking right here. Hmm. Um,

356
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,710
safety issue.
Good point.

357
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,420
She's wearing stilettos standing
on a drain cover and there's just,

358
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:11,430
there's holes in it. And I'm
really worried about safety.
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

359
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,520
And I'm seeing maybe a Tib fib
fracture happening. Kid Fib. Yup.

360
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,240
Tip Fib could just go like that if
she takes a wrong stuff. I mean, look,

361
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,520
what would she do that? Look
at this one. This one's,

362
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,180
it's right there on the edge right
there. I know. I'm nervous about it. I'm,

363
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,390
I'm sitting here like,
you're going to get hurt to nail biter.

364
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,230
That's really not good to stand like
that now. But this is her video.

365
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:34,110
She might need to pair up with Nicole.
Can that man,

366
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:37,090
I tell you what's offensive about
this video already. She goes, bitch,

367
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm Heidi flies. But let me tell you
something about Heidi Fleiss. Yeah,

368
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,990
that bitch is a fucking genius. Well,
that's why she's saying it. Yeah.

369
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,650
But she ain't know Heidi Fleiss.

370
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,030
But I mean she just a how Heidi
was the ho she was the, the pimp.

371
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:54,020
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. She's
a smart lady. Oh, manager. Yeah. No,

372
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,510
this bitch can we say
wow.

373
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,090
Wow.
Wow.

374
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,710
Hollywood man and bitch strip.
Yes.

375
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:11,420
Politics, politicians, shit.
Hollywood. Madam Bitch.

376
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,690
Thank Hilda policy.
I don't like machine.

377
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,780
Please don't rush me.

378
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,580
I think one of the things
she should invest in is, um,

379
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,140
maybe some other mix,

380
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,370
some of the not the highest quality audio
production value is deduction of low.

381
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,870
Yeah. But then again, it might be
your first song. You never know.

382
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,370
Somewhere la thirst million.
Four months,

383
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,900
a hundred back the night.
Count this money.

384
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,770
Hi. Nice to me.

385
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,550
I know you want to thank
me by really ready.

386
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,020
I think too, again, I got to
say I'm a big fan. I'm not,

387
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,970
I'm not good at rapping. Yeah. Even I
know that her tempo is not right. Like,

388
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:04,280
she's not keeping up with
the, Oh, you're saying,

389
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,360
you're saying just like the pacing,
the pacing is off. And she said, yeah,

390
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,340
you want to get money. You know
what? I get it then it's, it's off.

391
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,760
Right. You know, but it's also, I
mean, you remember your first set,

392
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,070
you know what I mean?
It's gotta get you gotta work at it,

393
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,830
but I think you want to discourage anyone.

394
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,210
I don't want to discourage anybody art,

395
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,810
but I think she needs a little help
with the tempo and the pace today.

396
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,130
Yeah. She's the shit though.
You know what I mean?

397
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,560
But you have to have some kind of native
timing. Yeah. Native sense of timing,

398
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,600
right? Like, yeah, it's intuitive.

399
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,160
I assume somebody's got 10,000
artists like me. Actually,

400
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,280
a lot of people have
$10,000. It's all right. Um,

401
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:50,450
let's see if she's really saying it's
$10,000 seem low to you for a pair of

402
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:55,250
boobs. I mean, I, that seems
really cheap to me for tits.

403
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,790
Um, yeah. I don't know. Let's
see. I'm looking up her, uh,

404
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,640
her porno category. Oh, okay. What, what
kind of stuff does she do? All right,

405
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:08,330
here's some descriptions. What do you,
wait, let me guess first. I'm going to go,

406
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,580
she's, she's does the interracial
lot of black guys stuff like black.

407
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,910
I'm going to go for just, just judging
by her demeanor, what I've seen.

408
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,750
I'm going to go for, um,
interracial gang bang,

409
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,710
like the five black guys on her kind
of thing. She's this. All right.

410
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:27,630
Well here's some descriptions. Okay. Is
it just the scene description? Go ahead.

411
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,510
Okay. All right. Uh,

412
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,670
Belarus riding a cock while her girlfriend
watches a busty Bella Reese plump

413
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:39,630
Posi Slam from behind. Okay.
Sounds pretty vanilla heart.

414
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,290
Bella Reese gets pounded by her ebony
lover. Okay. You were right there. Okay.

415
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,180
Um, Bella Reese gets her big
ass ready for an ass. Fuck.

416
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,600
So she does anal.
She's kind of all over the place.

417
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:55,830
I don't see her specializing in it
shows a lot of these are actually anal.

418
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,000
Valerie's gets her tied.

419
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,260
Asshole assaulted Bella begging for a dig,

420
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:05,550
pounding up, harass the,
seems like maybe she's, um,

421
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,150
he uses her butthole lot.
She's anal girl. Yeah. Um,

422
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,970
it looks like I wouldn't have guessed
that. I wouldn't have guessed that. Oh,

423
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:17,340
it looks like she fucked her trainer
at the gym. I didn't know that.

424
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,740
So I was here. Oh, but Italian Bay bell
Reese takes on a black monster cock. Yeah.

425
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,920
She likes black eyes or her boyfriend.
Is that right? That was her boyfriend,

426
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,530
individual.
Um,

427
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,770
and then it just says Bella
Reese with a dude camping, uh,

428
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:34,840
and she fucks his big cock. What else
would, it's funny that they would do,

429
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,330
they would let you know that that's what
she does. She fucks the big cock. Yeah,

430
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,930
right. Yeah. Well there you go. Wow.

431
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,300
I don't get fired. Yeah, she looks like
she does. I'm definitely does it for real.

432
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,320
However, I would say that if
I were an adult entertainer,

433
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:56,340
that I would try to make songs too. I
feel like you would a good marketing tool,

434
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,420
like if she was decent at
it and if you're good at it,

435
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,450
it could be a real thing would be if
she was a porn star that could wrap.

436
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,200
That'd be kind of,
or imagine if like you were,

437
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,680
if you actually started selling
album stuff, here's the thing,

438
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,050
but you didn't quit porn. See all the
time whenever it was, whenever, uh,

439
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,810
the other stuff takes off
for the porn person, they're
like, aw, I'm stomping porn.

440
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,060
But if you kept doing porn, that's
what I mean. That'd be hard. Cool. Rad.

441
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,040
That'd be some g shit right
there. Yeah. She'd sell so many.

442
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,630
I'm more of everything. I want to get to
this before we have to take our break.

443
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:29,190
We have a guest coming in a little while,

444
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,350
but it was so popular this past week
showing it was just out of control.

445
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,780
Uh, there are more. Good
Morning Julia submissions.

446
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,240
Can I tell you that I can't get enough?

447
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,910
And I watched it when I
was away over the weekend.

448
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,810
Even shows that can't stop.
I can't stop watching Joe.

449
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,970
Uh, good morning Julia. Um,

450
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,390
I haven't really watched our submissions
from last week. That's what I'm saying.

451
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,890
So funny. The guy with the
fans was fucking amazing. I
have not seen any of these.

452
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,500
Just a heads up.
I have nothing to any of these blue band.

453
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,230
Put these in a folder for me.
So I'm,

454
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,400
I'm seeing these for the first time
just like you are just like Christina is

455
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:13,500
okay and jewelry is Jacob

456
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,410
[inaudible] they can forget
about that exit years

457
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,250
and I just,

458
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,350
I just know we're going to have a good
time together and go full throttle.

459
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,580
And uh, this is where I were.
I put all the plumbing is

460
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,220
every
type of man you're dealing with.

461
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:11,050
Look at that thing. I just, I
hope to hear back from you too,

462
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:14,990
baby. Three day, full throttle.

463
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,480
You know what that guy really captured.
I'd like the fan work. I liked the dirt.

464
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,310
The movement. The eyes. Yeah. His
intense relentless eye contact.

465
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,030
Yeah. Cause you notice the Joe really a
seductive, comforting thing for a one C,

466
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,400
right? Like when a woman, when
a man, yeah, break or blink,

467
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,960
it's relentless and they,
I think he captured the essence of Joe,

468
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:42,560
this guy because of the, the
relentlessness of the icon. By the way,

469
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,140
the Real Julia, we've been in
contact, we've been trying,

470
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,450
she has a job that doesn't allow her
to, um, always match our schedule.

471
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:54,770
But we continue to stay in contact and
we're still fingers crossed for possibly

472
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,790
next week.

473
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,200
I can't believe she's not making your
mom's house podcast her priority. I know,

474
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,090
I know. She really should be. I can
quit that job and take our call.

475
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:08,750
Juliet, here's faith Saul
important. Good Morning Julia.

476
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,100
I just wanted to tell you that again,

477
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,380
this bend my anniversary
with you the other day.

478
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,510
It was one of the greatest
moments of my life. Anyway,

479
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,580
I'll, uh, I'll hop off here,
but have a good day baby. Ciao.

480
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,650
Yeah, she spent her anniversary
with Julia did. Yeah. Yeah.

481
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,910
Oh my God. I love the way she got it.
[inaudible] submission. I love it.

482
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:36,830
And she nailed his accent and the
creepiness of the look. Very nice.

483
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,053
Nailed it.

484
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,670
One Julia and more fans meet Joe Swayla.

485
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,400
You know these fans go full throttle.

486
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,840
He's got the accent down. Perfect.
Yes. Who is this? This is a Chris.

487
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,763
Good morning,

488
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,520
Julia. I'm so excited.
I can hardly contain it.

489
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,230
I don't know if you recognize this,
but I'm in your class

490
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,570
is fixing your bed frame
almost some restraints and uh,

491
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,430
I heard you coming in through the
front door. They're terrified.

492
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,190
Kudos. Ah, this a lot of stuff.

493
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:31,570
I could be fixing your class.
I was asleep.

494
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,040
I can't wait to call end of that.
What?

495
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,520
You're so fucking full
trial when I get in that bed

496
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,570
second.
Yeah,

497
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,780
it was gray listening. Oh
my God. It's a ski mask.

498
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,670
Dan. Hey Julia. She all this,

499
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,030
all this built all this myself.

500
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,020
Every flake, every leaf. I built it
all and I'll build it for you Julia.

501
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,510
It's the kiss now really makes me,

502
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,580
it makes my stomach turn weird.
This is so weird.

503
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,200
What do you think Joe's doing?

504
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:23,201
Do you think he's commit suicide yet of
all those horrible mess and I don't want

505
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:28,420
them to know. Neither do I, but I'm just
saying he's got it. Where is Joe? Yeah,

506
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,320
we had a talk to him, figure
out his life. Did he? Uh,

507
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,860
he told this is the type of guy you get.
Oh, so fortune. Let's make it happen.

508
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,050
Let's make it happen. Wow. Oh Wow.

509
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,340
Wow, wow. Ciao baby. Kiss is like, uh,

510
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,490
no. Good. And here's Darren.

511
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,120
Good morning,
Julia.

512
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,350
Just work to show you by a basement.

513
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:00,610
I took it completely with my bare hands
to the ground as though it all for you,

514
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:05,670
Julia. I want you to see this because
you'll be spending less time down here.

515
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,360
Julie. I love you. You're my flower.

516
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,720
You're my pressures about every day.

517
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,713
Oh,
okay.

518
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,330
Go full throttle down here
in the basement, Julia.

519
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,870
Well, you know what I like about
this one? The suit, the suit.

520
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:26,380
I feel like this, this is a
biggest departure from this
dude's real personality.

521
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,360
Thinks. I was thinking, do you
like about this? Is that this guy?

522
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,270
This is really stepping out for him.
Do this.

523
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,300
Could be like a an attorney or
something like that. In real. Yeah.

524
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:40,170
Somebody is going to be like high fashion
defendant court and you're doing good

525
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:41,460

have started texting each other.

528
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:55,260
Good Morning Juliet.

529
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,290
And that's what we say to each other
now and the other one wakes up.

530
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:03,090
It's pretty great. It's taken over
the house and taking over our lives.

531
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,830

00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,443

I Dunno.

563
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,690
That's okay. Tuesday and they'll
replay it and everything, but yeah,

564
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,150
just so people know,

565
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,500
it's a one off sketch special one hour
sketch comedy special called goat face.

566
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,310
Goats face. Yeah. It's with Hassan Minhaj
from daily show was on Patriot Act.

567
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:24,230
Now me, Aristotle, theorists,

568
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,440
and also folly. We did Youtube
starts way back in the day. Wow.

569
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,850
Sounds like a lot of enemy on that.

570
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,910
A little darker than most
of the programming I watch.
I'm ended not too dark.

571
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,750
Oh no, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah. We're, we're somewhere
in between. Yeah. Yoga Gateway.

572
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,650
Yeah. Like you look like you
were, I dunno, in Hawaii for
the week. It works for me,

573
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,370
but I do tell people that this is
much easier than explaining what that

574
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,090
explaining my, my more, my
parents were born here. You're
like, I'm going to Hawaii.

575
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,340
Yeah.
The big one,

576
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,650
big one is from Afghanistan.
Just, you know, which I
don't, I've never really met.

577
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:05,150
I've, well, besides his parents are
black. My bloods from there, dude.

578
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,910
Yeah. But he's from here.
He's from Seattle. That's
the Afghanistan of America,

579
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,100
right? He's from our Africanas. I don't,

580
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,760
I don't know nothing.
All the bumper stickers.

581
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,010
I'm trying to think of where the
actual Afghanistan of Americas.

582
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,280
There's definitely not a
Seattle. I love Seattle. No.

583
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,930
Um, let me ask you this.
Um, so when you were,

584
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,720
I imagine that there's
actually probably a,

585
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,740
I'm guessing a big Afghan
maybe population. I'm no,
actually, no. Yeah, no, really.

586
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,010
That's

587
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,870
why I think I am the way I am. Just
a warn, a ton of Afghans. I mean,

588
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:44,410
growing up some, you know, when I
would see other Afghans and stuff,

589
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,830
like there's a bigger population in
Orange County, I would say Virginia,

590
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,870
a Fremont, California, the bay area.

591
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,670
Those are kind of like Ed's fascinating,
um,

592
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,740
hotbeds of certain cultures in places
you don't imagine in the United States.

593
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,540
That's what I feel like. One of them
shows up somewhere and they're just like,

594
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,120
hey everybody, it's true.
Three months where it's at.

595
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,450
I was always fascinated by the number of
retrains and Ethiopians in Minneapolis

596
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:17,710
for this enormous population. They
go to Minneapolis and DC. Why?

597
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,020
I don't fucking know. I think there's
just such a network there already. Yeah.

598
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:25,450
It just makes it easier to kind
of like Cleveland Hungarians,

599
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Polex chicargo Hungarians
Polacks ballet Hungarian.

600
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,560
That's right. That's right. A
lot of roofs skis out here too.

601
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,360
A lot of those brewskies treat like you're
family. You're like, come over here.

602
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:40,530
Come stay with her. Then why did they pick
Seattle if there wasn't a big hot bed?

603
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,810
Dad was finishing up university and they
were about four and says it said it was

604
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:49,990
going to do the versus I was going
to. Yeah. Or like what is the disco?

605
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,360
Just certain words. Did
you do university? Yeah.

606
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,180
And then did he finish university now? He
did it. Yeah. He said to here in America.

607
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,630
Okay, I'm so bad at this. I
should key cause it came twice.

608
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,270
He came in North Dakota and Minnesota,
I don't know which is which.

609
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,770
So he's finishing up his engineering
degree and then Boeing came by because

610
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:15,040
they're trying to do recruitment
and they had a brochure of Seattle.

611
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,870
And so my mom and my dad are
looking at this brochure brochure.

612
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:19,210
This is all they know about Seattle.

613
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:24,130
They see the space needle and they're
like looks good. Yeah. So yeah,

614
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,030
they had out to Seattle.

615
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,420
Now do you have the hat and your house
and I we were talking about earlier the

616
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,790
actual, the Afghan hat. It's
somewhere in a closet somewhere. Yeah.

617
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,750
Cause Hungarians,
we always have a horse hair canteen.

618
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:39,820
Hang that in the hallway and then like
a horn, there's a certain the hallmarks.

619
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,220
What would it be if you're
American and other country?

620
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:44,350
Would it just be like an Apple Pie Tin?

621
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,330
Cozy Kid rock CD? Yeah, totally.

622
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,090
I know what's American.

623
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,710
Oh like that would just like
telegraph American letterman's jacket.

624
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,180
Yeah, definitely. Um,

625
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,620
you know what the like a
lot of like foreigners,

626
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,060
at least I have South American foreign,
you know a blood and family.

627
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,540
So I would go down there a lot.
They always thought James Dean,

628
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:15,400
the look of a white tee shirt
and jeans screamed American.

629
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,940
So sometimes now we always go like,
Oh God,

630
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:20,590
I don't want to seem American anywhere.

631
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,240
But in certain times like if you were
going to discotheque right and to America,

632
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,720
you would put that on and they would be
like, then you were like exotic. Right?

633
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:32,020
So they were like white tee
shirt, blue jeans. They're like,

634
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,280
this is American girl jeans,
blue

635
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,520
jeans screams American.
I like sometimes sometimes you'll catch a,

636
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,420
like my parents or aunts and stuff,
we'll,

637
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:41,660
we'll watch like a
Bollywood satellite channel.

638
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,550
So you get to see like a little snips
of Bollywood videos and you get to see

639
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,690
like their version of what
they think America is.

640
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,760
Like the jeans and the
sunglasses and the shirts.

641
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,980
Like ed hardy hit five years later.

642
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,790
I always liked seeing another country's
version of what they think of marijuana.

643
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,150
It's cause it was always a little
off, a little, a lot of the world.

644
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:08,150
It has to be at hardy a lot
of that as far like America.

645
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,620
You had a beautiful American shirt.
Yeah.

646
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,650
Now you seem to assimilate to our
culture well, which is why you're here.

647
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,540
Did you have an immersion program?
It's really hard to beat it out.

648
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,550
Is it actually more waterboarded
on like did you have a hardcore,

649
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,750
um, African like upbringing though
or no, my parents were pretty chill.

650
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,100
I mean obviously I culturally I do have
that background and baggage a little bit.

651
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,600
It's tough when we were
talking about it outside. Oh,

652
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,820
when you're first generation you kind of
have the burden of trying to uphold the

653
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,920
old traditions.
But then you're also very American too,

654
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,390
so you're kind of torn between the two.

655
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,820
But there wasn't this crazy pressure like,
you know,

656
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:51,170
pray five times a day and blah blah blah.
And there was no, you're not Christian.

657
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,630
Oh fuck. Well this was fun.
God don't touch anything.

658
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,340
I said, I'm sorry. Um, so, but they
were praying five times a day or no, no.

659
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,830
My mom would pray every, every now and
then it stuff. But they would instill,

660
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,600
they would kind of,
now that I'm an adult,

661
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:07,820
I kind of realized it was just sort of
like rocket fuel does they give their

662
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:10,980
kids like, all right, I did my part.
Yeah. You know, I can't say that I did it.

663
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:15,770
A flogging yourself and everything.
No, we were pretty well to do.

664
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:16,890
We had somebody to do that for

665
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,640
the engineered ourselves.
Did you dad pray? No,

666
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,490
he didn't have, uh, no. My Dad
has even more moderate than wow.

667
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,790
He's listening. Like, will you stop
telling people that shit? Yeah.

668
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,620
Tell him I beat you guys
and I'll tell you. Yeah,

669
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,940
he threw keys in my head one time.
I left the garage door open. Yeah,

670
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,350
he just barged into the my bedroom
and we live in like a really,

671
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:45,320
really nice neighborhood.
There's this woods,

672
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:49,190
there's deer maybe would break in at best,
you know?

673
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,880
And I left the door open on accident cause
it's garbage day and then I just wake

674
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,040
up to my dad being like,

675
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:58,850
you left the door open and he tries to
like hit me and then I dodged him and I'm

676
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:02,000
surprised that I talked to him and I
went downstairs but I guess he just threw

677
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:05,780
his keys to the last second I hit the back
of my head. Did you cry? Be Honest? No,

678
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:09,320
but I just like how that, he was good
with that. Like once the keys at my head,

679
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,950
he wasn't staying anymore. He's just
like, all right, satisfied emotionally.

680
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,780
Didn't fuck with you at all.
What the keys at the head.

681
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,890
I was old enough to handle it. Yeah. No,
I know. But I mean him being that upset,

682
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,420
it doesn't make sense. Just my dad. Yeah.
That kind of anger is not rational to me,

683
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:25,910
but that's just like immigrant anger.
Yes.

684
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:28,610
I remember my dad giving me mad one time
and I fucking, afterwards I was like,

685
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,100
I was like 16

686
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,800
he was mad at me cause I borrow,

687
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,480
I remember I borrowed his golf clubs
and I didn't really know how to golf,

688
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:39,060
but I started, I was like,
I'm start, you know, doing it.

689
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:42,300
And it was during like junior,
senior year of high school or something.

690
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,040
And then it was Saturday.

691
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:49,250
So he went golfing and I didn't put
one of his clubs back in his bag. Fuck.

692
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:52,830
And he called me like so fucking upset.
And I was like,

693
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,740
and then he came back and got his,

694
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,970
his club out of the bag that I had
put it in and he was like, God dammit.

695
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,750
And like just so upset. And I was
like, and then he left and I was like,

696
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,090
I was like, I was really worked up
about it. And then later on he was like,

697
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,710
I'm sorry, probably terrified
you. I was like, yeah, it's
fucking nine iron man. Yes.

698
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,220
Not that big of the deal. No, it was
upset. I bought a wedge of Amazon.

699
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:21,000
You know that like multiple, no, but I
just, I go to the range sometimes. Yeah.

700
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,500
It's basically a batting cage for adults.
Like Boberg does that really? Yeah,

701
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,470
I see that on Instagram.
He constantly puts it in a schedule,

702
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:34,920
30 minutes a day allocated for golf.
He loves it. And even when we did that,

703
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,180
we shot the movie. He would, um,
sometimes play rounds of golf.

704
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,820
Like what'd you have to wait? Like marks
for one a day. Yes. Shit. I was like,

705
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:47,670
why are we shooting this thing? And
they're like, Mark's playing golf.

706
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,480
And I was like, oh, which by the way,
I was like, make sense to me. Um,

707
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,480
he's a huge movie star. Right?
And then they were like, no,

708
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:58,270
he's playing golf in another city.
So we wait for his flight to come in.

709
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,480
And I was like, Mike, I still
make sense. That's what I mean.

710
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:04,920
You know what he likes? Yeah.
Literally nobody complained.

711
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:06,780
It was like some cities what it is.
Yeah.

712
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:09,950
They were just like some grip or something
was like, yeah, he's flying background.

713
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,640
I was like, oh, okay. It's
funny. I think my dad was angry.

714
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,380
A lot hard to imagine you're dead, but yet

715
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,070
you have your notes.
She has a foreign,

716
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,840
one time I backed up in the rain and I,

717
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,300
there was a car parked long ways against
a wall and I just fucking smash it to

718
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:37,730
this guy's car. I was 16 years old
and I just fucked this car. And he is,

719
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,510
that was when he had the maddest at me.

720
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:42,510
I think fucking up a car will
really bring out dad rage.

721
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,650
So my older sister was in,
by the time she was 18,

722
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,600
double digit car accidents. And the
accident meaning even as simple as,

723
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,020
you know what a gas station, the island
at the gas station sits on the gas pump.

724
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,200
She hit that, she backed
into light poles. She uh,

725
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,030
hit,
she's just like Ping Pong def,

726
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,760
no spatial awareness and just
simply put not a good driver,

727
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,410
you know, speeding tickets, running
stop. Like everything you could fuck up.

728
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:16,110
She fucked up.
And one time,

729
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,070
I'll never forget they had a um,
in their,

730
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,190
in their bedroom they had basically the
bed on this side of the room and on this

731
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:30,130
side of the room where the TV was sitting,
the wall was also

732
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,420
like custom cabinets. Like it
was part of the wall. Right.

733
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,790
And My,
my,

734
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,490
my sister got a speeding
ticket called the house,

735
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,210
told my mom and my dad was
opening a drawer in that,

736
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,030
like that wall builtin as my mom told
him and he pulled the whole thing out of

737
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,500
the wall.
Like he removed,

738
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:58,501
like he was so upset that he was like
fuck and pulled this whole wall off and

739
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,230
she got a hundred. She was
going 105 and a 55. Oh my God.

740
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,510
That's just reckless though. I feel like
I'm one ticket in my whole life. Really.

741
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,940
It wasn't,
it was in like,

742
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,880
it was like the short drive to get to
my parents' house in the development.

743
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,150
It's such the lamest ticket too,
but I did a deferral.

744
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,970
That is where it was for going.
What were you doing?

745
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,480
I was probably doing like 30 and a 25,
but he made it sound like I was doing,

746
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:27,890
I got a seven over a literal seven over
ticket in South Carolina once she was

747
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:32,350
like seven. That's a team.
Burbank. That's legit. It's legit.

748
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,380
I had to do community
service and shit like, uh,

749
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:40,890
so I worked the library for Cup
story. Where the library, Barry Barry,

750
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,740
sorry. There's no, our library
library. Yeah. Oh, sorry.

751
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,500
Yeah, yeah. You're welcome. We're
native speakers here. Sorry. Yeah.

752
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,010
So library. I've been saying it
wrong my whole life just gets,

753
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,740
so there's some other words we might teach
you to pronounce what you had to help

754
00:48:57,741 --> 00:49:00,560
him out.
Oh Shit.

755
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,990
Let me try to think hard as one

756
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:10,400
x specially like if something's
expensive, special espresso. Espresso.

757
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:13,990
Espresso, right? Yeah. Do you
want a double espresso? Right.

758
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,940
If you're especially tired and
you should get one similar. Yes.

759
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,480
Similar to something you
gotta be Real Pacific.

760
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:24,410
Like when you say is you gotta be really
Pacific so you don't confuse people,

761
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:28,580
you know? Okay. Yeah. Um,
what else? I don't know.

762
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,120
Everything can kind of be a blessing in
disguise when you're blessing this guy.

763
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,050
Yeah. You know, that's a t shirt shop.

764
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,470
So there's all these things you're
obviously learning while you're here.

765
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:43,040
This is a fresh, um, goat face.
Yeah, go tomorrow. Here's a clip.

766
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,790
Oh,

767
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:48,260
[inaudible]

768
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,213
comedy central.

769
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,780
That was great because
in my mind I'm like, oh,

770
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:58,250
he has a club who gave her, I
actually saw the clip or like, oh man,

771
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:01,610
there's so studious. Like they, they,
they went and they dug it up somehow.

772
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,540
Does he know that? Absolutely. Everybody
has fallen for it. Why would you not know?

773
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,100
I know, I know. It's pretty great.

774
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,820
I have legit gotten clips on
certain things. So, you know,

775
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,870
we talked to the publicist and
they give us a clip, but um,

776
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,300
it's more fun for the person to
be like, Oh shit, here's for sure.

777
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,880
What if we have a sketch like that?
And I'm just sort of like,

778
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,200
that's actually one of my
sayings is we worked really hard.

779
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:28,160
I work really hard in the vomit.
Why is it called goat? I don't know.

780
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,560
I think when we were brainstorming
as to what the call, the group,

781
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:35,150
we were just kind of free associating.
And then somebody said, God,

782
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,600
what if it's just like a goat's phase?
And then upon Campbell,

783
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,750
like Ghostface killers.
And that made us laugh.

784
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:46,430
And then I thought it's because there's
always like goat jokes about that.

785
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,160
You know, the record tryout
fuckers is, you know, there's,

786
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,930
I guess there might be
a Sys of, Oh, I dunno.

787
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,000
Well that's not what we were thinking
about, but it was pretty much the pond.

788
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,730
And then killers got lopped
off and we just stuck with Gus.

789
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:03,410
He's dealt fuckers instead.
I think that would be a real crowd drug,

790
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:08,180
don't you think? Oh yeah, I watch
a show called gophers. Yeah.

791
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,160
What about Gulf fucker yourself?

792
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:17,000
Um, go fuck out your face. Did you guys,

793
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,650
you got you and everybody in this
shot sketches for years? Uh, well,

794
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:23,300
so what happened was like,
I mean,

795
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,700
the genesis of it was I started
doing standup in Seattle.

796
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,000
So I was doing it for
four years out there.

797
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,260
And while I was getting my degree to
do mechanical engineering at Udab,

798
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,360
God mechanical engineering and Mechanical
Click of a parent's like I wanted to

799
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:37,160
do theater and shit and
like all this cause I,

800
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,970
I knew I want to do this type of stuff.
And when you're young and you're like,

801
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,720
oh okay I need a theater degree, you
just dumb as shit. You know what I mean?

802
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,000
You go okay I need,
I need to see her degree to do that.

803
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,910
And then luckily my dad is like,
if I'm paying for college I'm not,

804
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,480
I'm not going to pay for a theater
degree. Smart. And then I go,

805
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:55,190
so I kept on getting more and
more water down. I was like okay,

806
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:56,480
what about an English degree?

807
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,490
And he's like no I'm not going
to this in front of the way.

808
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,200
Real like dad shit too is like no,
especially immigrant dad too. Cause like,

809
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,410
like you're going to all the time here in
America with patron. Follow your heart,

810
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,190
Dylan, whatever you want to do, find
yourself if that's what you want to do.

811
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:15,120
Philosophy might be,

812
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,540
I had to talk my parents into it cause
they're like what these philosophy degree

813
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:21,261
and I was like,

814
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:23,570
I'm going to go to law school with it
and that's what I lied to them and I was

815
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:24,410
like,
I'm just going to go to law school.

816
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,600
It's the only way to get into law schools.
And classrooms was thrilled.

817
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:30,200
I can put together a sentence. They
were just like, you can get any degree.

818
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:37,560
So then I was like, what about me? What
about film? And they're like, no, no,

819
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:42,440
it's about real engineering. Core
engineering was the basement pretty much.

820
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,090
And I just knew I wanted it. Your Dad was
not fucking around with this for sure.

821
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:48,470
It wasn't fucking around. I was
like, I was supposed to be a doctor,

822
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:51,590
I'm supposed to be a doctor
or like a dentist or a lawyer.

823
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,600
So I was slumming it even
with engineering. But he
would pony up for engineering.

824
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,190
And then I was like,
what type of engineering should I do?

825
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,530
And my best friend across the
street was doing mechanical.

826
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,060
It's like I'll do mechanical,

827
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,030
I'll get to hang out with my
friend more around the university.

828
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:07,940
So I chose mechanical.
I just wanted to be out in four years.

829
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:10,970
I didn't want to find myself because
I knew I was, I was trying to do this.

830
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,210
You really knew, you knew then? Yeah,
there's always a means to an end.

831
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:19,130
So I was like, let me just, you know,
just suck it up, get the degree,

832
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,710
get a job,
and then I could support myself.

833
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:24,890
I could just apply for jobs and sow cow
and then I can live out here and just do

834
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,590
comedy at night and all that. And so
that's how I got out here. And then, uh,

835
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,000
but it was tough when you move,

836
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,440
where did you just stand up out
here or where did you come from?

837
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:34,290
When I started here. You
started in la? Yeah. That's,

838
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:38,070
so that was boggled my mind to start in
La only because I didn't know any better

839
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:40,210
though. You know what I mean? Okay.
Yeah. I didn't come in here like,

840
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,140
I got to think about that.
When you early on in your comedy career,

841
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:46,040
how like ignorance is bliss. I tell
people all the time, we're like, gosh,

842
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:49,230
what I should do. I'm like,
no, don't do that. I mean,
you can't having perspective.

843
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,060
It's crazy to think like I would drive
up from long beach almost every night

844
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:57,600
after work to do like Mike's in the
valley and Shit. You know what I mean?

845
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,380
I feel like, how are we doing? I mean
like I've known, I've seen you chose for,

846
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,020
it's gotta be over a
decade a while. Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,100
So then the third is when you
moved to from a smaller market,

848
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:09,420
because I was doing well in Seattle,

849
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:13,350
he can get up and you're kind of
somebody in in that set of market, same.

850
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,380
But eventually you gotta you gotta leave
and when you go to a saturated place

851
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:20,820
like New York or La, you're nobody again,
except you know how to write a joke.

852
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,220
You just, you just have like four
years of experience under your belt,

853
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,900
but you're still not getting up. So it
was tough. I was creatively backlog. I'm,

854
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:29,130
I'm not getting on stage is really,
it's just really hard to get up.

855
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,390
So then I started making
some sketches just uh,

856
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,680
as a way to do that or
just kind of as an outlet.

857
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,270
And so I've had this youtube channel
slash doc 2000 and I would just put videos

858
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:44,250
up on there while I was
doing standup around town.

859
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:49,020
And then my buddy Aristotle who went
to USC film school and he has a real,

860
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,760
he's a talented director
and comedian as well.

861
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:53,940
We became friends and he liked the
videos I was doing. We teamed up,

862
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,170
some of them went viral
and then we decided to,

863
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,680
to add Hassan and awesome, cause it's
more of an angle cause me and him,

864
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,820
it's not really a statement. I'm
Afghan, he's half Greek, half Iranian.

865
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,100
That's not really a thing.
But we were like,

866
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:12,300
if we add also often a song that's kind
of like Fort Brown dudes who do just

867
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,890
like regular,
just dope sketch,

868
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,520
not about Auntie and uncle shit all
the time because we have very American

869
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:21,310
sensibilities. We all, we
all grew up here. You know,
I grew up on SNL calling in.

870
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,590
Isn't that interesting though, that
like, uh, I think that's a more, uh,

871
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:30,710
it's more indicative or like a reflection
of the time now that 15 or 20 years

872
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:37,290
ago for sure you guys would all
be like, Ma, I talk like this.

873
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,900
Like just like every sketch
would be and now it's like,

874
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:48,450
Oh yeah,
I've always found just in terms of comedy,

875
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:53,190
no, I'm the Hashtag [inaudible] place.
And sometimes it's really funny.

876
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,520
I mean I remember that like
someone told me like, uh,

877
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,080
I mean it was a few hours in there.

878
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:01,410
Like you've never mentioned that
your mom's from Peru. And I'm like,

879
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,350
I must have more power in that though. It
just never, it never occurred to me to,

880
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,680
sure.
It wasn't like,

881
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:13,190
but also like I grew up like pretty
immersed obviously in American culture and

882
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,970
so I, yeah, it would be disingenuous
to you if you were to doing that. Sure.

883
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:20,100
That's a part of you.
But if you're playing up that angle,

884
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,870
you would feel weird doing sure.

885
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,350
I figured out way to talk about it
in a way that feels authentic to me.

886
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,820
And I've always been that way as well
to where my sensibilities are very

887
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:35,710
American. But I do have that gear.
It's always funny first brown second,

888
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,930
like that's, yeah, that's the second part
of my identity. You find American comedy.

889
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:43,230
So I'm a number one brown
and foreign people, uh,

890
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,740
being disappointed sometimes because

891
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:52,690
here's what's kind of annoying. Like,
um, I think when it saved my background,

892
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:53,381
Sam Afghan,

893
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:57,460
and sometimes I get these messages
back in the day and sometimes still now

894
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:00,010
they're like, Yo, come to
my university and my MSA,

895
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,790
like it's a Muslim student organization,
come do our event.

896
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,100
And I know that if I did that event,
they would not like what I do.

897
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,310
They have an idea of what I
do or they just see a skin,

898
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,460
skin and comedy and
they add this equation.

899
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,890
And I just know if I were
to do that event, I would,

900
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,920
they would regret it and then I do
comedy or I would have to bend to make

901
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:29,500
everyone happy. So it's just not a good
thing. And I think just foreigners,

902
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,740
whenever they kind of,
they want you to do the inside joke,

903
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,680
which is like talk about the
Middle Eastern. There were like,

904
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:37,870
Persians want you to talk
about Persians of course.

905
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:40,750
But it's such a shallow ceiling.
Yeah.

906
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:45,430
It's such a quick hit and it's almost as
if you have someone who, who, who's hit,

907
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,320
who's doing well on the mainstream level.

908
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,970
It buoys the people way more than like
doing a wedding here or an MSA event or

909
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:56,020
some now Rose Festival. Yeah.
So it's something you still
deal with though, right?

910
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:58,690
People are less so now, because I've had,
you know, I've done some late nights.

911
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:01,450
I've, I've had, I have like
a special, and you know,

912
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:02,860
the comedy central thing coming out.
So it's,

913
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,800
the mainstream is kind of
becoming more successful,

914
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:09,100
whereas when you don't have those
things, they'd be like, Bro, talk about,

915
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:13,450
you'll talk about this more,
talking about our food more. Yeah.

916
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:17,090
Way With women comics too. It's
kind of, we're still pigeonholed.

917
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,050
Either you're a mother or you're a slut.
That's so fun.

918
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:24,240
And it's still not to the point. Or
you're a lesbian, so you're outside of,

919
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,070
of being fuckable and therefore you're,

920
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,920
you're given a little more leeway to
have a voice. But we're still not,

921
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,370
it's still not there where you can be
like, I'm just a person that tells jokes.

922
00:58:33,371 --> 00:58:35,830
I'm not your mom. I'm not the girl
you want to fuck. And I'm not,

923
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:40,180
and unfuckable dike. So, you know what
I'm saying? There's no room for you.

924
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:44,140
There's kind of like a flyer.
It's called sluts only,

925
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,520
but uh, but I feel the same
way. Yeah. As a female comedian,

926
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:51,610
like if you're actually saying something
about the world, it's like, well,

927
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,580
we don't really know what
to do with you just yet.

928
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,990
It might happen another decade.
And then also I've found the,

929
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:03,310
like the Brown people, they'll
build, I don't know what the term is,

930
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,600
but like the Brown people will,

931
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,710
they'll fuck with you once you get on
the mainstream. They'll be like, yeah,

932
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,550
that's my boy. But it's very hard on
that. There's a select few and it's great.

933
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:17,020
Like there's nothing more I love then
Afghan fans on the come up who actually

934
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,360
liked what I did.

935
00:59:18,361 --> 00:59:23,120
It's awesome for what it was and are kind
of seeing what's happening now instead

936
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:28,070
of just like people are though and it's
not unique to one group are obsessed

937
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,940
with hearing about their own. Oh yeah.
Try always. We're tribal by nature, right?

938
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,780
People love inside jokes,
inside baseball stuff. We know.

939
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,710
What's interesting about Netflix is that
when I had a meeting with them to go

940
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:42,740
over, when I did my first
special there, they're like,

941
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:47,860
we found out that research shows that
it's not broken down by demographics the

942
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:50,180
way you think it is.
For instance,

943
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:54,560
it's not only white women
watching orange is the new black,

944
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,041
you know what I'm saying?

945
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:57,710
It's not all girls who look
like Piper watching that shit.

946
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,590
Like you'll have like the
black woman in Minnesota,

947
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:04,190
you'll have a dad in an la watching it,

948
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:09,191
so it's kind of just proven all of these
years of how they do television shows

949
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:13,430
and they mark it shows to specific
demos and everything. Like that.

950
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:15,380
Theory is completely
fucked with Netflix now,

951
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:19,600
which is great and interesting with
like Black Panther or crazy rich Asians,

952
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,090
right? Oh wait a minute.
People want to see themselves

953
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:29,630
a revolutionary kind of feels good a
little bit like they proved it right.

954
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:34,610
People would watch Asian people are gonna
Watch this and you can watch anything.

955
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,330
That's not the point. People would go
see, here's the thing, a white person,

956
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,180
we'll go see a good movie if it's good.

957
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,630
So it's like that going to be like,
what?

958
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:49,010
There's a bunch of Asians in that and
I was like, if it's good, it ends up,

959
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,380
you know that word of
mouth still will transcend.

960
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,560
Also to just kind of being older now,
even with the rap music man,

961
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:59,120
number one m and m came out like
how fucking huge to that was. Yes.

962
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:00,260
It was unheard of.

963
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:04,400
Do you know how technically proficient
he had to be at rapping to make that

964
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:06,380
crossover and then look the landscape.

965
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:10,130
Now you have guys like to catchy or you
have rich, rich Bryan who's an Asian kid.

966
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:12,950
You can be anything in rap now what?
The cash is terrible,

967
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:17,150
but I should be sure but like a, or like
the doctor Phil girl, she has a career.

968
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,770
There's no barrier of entry anymore. Girl
would bad baby or something. Yeah, no,

969
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:25,010
I know. Well now with, with
the, um, with online access,

970
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,590
anybody can throw up anything.
Yeah. It'd be like, Hey,

971
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:32,360
I mean there's guys with like girls
with the youtube followings from their

972
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:37,390
fucking iPhone where they now have like
19 million subscribers and it's just

973
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:39,740
them putting out a video,

974
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:44,030
not even like a well shot thought
out sketch. Just, you know,

975
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:47,240
you throw out your personality, people
might respond to it. No, it just happens.

976
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:50,330
Yeah. You got to realize that people who
did these gate controllers and all that

977
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:53,840
stuff, it's just monkeys picking
stocks. That's all it is. Yes.

978
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,430
They like to think that
they're tapped into this thing.

979
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:59,690
But it's great seeing guys even in the
comedy scene where seeing them take off

980
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:03,700
and I know you didn't fuck
with this person. Yeah.
Because there's a, there's an,

981
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,860
there's a pipeline directly to
the people nowadays. Oh yeah.

982
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,960
You can't deny it and now
they want to get on, you know,

983
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:14,330
comedy central goat faced Fahim
Anwar, here's a clip off fucker. Yo.

984
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:18,530
We got a lot of flack over that one,
but I fell on the sword for that. I go,

985
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,050
we're this.
Yeah.

986
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,440
Or I walk.
Yeah.

987
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,980
So I walked away from the wrapper. We
opened the show with her. A rapper.

988
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:31,320
I remember we did. Yeah. And
that lady that we played earlier,

989
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:35,070
maybe he'd be interested in hearing
her. Oh yeah. That is Rep. That's right.

990
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:38,400
I forgot about that. Did you
like rap music? I love rap music.

991
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,793
Wow.

992
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:59,630
Hollywood madam bitch hoes on the Strip.
Yes.

993
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:04,340
Politics, politicians,
shit. Hollywood. Madam bit.

994
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,443
Thank Hilda.

995
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,130
The same cohesive song or

996
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,980
first million,
four months,

997

998
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,310
I mean, she's got a good
rhythm obviously. Yeah.

999
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:29,500
Where do you find this? We're
lucky in that people said, oh yeah,

1000
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,720
I just like to think that you have
on a coffee on it. This is my jam.

1001
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:39,770
It's gonna be a long night adult
performer that that rapper does.

1002
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,900
Other things. I wouldn't have
been able to tell. Just, yeah,

1003
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:47,390
we looked it up and a lot of
anal clips. Yeah. Are you a,

1004
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,360
is that your kind of go to the anal? When
you, when you're doing a search, is that,

1005
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:55,650
is it mostly and you know her? No, no, no,
no. It's just rapping. Do you have lanes,

1006
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,920
lanes of a hardcore that you like to use
is Tom doesn't even know you that well.

1007
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:07,560
Come on man and dad are going to
listen to this. They're not Muslim.

1008
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:10,940
He doesn't do that shit all over my face.
Okay,

1009
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,910
so um,
we have a fun segment.

1010
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:19,911
We like to call drugs or mental illness
and we play you a video and you tell us

1011
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:24,690
whether you think this person is high
or mentally ill. Okay, here we go.

1012
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,730
It's a hard game.
Hello?

1013
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,710
There is a death curse.

1014
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,630
They place on the leader on
credit of Iran. It got it.

1015
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,800
And the toe. Yeah. I told her,

1016
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:43,710
I'm going to say mentally,
I think you're right. Yeah.

1017
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:45,723
For

1018
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:50,170
starts. How do we know? We
never know or any kind of card.

1019
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,060
It's just a gut feeling in the room.
The consensus

1020
01:04:56,110 --> 01:05:00,310
or I can drop the price to $10,000

1021
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,810
that times after like a
few set of few episodes,

1022
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:08,250
Dr drew will come in and he's really
good at spotting things that he'll be

1023
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:12,720
killed. He'll, yeah, he'll look
at even breathing patterns.

1024
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:14,880
It looks at the colors and the
eye, the skinny. He'll be like,

1025
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,980
well that's pretty much definitely math.
And like,

1026
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,460
he's just really good for us that we have.
We been like,

1027
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:24,550
whoa. Like we had no idea this, by
the way. We have to show him this guy.

1028
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:29,200
Which forest gang of this guy. Oh, this
guy. Oh yeah. Where's my list? Shit. Yeah,

1029
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,000
it's called our, we call it the two drew
list, so we make sure that he sees, oh,

1030
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,470
okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um,
yeah, but this guy, I dunno,
I think we're definitely,

1031
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,670
you'd want to do anything. And I did.
You can contact with a youtube services.

1032
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,060
I'll check email that way you can.

1033
01:05:45,061 --> 01:05:48,970
I'm glad it had provided surgeon
or removing the curse. A curse.

1034
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:53,170
So is that, sounds like there's a curse
though on the ayatollah and the uh,

1035
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:58,670
and the president of Iran. This is
just a put Iran president. Yeah. Curse.

1036
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,420
And that was sent to you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:07,130
Um, here's another one. Okay. I don't
know if this is the same guy or not,

1038
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:09,930
but it says drugs or mental
illness. Oh Shit. Oh, same guy.

1039
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,720
Sorry.
Death curse.

1040
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,160
Maybe it's high on the tone
for anyone who's a member of

1041
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:22,750
and the Taliban. Okay. I think we all
agree something's wrong though, right?

1042
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:27,490
Yeah. Brad is Walthill. Yeah, yeah.

1043
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:32,440
Uh, Shit. Did you know that they're, well
remember that porn we played that was,

1044
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,970
um, sit down Hussein? The
porn replayed. Oh yeah,

1045
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:42,390
sorry. Yeah, it was like
Taliban porn. Yeah, yeah,

1046
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,880
yeah. When they rated than any half,
like a tons of hard drive of porn. Yes.

1047
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:49,290
Yes he did. He did. But this was like, um,

1048
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,610
let me see if I can, uh,
if I can pull this up.

1049
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,430
The Taliban porn, well, this
might get him all worked up.

1050
01:06:57,431 --> 01:07:01,360
I don't know if you want to see
if this had, you know, these guys.

1051
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,630
Here we go. Here we go. Hold on.

1052
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,690
US military forces are,

1053
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:11,180
are on their way from
what I understand and no,

1054
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:13,443
hold on.

1055
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:21,750
Is this from Ghostface or is
this is on the cutting room floor.

1056
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,900
This was cut for time.
Yeah.

1057
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:28,290
It seems that time is running out for
a summer bin Laden and soon he'll fall

1058
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:31,380
into the hands of the Northern
Alliance and a special forces.

1059
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,480
Oh,
by the way,

1060
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,130
I think if you would have
done this segment on a goat
phase [inaudible] big head.

1061
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,960
I get thick monster numbers.
Especially if you've got this,

1062
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,980
you feel like we might alienate our bays.
Oh

1063
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,250
No. Here we go. Who is the end
of this like you gotta really?

1064
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,430
Where do you get this actor
is what I want to know.

1065
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,230
Oh, uh, this is, I'm like,
this is a craigslist ad.

1066
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:56,640
Like if you're the brown dude,
you know what I mean?

1067
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:06,770
Now, none of the higher ups that
kind of sent to say anything,

1068
01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:09,800
they're just like, there's,
there's humor here.

1069
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,860
Uh,

1070
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:20,440
I'm trying to get me in trouble. I'm
sorry to get knifed on the side. Wow.

1071
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:23,790
Um,
I like Halloween.

1072
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:28,640
They're like Veronica cane in Afghanistan,
like the whole country

1073
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,270
and they're like, uh, people as me. Yeah.

1074
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,470
Where do you think they actually at
Northridge. Yeah, we did. We did, uh,

1075
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,120
did that whiskey, tango, Foxtrot,

1076
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,420
that Tina Fey movie and we did it in New
Mexico and so New Mexico just doubles

1077
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:45,360
for Afghanistan I guess. Oh yeah.
They're shooting everything. Yeah.

1078
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,320
It was in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
Did that come out? Wait, is that,

1079
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:55,160
it was like two years ago that,
yeah. Wow. Um, we've been really,

1080
01:08:55,730 --> 01:09:00,730
really on one with Garth
Brooks the last few weeks.

1081
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:05,610
Months. Really. Um, you
like him? He's all right. I,

1082
01:09:05,611 --> 01:09:07,880
I mean I'm not a huge,
I know of him. Yeah.

1083
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,240
Is he still like really big or
is it all about, oh, he's huge.

1084
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:14,960
He's beyond any things. You like the
Drake of country music? Yes ma'am. Better.

1085
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:18,900
Bigger. Right. But he's still
flying on harnesses, like
over the audience. I Dunno.

1086
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:23,240
He's doing it. He's still do Chris'
Games. No, no. That's when I tapped out.

1087
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:27,770
Chris Gaines had the commercials
have been airing that um,

1088
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:32,260
his Notre Dame show is going to be,
is going to come out. Oh, okay. Yeah.

1089
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,160
So that's a big ass stadium tour.

1090
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,220
The big ass stadium tour of which
Notre Dame was the first stop,

1091
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,300
first concert ever in Notre Dame stadium
cheese and now he's just going to do

1092
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:45,520
nothing but stadiums. He's
there. He's way there bro.

1093
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,640
All stadium too.
It was supposed to be,

1094
01:09:49,641 --> 01:09:54,260
it was going to be a college tour because
of the cities, how they worked out.

1095
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:56,930
Just going to be some professional
stadiums and then as well,

1096
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,730
so we're just gonna keep
it at the staging tool.

1097
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:04,220
But this one is going to be so special,
so rare,

1098
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,350
so far apart. We'll do
about, we'll do this,

1099
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:10,400
we'll do probably 10 to
12 a year for three years.

1100
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,400
Jesus, 10 to 12 a year for three
years. It's defensive body language.

1101
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:18,800
I don't guard. It's like he doesn't
need it. It's, he doesn't need it.

1102
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:22,070
And it's like he doesn't dress up for
his press conference either. In visual,

1103
01:10:22,071 --> 01:10:26,900
very unique. There's
body language. We are.

1104
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,490
You don't categorize me, Ron, did you have
like Tommy from the store? I don't know.

1105
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,310
Did you ever interact?
Yeah.

1106
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:37,350
Get a little Tommy vibe with the
arms crossed with indifference to,

1107
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:40,550
by the way, this is the stadium tour.
Like why is he disgusted by his own tour?

1108
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,170
This is probably the fifth
or six different video
months apart that we've won

1109
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:49,650
where he's wearing that same app you
felt he just wears that shirt shirt.

1110
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,870
Can I tell you what I figured out what?
I know why he's God damn weird.

1111
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,450
Why I'm being serious.

1112
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:01,210
I think he might be slightly
autistic or Asperger's.

1113
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,600
I'm serious. Now think about my fucking
theory. I can buy into it because a,

1114
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:09,770
he mimics a lot of what he sees as
being normal human behavior and that's

1115
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:13,560
probably why he's not reading well
on social media cause he's not,

1116
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:17,370
he's really not relatable and all of
his interviews are fucking weird and a

1117
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:21,510
little ass burglary, but he's really good
at what he does. He's pretty meticulous,

1118
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:26,070
right? Yeah. I'm going to go like a
dash of Asperger's. I like your theory.

1119
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,960
I'm serious. A Sasha just, he's fun. He's
highly, I'm not saying he's like full,

1120
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,400
just a dash of Asperger. I'm going to
go to the line. Yeah, I think he is.

1121
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,090
Could be,
let's see if this gets me

1122
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,460
more weird, scared,
nervous. All good things.

1123
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:47,150
We'll say this is the whole diverse
going to be like another day to handle.

1124
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,090
This is the most work that I've ever met.

1125
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:53,400
Well isn't that a weird thing to say?
It's weird, but that's what I'm saying is,

1126
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,250
but it's an,

1127
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,200
it's a weird offshoot of aspergers where
it's like with a dash of confidence or

1128
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:03,400
I've got a heap of confidence.
Well, there's a little
Asperger's with confidence.

1129
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,050
Yes, there are performers
and habit though, is that
are really successful. Yes.

1130
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:10,900
So this is a press conference about
your tour where you're like, I'm scared.

1131
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:13,120
I'm nervous, I'm excited. Honestly,

1132
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:16,060
I don't know if I'll be able to
handle my own tour. Like he just said,

1133
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,910
if it goes like he just said it.
He's like,

1134
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,560
if the rest of the tour goes like this,

1135
01:12:20,561 --> 01:12:22,750
I honestly don't know if I'll
be able to do it. What? Like,

1136
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:25,510
what are you talking about? You're going
to be able to do your own tour. Yeah,

1137
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:26,830
because it's just too much.

1138
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,870
Well then don't fucking
something towards secure though.

1139
01:12:28,871 --> 01:12:31,510
And they doubled down the
other way, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1140
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,540
That's why I think is really
happening. I think it's fake. I'm so,

1141
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,830
I don't know all solar.
What's going to go this?

1142
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:41,530
This is the most that I've ever worked,

1143
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:43,670
but so most time I've
ever put into anything,

1144
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,680
he runs the of Ricky
Gervais' for the office.

1145
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,790
The character? Yes.
David Brent. Yeah. Yeah.

1146
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,110
They want to be the best matter.
Like you walk in there.

1147
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:55,790
That's a wonderful Spanish dance.
I'm doctor to her. Watch him. Yeah.

1148
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,480
Give it to him.
Let them know that you care.

1149
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,640
Let them know that you're singing just to
them. And that is easy in a honky talk.

1150
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:08,150
And it became easy in an arena and that's
what our whole pulling becomes easy in

1151
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:12,580
a stadium. He's about to cry right away
and they can feel like their front row.

1152
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:18,000
Oh boy, that's he's, he's getting
emotional there about putting on the show.

1153
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:22,440
That'll change your life. It's weird, man.
It is weird. Yeah, it sounds going on.

1154
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:25,200
We are.
Dr Drew has to watch what's going on.

1155
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:29,090
As He's thinking about all the bodies
he's got stacked in fucking graves on is

1156
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:33,870
and is 100% he's probably killed two,

1157
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:38,580
300 people in his life. It's a
good cover. Yeah. No, I think so.

1158
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:41,250
I want to go with it.
Just a dash Asperger's.

1159
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,980
Did you shop for Black Friday?

1160
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:46,530
I know you've always known to me that
you're a huge shopper line overnight.

1161
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,410
Do that. What's the point?
You know what I mean?

1162
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,080
So I think the only people who do it, it's
like if it's a ritual like the family,

1163
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:55,110
all right, after we eat Turkey we, this
is the thing we've been doing for years.

1164
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,410
Yeah. Does anybody need to save
that much money? Just for a thing.

1165
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:03,470
I think some people really can't stand
the thought that they might not get the

1166
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:07,620
deal that somebody else got.
And those are the people.

1167
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:12,550
It's actually a number of them.
Don't you value value your over 50 bucks?

1168
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,910
I do. Those people don't. And
then what about cyber Monday?

1169
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:20,470
Just have it delivered to your house?
Yeah, well, I had a friend that's like my,

1170
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:23,050
my mother and I do it every year.
Like you were saying,

1171
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:26,770
we take turns standing in line, so
it's like a fun thing. I don't know.

1172
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,740
It sounds like torture to me.
Sounds like the worst thing ever.

1173
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:31,720
Especially if you can't get a refund.

1174
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,260
It goes to your debit card directly.

1175
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:54,880
I'm just talking.
I will see you.

1176
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,020
I'm not putting it on youtube.
I'm document.

1177
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,860
Yeah, sure. That is perfectly fine.

1178
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,330
You don't want to be recorded.

1179
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:12,240
There's no way they can afford
an attorney. It's on youtube now.

1180
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:18,120
If he's asking for the $50 back or
whatever, she can't clearly can't afford.

1181
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:21,020
Attorneys are very expensive,
I guess Ross.

1182
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,060
Oh well that's not even there
anymore. How good. The detective,

1183
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:30,300
I like how they're doing in
front of the baby. That's nice.

1184
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:32,450
I hope everyone fucking job.

1185
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:35,760
How do you feel about Sears going out of
business and then I'm calling see your

1186
01:15:35,761 --> 01:15:36,780
stupid.
Okay,

1187
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,103
awesome.

1188
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:46,460
These are, these people are really
giving white people a bad name.

1189
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:50,510
I kind of say this is a very
white kind of feel to it.

1190
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:56,030
White trash though. Hey, to be clear, I
don't know if I would call them morning.

1191
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,600
Yeah, there's different levels of of
white. I mean, you know what I mean?

1192
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,200
I was trying to be nice to them.
Oh, I'm not terrible people.

1193
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:04,340
These are garbage people.

1194
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:07,160
Do you think they're the same family
or friends or like four different white

1195
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:11,060
wanting to get a refund.
That's the crew they went through.

1196
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:15,430
They needed a backup. They go bring
your baby. Oh Yeah, God, the baby needs.

1197
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,290
Could you imagine being that
baby? It sucks. It's terrible.

1198
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:22,910
Isn't your shitty family?
Dammit. I know what this is over.

1199
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,300
Also like what the item is,
you know?

1200
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,710
What do you think the cost is of the item?
What are the squabbling over 20 bucks?

1201
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:35,030
It's probably, it's less than a
hundred yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1202
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,570
The real game is like,
is it $26 a good price is right game.

1203
01:16:38,571 --> 01:16:41,360
That's just sort of like
just the white trash

1204
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:44,143
trash off

1205
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,173
Clark.

1206
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,460
Oh Shit. Now she's calling
somebody out on their job.

1207
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,660
Please tell us the amount if it's fucking,

1208
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:09,453
did you get your money?

1209
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,350
What do you mean before I'm knock it out.
Knock it out.

1210
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:21,240
She'd have to kick it up though.
My hands are tied up.

1211
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,340
There was a Sears mastercard application.
If you're interested. Some not.

1212
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,190
That's something you would want.

1213
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,550
I have a pair of pants that I bought
from Sears and I can't return them now.

1214
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:32,680
Oh no where to return.
There's no CEO then Kmart just shut down.

1215
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:36,150
The camera's been gone for a long
time. No, you didn't know this.

1216
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:40,710
Kmart just shoot down, uh, one of their
stores last week and it was a big deal.

1217
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,580
Are they still around? I thought
they were done. They are.

1218
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:47,370
Do you remember what you have?
They have been closing down
slowly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1219
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,590
Here's, has been doing that too. And
now I think they're finally like, yeah,

1220
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:55,620
what's the cane toys r us. Oh
man, that dude's gone. That hurts.

1221
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,210
Cause I remember that was
such a big part of my life.

1222
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,010
I remember I would get such a rush.

1223
01:17:59,011 --> 01:18:02,430
I'm going to toys r us and picking
an intender game. Do you remember?

1224
01:18:02,431 --> 01:18:05,070
Like they would have it right there
and they'd be like, get it for you.

1225
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,680
You'll never experience that again.
It's just weird.

1226
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:11,990
There's like things about being older
where technology advances. Like,

1227
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,590
like even buying a CD,

1228
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:18,480
I remember you would go into circuit
city or best buy or future shop or,

1229
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,550
and you'd have to walk by washing machines
and shit to actually get a CD. Yeah.

1230
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:27,060
[inaudible] in the cellophane and no one,

1231
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:31,770
no one that now just on your phone it
would know like the whole, the ritual,

1232
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:36,450
the ritual of being dropped off,
you know. And then having, man,

1233
01:18:36,451 --> 01:18:40,440
there was a point where cds were like
getting like it was like 1699 they were

1234
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:42,060
getting to try see pretty pricey.

1235
01:18:42,061 --> 01:18:45,840
But you would seek out and then
to hold it like the actual,

1236
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:51,060
and it had that security, you know
clamp. Yeah. Have to get it unlocked.

1237
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,420
I love that Rachel. Yeah,
it was really fun. And,

1238
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,260
and it always comes out on Tuesdays.

1239
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,780
Oh for like we have new
releases or releases. Yeah.

1240
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,990
But in hindsight you can understand why
the music industry was going to fuck

1241
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:04,560
cause they're just bilking us
for so long. Oh, cds are what?

1242
01:19:04,561 --> 01:19:09,420
17 2121 bucks and there's three good
songs on it. Oh my God. Now we pay what,

1243
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:13,170
like 10 bucks a month for Spotify?
Yeah. Every song in the universe.

1244
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,240
Not that mansion.
The uh,

1245
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,810
what you were the actual
cost of producing that,

1246
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:22,890
that actual item. Was it like pennies?
Yeah. So you were just, you know,

1247
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:25,530
I mean obviously you're not paying just
for the whole day paying for the content,

1248
01:19:25,531 --> 01:19:27,630
but they're really word robbing us.

1249
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,370
But you've got the booklet and you gotta
throw quit lyrics, read the lyrics,

1250
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,300
you're fine.
I liked her albums.

1251
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:38,160
Even you could do your homework on the
album cover. Yeah, I know your shit. Yeah.

1252
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,790
Everyone, all the rappers started doing
double disc and triple discs. Dean.

1253
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,360
And I thought it was so great as a kid.
Like, yeah. More content, like, yeah,

1254
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:48,540
more songs. But in hindsight
you're like, do some editing.

1255
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,660
Not all of these are the youngers.
No water. Garbage on here.

1256
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,310
So we've been talking all this, uh, Garth
stuff. We've got an email that said, um,

1257
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,280
I brought up Garth Brooks when I saw
an advertisement for one of his shows

1258
01:19:59,281 --> 01:20:01,290
during Thanksgiving,
which was obviously the,

1259
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:06,030
the big and the Notre Dame
one in an attempt to expose
how crazy Garth Garth was

1260
01:20:06,031 --> 01:20:07,920
to my relatives.
Instead,

1261
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,150
I got roped into a six hour
conversation with my grandfather,

1262
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:17,420
which led me to watching two full length
live Garth concerts in both New York

1263
01:20:17,611 --> 01:20:20,940
City in Dublin as well as
listening to for Garth albums.

1264
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:25,020
I tried to tell my grandpa they only
know Garth from your mom's house,

1265
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,510
but now he thinks I'm a
huge fan of country music.

1266
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:31,020
And especially with Garth quite
literally until my grandfather dies,

1267
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:35,820
I will now need to pretend I left
guard. So in short, fuck you.

1268
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,570
High insight Stephen.
Yeah. Nice. That's good.

1269
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,500
That is good stuff. Fuck man. Well
that's kind of Nice. A stronger bond.

1270
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,080
But now he has to keep this
facade of living Garth Brooks.

1271
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,990
So he was probably like, have you seen
Garth Brooks? And His grandpa was like,

1272
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:55,440
you like him too? He's like, well, yeah.
And then it just went downhill from there.

1273
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,030
God Damn. Um, here's a, Oh,
a scrump solution. Oh, okay.

1274
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:04,650
Um, when you date you're dating,
do you have a, you're trying to,

1275
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:08,250
you're about to be on big TV show
on comedy central and we'll see.

1276
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:11,510
You can start getting some of
those hot submissions like I get,

1277
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,750
do we talk about this on the show yet?
About

1278
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,970
five years or something about the
upright, right before we hit record. Uh,

1279
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,880
we were at dinner the other
night and Christina goes, um,

1280
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,620
we're having a dinner with a couple
and then, uh, they said that, you know,

1281
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:36,690
the wife said that she sees emails for
her husband and then Christina goes,

1282
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,800
Tom, do you get hit up a lot?
Like A, now that you're, you know,

1283
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,800
touring and put out specials, like to our
chip just hitting on you. I'm like, yeah,

1284
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:49,190
about once every five years I'll get
an email or some message from a woman.

1285
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,260
It'll look like I'm a woman.
Um,

1286
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:57,260
but like dude's weekly will be like,
you're so hot and a,

1287
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,840
and I'll be like, cool. Like, you
know, Instagram stuff, they'll be like,

1288
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:04,180
great special. It doesn't hurt
that you're easy on the eyes.

1289
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:08,550
Less of a filter with, with gay guys.
Yeah, of course. I'll get that too.

1290
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,090
And then also I think like black chicks
aren't into me as well. Really Nice.

1291
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,930
I don't know what that, what
it is. Why that demo? Yeah.

1292
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,700
Do you maybe I'm like a light skin
black Swizz beats or something.

1293
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:24,610
Have you ever hooked up with a fan? Like
somebody who messaged you, like, um,

1294
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:29,330
you know, you're hilarious and then
meet them? No, never. Wow. Yeah.

1295
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,550
Did you get, you're going to do
it now I assume. I don't know.

1296
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:36,990
So you never even like entertain the idea,
like let's say sounds fun.

1297
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:39,750
You know what I mean? But like
Instagram, Instagram is photos.

1298
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,890
Like somebody goes like, oh my God,
you're so funny. And you see it's a girl.

1299
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,870
You've never been like, she,
I'll be, I'll be, I'll, I'll
look. Yeah. And then nothing,

1300
01:22:48,871 --> 01:22:52,770
no. Pursue it at all. Uh, well sometimes
logistically we just sort of like,

1301
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:57,120
it's like when a 13 year old girl says
marry me Bieber or whatever. Right.

1302
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:01,080
You know, like it seems so
emotionally mature. Thanks.

1303
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,230
This is mechanical engineering, so
that'd be maybe a to practical. Yeah.

1304
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:06,100
You're like, well look,
you live too far away.

1305
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:09,490
Also, I've thought about this too,
like as you get older, like in your,

1306
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:13,060
in your 20s like you'll, you'll chase
the girl. Everyone would be like, hey,

1307
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:16,980
we're at this word, this bar, come here
and do yoga. We're in Riverside or animal.

1308
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,970
We would like,
you just follow them everywhere.

1309
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:21,940
You don't think about anything and then
when you get older you just kind of like,

1310
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:25,720
you can do the math or they're like, hey,
we're at this bar and then your mind,

1311
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:30,400
okay, it's one 30 she's around
a town with four of her friends.

1312
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,870
Like you can just crunch the numbers
and you're like, I'm not doing,

1313
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,910
this is another, yeah, this is nothing
you're describing me at my thinking.

1314
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:39,010
At 21 I was like,
I'm tired.

1315
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:41,090
I just, that's what I
always say. I was like,

1316
01:23:41,091 --> 01:23:45,380
I never pursued anything that didn't
just kind of show up. Yeah. Yeah.

1317
01:23:45,381 --> 01:23:48,960
I just wasn't into effort. I'd be like,
what? We're going to go to another place?

1318
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:53,120
Yeah. Terrible. Yeah, it's terrible. It's
probably why you and I lasted and we,

1319
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,340
I mean I basically was like,

1320
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:57,860
just kind of like over, we'll
go to a bar. Yeah. Those,

1321
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:00,980
those are good at hitting balls that
are caught to me but I'm not, yeah,

1322
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,940
I'm not yo, what up girl? Who'd
you get into? I love your face.

1323
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:07,760
Probably

1324
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,180
Margaret. Cause he know that your
girl likes you already faces so hot.

1325
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:13,971
But that,

1326
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:16,570
but that's good cause you don't wanna
have to fight some chick to likeyeah.

1327
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,870
It's terrible.
Would you consider possibly um,

1328
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,560
putting out like a, a video like
this to like, just to get the ladies,

1329
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:25,394
you know what I mean?

1330
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,360
Hi Baby.
Oh this great sad day.

1331
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,010
I've been looking at your picture.

1332
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:38,011
So low bay and they met
and they magnify my eyes.

1333
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:39,004
Bay.

1334
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:40,490
Yeah.

1335
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:44,690
I'm it to a telescope when
I see your page. Nice.

1336
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:49,970
You feel so good to meet bay. They will
not meet you. Are you talking to me?

1337
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:55,030
I want you to milk me like hot chocolate
and candy and not with high bro.

1338
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,000
Well,
we cool.

1339
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:59,790
See, I picture you like that.
Like that's my game by a yeah.

1340
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,600
I said it's the wrong some aviators.

1341
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,010
I turned into a telescope when I see you,
I metlife had,

1342
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:08,710
he thought that was like a hot bar right
there. Like a girl's gonna be like,

1343
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,400
damn a telescope.
That was Gus sexy as hell sense.

1344
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:15,940
Tell us when I see you. I turned
into a telescope. What did that mean?

1345
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,100
Say That I really look at your
picture when I see it, but uh,

1346
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:25,360
came out the way he put it, which is kind
of cooler. What are you going to go for?

1347
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,310
Drugs or mental illness on that one.

1348
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,980
I think that's just his death swag.
That's too much swag. I thought, oh,

1349
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:36,050
I'm going to go drunk. Old School
Alcohol Abuse Pot. Yeah. Okay.

1350
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:40,570
Double. Yeah, it's a lot of
drugs and alcohol I think might

1351
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:44,250
be a little booze in there.
Yeah. I'm here is a, uh,

1352
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:48,430
a message though about this called
the scrum solution. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1353
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,710
So like when you do data girl though,
you ever eat her?

1354
01:25:50,711 --> 01:25:55,240
Ask her to eat your scrum or something
like that. Okay. Um, this one says,

1355
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:55,751
Hey Hitler's,

1356
01:25:55,751 --> 01:26:00,751
I may have a solution to getting
Christina over her scrum eating no phobia

1357
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,480
to decide triple d sled girlfriend and
I have been together for three years now

1358
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:13,470
and never once had she ate or
even offered to eat my scrum.

1359
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:18,770
Obviously I was very frustrated at how
inconsiderate and rude she was being as I

1360
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:21,270
am as well.
Finally,

1361
01:26:21,271 --> 01:26:24,570
the strategy that worked for me was
to no longer bring up my browns.

1362
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:29,160
The discussion of size, shape, smell,
and frequently is now off the table.

1363
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,140
One month ago today,

1364
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:35,400
while she and I were practicing
for her 16th birthday,

1365
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,960
I kept telling her to sniff those balls,
but she kept wandering further south.

1366
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:44,760
I finally gave in and I let her eat my
scrum for the first time and it was truly

1367
01:26:44,761 --> 01:26:46,950
a life changing experience.

1368
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:52,020
It has now become a frequent event that
she will eat my scrum and then I give

1369
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:56,100
her her reward. Okay. Anyway, it's
a real Sophie's choice. Good luck.

1370
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:01,260
Piss on me and beat me. Chad w that's a
nice message. Chat. Thanks so much for,

1371
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:06,560
so what do you think? Maybe we stopped
talking about Brown and then you know,

1372
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:11,360
your tongue launder south. I would rather
talk about Brown and enjoy the talks.

1373
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,460
Then eat your scrum.
Do you know what I mean?

1374
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:18,461
Like talking about what I'd prefer w
how much joy scrum taint or well yeah,

1375
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,880
that's a little further back. Yeah.
Am I going to do it? It's never happy.

1376
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:25,490
Whole adjacent. Yeah. I see. Yeah.

1377
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,920
I mean, will you give her a
little encouragement? Know what?

1378
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,970
It's really not my place.

1379
01:27:35,971 --> 01:27:39,780
That's kind of let's you guys
let him have a do it for him.

1380
01:27:39,781 --> 01:27:43,590
I have a question for you. Let's say
you've just eaten a bunch of Afghan food,

1381
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,650
right? Right. This is a great
segue from scrum. Does that,

1382
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,400
this is like a free associate. Yeah.
Speaking of scrum, Afghan food,

1383
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,110
tell me about it.

1384
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:57,180
You've just had a big play of mom's
cooking and then she was like,

1385
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,820
give us a company or would it be,
uh, it's like rice and meat based,

1386
01:28:02,821 --> 01:28:03,391
I would guess.

1387
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:08,010
Sort of if I had to say what it is you
maybe like chicken and rice or like

1388
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:10,890
playing with rice sauce or something.
I was going to core mine,

1389
01:28:10,891 --> 01:28:15,870
which is kind of like, um, like a curry.
Yeah. Okay. There you go. Perfect. Okay,

1390
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:20,850
so you've had your curry and it's the
morning and your dump dump dumping and

1391
01:28:20,851 --> 01:28:24,510
it's a messy brown and you go
to wipe and you just go like,

1392
01:28:24,511 --> 01:28:27,180
you know when you wipe and you're
like, oh boy, this is a disaster.

1393
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:29,940
Like this is going to require
a lot of cleanup. Right.

1394
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:32,700
So we have a total wash let,

1395
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:36,960
have you ever used that a washlet it's
like sprays water and you're just like a

1396
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:41,670
day. Yeah. But my question
is what do you do on that?

1397
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:45,990
Like do you just go to shower? What do
you mean? Like you wipe, wipe, wipe,

1398
01:28:45,991 --> 01:28:49,710
but the Brown keeps coming down.
It never ending wipe scenario.

1399
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:53,400
But how come when you go in the shower
and then you wash it with soap and water?

1400
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:57,450
The never ending wipe stops. What's your
theory? He had a lot of cascading water.

1401
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:00,940
So, although you visually cannot
see all the, it's, it's working.

1402
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,720
You think it's just the
cleaning of the browns,

1403
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,450
the water cascading done your bowl.

1404
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:12,780
That's my guess. I do. I do a toilet
paper. Baby Wipe Combo. You do?

1405
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:16,680
Oh yeah. But how do you feel about
that, that the day that, that,

1406
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:20,160
that I'm not there yet. Um, yeah. I
have no idea how I would feel about it.

1407
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:23,070
I've never done it. Now where would
I go? I don't have fancy friends.

1408
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:26,370
Do you have to bag a brown right now?
No. I wish that's very flattering.

1409
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,590
Like no one would ever say, do you have
to please take a shit in my toilet? Oh,

1410
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:33,690
I would normally, normally it's
like, take a shit in the lobby.

1411
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,630
Don't do to my hotel room.
But you guys are the opposite.

1412
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,870
He was a little go outside. Tell me
when you want to do a dump. Yeah.

1413
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:43,770
We encourage people to Brown here. Yeah,
we do. Wow. You're, you're a rare breed.

1414
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,330
Yeah. You're like the only people who are
like that. What is your take by the way?

1415
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:51,660
Your, yeah. Your gut reaction.
Is this horrible or hilarious.

1416
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:52,733
Oh,
come on.

1417
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:04,250
You're sick inside too. If
he's okay. He's not okay.

1418
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:11,820
Yeah, I see a smile from you.
The sound of him yelling at

1419
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:16,740
the wellbeing of the sounds are funny.
Most of the,

1420
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,373
yeah.

1421
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,640
That's funny. Yeah. There's
a look at the slow Mo.

1422
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,280
Oh Wow. Oh, oh, that's not good.

1423
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,870
Fuck.
Oh,

1424
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:36,680
the scream is funny. That
was funny. In slow Mo. Yeah,
you're right. Real time. Yeah.

1425
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:40,090
Brutal. I mean that definitely
hurt. That hurt. Like hell

1426
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:40,983
man.

1427
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,340
He goes and him going, oh yeah.

1428
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:52,180
Just the realization of impending doom.

1429
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:56,930
Yeah. At the apex is very comical.
There's also like, uh, like the,

1430
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:59,570
what are you landed on this rate?
Like when he hit the railing,

1431
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:03,980
that probably broke something. And
then when he, when he fell here,

1432
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:08,750
um, it's an additional hit, you know,
like before he died, it definitely,

1433
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,860
he's dead. That's what it says
here. He says he died. Oh, stop.

1434
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,580
He was screaming. She was like, what?

1435
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:30,290
Lay in bed at night time. You just
have this on a loop and you're here by

1436
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,260
video. I don't know how to dig it up, but
there's this like little kid on a bike.

1437
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:38,960
He's like learning how to ride a bike
for the first time. And he's like,

1438
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,410
hello, hello. And then he's like,
there's a tree right there. And he goes,

1439
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:48,340
no. He goes, ah, ah.

1440
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:51,590
And then he hits the tree.
It's the funniest shit.

1441
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:54,310
I laughed so hard at that as
much as just him saying, okay,

1442
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:55,623
hmm.

1443
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:00,010
I like, I mean there's certain sounds that
are just funny. I'm like, no, please. No

1444
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,153
thanks.

1445
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:10,310
Oh,
what happened?

1446
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,533
Huh?

1447
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,630
Write it out. Oh, no

1448
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:35,320
learning man. You learn to play the first
part again. Did he just run into him?

1449
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:38,710
No, he's backing up, but you know,

1450
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,080
we've got to ease off the clutch.

1451
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:46,060
Just give it a little bit more man.
That back it up.

1452
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:48,990
Not too long.

1453
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:59,040
It sounds like a threat. The Reb.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well he's like,

1454
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:00,190
there's more where that comes.

1455
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,550
Yeah. But then there's this funny
stuff like that sending out funny.

1456
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:08,090
It's not okay. Yeah, no, he's
okay. He's alive. He's fine.

1457
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:10,130
Actually,
we learned that he was fine.

1458
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,700
It was a big story in Taiwan when it
happened. Right? Seriously? No, no,

1459
01:33:13,701 --> 01:33:16,860
I swear to you. Oh, well how, yeah.
How's that? A big story. Well,

1460
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:19,490
because it went viral and it was,
it was in Taiwan,

1461
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:22,640
so then it was in the news and
people were like, is this guy dead?

1462
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:26,090
There is like shattered. Turned
out. He just said bruises. Oh yeah.

1463
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:30,410
This wasn't because uh, some people
thought for sure the legs were amputated,

1464
01:33:30,411 --> 01:33:34,970
but no, you weren't. Yeah. Yeah. It makes
me feel better about it. Yeah. Yeah.

1465
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,780
You laugh pretty hard. Be Honest. That's
how he laugh. No, I'm saying you left.

1466
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,930
He enjoyed that.

1467
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:44,810
Christine has always like weirded out
when I show it to people because I'm a

1468
01:33:44,811 --> 01:33:49,520
mother and I hate seeing people
getting hurt. Men are destroyers,

1469
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:51,890
women are creators. You know what
I mean? Yeah. They create life.

1470
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:56,090
You guys fucking kill each
other. Yeah. Serial killers.
All male. Mostly murderers.

1471
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:59,960
Male mostly. Hmm. That's a good
point. It's fucking theory.

1472
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:04,980
Would you rather sit through 24 hour
performance of here's what I'm going to

1473
01:34:05,781 --> 01:34:07,500
give you choices. Okay. Okay.

1474
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,393
This,

1475
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:21,780
so it's just this 24 hours.

1476
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:26,960
This Yoko Ono,
I,

1477
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,350
I'm going to kill myself.

1478
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,710
Okay. So do you want 24 hours of that? No.

1479
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:38,900
Or 24 for 24 hours in a row.

1480
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:43,240
Oh fuck.
This is a vocal performer.

1481
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:58,610
24 I'm going to go this guy.
Or it's annoying.

1482
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:03,680
Oh, so far they're both a
very annoying or 24 hours.

1483
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:08,300
Yours.
Jesus Christ.

1484
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,170
How does he have this large
of an audience? Oh, oh yeah,
this guy moves tickets.

1485
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:18,330
This, I really sells tickets.
I mean, I think as a comedian,

1486
01:35:18,331 --> 01:35:20,700
when you watch your stuff and you
see people busting up in the crowd,

1487
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:25,650
don't you die inside? Yes. Dykes a
sour and go into a homicidal rage.

1488
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:31,080
Yeah. Yeah. And be like,
wow, what an amazing skill.

1489
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,180
It's so dumb.

1490
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:43,460
So yeah, which is, give
me the order of worst.

1491
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:46,220
The worst one,
all the way down.

1492
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:52,930
I'm going to go to, it's tough
between the screaming guy. Yeah.

1493
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:57,340
And this last one with
the mustache as the worst,

1494
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:59,200
I think so over the drumming lady

1495
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:03,290
drumming. Or you don't have to look at
them. You know what a drum sounds like.

1496
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:07,340
It's very passive.
This is performance running.

1497
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:11,150
It's not even real drumming. It's
like you don't have to see their eyes.

1498
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:15,900
It's like a bear rummaging
through the trash. Look at him

1499
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:20,020
watching like it's a real thing.
Like yes,

1500
01:36:20,021 --> 01:36:22,510
this is our crazy piece of shit.

1501
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:27,440
I know you guys are watching the stupid,
this is so dumb.

1502
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,980
People buy into this,

1503
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:40,010
we'll get this guy
analyzing it like it's real.

1504
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:45,600
Yes, art. Yeah. That's cool.
You think this is really hard.

1505
01:36:45,601 --> 01:36:48,930
See I suppose cause I didn't see him
go that violent on the drum and that's

1506
01:36:48,931 --> 01:36:52,080
really annoying. I thought it was
just sort of like, is it a girl?

1507
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:57,110
I think it's a guy. Mike gone hair
guy. Yeah. We Egos on these three.

1508
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:01,050
I think middle, middle. I definitely, I
can't do, that's just too great voice guy,

1509
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:06,690
that guy. Okay, so that's the worst.
That's the worst for me. Yeah. Yeah.

1510
01:37:06,691 --> 01:37:08,220
That's pretty back in place.
Go ahead.

1511
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:13,390
It's hard.
It's hard to

1512
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:16,500
Ah,

1513
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,220
oh

1514
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:26,330
24 hours. What if they did like a
watch the throne tour. This guy,

1515
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:31,730
the last guy. People minds
are blown. Oh Holy Shit.

1516
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,950
As in suicidally boring.
Yeah.

1517
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:40,230
Age that just like floats over
everybody like Kanye, you know. See I'm,

1518
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:43,300
I'm struggling here because
I feel like the drummer,

1519
01:37:43,301 --> 01:37:48,100
I want to punch straight in the fucking
mouth for thinking that he's putting on

1520
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,750
a show. Yeah. This guy,

1521
01:37:49,751 --> 01:37:54,751
I realize he does a specific thing and
in its own weird way he can actually do

1522
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:56,550
this bullshit.

1523
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,650
Well, but I want, I want him dead
100%. So those are the struggle for me.

1524
01:38:01,651 --> 01:38:04,620
Cause now I, now that I see all
three together, the hand boning guys,

1525
01:38:04,621 --> 01:38:05,760
definitely the most tolerable,

1526
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,910
the clapping guy. I agree with
you. But here's the thing,

1527
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,980
if a heme brings up an excellent
point is the rage. And um, I would,

1528
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:16,920
I imagine myself watching
him do this horse shit,

1529
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:21,921
people laughing and the torture of the
audience enjoying that might set me off

1530
01:38:22,411 --> 01:38:26,340
even more than the drumming
and the screaming. So there's
two layers to it, right?

1531
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:29,490
It's drumming is just, everyone's
just get through this, right?

1532
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,330
But then the emotional component
to the stupid ham boning,

1533
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:38,370
it adds another layer of triggering
layer for me. So I'm going to go,

1534
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:41,000
I'm going to go number one
on the hand boning guy.

1535
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:45,920
It pisses me. This is the most
offensive second place, the drummer,

1536
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:49,520
third way, this is fine. This, this
is just a homeless guy in my mind.

1537
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:53,420
You know what I mean? Take a homeless
guy on an alley. It's like big deal.

1538
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:57,480
Some guy on the subways is crazy.
24 hours though. That's hey,

1539
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:01,500
but the ham Boehner would make me go.
Not really any price.

1540
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,130
I think the drummer I hate the most.
I think I hate the drum or the most,

1541
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,690
the drummer.
I think so.

1542
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:13,950
We're always fucking pointing out how
nasty and inappropriate people are in

1543
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:17,960
different scenarios, sometimes in
public. So we got an email said,

1544
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:21,180
I recently started listening to the
podcast and I've been listening glassing

1545
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:23,640
through the back catalog
back in episode three 98.

1546
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:28,560
Are you talking about sandals
specifically? Stinky, funky,
ugly ass Birkenstocks.

1547
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:31,410
I think that's the official
shoe of Seattle. Right? Um,

1548
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:34,680
I don't know yet if you got the blowback
you were expecting from the low and

1549
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:38,700
loose dirt Burke wears,
but I'm 100% with you.

1550
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,220
Totally smelling your
ass hole on this one.

1551
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:45,060
I don't know if you classy celebrity
country club folk or anything like the

1552
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:47,910
modest non-binary Zur from Canada,

1553
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:50,700
but I see some real nasty ass pictures.

1554
01:39:50,701 --> 01:39:55,701
People post in swap and sell groups on
Facebook of their like new and worn once

1555
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:00,483
Sandra's wow.

1556
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,930
Some of them look like the person may
have been burned to death wearing them

1557
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,140
leaving the imprint. Oh,
on there for eternity.

1558
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,520
I took a few screenshots to share with
you, but now or to share with my brother.

1559
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:12,690
Now I'm going to share them with you.

1560
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:17,490
Keep those jeans high and tight in
those purples. Big and mushy. Kevin.

1561
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:22,830
People are fucking, oh, like,
oh look only worn two times.

1562
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:26,980
No Bitch 22 times.
That's bullshit.

1563
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,540
Ah,

1564
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:31,850
this is, how should those costs
new? That's what I'm saying.

1565
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:34,850
Hundred dollars may really are 100 bucks.
I think they're pretty well.

1566
01:40:34,851 --> 01:40:37,490
Maybe she loves their
Burke has worn twice.

1567
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,510
Twice.
Yeah.

1568
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:44,440
Uh, no, barely warm.

1569
01:40:44,441 --> 01:40:46,870
My feet change sizes,
I can't wear them anymore.

1570
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,740
Ah,
uh,

1571
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:54,880
I think people's criterion for barely
worn the Birkenstock community is a bit

1572
01:40:54,881 --> 01:40:55,714
different.

1573
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:00,760
These are totally faded and look
at the indentations of the toes,

1574
01:41:00,761 --> 01:41:04,170
you know, is there like a park?
Is there a market for that?

1575
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:08,020
Like these are 10 bucks. These, this
person was like, I've got to get some,

1576
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:09,550
I have friends and stuff.

1577
01:41:09,551 --> 01:41:13,540
We'll have raw denim jeans that were worn
by a Japanese guy for like two years.

1578
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,170
Like Bobby Lee will do
that where he'll pay.

1579
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:21,310
There's Niggas company where like you're
paying a premium for people having worn

1580
01:41:21,311 --> 01:41:25,410
them in for you. Oh, that's
funny. So pants you can
handle, but like that's funny.

1581
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:31,440
I think some of them pants. I don't want
anyone, I don't want to a pants either.

1582
01:41:31,441 --> 01:41:35,910
Yeah. So here we go. Birkenstocks
are expensive. $139 Oh shit.

1583
01:41:35,911 --> 01:41:40,090
$100. This is a high ticket item.
You know why people would buy them.

1584
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:44,560
You just feel like those aren't
for me. Yeah. Get the rung below.

1585
01:41:44,561 --> 01:41:47,170
Birkenstock a hundred dollar
shoes. Yeah. I mean, I've,

1586
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:49,720
I've wanted nice shit that I
couldn't get and I was like, oh,

1587
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:54,130
I guess I just won't buy that. We're
just, wait, wait a little bit. Save up.

1588
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:57,790
You know, I'd be like, I have $40
now, so I'll just put that aside.

1589
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:01,320
How funny it was. If they want to stunt
on there, like granola friends, they go,

1590
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:06,220
oh nice dude. Nice new Birkenstocks. Yeah.
But in the back of your mind, you know,

1591
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:09,710
they're second hand. That's the
only reason to get them second hand.

1592
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:13,870
Somebody wore these to a festival already
and I'm fucking flexing on these fools

1593
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:17,560
right now. I'm so torn on the
Birkenstock because on the one hand,

1594
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:20,380
I imagine the comfort,
you must feel wearing them.

1595
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:25,330
They do look like be ultimate comfort.
Why are they so grading? I don't get it.

1596
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:28,420
I Dunno. Sure. They're
flexible. Your foot is free.

1597
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:31,090
I think part of what's amazing about them,

1598
01:42:31,091 --> 01:42:35,740
like I mean levels of it is number one,
the ease of putting on and taking off.

1599
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:40,030
Is that any sandal? Yeah, but I mean
like I'm just saying this one component.

1600
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:42,400
Right. Okay. And then the,

1601
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:44,980
I talked to a couple of
Birkenstocks fanatics who were like,

1602
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:48,430
they are so unbelievably comfortable,
and you wear through them,

1603
01:42:48,431 --> 01:42:51,450
like they're still comfortable, but you
eventually wear through them. You know,

1604
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:55,950
you have to re up those, those shoes,
I guess fairly often. But they're like,

1605
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,120
I know a couple people that are
obsessed with them. They're like,

1606
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:01,330
they really love them. I never, I just,

1607
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:05,680
my problem is they're so unfashionable
and I'm not a big fashion Easter,

1608
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:08,800
but there's so unfuckable
like you're just, Oh,

1609
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:13,360
you're really giving into not having
sat on like that. Yeah. I don't like it.

1610
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,780
I like to look, I mean, I've
seen you wear the most days,

1611
01:43:15,781 --> 01:43:20,020
but I think that's just part of
my stage persona. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1612
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,860
I compost on stage too. It's kind of a new
thing that I'm doing. It takes a while,

1613
01:43:23,861 --> 01:43:27,760
but I had a landlady that composted and
she get mad if I didn't put my table

1614
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:32,680
scraps on her compost heap. I'm just
not going to do that. He's not doing it.

1615
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:38,170
Then she puts your trash and your
thing on. What's wrong, Tom? Sorry,

1616
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:42,940
I'm just looking at something
that a message came in. All
right. Um, what about, uh,

1617
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:47,040
dates? Are you doing any road dates coming
up? I'm a teammate with Neil. You know,

1618
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:50,560
I was opening for him on his
tour. Oh yeah. How'd it go?
Here we go tour. Good. Uh,

1619
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,250
we took November

1620
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,490
off, so we're back on December.
I think we're doing la,

1621
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,180
Denver and San Diego and
Arizona. All right. Yeah.

1622
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:03,860
And then you have this thing around La.
I don't have anything on the books yet,

1623
01:44:03,861 --> 01:44:07,690
but I think the promo goat face, I might
get some road dates set up. Great Grace.

1624
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:11,120
And let's encourage everybody a two,

1625
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:15,580
if you're listening to this episode
as it comes out, a watch goat Phelps,

1626
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:19,400
that'd be great. Comedy
Central Comedy Central. Um,

1627
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:23,840
10:00 PM November 27th. Wonderful.
Yeah. And then I have a special called,

1628
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:26,730
there's no business like show
business coming central licenses.

1629
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:29,450
So I think he watched it for free on their
website and it's also on Amazon prime.

1630
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:34,490
I love Amazon prime. Yeah. Good. Then I
have a podcast too called Humana or dance.

1631
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:37,700
Our
dance.

1632
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:42,050
You've put out some hilarious videos.
You know what,

1633
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:44,470
like one of the first times we chatted,
um,

1634
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:47,830
it was in the backstage of the main
room at the comedy store. Yeah.

1635
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,810
And you are in your space. I didn't want
to bother you. And you're like, oh, I saw,

1636
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:55,250
I saw, I don't dance that Brent wine, Bach
short film. And you were really into it.

1637
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:57,830
And that was really cool
for me because I did an,

1638
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,480
you don't know who watches watch that
came your way and people just Google that.

1639
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:05,150
It's on Vimeo. Yeah. It's called,
I don't dance. I love Brent.

1640
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:09,440
He's such a weird comedy brain is man.
There's no one like him.

1641
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,910
No Buddy. Um, well please support
for him and uh, thanks for coming.

1642
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:17,090
Genius or anything else you want
to add? No, I love you. I love you.

1643
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,270
Thanks again for coming in and are having,
we should edit.

1644
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:25,030
Here's a young Patriot on a scrum dog
millionaire produced by Dj j p sounds.

1645
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,330
We'll see you guys next.

1646
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:34,740
[inaudible]

1647
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:40,740
okay.
