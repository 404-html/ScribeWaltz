1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,080
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,030
Christina Vincent.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,020
Your burps are just
violent rips? Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,050
All
right.

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,850
How angry would your mom get along?

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,623
Let it let it

7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,363
good.

8
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,140
Your books the best because I feel
like they always tell a story.

9
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,123
Please.

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,930
Good.
My point.

11
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,133
Yeah.

12
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,163
Good.

13
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,350
We do my language.

14
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,090
I can't listen to it and drying

15
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
my last episode I had a really,

16
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,283
I'm going to pass

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,693
a

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,153
good stuff.

19
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,070
I feel like he made a real song here.

20
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:49,540
It was really good.
Who is this western?

21
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh says west as it really funny.

22
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,590
I was laughing really hard as
long as called Burp. No Shit.

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,220
Artists is called West. That's
west. You know what? I love
my favorite bourbon. That

24
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,263
is when you go back,

25
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,250
when it's half out and you
muffle the second half. Yeah.

26
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,790
Where did you pick that
technique? I don't know. You know,

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,070
I've just been in the game so long.

28
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:13,840
I just have so many different
skills to really do whatever.

29
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,970
I want to kind of an innovator,
if you will.

30
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,280
How long have you been using that
burp technique? Years. Many years.

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,050
I have a wide range of abilities
when it comes to bourbon.

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,750
I think you notice it in that song. You
definitely conceded that I am the burp.

33
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,040
No I did not.

34
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,660
You said I did not say that said you're
definitely the better Berber that I

35
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,790
didn't say the phrase burp champion. Well
yeah, but you said it without saying it.

36
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:43,120
That that's probably from an episode
like 200 back and that's before I

37
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,050
listen to what you said. Pregnancy
changed my burp games. Violent rips.

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,130
I liked the reps.
Yeah.

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,360
That statement taken from our show. Yeah.

40
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,900
Like 200 episodes ago. No, it was
pretty reasonable. This one. Yeah.

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,553
Yeah.

42
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,003
That's me.

43
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,860
That's me. That's me.
I'm doing the loud ones.

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I feel like they always tell a story.

45
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,030
Yeah, I'm the BURP champ. But I
didn't say you're the verb champion.

46
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,230
I didn't use to have to say it.
What it is,

47
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,430
it's not implicit.

48
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,020
All I said is I liked yours
the best because they have
different sounds. Pitches.

49
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,250
They do tell a story.

50
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:44,251
I like when you go half into
the sometimes you like that.

51
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:48,190
Why don't you try it? Cause it's your
technique. I can't or you can try it. No,

52
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:51,640
it's not. It's not mine. Mine's
different. I like to go aggressive.

53
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,420
You heard what I was capable of
and that song, I'd like surprises.

54
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,920
That's,
that's a going,

55
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,170
can I have some of your doctors
evs to get my own burps going.

56
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,060
Your whole thing is like,
I want somebody yours.

57
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,270
That's because yours is better than my,
I don't know why you do that.

58
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,460
It's really ridiculous. It
just tastes better. It tastes
good. Tastes good. A bitch.

59
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,590
Um, but you're, you're burbs
consistently make me laugh. Um,

60
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,790
probably that's probably why.

61
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,970
One of the main reasons I married
you and your burps in here.

62
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,060
One of the main reasons. I
mean, there's other stuff like,

63
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,730
are you a good person? Are you not
addicted to things? Do you call, you know,

64
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,530
like do what you're saying, are you going
to do keep your word, are you moral?

65
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,890
But above all that is, can you Burke? Wow.

66
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,740
I didn't realize it was that
high on the list. Well, yeah,

67
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:46,160
because I've actually addicted to things.
That's a little important to a lot,

68
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,400
but I, I dated guys in the
past who don't like by,

69
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,950
they didn't like my burbs where my farts
and I got a lot of heat for being who I

70
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:58,520
was. Really. So when I found you
I was like, Oh really? Oh yeah.

71
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,563
I have upset.

72
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,000
Every ex boyfriend did not appreciate
my burping or farting skills.

73
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,970
Wow.
Fall in.

74
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,380
I got a lot of heat for my burbs. Like
the last boyfriend I had before you. Yeah.

75
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,230
He actually would be like,
stop farting. Stop it.

76
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,680
Like he would get really mad at me.
He didn't appreciate it.

77
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:28,130
That's why I can't hear it. The
thing is done. That's why. Okay. O is

78
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,430
for is for
far.

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah. I liked that burp that I did
on the show that made the teaser.

80
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,670
That was a pretty, I mean, I
wish you'd give me some credit.

81
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:48,070
I feel like you just want to Laurie and
I don't get it. What about my farts?

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,350
Remember you came home and I farted a
lot yesterday. Very cool. In the kitchen.

83
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,240
I farted a bunch and there's
no shortage of parts from you.

84
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,410
I mean if that's what this is about, well
who's a better, okay, let's decide then.

85
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,880
Who's a better fighter?
Who was a bit of Roper?

86
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,960
You really want to have that discussion
right now. He really thinks so.

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,430
Well why not?
Why can't we just have the discussion?

88
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,260
It doesn't have to lead anymore.
Let's just open up a topic. You know,

89
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,830
you know the answer.
What's the answer?

90
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,220
I'm definitely the king supreme of
both of those categories. Not True.

91
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,700
Yana.
Yana might.

92
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I present the case of my farts being
very smelly and hot cause I eat a lot of

93
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,860
dried apricots in the past.

94
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,720
I tend to have smellier hotter
farts than you think so. Yeah.

95
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,610
Mine smell way worser than
yours. Sometimes they do.
Most of the time they do.

96
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,290
I think we're going to vomit during this.

97
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,820
There's so much gross stuff in this
episode. Last conversation is one of them.

98
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,930
Definitely the BURP champ.
I can't believe you wouldn't concede that.

99
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,470
I don't know. I feel like that's
up for debate. I feel like,

100
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,630
I just feel like we need to open it up
and let's kind of see where it says I'm

101
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,930
not ready to call that yet. Okay.
I feel like it's warm in here.

102
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not warm in here. You're always hot.
We'll take off your fucking sweatshirt.

103
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,600
We'll know because it's like comfortable.

104
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,490
But I mean the other day I take off the
sweatshirt aware these sweatshirts comes

105
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,170
or not hot anymore. It's comfortable to
wear it though. That's what I'm saying.

106
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,840
But here's what Howard tour
that was pretty good. This
is how ridiculous it was.

107
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,510
Just looked at it to see how it registered
and how did it register? Pretty hot.

108
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,560
Pretty hot.
How is yours and comparison go back to it.

109
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,750
You didn't look when yours.
I mean you,

110
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,980
you did it like a real theatrical
appropriate then though. Really forced to,

111
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:50,670
so what you're saying, what
you're saying is, is that you,

112
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,870
you're good with a variety.
I might be good with sound.

113
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,033
See I like,

114
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,210
I like that right there cause it had
different sounds and then you incorporate

115
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:01,560
it at the end.

116
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,980
My favorite Burberry or is when you used
to go when the mouth and then blow it

117
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,670
out?
Yeah.

118
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,030
I mean you're talking about all these
different burps right now and you're like,

119
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:15,090
those are cool down one's called. They'll
be like, that one's cool. That was cool.

120
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,970
But then you go. But I mean,
who says you're the best? Well,

121
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,560
who does all these different verbs?
It's me. I'm obviously the boat.

122
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,120
We haven't decided what criteria is the
best. Okay. And in my opinion, yeah,

123
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,260
variety is important,
but so is pitch frequency volume.

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,770
Very important. Yeah. So
I think I have the volume.

125
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,160
I have the fortune to talk about
how ridiculous you are. Oh,

126
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,600
that light's off by the
way. Oh Shit. Fuck. Hold on.

127
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,540
You guys can look at my light denim that
I got. Oh yeah, she's got real light dad.

128
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,870
But I'll tell you why.

129
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,470
Because these are lucky brand and
they're like a nineties Jean that I

130
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:54,360
specifically order online. Pretty nerdy
colored. Yeah. But the cut is cool.

131
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,293
Look,

132
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,800
it looks kind of cool though.
Cool.

133
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,230
Yeah. Dad, where did the uh, white sneaks

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,970
yeah.
Should close this door.

135
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

136
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,590
I know another another day of rain.

137
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,330
You want me to hold the heat? Yeah. No,

138
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm going to turn the
air on so cold. Why? Why?

139
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,200
Why are you doing this? Why aren't
you doing this? You're miserable. No,

140
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:34,100
Dad. You're the worst. How cold
are you going to make it in here,

141
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,560
Jean? You have such unreasonable
expectations for this.

142
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,620
The other day I was in bed and I
go, is it warm in here? No. I go,

143
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,700
it smells warm and I kind of just like,

144
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,070
I let your logical mind step in
for a second and then I go, wait,

145
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:55,970
this doesn't feel right and I
get up and I work. I miss that.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,620
And it's 80 it's 80 and you're
like, I like it. It feels good.

147
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,960
Here's a problem with what you do or I
don't like your methods is because it'll

148
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,560
be hot as fuck outside.
I don't feel it kicking on,

149
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,250
so you don't feel it.
Jesus. Oh my God. Oh my God.

150
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,173
So listen,

151
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,300
my problem with your AC consumption is
that it'll be hot as fuck outside and

152
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:26,450
then you'll decide to put it down to
like 60 never, never once. Not even once.

153
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,040
You said you want it to be
63 never done it. Never.

154
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,770
How low do you put that
thermostat because of you?

155
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,310
It feels like 63 I should
say that because of you.

156
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:42,311
I always put it at 72 73
silo like that please.

157
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,530
The problem is you turn it to low and
then it feels like keep it in the low

158
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,930
seventies not even down to seven
but it feels like I have a fever.

159
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,980
I don't feel like you have a fever.

160
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,940
It makes me feel feverish and sick when
you make the AC so cold and it's been

161
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,220
hot all day,
so my body's all super high.

162
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,830
Whenever I see you and then you
overcompensate with whatever.

163
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,780
I see you being feverish and sick.

164
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:08,320
I feel so happy and I feel so
good with myself, you know,

165
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,520
kind of smaller. And your soda.
Where's your water? Water Champ. Oh,

166
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:18,900
interesting. Yet another
episode where you have no water.

167
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:23,350
Every two beverages with you. Ha, I
have coffee and I have water id hydrate,

168
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,630
but then I rehydrate.
That's my system.

169
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,670
The whole thing I do is
I don't dehydrate ever.

170
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,840
So he also don't drink water and I do.
The thing is water champion,

171
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,070
not beverage champion. I drink gallons
of water were not during the show.

172
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,100
I don't know how you go in there right
now because I drank so much before. Oh,

173
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:42,220
really? Yeah. Okay.
That's your story. Plus,

174
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,970
this is water soda.
Why naturally flavored?

175
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,410
No Art, no sugar, no artificial
sweeteners, no caffeine.

176
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,240
Fun at all. Water. Yeah. Oh it whatever.

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,520
I always thought the clear stuff
that comes from the tap is water,

178
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,910
but you're,

179
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,910
you're claiming the Black Cherry
via soda is the same as water it is.

180
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,010
It's exactly the same molecularly. Well,
it has some carbonation in it. Okay.

181
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,500
Add some flavorings that make it not
taste. Why no artificial sweetener,

182
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:17,130
don't you just drink water if you
like water or something like that.

183
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,470
Do I drink it all day? I drink gallons
of senior drink. Any water today.

184
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,520
You're a liar, but you live in
a lie. What's the light? Okay,

185
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,570
now you're performing. You're forcing it.
You're forcing it. You're the lightship.

186
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,540
That'll you're either lie champ.
He's a liar champ. You're the liar.

187
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,580
Chances are willing to
share the cold champion.

188
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,180
You like it cold like your heart ready.
Let's do this shit.

189
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,210
I've been, I'm very,
very dirty ground lately.

190
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,080
For some reason I've been going two, three
days without showering. Oh No. I know.

191
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,590
It's pretty bad.
It is.

192
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,650
But it's not all bad because since I'm
not showering as often as I probably

193
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,210
shut,
that means that my asshole

194
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,100
probably has a nice stinky sent to it.

195
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,920
Oh is Randy.
Don't bring anyone loving coded.

196
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Well welcome to your mom's house for us

197
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,000
Christina pledges.
It's interesting

198
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,750
she hasn't showered in three days, but
that means on the good side. Yeah, this,

199
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:17,030
she's got real stinky be whole.
That is a positive.

200
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:20,620
So I thought you were going to say she's
not wasting water but that too. Yeah,

201
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,410
that too. How, what's the longest
you've gone without showering?

202
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,580
Definitely a couple of days, but
not, not often, man. I mean, uh,

203
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,550
yeah. I'm trying to think of like
sickness Leben like really sick.

204
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,230
You stay in bed and it hurts to
stand. That kind of stuff. Yeah,

205
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,030
a couple of days maybe into the third day,
you know,

206
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,080
or some crazy outdoors. Each trip
that I took, I dunno as this guy,

207
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,540
I don't even do that.
I'm the indoor champ period.

208
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,850
I haven't done it in a long time. Hey,
can't, I'll never can't to my life. Yeah.

209
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,270
We got so much flack from that.
Uh, what one episode, I don't know,

210
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,170
hundreds of episodes ago where we're
like, fuck camping. You're wrong.

211
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,990
Like I don't want to go dude. And they're
like, but you're missing out. No, I'm not.

212
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,300
I've been before. Right.
I don't want to go.

213
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:11,110
It doesn't mean I don't like it
outside. I like being outside. Yeah.

214
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:13,910
I just don't want to say we've gotten
there. I liked it. I like lakes. Yeah.

215
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:17,020
I like stuff. I know I like going
outdoors. I just don't want to,

216
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,810
I don't see the need to sleep
out there for days on end,

217
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,910
but that's what's funny to me.
Shit out there and stuff.

218
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,350
When somebody argues against
someone's preferences. Right.

219
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,660
You know, it's like, it's like someone
arguing with about your food preferences.

220
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,190
Yeah. You know, if you're
like, I'm meeting the soup
and they're like, I hate soup,

221
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,980
you should try this. And you're
like, but I like it. Right.

222
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,180
But they're usually like what I
liked. Yeah. Like would I like that?

223
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,550
Why don't you like my stuff?
I Dunno. I Dunno man. Nope.

224
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,520
I like sneaky bought wholesale and this
lady's got one, so she set it up. Well,

225
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,440
now I know what's going to happen. I
think. Oh, I don't know. I'm lost today.

226
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,400
I thought I would play with my ass home.
No,

227
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,850
stick my finger really deep.
Far.

228
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,250
Wait a minute. She's gonna get shit on
her finger. No. Yeah. All up in there.

229
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,280
Maybe she's training.
Take it out and inhale.

230
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,430
Yeah, she published stones as field. Wow.

231
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,990
Yeah. Maybe that's a spam. I don't
know. Maybe she's trying to train

232
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,120
Glen. What's your ass smells like?
What's your cock and balls smell like?

233
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,500
Yeah. That, that is one of my favorite
clips. Learn what your cock and balls.

234
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,380
Learn your finger along
the crack of your ass.

235
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,180
You don't need to finger your whole,

236
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,950
you don't want to come back
with shit on your finger.

237
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,800
But here's somebody that wants
to take that advice to task.

238
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,140
Maybe you can say, I don't think so, sir.

239
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,820
You're not the only one that knows how
to run your finger along ass. All right,

240
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,040
let's

241
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,430
just talk about what sense I'm getting.

242
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,990
Oh, what kind of smells or
living in my asshole right now,

243
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,810
because trust me,

244
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,280
there's probably a lot of smells
going on in my asshole right now.

245
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,950
Talk like you, I mean, I was gonna
say one of my sisters, but yeah,

246
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,610
she is a girl. This is a woman might be
related to you. Seriously. Seriously.

247
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,270
Seriously. Seriously.
Seriously. Oh my God. Seriously?

248
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,310
She sounds like you. And
then she's like, say, uh,

249
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,400
as a lot of smells loud that
here is a tribal tattoo.

250
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,240
That's a neat,
let's see here is my sister.

251
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,290
Oh my God. Seriously. And then
here's this lady. Seriously,

252
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,230
seriously. Oh my God. Seriously.

253
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,810
Oh Man. So is that it's like you
think she's got some real smells,

254
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,880
you know,
I'm not so worried about the smells.

255
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm worried about that tribal tat that
she has around her arm. That kind of

256
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,610
Barb wire nineties. My own included. Yeah.

257
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:03,730
And if you're watching this,
you probably love asked smell too.

258
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,140
Oh, so this is an f smell
video? Like that's like, yeah.

259
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:13,400
What did you think she thought maybe
she was just somebody who has, you know,

260
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,850
sexual videos up. I didn't know
it was like specific. She goes,

261
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,510
if you're watching this, you'd like asked
smells. This is cool. From an ass smell.

262
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:25,040
Yes. I think so. This is a
very specific genre. I can't,

263
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,550
oh my God. Seriously. I can't
imagine this is like generalized.

264
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:31,880
It's all about ass smells. Oh my
God, you guys are so disgusting.

265
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,860
That was Jane by the way. People
sometimes don't know he was doing, uh,

266
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,420
which sister is doing the voices, right?
You know, or what they're hearing. Yeah,

267
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,230
that's Jane. Yeah. Maria. I
don't know. Can we find them?

268
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,900
Maria thing to do the difference.
Fingers,

269
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,250
cut the bomb vest on and like throw myself
out because I'm basically on map hat

270
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,810
with the lifestyle. It's very fucking
healthy lifestyle. He asked me,

271
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,260
they kind of sound the first half of that.
Yeah, that's real. Yeah, it's different.

272
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,710
It's a faster cadence.
Much faster. Yeah. Yeah,

273
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,870
yeah. Okay. So let's get back to this
stinky ass hole. These ladies here,

274
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,740
real curious

275
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,080
about it. Something Raunchy. Yeah.

276
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,270
Intoxicating.
Seriously.

277
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,790
Someone can sit on my face all day with
her ass and I wouldn't mind sitting in

278
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,560
someone else's space, smothering
with, smothering them with my dirty,

279
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,970
smelly asshole.

280
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,060
She kind of talks like you kind of has,
well this is kind of vocal fry or so,

281
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:38,620
right? Yeah. I mean, do you
think she talks like me?

282
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,600
Yeah. Like I feel like you two
could be a nice pair in a way.

283
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,160
I mean, she was nasty. She had nasty
as fuck. But you're like, you're,

284
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,840
you're open to nasty like that,
you know,

285
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,090
I dunno if I would be farting or
when he named Justin Myself. Uh,

286
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I don't know if I would necessarily
be into the ass male aspect of,

287
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,860
of the relationship with her.
Like if she was like,

288
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,560
I didn't shower days wants to smell,
but she's inside of my ass.

289
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,120
But she's definitely got kind of a
Karen vibe to her. Yeah. I mean she's,

290
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:11,590
she's a nasty bitch for sure.

291
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,460
She's a crystal or a Shandy.
She's gnarliest. Fuck Trish.

292
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:23,410
She's kind of a Trish. Trish that
Karen. Yeah. Karen is broken,

293
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:27,610
but she's not this damaged
this girl. A Trish. Sure.

294
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,520
She is a little more sophisticated.
And Karen though. Oh, I'm sorry.

295
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:34,930
I thought I thought Tricia was trashy or
my mind. No, Tris thinks he has a shot.

296
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:38,800
Remember? No, Karen thinks she has a shot.

297
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:42,430
Trish doesn't trick Tricia's trashier
than Karen. No, I don't think so.

298
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,380
Have I messed up my alter
ego? I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

299
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,720
That's not it. Um, all right,
let's see what this, uh, yeah,

300
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:53,800
cause it's so cold in here.

301
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:58,801
I feel sick because I'm warm under
my sweatshirt and then the 74,

302
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:03,630
it's freezing. Freezing. You feels
like studios, there's cold air around.

303
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:06,510
It keeps studios in the 60s always.

304
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,840
I wore this white shirt today is because
I knew it was cold out and I knew you

305
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:13,750
would still turn on the AC. It's not,
it's not clean. That's why I wore this,

306
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:17,440
because I put my hood up for him.
His lights that generate heat in here.

307
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,290
Yes. It's not as nice.
Why don't we stop? No,

308
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,670
please don't.

309
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,990
No, you want me to sue other
my panties all over your face.

310
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,480
You inhale.

311
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,840
It's gotta be real stake here. How do
you know if she's telling the truth?

312
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,780
I don't. I wonder. That same
thing. Yeah, she's lying.

313
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,330
The two to three day thing could be.

314
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,140
I don't think she really is into it
the way she pretends to be. You know?

315
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,230
Oh Jesus. Fuck. Are we
done with this yet? I mean,

316
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,490
my stomach's hurting from watching this.

317
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,320
It smells stronger then I
thought I would smell. Oh Wow.

318
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,030
It's like a combination of a Raunchy ass

319
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,530
and sweet shits now, but in a good
way. You know? Not Dirty Shit.

320
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,770
Oh my God.
You guys are so disgusting.

321
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,400
Let's see what's happening.
This is blurred.

322
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,240
Blurred this hall.
No,

323
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,570
you get all the natural
smells of my asshole.

324
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,540
I mean, she's really doing
it. Yeah, I know. I get it.

325
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,480
A little coercing cause my finger is dry,

326
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,840
but I don't want to get
all the real smells.

327
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,240
That's the important thing.
The real smells. Oh, okay.

328
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh, oh fuck. Um, no.

329
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,240
You know what? She's authentic. That's
what I respect. Sweetness. Do Smell.

330
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,370
I can't,
we can't fake this level.

331
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,990
So if you're one of her followers,
that's my girl.

332
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,550
She's not as my jam.
Christina's Janice.

333
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,960
She's authentic. I
believe her now. I wasn't,

334
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,110
I wasn't convinced when she showed us her,

335
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,980
she spread them and then I
wasn't convinced when she
was sniffing her panties.

336
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,450
I do feel like in order to be the kind
of girl you put your finger in your butt

337
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:22,860
and that smell and then describe the
smell. You're committed. Like you're,

338
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,320
you're in it. You're in it, you're in
it. You're real. She's real. She's real.

339
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,980
She's real.

340
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,540
No thanks asshole.
Yeah,

341
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,350
she's three days

342
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,200
crazy laugh. She's, she's a crazy
lady. Crazy. She's crazy. What do you,

343
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,570
things like the data, right?
Right, right. Nobody dates her.

344
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,100
No one on one dates hurts.
People start to date or,

345
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,830
and then it doesn't go that long.
No.

346
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,870
How long before you realize how crazy
she is? But it's also something good.

347
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,730
It's just raunchy ass and shit smell.

348
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,200
I mean that's basically what it is.
And I fucking love it and I don't care.

349
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,060
And I know you love it too.
I'm going to throw us too.

350
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,170
She is gnarly

351
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,310
getting that Hashtag.
Uh, what do you think it,

352
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:17,590
how long before,
how long do you think

353
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,280
Rhonchi ass and shit smell?

354
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,930
Do you think she leads with us?
Like is this,

355
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,440
she has to meet people on like fetish
site. I don't know if she leaves

356
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,440
is with this, but she doesn't, she
doesn't completely mask it either.

357
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,960
I think she's the kind of person
who you're having dinner, right?

358
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,890
Talking about this and that.
And then she might be like,

359
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,180
I like stinky stuff.
It's smelly cheeses.

360
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:44,230
Like she might lead you into
or she'll say something like,

361
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:47,860
I didn't put on deodorant today. Right.
And then you're like, oh, you know,

362
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,813
that's okay.

363
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,260
Do you like that you don't like what?

364
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,340
There's a Dwayne reed across the
street if you want to go there.

365
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,400
And then she's like, I don't
want to buy any. I'm saying,

366
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,950
do you like the way that smells? And
you're like, oh, I don't think so.

367
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,220
Then she's like, I like doing my
fucking asshole smells. And you're like,

368
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,390
we should probably get the cheque.
Yeah. Yeah. It does go down like that.

369
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,130
Yeah. You think she drops it
on the first date though? Yeah.

370
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,450
I think when you have a fetish,
uh, this real, you gotta Let,

371
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,240
he's not playing games.
She's real

372
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,190
full note. A lot of smells going
on in my asshole right now.

373
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,240
You see that too? Like try a lot of
smells going on in my ass asshole.

374
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,120
But for different reasons.
Not for sexual,

375
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:34,780
I don't say I don't think go and I want
to smell each one of them on my finger.

376
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,200
And you're usually, you say that
when you have to shower, you're like,

377
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,840
oh my sticky asshole. Yes. Thank you.

378
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,460
But that her finger would have brown
on it. It didn't, it didn't know God.

379
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,740
Interesting observation.
It did not.

380
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,010
Well yeah cause that was another level
of gnarly that I thought was coming,

381
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,280
you know,
wait,

382
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,360
she didn't get shit on her fingers and
she fingered her bottle so that the pup

383
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:57,300
play guys kind of off. And you
think yeah, but maybe, I don't know.

384
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:01,020
Maybe she just has like a cleaner pothole.
She's a girl.

385
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,000
She's a girl or a way gnarlier
she could have even, you know,

386
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,910
tried to remove some inner brown.
Who knows.

387
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,290
Well,
speaking of dudes being gnarly,

388
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,030
a while ago we gave some advice to a
young gentleman about what to do about a B

389
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:21,490
hall shaves.
He writes in,

390
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:25,210
I wrote you a couple of weeks ago asking
if I should do some maintenance down

391
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:28,120
under after listening
to your words of wisdom,

392
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,520
I made the decision to bic my be whole.

393
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,660
I didn't go with the waxing because I
didn't know if I was committing to a good

394
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:39,430
thing. Well it was a game changer.
Uh, just like you had said,

395
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,690
my cleanup game is pretty fucking tight
right now. Just a few wipes and done.

396
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,510
There is the sweat issue that you
mentioned, but that's a welcome trade off.

397
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,720
I was surprised to notice how my farts
smell different now to kind of sloppy

398
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:54,910
sounding like a fat Guy Fart.

399
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,620
I also changed my diet as you suggested
by removing most of the carbs and almost

400
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:03,040
all sugar. That's made a huge
difference in my life in many ways.

401
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,480
I feel like a new man and I can't
thank you enough. Fuck Dan Pena.

402
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,140
My life coach is the one and only
undisputed water champion Tommy Bond.

403
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,190
Thanks.
And I bow and thank you for your thanks.

404
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,780
Well it's neat on this show and we can
help people. It is cool. And you know, I,

405
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,990
it was easy to give that advice.
I thought that it was a,

406
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,880
the idea was one that I would go for and
I think that the Diet changes, you know,

407
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:33,710
it's modest. It's not too crazy to do
that. Change is key to farts. Oh yeah.

408
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,180
And the heat,
they probably,

409
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,450
he said they feel diff or they
smell different or sound different.

410
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,220
Sound different. That's
right. The hair is gone.

411
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,910
So it's just really going against skin.
It's in the air and the skin is,

412
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,830
it says what girl fart sound like. Yeah.
Girl forests on different, yeah, for sure.

413
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,710
So I'm, I'm very proud of him
though for doing it and I, you know,

414
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:58,940
I encourage people to at least
take that hair removal for a spin.

415
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,290
See if it's something that feels
right to you, is fun to you.

416
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,040
Well, there's lots of benefits.
You got a cleaner wipe. Yeah. Uh,

417
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:13,720
it is sweaty like he said,
but you know, trade off. I'd
say the cleanup thing is, is

418
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,070
massive. The cleanups, the whole point,
everything else is, uh, you know,

419
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,050
has his, uh, you know, uh, whatever
effect of it. But it's not, it's not,

420
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,490
it's all about the cleanup challenging
cause when you're a hairy man, that is,

421
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,200
I can't imagine the suffering.

422
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,620
I can't imagine shitting into the
top of your head and then being like,

423
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,730
seriously, and then just wiping the
fish shit off of it. And you're like,

424
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:40,120
how long is it going to take? I
don't know, 45 minutes. Speaking of,

425
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,390
speaking of that an we got
bringing water to Poop,

426
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,520
it's called Christina is wrong.

427
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,270
Here's the email Solomon get
this straight Christians uh,

428
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:54,310
yeah is freaking out about Dj Dad Mal
bringing a water bottle into the stall but

429
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:56,680
her jam is to wash it off of her.

430
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,500
How do you say rectum in the shower.

431
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,360
I guess there is some risk of airborne
brown particles attaching to the small

432
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:08,290
surface area exposed on a water him
after the bottle cap is removed,

433
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:12,820
but that's only a short amount of
time and the risk of contamination is

434
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,710
negligible and any non juggle,

435
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:19,390
oh person would ditch that water bottle
after bringing it into the shit or

436
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,040
obviously chugging most of the water
before bringing it into the hydrate water

437
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:28,450
champ. Is it lifestyle? He probably
starts out saying it doesn't smell,

438
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,560
it doesn't burn it and greasy,
I mean step on my balls,

439
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:36,310
but brown should not be
washed off onto a surface.

440
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:39,940
You routinely walk barefoot in a puddle
of water unless you are bleaching your

441
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:44,410
shower every day, but get your life only
using dove body wash. So main mommy.

442
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:49,330
Tina was suspiciously shocked and
couldn't barely recognize buttons after

443
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,680
hearing this pro level move.

444
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,810
I'm no professional but sounds like a
subconscious retaliation effort from a

445
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,030
personality of lesser character.

446
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,980
I mean it's basically f
a r t level hypocrisy.

447
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,480
Wow. If you swap out poop
particles for curse words for,

448
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,560
for curse words, for analysis,
you feel me? Smart and final mark

449
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,860
smartify armor. Yeah. Well
first of all, mark, uh,

450
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,150
list off a r t allow me to uh,

451
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,020
clarify my position on Tom's usage of the
water bottle to clean off her ass hole.

452
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,000
He is right by the way.
And that you don't take a,

453
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,840
I'm a taking a full bottle of
water and cracking it to do this.

454
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,580
What are you doing? This is a like,
let's say an airport. You have,

455
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,680
you buy your bottle of water,
you're drinking it.

456
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,850
Let's say you're probably two
thirds of the way through it.

457
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,810
I gotta take a dump. I bring that
in there and it helps me clean up.

458
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,480
Now you're using like the maple syrup top,
you know,

459
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:53,410
the kind that's like the power squirter.
Is that what you're doing? And you're,

460
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,350
you're kind of supporting your asshole
or your wedding. The toilet paper.

461
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,000
Toilet paper. Well, my only thing just
go like this. You pour water into,

462
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,810
now you have wet toilet paper.
Okay.

463
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,510
To wash the top of your head off
that you shit on my own way. Uh, my,

464
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,540
my issue with it was that I was worried
about the shame of caring in a bottle of

465
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:19,300
water into the shitter. I just think
it's odd when people carry zero shame,

466
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,373
um,

467
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,560
food items are edible things
into the store would not bring.

468
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,890
That's kind of a cheeseburger.
I see you like you've got your Mcdonald's,

469
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,850
you got your Apple Pie. There is a good
idea though to eat that on the Shitter,

470
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:38,620
right? So nasty, nasty.

471
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:39,454
And secondly,

472
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,850
I don't do shit to shower anymore because
of the total washlet three talking

473
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,970
about outside of the house we're
talking about, uh, why haven't,

474
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,540
I haven't shit to showered in awhile,
but we're talking about how, so you're,

475
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:53,840
you're, you're at the airport
and what do you do? Right.

476
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,220
And so that's what I'm
saying is it's not an,

477
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,850
I don't bring a bottle of water into
our home. I'm saying when you're,

478
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,600
when you're in public, I guess I'm
thinking about the office worker,

479
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,280
the person who has to be,

480
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,550
I don't think it's that weird rule has to
go to like a bottle of water is capped.

481
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I know, but it just seems weird. Like I'm
going to go to take a shit and then you,

482
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,880
you're carrying your bottle
of water in the stall with he,

483
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,170
you don't think people kind of know?

484
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,860
I wouldn't think twice because I used
to get wearied just like weird about

485
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,900
bringing my iPhone in to
take a shit. Like, oh,

486
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:24,200
everybody knows that I'm looking at
my iPhone. Oh, when I'm taking a dump,

487
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,430
which I would hide it Kinda in my clothes
so that people didn't see, I still do.

488
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,250
I would carry that water right in.
No problem. Right. I, but you're,

489
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,010
you're an animal. You don't care
about anything. That's true.

490
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,780
I wanted to bring this to your attention
a as long as we're still on this topic.

491
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,050
Yeah. Uh, our good friend
Eric, it was his birthday.

492
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:45,920
We bought him a squatty potty using our
Amazon banner and go to your mom's house,

493
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,570
podcast.com.
Click on the banner at the bottom,

494
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,070
the homepage to your shopping
as you normally would.

495
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,410
And I got him a squatty potty.
Right. And in Kansas shitty he lives.

496
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,070
Yes.

497
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,150
Now here's the interesting part is that
we've had so many people tell us to use

498
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,150
the squatty potty.
Yeah.

499
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,680
And I've been reluctant because
like I take healthy browns,

500
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:08,090
I don't need the assistance of anything.
Yeah. Interesting review came in.

501
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:13,250
I'm going to read what he wrote verbatim
because I find it that interesting.

502
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:17,820
Hold on one moment. One moment.

503
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:19,590
You don't have it prepped
for the show or anything

504
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,020
and breathe into the mic because
that's definitely loving that.

505
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,930
I can't find Jesus. Basically
he said, sure hour here.

506
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,380
Basically he said,

507
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,070
well he said that it's good that it comes
out faster when you're doing it right.

508
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,170
Like you take it faster shit cause your,

509
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,550
your knees are up to your chest basically.
Right.

510
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,920
The problem is it doesn't
leave much time for reading,

511
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:53,120
for texting, for catching up on,
you know, Instagram, Twitter,

512
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,910
or whatever.
That's the problem.

513
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,630
So part of the fun of shitting
is really catching up on emails,

514
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:01,180
texting people back.
Definitely texting your friends,

515
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:05,350
you're taking a shit right now. That kind
of stuff. It becomes a necessity. Oh,

516
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:10,120
how's it takes a while. So it really
does make sense in that you, I'm sorry,

517
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:13,120
what becomes a necessity? The
iPhone. Yeah, because you're like,

518
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:16,870
this isn't going to come out and in half
a second I'm going to sit here for a

519
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:21,130
second and then you get the engine going.
But if you're,

520
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,280
if you're doing that, maybe you're
happier that you have more time, you know,

521
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:26,770
in other words, you, you feel
like it's going to take some time.

522
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:30,370
That's why you bring your iPhone. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I like to take my time.

523
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:33,940
I like to catch a real dilemma though. I
understand. Yeah. Because on the one hand,

524
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:38,090
I like the efficiency of the squatty
potty. I liked the idea of, yeah. But

525
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,310
then again, I kind of
enjoy my, um, you know,

526
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,960
relaxed BMS. I like, I like texting
everybody that I'm shitting. Anything.

527
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,290
You already made your decision. I don't
think you're going to do it. No. Um,

528
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,220
I should tell this.

529
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,160
Are you out on this?

530
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,350
Oh, I like the way I
should. So Do I. Yeah,

531
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,350
but that was just chipping the ball right
there. But why not? Sorry. Sorry. Um,

532
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,720
the big announcement is chips in a mall.

533
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,670
I'm coming to Momster.

Uh, that's pretty exciting. Gene. I
haven't been here in quite some time.

536
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,380
I'm coming in August. I'm
hitting four cities. Brisbane,

537

Melbourne and Perth.

538

Tickets are on sale. Better
scoop them. Shits up.

539
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,010
It's August. Uh, I believe
the first show was August 9th,

540
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,560
and then there's one the
10th, 12th, and 14th.

The first one sold out,

547
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,300
so that is on sale now.

554
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,750
I had to add a show in May because of
the way that the weekend worked out.

555
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,070
Um, with uh, what's it called with Easter.

big announcement too? I feel like, yeah.

561
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,090
After fucking a million

611
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:47,360
decides to a rap about how awesome
cucumbers are, but and he wrote,

612
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:49,690
decides to rape about
how awesome cucumbers.

613
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,833
Hmm.

Everything they say sounds real
fine when they talk that way. Yeah.

617
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,970
It's like when English people talk,
they just sound super smart. Yeah.

618
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,960
No matter what they say.
And then when like Jamaican dudes talk,

619
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:16,850
it's just sounds like it's
a party. It sounds like fun.

626
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:43,170
combining a special form
of organic broccoli please.

627
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,870
Broccoli sprouts still liver.

628
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,490
It's not for compound of
Broccoli sulforaphane.

629
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,380
Hold on.
Show business number one.

630
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,760
Try not to match your jacket with
the background. That's kind of funny.

631
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,660
Maybe it was like he's
popping out of the wall.

632
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,070
Just those eyeballs and a white collar.
Anything Weirdo.

Yeah, come on. Creep Salad. Secondly,
pick somebody a little more camera ready.

634

Then this fool, what are you trying to
say is definitely not for television.

635
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:15,560
This face? No, it's got
a face for podcasts.

636
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,210
Guys are bugged out the bulbous eyes,

637
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,640

hear more about so forth. No,

638
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,540

Oh God,
I love cop out

640
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,060

an active biomolecule. However,

641
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,270
it can be converted into Sony,
which is yeah,

642
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,280
and so forth. Yes. The important
preventive benefits and it's a effect.

643
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,270
Well documented. He might have
even read about it on my site.

644
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:51,130
I probably haven't write about
it. Are we done? No, please.

645
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,970
And be converted to so far
thing. We're crying out. Fuck.

646
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:57,770
Using the bacteria that are
normally present there. I was

647
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,490
like this fuck. Like they talk. Yes,

648
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,450

like, well right now the uh,

649
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,460
the vaginal juices are making it.
This is a lubricant.

650
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:14,330
It's a natural lubricant is telling
you about it. You do it? Yes, he does.

651
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,223
I believe it.

652
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,640
Do you know I had a listener from
nasty bro and she listens to the show.

653
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:22,790
She's like a bio chemist. Super
Genius. She wrote in, she was like,

654
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,290
I actually understood one
of your boring videos horse.

655
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,500
Somebody every week understands
a boring video or two. Yeah,

656
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,070
top soil.
That's my

657
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,390
jam.
I love it.

658
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,550
I love sinkholes or dry dry sockets
or whatever the fuck. Oh my God,

659
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,230
I had an awesome brunch. You did.
God, I haven't had brunch in forever.

660
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,210
Tell me about bright. Well, cause our
baby jeans is up at six in the morning.

661
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,200
Yeah. And then he's down by that
first nap by nine. It's not really,

662
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:53,340
there's no brunch window.

663
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:56,500
I mean I guess we could do it when he
wakes up from that or did it in Chicago.

664
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,810
Yeah.
What did you have?

665
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,520
Well, first of all, I'll tell you
the whole weekend was bananas. Yeah.

666
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,150
Chicago's like banana city.
No,

667
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:06,590
but I mean I did it started in Green
Bay and then I went to the trois.

668
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,980
And then how has the trois, my,
my former, uh, had a great time.

669
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,690
I was at the adjacent place.

670
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,710
Royal Oak Music venue.
Yeah.

671
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,320
And uh, crowds were amazing. So
cold in here. I need a hot beverage.

672
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,870
Yeah. That, that was a blast.

673
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:29,871
But then on Sunday I was with a j
Elvis Weinstein came with me and,

674
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,500
and then Lewis Lee who,
uh,

675
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:40,010
lives in Minneapolis came down and we
had brunch at this place called Shaws and

676
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:45,720
it was just delightful.
Nothing like a killer Brunch,

677
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:49,800
man. What did you have? I had
everything. I was off. Fuck the points.

678
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,300
Fuck the points. Yeah, he did it. Yeah.
Sunday morning. I'm like, um, Sunday.

679
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:56,310
Funday man,
here's the thing.

680
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,900
Ever since I've been a more
moderate and the focus eater,

681
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,480
even off the rails,
isn't that far off.

682
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,870
Yeah, I agree. Because you know, like
a, it's not going to feel that great.

683
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,250
That's the, yeah, the whole thing

684
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,070
want to like hurt myself. Right.
So I remember when of my way there,

685
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:19,040
I told Josh, I go, I said, dude, I'm
going deep in this shit today. Like, yeah.

686
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,020
And what does that mean for you?
Exactly? Going deep. Just A,

687
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:25,530
I'm going to have some sugar and
I'm going to have some carbs. I'm,

688
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,010
I'm not going to be like, what is,
what is that? I'm just going to eat it.

689
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:34,440
But pacifically what are the items
that you will order off the menu?

690
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,220
I love, you know, I'm a breakfast
maniac, so this is uh, the,

691
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:42,090
the Brunch is like a brunch buffet with
ton at this place. It was phenomenal.

692
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,570
So I just wanted to get like
a waffle waffle state too.

693
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:47,100
The cool thing is they
did many ones there.

694
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,160
Minis are the best.

695
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,150
That's the thing I learned is that it's
not even about having a crazy amount.

696
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:56,620
It's like getting that taste again.
Still want to make something. Well,

697
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:58,480
here's what puts a taste in my mind.

698
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,670
Here's what I would do with
the mini waffles is it,

699
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:04,150
get as many of those on your plate as
you can and then change up the situations

700
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:08,460
on all of them. Dude, you do like
chocolate and whipped cream on one. Yup.

701
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,080
And then you do your fruits on another.
Know what I'm saying?

702
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,120
You got some Nutella.

703
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,370
There I go. I have that. I have some,

704
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,450
some scraps had crab let, cause I
have a lot of as a seafood crab legs.

705
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,920
But I mean, you know, they give you
a, you know, a moderate portion. Yeah,

706
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,180
I had my little mini waffle,
some breakfast sausage. Yeah.

707
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,080
Um, I dunno, a couple of
others, like I said, gramps,

708
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:39,070
couple egg things and you're
just like, oh, I'm totally good.

709
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,170
So you feel like you, you had,
uh, you went off the rails,
but it wasn't that crazy.

710
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,830
You know?

711
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:49,260
And what I've learned too is that if I
go off the rails early in the day, yeah,

712
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,750
it's better.
I don't eat a lot at night.

713
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:57,190
I know I have this stuff I take after
I ate that. Does that work? I mean,

714
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:01,680
it's supposed to work and then I
asked, I exercise after too. Wow.

715
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,440
So you're good. So you do you balance.
Yeah. And then I do, you know,

716
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,120
I don't fuck around the rest of the week.

717
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,510
I don't like that you pick one day to go
off the rails and then you clean it up.

718
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,430
It was, otherwise you're going
to have problems, you know?

719
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,820
You know what I found too is that it's
not as fun to do the things I used to do.

720
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,870
Yeah. It's not as fun because I knew like,
I'm just going to get fucking fad. Yeah.

721
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,560
Not Worth it to get fat and shitty again.
Just cause I like eating.

722
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,760
I like drinking a lot of wine.

723
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,490
I've had to like really like curb all
that, you know, late night, evening,

724
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,480
start looking at sugar and things.
It blows your mind if you start,

725
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:46,210
if you start being sugar conscious,
it's really blows your mind.

726
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,970
Just because we were trying to make
these, uh, these Quito pancakes, um,

727
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,060
the Keto friendly ones,

728
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:57,530
and of course one of the components
that you have to get a sugar free syrup,

729
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,540
but it also has to not have,
so not only can it be,

730
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,160
it has to be sugar free.

731
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,910
It can't have the sweeteners that
affect you the way sugar does.

732
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,620
So it's a very specific brand.

733
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,630
So I was in whole farts and I asked
if they had it and they go, no,

734
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:15,910
we don't have it.
And just out of curiosity,

735
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,970
I picked up a regular maple syrup
and looked at the sugar grams.

736
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:25,090
You know, how many sugar grams are
in one serving. Dot. Get your life.

737
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:29,740
I can't even imagine. 53
grams. Yeah. That's like,

738
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,410
uh, more than a candy bar. It's more
like a snickers bar, Ryan. It's,

739
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:37,780
and then having a little bananas
stick to a serving of maple syrup.

740
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,360
First of all, whoever makes the servings
is fucking bullshit on any product ever.

741
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,920
Who just eats, ate potato chips or who
has it? I know spoon if, if they didn't,

742
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:51,460
if they didn't tell you that,
then the back of every level would terrify

743
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,360
half a serving is what that shit is
because sugar is the one that only up,

744
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,370
I think next year it changes for the
first time we're next to the grants.

745
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:06,370
That doesn't show you that the percentage
of the daily value you see sodium,

746
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:11,530
fat, protein, it shows you the
grams and then a percentage,

747
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,970
15% 25% sugar,
it'll say 53 grams,

748
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:17,920
no percentage.
And that's because of the sugar lobby,

749
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,880
but getting fucked and next year that's
neat when the business can fuck with

750
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:24,610
your health like that. So
yeah, there's a little bit,

751
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,900
just a tiny little bit. Yeah. And
if you don't watch your sugar,

752
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,380
that's right up like Bert or
you get the sugar beet is, yeah,

753
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,010
the B. This, um,

754
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,450
are you thinking of maybe
changing who you are?

755
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:50,150
[inaudible]

756
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,760
it's so good to know that my friends
have my back through anything.

757
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,890
It's just always good to
have that friend reassurance.

758
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,100
And especially for me it's like don't
talk to people outside of my group.

759
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:08,310
Well that's going on here.
Did you actually is one of
my ex specially vocal fry?

760
00:51:08,311 --> 00:51:12,680
Did you see what his um, his lower
third was where they call it the Kyron

761
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,260
and it says nasal alien.
Right, right. So Vinny,

762
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,400
no, that my friends have
my back through anything.

763
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,560
It's just always going to
have that friend reassurance.

764
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:25,410
And especially for me because I don't
talk to too many people outside of my car.

765
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,850
Do you order espresso? Of
course not. You know me at all.

766
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:34,130
We in him auto express, so I order, I uh,

767
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:38,520
I always give an extra stair to the
person that says, oh my God, me too.

768
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:41,310
I judged them so harsh. So we went
to the hotel and the lady was like,

769
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:46,050
this is your espresso machine. She checked
us in and I said, where's the machine?

770
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:51,210
An Espresso machine. I love when somebody
has poor grammar in front of one of us.

771
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:54,370
And then we ask them on to keep
saying it. You're going, yeah,

772
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,780
what can you make with this?
Just expresses,

773
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,060
um, but anyways, back to Vinny. Vinny,

774
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:08,360
he's doing some interesting things with
the look. The makeup is really intense.

775
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:13,361
It looks like maybe midway
through a performance of cats,

776
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,250
the musical, it's like
there's an a, there's a,

777
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,160
a costume change cause
there's very detailed and,

778
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:26,161
and very profound levels of black eye
makeup with it's not just black and like,

779
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:30,200
uh, um, it's,

780
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:35,201
it's kind of artistically applied so
that it looks like the eyes wrap further

781
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:40,170
back up along the temple. Well, I don't
know if you have another clip, but maybe,

782
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,410
oh, there's a, yeah,
there's a lot going on.

783
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:47,010
Me. I don't want to be that,
like that woman. I don't
want to be that muscular man.

784
00:52:47,011 --> 00:52:50,610
I just want to be this alien. I want
to be able to like turn people's heads.

785
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,900
I want you to be terrified me.

786
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:55,050
But I also want you to think I'm beautiful
because that's what I'm attracted to.

787
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:55,884
When people

788
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,340
see this.
This is interesting

789
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,280
why? It seems pretty common to me.
Just your everyday kind of guy.

790
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,430
The Psych Guy Space
Alien, Babe. I'm sorry.

791
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:15,440
I forgot your Pronoun. Your
space. This is, yeah. Oh,

792
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:18,440
what's your pronouns? Yeah, well
there's, there's a lot going on.

793
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,610
I want to terrify people though.

794
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,040
It almost makes me feel like this
person wants attention, but I wouldn't

795
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,150
know. I wouldn't stoop so
low as to what are you doing?

796
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,320
Wait, are you saying that this person,
hold on, let me get this straight.

797
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:37,590
You're saying that this person isn't
right in the head and they just want

798
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:42,540
attention even if it's negative attention.
What's Your Pronoun? Wait is out.

799
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,370
Is that what you're implying?
That this isn't,

800
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,460
we shouldn't support this young
person and and becoming a nasal alien,

801
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:54,120
a nasal alien. How dare
you? You're anal, anal,

802
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:57,700
your alien phobic right now I know
and I should be open to alien.

803
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,660
You should be open to
everything in this era of dairy.

804
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,680
Tell me what the gender of
an alien person will be like.

805
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:09,540
A question from
Sam's friend has a point.

806
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,140
The reason why I call myself
alien is because alien is
never associated with sex.

807
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:18,410
It's like genderless. It's sex less. Yeah.

808
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,130
And that's why I started saying alien.
Yeah.

809
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:24,720
I like that. You do? Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know.

810
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,800
I don't know if you'd like where
you were about to hear next though.

811
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,410
Cause this next part,
it's not a lot to like

812
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,970
I went in also to see if actually
I can do some of everything. Uh,

813
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,180
yeah. That, that was the
first thing. Genderless.

814
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:40,800
Really just have like enough and just
not have any sex for the rest of my life.

815
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,970
Like you can't even get like, it's like,
it's like there's nothing there like

816
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,563
a mannequin.

817
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,590
Just be like, Hey, hi. How are you?
What's your name? What's Your Pronoun?

818
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,220
Hey, will you remove
everything and leave a nub?

819
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:00,643
Maybe.

820
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,190
Maybe just a mental health
counseling would help.

821
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,040
Well it sounds like someone's
got a problem with their
PP. Some something happen.

822
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,690
There's,
there's some,

823
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:13,900
something's wrong and someone needs
to see a shrink before he removes his

824
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:15,480
genuine.
Why wait till after.

825
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,130
I do hope they have to go through some
kind of counseling before you remove your

826
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:25,510
genitals, Dick and balls off. I want it.
I want my nub, I want to be a space alien.

827
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,320
So I, I, I want to terrify people
for them having to be like, wow,

828
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,310
that's pretty attractive too.
It's a very complicated one.

829
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,820
Most trained psychologist
and they'd be like,

830
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,140
we're going to keep you here overnight.

831
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,730
And you were to start
this again in the morning.

832
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,850
Yeah, it's a lot. Uh,

833
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,690
this niche right here is about
a change to a world. I know.

834
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,880
It means a lot coming from, you know,
my friends are these creatures that the,

835
00:55:53,881 --> 00:55:57,450
I've handpicked and found in
different places in times in my life.

836
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,210
They're probably the realest people
I know out of everyone I met,

837
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:01,770
which speaks of volumes.

838
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:06,810
What show is this? Um, I'm not
sure. It's on e it's on e I.

839
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:11,640
F I think it's like botched
plastic surgery dudes. I know,

840
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:15,880
I know he was on that show. Sorry, I
dunno. Somehow I came down botched. Yeah,

841
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,000
it is what it is. Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,590
So I think this may have been on the your
mom's house face book group page where

843
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:22,760
this originated from.

844
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,840
And then I went down this rabbit hole
of this guy's videos and it turns out he

845
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:31,750
has been transitioning into
an alien since he was like 16.

846
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:32,584
Like he's,

847
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,090
he's always hated himself and the
way he looks and he really, really,

848
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:41,380
really wants to be, and he looks even
crazier now. Like that's narrative now.

849
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,610
He black, he blacks out his
eyes so that they're all black.

850
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,970
It's fucking terrifying dude.
You hear the similarities though,

851
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,700
between Zeeman,
Garth.

852
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,080
Yeah. I like that. I like that.

853
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,380
I like that.
I like that

854
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,030
pink haired Lady. It's funny. I like
that though. I really like that.

855
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:07,410
Uh,

856
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:12,300
so I've been following Garth on
Instagram and the g g sorry. Yeah.

857
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,110
And they've been teaching him,
he's been doing those, uh,

858
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,010
videos that are only up for like the day,
like those,

859
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,760
what do they call the snapchats?
Yeah, basically on Instagram.

860
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,550
And they taught you start.
Yeah.

861
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:26,880
And they've taught him
link in bio or swipe up.

862
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:32,580
So now he'll be like, um, um, first it's
the fake. Yeah. It's the fake smile.

863
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:36,390
Like, hi, I'm here right now.

864
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:41,730
I'm at south by southwest,
swap up, swap up. Like,

865
00:57:41,731 --> 00:57:46,380
he's so bad at it. It's so great. I was
watching him today just like cringing.

866
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:50,010
He's so bad at it. Yeah. It's just
not as thing. You know, he, you know,

867
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:54,150
he's a successful singer. I get that
he entertains millions of people,

868
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,090
but the social media,
he needs like a coach.

869
00:57:57,091 --> 00:58:00,640
He needs someone to help him be more
natural at that stuff. Yeah, he does.

870
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,710
Because it's all about authenticity
on that medium. You know, it's like,

871
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,080
um, also I wanted to point out that, uh,

872
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,270
every week now after we do the podcast,

873
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,210
if you go to our Facebook page,

874
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,320
it's facebook.com/your
mom's house podcast.

875
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,170
We were doing a live video,

876
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,060
a studio m at studio m and a we,

877
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,510
you know, we talked to you
guys, we answer questions, uh,

878
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:32,370
because it's all about you. You keep
talking. You, y'all did it. Y'All did.

879
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,373
Y'All day.

880
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:38,670
[inaudible] so many maps.

881
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,260
Oh, there you go. Even the dog says,
yeah, he hair. She goes, thank you.

882
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:45,094
That's all.

883
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,610
So, um, so they're teaching
him to be like a real

884
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:54,680
yeah, they're, they're doing a makeover,
I think of his social media. Yeah.

885
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,760
And the Instagram's
getting a little better.

886
00:58:56,761 --> 00:59:00,720
Like he started to do more frequent
posts, but the snapchats, the,

887
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:04,650
your story parts, they're there. They
need work. Let's just put it that way.

888
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,870
Cause he, every time teaching the ultimate
Dad Boehner had seen there's nothing,

889
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,420
no better environment for a dad
boner. Then technology, you know,

890
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:18,040
they're all thumbs. They
don't so excitable. Yeah.

891
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,030
And the thing is too is like you can tell
somebody like, look at the guy. Oh God.

892
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,290
But you can tell someone's
like, okay, Garth and right.

893
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,720
Go cause then there's always a pause
before he starts his thing. Yeah.

894
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:34,480
I got real excited. He's
like, hey yeah, and waves.

895
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:38,210
Yeah. Hey guys. Oh, we're just
hanging out. Did he? Oh Gee.

896
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,060
I don't want to say what's up to
Bozeman, Montana. Yeah. Great time

897
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,920
going to blow your city. Excited about
that. Going to Shreveport, Louisiana.

898
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,180
Excited about that. You're like, you're
not excited about going to Sri port.

899
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,230
Shut out crap and energy when she has.

900
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:57,783
Okay,
dad.

901
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,710
Right.
We're at south by south.

902
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:05,450
I'm going to show you the one that's
made out of bamboo. Look at this night.

903
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,460
This has a really nice sound to,

904
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:14,430
this one is made by drying out the
bamboo poking holes through walls,

905
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,940
dividing sections that, oh
shit. Close that up yet.

906
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:21,630
Poking holes through all those kind
of putting the beans in. Got It.

907
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,560
And then the beans go from one
section to the next. No kidding.

908
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,460
Draping down and making it right.
Yeah.

909
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:32,420
That's the other thing I like about
this. It's boring, but he's also excited.

910
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,710
They gag Boehner. Slash. Board. Wow.
Right. You don't get that a lot crosses.

911
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,480
It crosses two worlds came together.
Borings

912
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,120
and dad like all on hold on your pants.

913
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,030
Are you going to come
and you're right. Oh Wow.

914
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,810
We hear it pretty nice. Huh?

915
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,481
Oh,
the other way.

916
01:00:55,481 --> 01:01:00,000
Now he showed it to you like it was
two tits like you think of the east.

917
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,600
Yeah. It was super stoked about you.
She'll go in the next room with you.

918
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:09,010
Thank you sir. But that he has to explain
to me how the rain stick work. I mean,

919
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:12,880
look, if you've been in a mall since
1990 you fucking seen these. Yeah.

920
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,330
It'd be a real idiot nights to know
how the rain stick fucking works. Yeah,

921
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:17,420
it has.

922
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:21,230
Keep it going and definitely if you use
the turning motion and explained earlier

923
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,520
and levering back and forth,
no shit.

924
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,810
Okay. Now you can try it the
other way. Wait a minute.

925
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:32,670
You made a ton of those.

926
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,520
Well of the beans go down that way.
No Shit.

927
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,500
Yeah,

928
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,030
you gotta be kidding me. He's like, yeah,

929
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:42,290
you can just keep doing that for days
that it won't stop making that noise.

930
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,760
Dad's been smoking dope. I think so.
Yeah. He's high. He's a dope dad.

931
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,800
Definitely.
I get home.

932
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,090
We've got a few on for days like
that. Oh Wow. I don't have to worry.

933
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,390
You won't drive your neighbor's
crazy with this instrument.

934
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:56,840
Okay.

935
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,510
I find even an answer. Is it
really an instrument? I mean,

936
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:03,110
who plays the rain stick? I
fucking guy guidance. He'll be,

937
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,050
he plays that hacky sack lifestyle.

938
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:10,880
The fucking guy kiss up. Thinking about
that space. Alien can, I now are fine,

939
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:11,810
but I was so attracted.

940
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,290
Okay.

941
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,600
Okay. Okay. Should
complete, what'd you rather?

942
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,933
Yeah.

943
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,940
What'd you
take a cruise?

944
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,470
You're sharing a room
with the anal finger.

945
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:30,060
Stinky butt hole lady
or the space alien kid.

946
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:34,050
You're in a fucking cruise
ship room for a week.

947
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,400
Um, you got to have meals together.
You do your shuffle board.

948
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:40,920
You're being go activities together.
You guys are together.

949
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:42,960
You're a couple for a
week on a cruise ship.

950
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,280
I think space aliens probably easier
to hang out with. I don't think so.

951
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,550
I think he is a vortex of
emotional need. Yeah, that's true.

952
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,560
He's going to rail age.
She's nasty.

953
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:59,190
She's like living with a Frat Guy,
but the alien guy,

954
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:01,770
he's going to drain you emotionally.
She's like,

955
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,310
come over and just sit on your
fucking face. And he's like a,

956
01:03:06,311 --> 01:03:09,660
an emo 13 year old girl.
Yeah, I guess you're right.

957
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,690
But I'm just thinking like what if the
whole time she's just like some of my

958
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,940
fingers smell it. Yeah.
But you've been to college.

959
01:03:14,941 --> 01:03:17,350
Isn't that what that is when
dudes hanging out, I guess,

960
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,850
is that what you and your
slap Dick Friends did all
the time? Smelling fingers,

961
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:24,540
lighting farts, guys
do. I thought, I dunno.

962
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:27,270
I just feel like it's more pervasive
with her. I think it's going to be,

963
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,630
there is no joke in it.
She's like fucking smell like shit.

964
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,100
Yes Karen. It smells
like shit. So my panties,

965
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,130
something like fresh shit does.

966
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,390
You're saying that you think
she's relentless with it?

967
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:45,960
Like she can't go to
another topic and then,

968
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:49,170
and then as the week progressed
she's like stay for with no shower.

969
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,060
Nasty and you're like,
yeah,

970
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,030
and you guys are on a cruise ship
and it's like the Caribbean cruise,

971
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:58,050
so it's real sweaters and the
room's small. We got one of those.

972
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:01,680
We've got the inside room,
there's no balcony, no window.

973
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,260
Now the alien guy.

974
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:07,680
The problem is you're going to have to
walk around with him a lot and people are

975
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,120
going to be like,
what's up with those two?

976
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,000
And you're gonna have a lot of eyeballs
on you and he's going to make a big

977
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:16,110
spectacle of himself every time
he go eat somewhere. Oh My god,

978
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:19,140
why is everybody staring at me? And then
he's going to do that thing of like, God,

979
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:22,380
there's someone knowing God,
don't assume my pronoun.

980
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:27,000
He can get old person's death. Is that
a man or a woman? Let me, he'll be like,

981
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,920
I'm neither God is it so hard ass?
My Pronoun Bitch,

982
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,810
I'm a fucking nasal alien.

983
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,750
He's going to have a shirt made up
that says that the, of course bitch,

984
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,830
I'm a nasal alien and then he's going to,
it's going to be really embarrassing.

985
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:47,110
Whereas the asshole girl, she's not an
embarrassing on a public public. Yep.

986
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:50,940
She'll be, she'll be annoying in the
cabin but not in front of everybody else.

987
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:54,510
Yeah, we're in public. People will
walk by and go, oh, what does it smell?

988
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,560
Hassles stinks.
Horrible.

989
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,950
Oh I guess she would make me laugh more.

990
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,070
I think she would make me laugh cause he
kind of reminds you of your sister's on

991
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:09,330
ready. So it's like, so maybe
I would, but then again,

992
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,980
do I want to cruise with
my sisters for a week?

993
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:15,990
It'd be maybe,
can we make it a three day cruise?

994
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,700
Well, let's say if you had to
choose between two occupations,

995
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:26,701
one being you're the nasal alien and
you have to go through life trans

996
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:32,610
transitioning into an alien or your job
is to not shower and do those asshole

997
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,570
committee pretty good. You're
all, this is your skill,

998
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:39,840
thank you and Milo skill and my other,

999
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,790
would you rather champ
would you say thank you.

1000
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,120
It's your job and you
can still do comedy but

1001
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,480
these jobs might,
I would definitely do asshole videos,

1002
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:57,570
finger my asshole videos and them
over over becoming a nasal alien.

1003
01:05:57,971 --> 01:06:02,410
Of course. Well I feel like
the nasal alien, you just
have to wipe the makeup off.

1004
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,500
No,

1005
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:08,500
I'm saying I'm transitioning to be a
nasal alien that's going to occupy more of

1006
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:12,010
my time than you think.
That is such a full time Gig.

1007
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,370
Of course transitioning and he was like,
we have to give this guy a fucking show.

1008
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,320
They really should actually, I'd watch
that Guy Shell. It exists obviously.

1009
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:23,970
Just on, I thought that was
an episode about, Oh, I think
you're right. Okay. Yeah,

1010
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,470
no, this was a segment
to a, a different show.

1011
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:28,300
But that kid needs his own reality show.

1012
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:30,430
I'd love to watch what's
going on mentally there.

1013
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,700
Doctor drew needs to intervene.
This flickering light.

1014
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:41,000
Unreal. Ah, ah, ah.

1015
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,590
Wait a minute. So wait, what did
you, you decided on being the ass.

1016
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,300
Wait,
aren't you

1017
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,640
ruined my life,
but both will ruin your life.

1018
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:18,970
I'm trying to do a dental update and I
totally realize that you didn't explain.

1019
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:23,000
What do you mean it's going
to ruin your life? Both. Well,

1020
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,390
why would your asshole vids row in
your life? You know what's another one?

1021
01:07:26,391 --> 01:07:29,750
Both where people say like idea.

1022
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:34,330
Both idea. We'll say idea. God,

1023
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:39,350
that's fucking terrible. Okay. Um, I,
it'll ruin your life to do these assholes.

1024
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:42,950
That's why. Well, because I heard an
interview with Tara Patch or I can,

1025
01:07:42,951 --> 01:07:45,410
she made a great point. She's
like, if you want to do porn,

1026
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:49,940
be prepared for everybody in
your life to know your pastor,

1027
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:54,320
your Stepdad, your kids. You went to first
grade with everyone's gonna find out.

1028
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,220
So as a ruin your life though,
that wouldn't ruin your life.

1029
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,930
Your mother knowing that
she'd be like,

1030
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,250
you've always been nasty.

1031
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:10,430
What's the big deal?
You don't think your,

1032
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:15,490
you think your son wants to know
that his dad does asshole smelling

1033
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:20,300
videos. I think it's fine.
I think it's not a big deal.

1034
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,830
You don't think that's going
to mess up his school life and,

1035
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:26,700
and I mean I look the alien thing
is way worse or until you know,

1036
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:27,623
I think it's fine.

1037
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,760
It's just an asshole. You're
just, you're just being nasty.

1038
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,200
I wouldn't say it's quite like porn.
I mean it is.

1039
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:40,430
There was the one blurt out video where
she's clearly fingering her asshole.

1040
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,790
Yeah. So putting that out there
would be a little uncomfortable.

1041
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,780
Wait a minute.
But what about our marriage?

1042
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:48,450
Like I'm going to have to smell
your asshole. Why does it smell it?

1043
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,080
Cause I live with you. I sleep next to
you. Shine for days and days. Oh yeah.

1044
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:55,730
You'll get used to it though.
I don't want to get used to it.

1045
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:59,730
I know it's not desirable, but we signed
up for this. This is our life now.

1046
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:04,470
This is what we're doing. I guess it's
still better than being an alien. I, yeah,

1047
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,980
I take the asshole stuff over alien too.
It's not that weird.

1048
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:13,080
It's just like the gate.
It's just like the gays.

1049
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:16,200
The gays do the same thing,
you know? God Damn Dude.

1050
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,780
Um,
all right,

1051
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:23,610
so I was trying to read these
dental updates we got. Oh,

1052
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:27,240
I have one too. You do? Yeah,
of course. All right here

1053
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,590
can be back in the mood.

1054
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,770
All right.
Just wanted to give you a dental update.

1055
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:44,330
I recently went to the dentist after
not seeing one in almost 15 years.

1056
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:48,260
Holy Fuck. Last time I went
was when I was 12 oh my God.

1057
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:50,240
I had to get a baby tooth bold.

1058
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,760
The dentist forgot to give me Nova
came before we started pulling.

1059
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:54,750
Woo.

1060
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:59,510
Told me to stop whining when I told him
how bad it hurts. Oh my God. Since then,

1061
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:00,860
I've been terrified of the dentist.

1062
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,200
After listening to your
show for several years,

1063
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:08,330
I finally told my jeans up,
got my life and went to a dentist.

1064
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,340
Besides my teeth being all buttery
and needing a thorough cleaning,

1065
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,860
I had no cavities.
Alright.

1066
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,560
Thank you for your
constant dental shaming.

1067
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,580
It's just as a fact of
effective as fat shaming.

1068
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:27,680
Just like the gays Matt. Wonderful
Map. Yeah. Um, we have another one,

1069
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:28,730
but go ahead.
Go ahead.

1070
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,410
Big Update for me.
I'm getting my new crown this Thursday.

1071
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,150
Today's Tuesday.

1072
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,900
And it's been misery for the last two
weeks because I've had to chew on the left

1073
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,770
side of my mouth, which is when
they fucking tell you to do right.

1074
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,610
And now what happened was I got a piece
of meat stuck behind the temp crown.

1075
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:51,140
Oh God. And they tell you not to floss.
What do you do? But it was hurting.

1076
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:55,160
It was really hurting. And so, you know
what I said, fuck it. And I fought,

1077
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:57,690
I flossed and one was,
it sucked.

1078
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,260
It didn't pop up just a hour or two.

1079
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,130
I was like trying to get it out with my
fingers and then I just lost in it and

1080
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:05,680
it didn't pop off.
So I've been flossing.

1081
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,280
I have an idea. Yeah, go ahead.

1082
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:12,340
What about doing a video like the asshole
video lady about your teeth and how

1083
01:11:12,711 --> 01:11:14,130
you don't and

1084
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,500
you make a video like that. You
go like, Oh, I'm not going to fly.

1085
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:19,680
I haven't flossed in days.
I bet it smells real bad.

1086
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:26,590
You run your teeth, your finger
around your teeth. Got It. Thank you.

1087
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:31,050
Thank you. Why don't you like don't
want to do that? It's disgusting.

1088
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,670
I first of all, I can't go a day without
flossing. I think that's revolting.

1089
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:41,430
I don't want to do that. Yeah.
Okay. What would you rather do?

1090
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,870
The flossing video or the dirty
ass whole video. Of course,

1091
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:47,550
the flossing video.
Seriously,

1092
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,310
you would rather do the asshole video
because I would rather have a dirty ass

1093
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:56,040
hold on a dirty mouth. I get a finger it
and smell it. My ass was pretty clean.

1094
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:59,970
Dude. Are you hearing the nonsense
that you're spewing right now?

1095
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:05,040
My butthole because it's hairless. I,
because I bid day wash it every day.

1096
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,390
It's fine, dude. Like I could skip three
shower days because I have a day so much.

1097
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:09,870
Damn,

1098
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:13,920
I didn't realize you're fucking out of
your God damn fine and my bowel movements

1099
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:17,160
are pretty clean. They pinch right off.
There's not a lot of remnants right now.

1100
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,880
Just some air that comes out of
there and it's not real sweet.

1101
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,310
Like she was saying,
it's really,

1102
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:27,300
really bad and I think the idea that
you're trying to sell that you would do

1103
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,460
that over a dental video is crazy.

1104
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:34,530
You can taste all the time and when
I have a floss, I just feel dirty.

1105
01:12:34,531 --> 01:12:39,150
I don't think that you would finger your
asshole and then and then smell it for

1106
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,830
a while on video. Yes. No, you wouldn't
then do the flossing. You're lying.

1107
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:48,240
Why would I lie? The philosophy was so
disgusting. A minute, wait a minute.

1108
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:51,450
Didn't we just say that you shouldn't
shut on people for their preferences.

1109
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,040
I don't like to go camping.

1110
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,950
This is the same thing trying
to convince this one's dumb,

1111
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:01,910
Tommy being hurtful. Now
I think you should not be
hurtful smelling dirty floor.

1112
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:05,160
I'm like, God, you guys are so
disgusting grosser than smelling a shit.

1113
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,000
No one believes that.
What's not to believe in my mind.

1114
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:14,150
Fingering your ass home dirty food
over dirty plaque in your mouth.

1115
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:17,220
I'm just going to jump over to
the next one because this is so,

1116
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:19,230
but I'm not even done
with my dental updates.

1117
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:22,410
So I'm going to get a new
crown and then as a treat,

1118
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:26,520
I've decided to have my teeth whitened
at the dentist's office after my crowd.

1119
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:31,620
So when I come home next, oh no,
sorry. Thursday I'm at brand new crown.

1120
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:37,180
A zoomed out there because I realized
the one flaw and the Gel whitening when

1121
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:43,500
you do it yourself is that you can't
gauge how wide it's going to be like it

1122
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:47,880
sucks. It takes too long. Just fucking try
it this way and see if I like it. Good.

1123
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:52,820
Are you doing it the same when we went to
the same dentist? I like that guy. Yeah,

1124
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,190
I like him too. We'll see Dr
Farts. He's good. It's not a,

1125
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:59,440
here's another email. What's up? Mommies?

1126
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:02,250
I had to send a dental update after mommy.

1127
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:06,960
Tina talked about replacing her
badly fit crown. It's the worst time,

1128
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:10,620
eight twice a week.
Flosser thanks to the show twice a week,

1129
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,980
pump it up to once a day and then

1130
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,700
we'll talk. I put off getting a crown
over a root canal for over six years.

1131
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:21,250
Every cleaning my dentist would ask if
I wanted to spend 1500 on a crown and I

1132
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:25,090
would ask if it was necessary.
The answer was always, you know,

1133
01:14:25,091 --> 01:14:26,680
of course whenever you have the money.

1134
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,130
I never knew this was code
for fucking immediately.

1135
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:35,940
I recently went to a new dentist chain
called modern dentistry and it was the

1136
01:14:36,131 --> 01:14:41,020
shit I tried to put off the crown again
and they said the tooth was developing

1137
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,060
micro fractures.
Ooh,

1138
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,380
I said it was in a hurry and they
convinced me to stay with 20% off. Great.

1139
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,880
Promised a two hour crown. Oh,
oh it sounds. He numbed me up,

1140
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:56,380
ground the tooth down and scan the shape
with a three d scanner or the size of a

1141
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:01,000
toothbrush, the design, the crown,
the crown in the computer and Oh,

1142
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,360
they designed the,
the crown and the computer and they uh,

1143
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,930
they machine it in under 30 minutes.
I don't know what that means.

1144
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,990
They even did the general cleaning
while I waited on the crown. Oh my God.

1145
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,740
After installing it, they uh, they
show you an x ray of how well it went.

1146
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:17,650
I'm telling you this
shit is big time jeans.

1147
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:20,980
[inaudible] I know you probably trust
Steve Harvey's Dennis to keep your shit on

1148
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:25,270
fleek when you're squishing nasty molding
goo into your choppers and waiting two

1149
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:26,380
weeks for a phone.

1150
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,090
Remember that you can get
your life to not sure when,

1151
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:34,240
but you call that a listener for standing
up while wiping like a four year old

1152
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:38,650
man and I stand with them. Many parents
give up on teaching technique at four.

1153
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,160
We are so lucky to have you and
top dog to give higher titer,

1154
01:15:42,161 --> 01:15:44,050
wiping education to those less fortunate,

1155
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,550
keeping it in greasy and mom
[inaudible] thanks for that Steve Bro.

1156
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,470
Cheers Kyle.
[inaudible]

1157
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:54,160
well, Kyle, I wasn't even aware that
they could do a crown instantly.

1158
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:58,570
Modern dentistry. I know. I thought we
were going to somebody modern and I'm,

1159
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,300
I'm upset now that there was such
a thing that I could've done.

1160
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:05,650
I would've gladly, I hate waiting two
weeks to the temp. It's misery. Terrible.

1161
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,320
It's misery. Absolutely
terrible. But then again,

1162
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:12,490
my veneers that I had done really, really
nice, took about two weeks as well.

1163
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:17,050
And it was, it was well worth it because
the guy like hand crafted my teeth.

1164
01:16:17,051 --> 01:16:19,750
You know what I mean? Yeah. I
don't know. I don't fucking know.

1165
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,220
I don't fucking know.

1166
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,530
Um, it's been a minute. So what
do you say we revisit some, uh,

1167
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,940
new submissions of hi mommy thing. Oh,
I'm so excited. These are my favorites.

1168
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:32,290
There are a lot of fun.
Here we go

1169
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:39,010

1170
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,720
Thank [inaudible] guys,

You're welcome. What can I say? Ah,

1172
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,890
I think I'm going to go double
pipe classic and get a media Mocha.

1173
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

1174
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,450
You know my teeth or an a plus like toms,
but I can do that.

1175
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:03,250
[inaudible] I was a blessed. Yeah,
I could do that. Yes, please.

1176
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,330
Can I get do anything? Do
you want anything? You can
get me a small friends. Ah,

1177
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:10,700
yeah. I got a thing later with a
bunch of guys just hanging out.

1178
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,070
Totally nonsexual.
Um,

1179
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,950
could I get a small French Vanilla,

1180
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:23,570
Vanilla. That's it. For six days we
were milking. Thank you. Thank you.

1181
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,400
Wow. Really? Really.

1182
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:32,910
You know what I really liked about this
one is his calm demeanor key to it.

1183
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:37,770
I think he really was really ups the
value. Yeah. Stay calm. He was like,

1184
01:17:37,771 --> 01:17:42,120
Hey Hitler. And she was like,
hi, how's it going? Like,
yeah, really good, calm, calm.

1185
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:45,120
The stop that one.
And that makes it sound like it's normal.

1186
01:17:45,121 --> 01:17:46,900
And that's just natural conversation.
Yeah.

1187
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,340
I think this whole experiment really
has taught us how little other people

1188
01:17:50,341 --> 01:17:54,240
listen. He was really, he goes very
rarely do you get like, yeah, I'm sorry,

1189
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:57,870
what was that? A lot of times
just like response automated.

1190
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,540
That's Ian. Thanks Ian. Yeah,

1191
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:04,020
the one time we got pushed back is when
that girl went straight to the window

1192
01:18:04,021 --> 01:18:07,290
and was like, Hey, I'm just wondering,
would you ever date your mom? He was like,

1193
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,320
excuse me. He leaned out of the window.
He was like, what are you saying to me?

1194
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,243
Yeah.

1195
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,870
Sub Kane.

1196

bit of a dog Dick afternoon,

1197
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:24,200

But that's a whole of being.

1198
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:28,830
So I'm ready for you to give me the
grease here. Slashing the menu real quick.

1203
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,520
Gum and mustard.
Oh my God.

1204
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,440
He said only muster a yes.
I'm not sure. Anything else?

1205
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,700
And then I'm not seeing
it on the menu here.

1206

Yes. Alright. And then, let's see.

1210
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:20,470

more of a HBO property, right?

1257
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:12,920
They think they really go outside the box.
They're like really original stuff.

1258
01:22:12,921 --> 01:22:16,740
So God, Shit. Yeah. Fuck my stoma is, oh,

1259
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,730
old school reference. Yeah. I
don't even know. I know of that.

1260
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:23,210
I think that was someone that was having
sex with somebody that had a stoma.

1261
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:27,250
I think you were talking about
if I want to, I want to remember,

1262
01:22:27,251 --> 01:22:28,390
I'm not entirely sure,

1263
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:33,391
but I want to say we were talking about
what happens with people with those,

1264
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:39,430
um, and that you said, you
know, fuck my whatever.

1265
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:43,300
Fuck my stoma and then
that became a a drop. Yup.

1266
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,940
It's always nice. Yeah. People
catch you saying dumb shit. Yeah.

1267
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:52,480
It becomes a nice little sound, rob.
Yeah. I mean, here's a, of course,

1268
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,820
and that's fucked up. How I say that word
forever now Stan. Emma, I can't stop.

1269
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,700
I don't say it right. I have to uncross
the letters. Stand them up. Stand them up.

1270
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,080
Stand them off. I mean that, this,
we may be one of the all time,

1271
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,540
most well crafted. Yeah. Hey Man. Fuck
my stoma. There it is. It's old school.

1272
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,800
You can even hear the audio different.
Yeah. I mean he Mike's first mix.

1273
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:22,220
Fuck my stoma. You hear that? Yeah. The
differences, but at least I can hear him.

1274
01:23:22,221 --> 01:23:27,210
He just started a dynamic
microphone. The Evie, my guy, the Ebi

1275
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,110
did cardioid dynamic range.
Oh my God,

1276
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:37,120
that was the first boring video. Yeah.
You know, we should do like, I killed it,

1277
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,580
but we should do as, um, cause
we're almost here. But uh,

1278
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:45,160
we should do an episode where we just
go through the early soundboards and

1279
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:49,390
explain maybe some of the drops.
Yeah, sure. From the early years.

1280
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,800
I see people asking you about
references sometimes. Yeah. Uh,

1281
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,830
or just maybe take a little bit.
Yeah.

1282
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:02,470
Wow. What a talent. Thank
you. What a talent. Thank you.

1283
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:06,160
Thank you. Thank you. There's one more
here. You want to impress this one? Yeah.

1284
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:08,140
Yeah. Okay. Awesome fee.

1285
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:12,870
Many of those, let's say
his head whipped around,

1286
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:13,743
he was like,

1287
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:21,000
oh hi mommy. In a second. I'm just
glass on the menu here. You know,

1288
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:27,670
I can only see what's his high
end type on the corner there. No.

1289
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:33,350
F A r t am I knew I got a
coupon here for a double,

1290
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:38,070
like classic. Could you repeat
that? I got a coupon for the,

1291
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:40,380
the two quarter pounder meal.
Okay,

1292
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,890
I'll get that please. I know. Um,

1293
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:51,420
I don't want to be fat like burnt, so, you
know, I'll get a, uh, just a diet coke.

1294
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:57,180
No, you know, and that's
for the first one. Um,

1295
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:01,620
hang on. Where do you want my super
bowl please? Yes, it is. Yeah.

1296
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:05,250
And for the second, the second training,
uh, you know, we were just down in Boston,

1297
01:25:05,251 --> 01:25:08,430
see a Dj, dad mouth, you know, and
they had a monkey purples down there.

1298
01:25:08,431 --> 01:25:12,390
Do you guys have that to drink?
No. No. Let me know. Okay.

1299
01:25:12,391 --> 01:25:17,250
They must sound like a nonbinary menu, you
know? Uh, so for the other one, you know,

1300
01:25:17,251 --> 01:25:20,860
all those have probably a root
beer to drink, please. No. Okay.

1301
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,240
Second Window.
I think jeans.

1302
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,970
Wow. I love the Kayla and Michael. Great
job. I love the incorporation of a,

1303
01:25:31,971 --> 01:25:35,900
your act in the very beginning. And
then B, I like the, you know, I mean,

1304
01:25:35,901 --> 01:25:38,540
we haven't had somebody put in a, you know
what I mean? You know what I mean? Like,

1305
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,840
yeah. You know, I also, like he said,
I don't want to be fat like burnt bird.

1306
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,840
He didn't say like Bert. Right.
Subtle distinction. And I like that.

1307
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,890
Really good work. I liked the use of the
coupon. Yeah, very earnest and very, uh,

1308
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:54,980
good. Uh, a r t a very vulnerable
to incorporate the use of a coupon.

1309
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:59,980
Very sweet touch. Sure. Super impressed.
Yeah. Good stuff. As always guys.

1310
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,890
He's just killing it with these blocks.

1311
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:07,270
A R as a reminder that
the super soft Hoodie,

1312
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:12,140
Jean j e n a dream

1319

More details will be announced for that.
Uh,

1320
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:41,670
it's going to be coming up pretty soon,
so fucking weight.

1321
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:47,190
You can see her on the road getting ready
for it. Yeah. Thanks Jean. And yeah,

1322
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:47,930
that'd be great.

1323
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:50,630
By the way,
W can we mention that on this episode?

1324
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:54,770
Tom and I got dressed today without
seeing each other prior. Yeah,

1325
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:57,410
I came home after you so I didn't
even know what you're wearing.

1326
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:00,200
And we both ended up wearing
identical outfits today.

1327
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,540
Black hooded sweatshirt.

1328
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,990
You were in that a Chola la one.
Yeah,

1329
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,580
I'm wearing the Jamie Young Jamie.
Yeah.

1330
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,910
Powerful, powerful,
powerful sweatshirt. Um,

1331
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:18,110
which I bought by the way. Nice
support. Yeah. To support. Um,

1332
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:21,740
yeah. And we're wearing jeans.
You're wearing dad colored Jean.

1333
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:27,050
Let me justify these genes.
They need a little bit of justification.

1334
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,150
I don't, I normally don't
do light denim. Yeah.

1335
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,940
But these are specific nineties cuts.

1336
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,840
But I buy from the lucky brand online.
They don't sell them in the stores.

1337
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:38,930
They're called the little Maggie's honor.

1338
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:43,020
I think that these chains speak
for themselves and this, uh,

1339
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,720
attempt to make them seem
like they're acceptable.

1340
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:51,010
It should be dismissed. I let you
decide. You know what? I'm not,

1341
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:55,970
dudes can't wear a light denim.
I think girls can rock light denim boys.

1342
01:27:55,971 --> 01:28:00,890
It's not even cute. It's not even
cute, bro. The state rests, your honor.

1343
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:05,900
We believe that the evidence show,
let the record show,

1344
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,830
that's brown lock.

1345
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:11,360
We used to do brown lock where we
would uncover mysteries behind these

1346
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,130
mysteries. Can we talk
about, first of all,

1347
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,790
I'm surprised we didn't even get
there today. You took two shits today.

1348
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:21,060
Let's go through them. Um,
yeah. Well wait a minute.

1349
01:28:21,061 --> 01:28:23,940
How do you know about too?
Because this morning we were like,

1350
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:29,240
are you sure about that? Yeah, I did.
I did. I did, but it was, it was,

1351
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,830
it was on the way. Sorry. Cause
it was right before the shower.

1352
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,000
I got dressed and everything.
Yeah, we were talking,

1353
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:38,830
we were in the middle of a discussion.
Yeah. Like a business discussion. Yeah.

1354
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,820
And I love this.
My favorite thing that you do,

1355
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:44,540
like it's a pretty serious discussion and
then you just turn around and you walk

1356
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:48,860
away and you walk out. And I was like,
oh, hello. Yeah, we're not discussing.

1357
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:49,840
You're like,
I got to shit.

1358
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:54,710
Can you tell me you have to ship before
you turn her around and walk away.

1359
01:28:55,450 --> 01:29:00,410
Okay. Um, and then we were eating
lunch. Yeah. And I'm still eating.

1360
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:03,210
And you're like, I got a shit.
Oh, I really got to shit.

1361
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,160
It was like a little bit like,
ah, the second one, by the way,

1362
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,540
to say I gotta eat alone.
You had finished everything on the plane.

1363
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,770
Yes you did.

1364
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:18,220
I was getting a second round of food
you saw in the second round snack.

1365
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:21,420
Yeah, but it was just, I mean, come on.
It was a follow up like a little treat.

1366
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:24,990
It wasn't, this is what I'm
eating right now. Anyway.

1367
01:29:24,991 --> 01:29:26,460
I will always want to make the point.

1368
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,300
The second one was a lot sloppier
and messier. Let's talk about it.

1369
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:34,110
I'm trying to travel.
I made fitness.

1370
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,210
It was clean food. You know,
it was healthy food. There
was Kale, there was chicken.

1371
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:43,560
Yeah. Felt the far it's
coming. It's my new favorite,

1372
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,250
eh?
Eh,

1373
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,830
I like how she says that I was for,

1374
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:57,210
it might be the best one of those.
That's a real drawn out. When I like it.

1375
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,910
He know who I keep thinking about.
There's the come lady.

1376
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,160
I can't get her out of my mother
for some reason.

1377
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:12,000
She's been stuck in my mind.
Yeah. I've come all over my face.

1378
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:17,900
I think that her issue with men not
wanting to touch their comment and

1379
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,860
that is not an issue, is that you're
trying to say no, it was like when she,

1380
01:30:23,861 --> 01:30:25,220
when I thought she was just like a,

1381
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:28,770
an a lay person and then I find out she's
a professional sex worker. It's like,

1382
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:29,670
well yeah guys,

1383
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:34,520
you know are going to be weird to you that
they're calm and everything like this.

1384
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,200
Not a big deal. Right. What,

1385
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:40,920
what's not the big deal guys don't really
want to be that close to it. I don't,

1386
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:41,581
but then,

1387
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:45,720
but the problem is they expect her to
be into the com I think is her gripe.

1388
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:48,220
But then we'll never even
touch his own commerce

1389
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:54,660
so many times. She also, did you
hear her part of that where she said,

1390
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,670
or even taste his own,

1391
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:01,170
but like even when do you meet?

1392
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:05,430
When did any sensible reasonable guy
be like, I mean, yeah, I'll taste it.

1393
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:09,330
No one does that. No. But it also, and
here's my thing with it, it's like, well,

1394
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:14,310
if you're a sex worker, it's part
of the Gig that someone asks you,

1395
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:17,400
hey, will you swallow? I'm assuming
you negotiate ahead of a time,

1396
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:20,040
I guess what the sex, we're like, hey,
will you swallow my come? Yeah, sure.

1397
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:23,850
So you can't really complain
about it. Yeah. You shouldn't be.

1398
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:26,040
You know what I'm saying? Like,
it's a business transaction.

1399
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:30,360
If it doesn't have to just
come, you know, go on strike.

1400
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:35,670
I think we should go on strike
against, come, uh, come strike

1401
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:41,960
bold stance. But you know what I
mean? Like you can't, you can't, uh,

1402
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,440
fault the guy for not wanting to taste
his don't come if he's paying for your

1403
01:31:46,441 --> 01:31:48,510
services.
You know what I mean?

1404
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:52,260
Like that's his right to not want to eat
the calm because he's paying for you to

1405
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:53,310
do whatever.
It's like,

1406
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:57,900
now we're kind of making a leap on that
because I did see something that said

1407
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,720
escort for her. I don't want
a hundred percent. So let's
say, let's assume she is,

1408
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,630
let's just put that, we're making the
assumption that discussion. Yeah, I don't,

1409
01:32:04,631 --> 01:32:08,350
you know who knows what the real story
is, but if she is, it's like, okay,

1410
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:11,830
well it's not your place to judge.
The guys who don't want to eat their come.

1411
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:15,400
Most guys don't want to eat their
own comp. Most guys don't write.

1412
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:18,880
I've never known a guy who's been
like, I love it. I love the taste.

1413
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:23,280
Have you known anybody that
was like, I love? Not Openly.
I mean, I'm sure we know.

1414
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,770
We know somebody is eating their
come right now. As they're listening,

1415
01:32:26,771 --> 01:32:31,360
they're like, I'm going to
write an email and let's just,

1416
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,990
right. Yeah. I don't know a lot of,

1417
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:37,990
I mean obviously I'm sure there's a lot
of people that are, I'm sure into it,

1418
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,100
but into their own come,

1419
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:44,101
it's probably a smaller percentage
into your own Tj's interesting.

1420
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:48,220
You think that that's lesser than the
guy that's into other guys? Of course.

1421
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:50,910
Because that,
because that's not that.

1422
01:32:50,911 --> 01:32:55,720
I mean there's definitely guys
and girls that are into com.

1423
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,640
Yeah. Tasting it, swallowing it.

1424
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:00,940
Either there's thoughts
out that's not that crazy.

1425
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:05,580
To be into your own I think is
a bit more of a stretch. Yeah.

1426
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:09,700
Cause your own fluid in usually the,

1427
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:13,470
the thrill would be that it's
a belonging to a second party,

1428
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:15,850
nonsexual person.

1429
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:18,400
And I'm into things like pup play and
that's where we're supposed to get

1430
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:22,420
familiar with your own things. Yeah.
And it's not sexual, it's not sexual.

1431
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,480
It's good. Good point. It's just
science could always just do,

1432
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:27,210
I'm fucking come run,

1433
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,780
come on.
It never seems to get any less humiliated.

1434
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:37,150
Come run. In other words,
one big fucking Bull Lake.

1435
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,930
Of course though.
And I also know you're deep.

1436
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:46,930
Your fucking Dick back inside me where
I've still got reminds if your calm and

1437
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:51,460
then expect me to fucking suck off
my mind so I'll just finish up.

1438
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:55,060
Let me do the camera. Let me have
a shower. You jumped in the shower.

1439
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:58,150
Fuck me in the shower.
Clean each other in the shower.

1440
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,290
Electrical.
I love her.

1441
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:05,940
You know what I do love these
are lower class English girls,

1442
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:09,020
dare you. You know what I mean?
Like no, I don't know what you mean.

1443
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:13,680
Really dark are white trash is
far less charming. You know,

1444
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:17,790
our white trash girls are just not
as as charming as the English accent.

1445
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,260
Maybe it's the accent.
I mean,

1446
01:34:19,261 --> 01:34:23,790
I am assuming she's a bit trashy and
I'm assuming a class distinction here,

1447
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,160
but I do love these chaps or
whatever it is. A film in Oxford.

1448
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:33,580
She's a Cambridge,
the fellow in the shower.

1449
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:38,840
Yeah, she's talking about
her tutorials. All right.

1450
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:41,820
We've got to run as always.

1451
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,190
Thank you guys for listening to our show.

1452
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:47,430
A lot of heavy hitting topics today,

1453
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:51,720
but it was huge farts and
burps and bowel movements,

1454
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:55,200
knowing your fingers.
We're lucky in that.

1455
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,310
A super mature

1456
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:03,710
DJ boy butter. Oh, okay. One of my
favorites doing songs right now.

1457
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:07,600
I mean, he is killing it. He got us
the hottest guy in the game. Well he,

1458
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:11,450

gay song, then I can't stop playing.

1459
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:15,290
I mean, I play it on my phone
all the time. It's so good.
You know that song, right?

1460
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:18,210
How does it go? Um, I think here at I,

asked him when you did your mom

1465
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:42,950

I would hear my son.

1466
