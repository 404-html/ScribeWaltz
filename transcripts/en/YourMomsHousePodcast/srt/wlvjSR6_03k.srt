146
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,880
Every other third sentence in his
book it says that, yeah, it doesn't,

147
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,160
I tried reading and it just
doesn't really make a lot of sense.

148
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,910
It's not very cogent. It's like not
well written, but he would tell you,

149
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:33,750
cause you're a fucking mongoloid. Yeah,
I'm going to youtube fucker. Yeah.

150
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:37,290
And he also shoots on people watching
him on Youtube. Mongoloid is watching me.

151
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,440
Yeah. Here. Um, he's
just an old military guy

152
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,130
now. Apple have, you know this,

153
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:48,110
and I'm being sarcastic and I'm being
a cheeky, uh, the Sally and I, uh,

154
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:50,060
I've lived all over the world.
We used to live in Monte Carlo.

155
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,040
This is how they dress.

156
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,110
So if you're listening,
he's wearing like a velvet,

157
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,333
uh,

158
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,450
like dotted Tuxedo jacket without a
massive black bow tie and almost like a

159
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:10,820
floral patterned shirt
underneath it tightly.

160
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,140
Yeah. World. He, oh, he usually wears
a Tuxedo to class. He looks, it looks,

161
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,220
that's crazy.
Yeah.

162
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,950
The pigs, you know. Oh and I, uh,

163
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:24,960
I have lived all over the Woolies live
in Monte Carlo. This is how they dress

164
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,850
pigs, you know, and this is
my, this isn't even dressed up.

165
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,100
Okay. Yeah, yeah. No,
it's dressed up there.

166
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,050
That's how my dad used to
talk all the time. Everything
has to do with gene. Yeah.

167
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,790
Yeah. Jeans. Um,

168
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:46,770
I remember when I did my semester abroad
when I did Spain. Yeah. Their main thing,

169
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,980
they didn't really talk about
American behavior, you know,

170
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:53,980
cause a lot of kids were louder
and more obnoxious Americans

171
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,630
that went over.
They were always like,

172
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,440
we know an American cause you guys
dressed like shit. Shit. Yeah, it's true.

173
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:03,040
When I go back to Hungary to visit my
family, yeah. That's the first thing.

174
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:07,360
They talk shit to me like,
oh the fucking blue jeans and my parents,

175
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,600
both my parents, if you went
to the doctor, you dressed up,

176
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,560
you didn't wear a fucking genes.
Right, right. My Dad hates jeans. Yeah.

177
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:19,420
So does mine. Yeah. I hate,
well good genes don't like
jeans. I know. Doesn't either.

178
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,430
Okay. Just look sloppy. And I used
for years, he used to be like,

179
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,840
you got to shave that when I had
more just like scruff. Yeah, go.

180
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,510
No, let me just look scruffy scruff. Yeah.

181
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,160
I don't like it. And now he
likes her. He would say that too.

182
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,410
We're going to go to this
dinner. You can't wear jeans.
And he would get excited.

183
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,410
Kind of excited to say that.
No, you can't wear jeans.

184
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,070
How does he feel about your beard now?
I think it's so many years, I think.

185
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,150
And it's, it's bigger. So it's accepted
as part of, yeah, it looks good now.

186
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,690
Whoever that guy that fucked you
grew back nights is that his plan?

187
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,380
You think I'm going to give you a haircut
that in three weeks you're going to

188
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,180
love.
That's his formula.

189
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,450
It might be what are your next three weeks
looking at it because you're going to

190
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,284
look like shit.

191
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,090
You know what the irony of that horrible
thing happening is that you've been

192
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:14,650
performing in these enormous venues where
it's not that the audience is intimate

193
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,800
with you, you're up on
a huge screen. Right.

194
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,410
So people are looking really at your
face more than jumbotrons. Yeah,

195
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,230
like stadium size jumbo trons right.

196
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,530
So you're getting scrutinized more
now horse than ever before. Let me,

197
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,000
let me see what my love Dan has to say.

198
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,970
And I know you think that somehow designer
jeans, I don't know what that means.

199
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,260
I have some,
in fact,

200
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:39,230
how many got genes in the last four or
five years and my kids think it's a riot

201
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:42,470
when they see me in him.
Yeah, a designer jeans.

202
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:44,860
I guess it's because when they cost
seven, 800 bucks, I guess that's um, uh,

203
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,530
you know,
that's the definition designer.

204
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,330
Did you probably don't have to pay seven,
800 bucks from genes. But anyway, uh,

205
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,910
I hear at Costco you get James for 80
bucks or 80 year olds or 40 year olds.

206
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,050
I can't somehow, for some reason
women's jeans cost more than men.

207
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,763
Does anybody know why?

208
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,810
Because women are stupid.

209
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,990
Yeah. Keep it playing. I know.

210
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,163
Ain't know why?

211
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,840
Because women are stupid
and they'll pay more.

212
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,470
That's why there's less material
unless you got, you know,

213
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,090
some big fucking hog of a woman. But
the, uh, the mortar love I guess.

214
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,050
But, uh, I don't understand why
women's jeans, anybody on Youtube,

215
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,890
you little fucking wimps.
Uh,

216
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,410
email me and tell me why women Jane's
class more when there's less material.

217
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:41,790
Unless you've got a big hog.

218
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
He's such an old military dude.
Yeah. Yeah. His background is that,

219
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,980
so he just lives like he's still in
the military. His philosophy basically,

220
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,540
I'm going to say whatever I say
and you can go fuck yourself.

221
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,510
He believes it. I think
I believe that too. Yeah.

222
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,330
I think I might hold a similar
philosophy if you were more famous.

223
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:03,890
In other words,
if he was part of the mainstream,

224
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,080
it would be really funny to hear, you
know, these talking head news shows,

225
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,400
interviews you just said, and
he'd be like, fuck you. I wish,

226
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,060
I think that's why he's not more well
known. He just doesn't give a shit.

227
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,440
And that's not as refined as a a Tony
Robbins, let's say. Oh yeah, but he,

228
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:24,140
by the way, I watched, I haven't
finished that, that flicks thing.

229
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,990
[inaudible] he curses a lot
more than I thought he does.

230
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,560
And he says he does it to jar
people out of their everyday. Yeah.

231
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,530
But he's also got a refined,
and he's a good communicator,

232
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,810
refining refined message. And this
guy has done, unfortunately. Yes.

233
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,630
You a fucking hog. Like
Tony Rap. Yeah, no. Yeah.

234
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,440
Tony Robbins is more of a feel
good. He's kind of crazy. You know,

235
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:49,340
he's just an old military. He's kind
of nuts. Absolutely. Out of his mind.

236
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,390
He's absolutely, but he made
a ton of money. Most of it,

237
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:56,720
I think doing these
seminars. He has, uh, this,

238
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:01,460
this inflated a number floating around
out there, you know, I don't know.

239
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,450
What do you mean you don't know?

240
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,900
I know that he made a lot of money
as a CEO of some big company. Yeah.

241
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,090
And then he was fired as a CEO,
and the next day he started the seminar.

242
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,150
And I don't know what his actual value is.

243
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,970
I think the $50 billion
thing is when he was a CEO.

244
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,990
He made that much for this company. Right.
But I don't know if that's his actual,

245
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,470
you know what he's worth now?
I don't know. Yeah, I don't,

246
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,780
I don't definitely got money though.
I don't doubt that.

247
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,370
I don't doubt that he has money.

248
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,260
I don't think that he's
a worth $50 billion.

249
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,010
He's never, never been mentioned on any
of these. No. That's what I'm saying.

250
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:41,900
The $50 billion is when he was a CEO
of some company and he made that much

251
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:46,610
revenue for the company. But he personally
didn't do it for like his own company.

252
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,590
Right. Why? No, but so, but that leaves
in the question, what is that guy?

253
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,150
What is he worth? It's not out
there. I don't see it. Oh No.

254
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,340
He calls himself the $50
billion man. Whatever. We just
a couple of Youtube fucks.

255
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,620
Anyone you should listen to his podcast.

256
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,490
It's so funny cause he answers people's
questions. That's the whole thing.

257
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,630
And every answer is like, I dunno, it's on
my fucking website. You Fuck, look at it.

258
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,550
Tweet. Fuck it. Like
fuck it. I don't care.

259
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,650
So he's the worst podcast and the
audio quality's terrible. Good. Good.

260
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,953
Yeah.

261
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,820
I love it here.
You do by loves you.

262
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,290
But yeah, but in my case,
yeah, I love you, but I don't
want to have sex with you,

263
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,380
you know? And uh, and I just, I
could live just on lust, you know,

264
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:36,710
and I'm 70 so I mean,
but I love your youtube.

265
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,430
Okay.
Okay.

266
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,060
Hey,
Chinese got any Chinese shit to say?

267
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,830
All right. Dang. When Jane,

268
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,063

so he's,

270
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,240
Now there's a Chinese girl in this,
right? And he like shits on them.

271
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,440
He'll shut on you. It's just whatever
your race is. Yeah. And he's like, Hey,

272
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,700
Chinese got any Chinese shit to say.

273
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,790
Dang Wing Jing Ping. When
gene, he does that a lot. Yeah.

274
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,250
He just fucks with you like whatever
your race is, whatever your thing is,

275
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,110
he'll just fuck with you like they do in
the military. You know he doesn't care.

276
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,890
No, he definitely doesn't
care. Oh Man. And he out.

277
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,930
He talked about it before
on youtube where he's like,

278
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,980
you fucks can write in the comments.
I don't give a shit. Fuck you.

279
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:30,940
Like he doesn't care. He's like, I'm not
politically correct, but Chinese thing,

280
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,680
their access to soften this
clip earlier and then a girl,

281
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:38,430
a Chinese girl actually that's who
he's talking to you. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

282
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,830
And somehow for some reason
women's jeans, they, um,

283
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,860
so far are we supposed to
be watching it? Well, no.

284
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,410
So I'm expecting a fuck up then the
next day or two because it, it's gone.

285
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,360
I want to hear her talk on girl

286
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,290
and I haven't had to pivot yet.
So it's,

287
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:05,040
it's obvious are important because at
least somebody in the team and the way I

288
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:09,610
show up on Youtube, oh my God, I love you.

289
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:11,280
You too. Bye. Love you. This is a,

290
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,280
but in my it misunderstanding,

291
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,410
I'm just asking if you have any comments

292
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,450
and you're, he's got any Chinese
shit to say. Dang. When Jane,

293
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,440
uh, please say it again. Slowly.

294
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,830
That's a Chinese girl.

295
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,870
He says that to their fence
normal and there's like,

296
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,890
I saw one clip with like a Chinese dude
and he's like, I could change John.

297
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,980
Ding Dong. What do you
have to say? It's like,

298
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,710
actually I have a question like he did.
They don't care.

299
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:55,760
They're used to it right there.
It was that a retarded person could,

300
00:19:55,761 --> 00:20:00,180
you said you have a question. Is that
what you're meant to do? Chinese retarded.

301
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,650
I'm a huge damn pain your family. I
just, I can't get enough of this guy.

302
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,010
It's hard not to be or not to be.
You know what he really preaches though.

303
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,370
I'll tell you what the, if you
distill it and I've read his website,

304
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,880
I've read everything.
Yeah.

305
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,100
He really breaks down
people sense of fear. Um,

306
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,050
his whole thing is like,

307
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:26,130
do one thing a day that scares you
because if you break down people's fear,

308
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,600
you break down the fear of failure.

309
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:32,070
And the fear of success and you'll
do whatever the fuck it takes to be

310
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:35,400
successful space. So that's
what he's doing. He's like,
stop being a fucking pussy.

311
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:39,570
Just do it asshole. You know,
who cares whatever you are.
Chinese, a woman, whatever.

312
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,830
Like he actually does like women. He
said that he, he refers to like, um,

313
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,070
female CEO's the crater of
Victoria secret. That woman in

314
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,940
some other video I saw like he,
he gets it, but you know, yeah.

315
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,680
Whatever it is hard. Dang. Dang.

316
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,700
Dang. Dang. Dang.

317
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,093
Dang.
Dang.

318
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,710
It's one of the best songs you've
ever had made. Ching Chong. Yeah.

319
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,240
I think there's a good one that
came in from Jenna. Oh yeah,

320
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,170
she submitted one. We played this on
patriotic, but we put that shit down.

321
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,770
Overlooked it for your mom's house and
we know it came in after it came in

322
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:26,250
afterwards episode. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Um, yeah.

323
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,190
Let's see. It was all types. We,

324
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,200
we never fully get to explore all the
great music you guys send in cause you do

325
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:38,200
send an incredible music
and um, yeah, this,

326
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,410
this latest one was from
Jenna, is that her name?

327
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,600
Jenna, Jenna. It's water
champ song. It's really good.

328
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,720
Yeah,
she did the thing that I think uh,

329
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,860
um,

330
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,520
ob one did once was that
she pieced together things.

331
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:04,930
Setting conversation, right.
To make it flow like a slog.
Actual things we've said.

332
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,880
Yeah. Jenna. Uh,

333
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,430
uh, this song is called Watergate.
You want to hear it? Yeah,

334
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I'm standing there and I smell what
smells like somebody just dumped an entire

335
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,500
container of coffee in the shower like
somebody took, I don't know what that is.

336
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,350
Okay.

337
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,450
Like do you think you could
drink water today? Dad

338
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,410
always been a big water
drinker. Oh, bull shit.

339
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,350
I have your P is like Brown.

340
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,640
We should measure who drinks more
water in a day. I do in a second.

341
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,990
I think it's me more than two to one.
Why don't we do a water challenge?

342
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm fucking challenge you right
now, Bro. Okay. Okay. Let's do this.

343
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,790
It's so ridiculous. That's
ridiculous. Accurate. Not even close.

344
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,330
I drink so much water and after set.
Yeah,

345
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,140
I'll let you get off stage. She was
taking, he's like a little baby.

346
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:09,820
So I think what's your
water intake funds all day?

347
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,200
We have a new logo that just
says, Tom, the water champion.

348
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,950
I may shoot flowing your age to know
and they can see the manipulation.

349
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,630
You could never drink as much water.
There's online support. Instagram,

350
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,100
Twitter with Tom is the best done a big
fat liar. Here's the evidence to wait.

351
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,640
Remember? Wow. That is so false.

352
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,210
Hello Yana.
That wasn't a lie.

353
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:34,230
That was just misinformation and the
truth is more Stonewater all talk.

354
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,330
No hydration. It's a marathon. You're
sprinting. Big, stupid, stinky, dumb bear.

355
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
Lot of water,
no drinking.

356
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,770
I'm the tortoise and the hare
while on the road performing too.

357
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,250
You hydrate with club soda. I drink
more water than you. You're a Bush jr.

358
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,920
This is Florida.
Who gets the Sparklets in the house?

359
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,670
Who makes sure that shows up?
Where's your water? A mug.

360
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,740
A tiny little shitty cup of tea.

361
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:01,280
Drink less frequently because
you're dehydrated severely.

362
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,190
Those of us that hydrate properly hydrate.

363
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,020
People want to hear that.
It's so you drink like an animal.

364
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,190
This is all for the cameras.

365
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:16,430
You know that he never does this when the
cameras are off, your honor, your honor.

366
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,780
For me to the fucking pint and it's
sit for you. That's a sip for me.

367
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,900
That's the point is I'm the one, I think
this is where the confusion comes from.

368
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:27,420
Probably had like $70 this week. You're
not drinking enough water. Sorry Tina.

369
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,160
You need to work on your concession
speech and water champion.

370
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,490
You're going to happen. Is that
the truth will come out eventually.

371
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,480
It's a long race. I sit all day. If
we can contextualize that properly.

372
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,230
You're such an imposter corridors
of water in his house. Your honor.

373
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,380
If Tom had enough water,
he wouldn't be Dj dad mouth.

374
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,260
Do you know why you're a fucking loser?
You drink water with losers.

375
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,880
Please go fuck yourself.
Stupid fucking Twitter followers.

376
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,140
Microscopic sips of water. Look at
the physical evidence. Your honor.

377
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,140
Time will tell you. Do your sprints
and I'm in for the long haul. Bitch,

378
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:00,974
the tortoise wins.

379
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,553
Okay.

380
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,220
Is the SIP chain Gavi? Yes.
Beer. Oh and bounce off.

381
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,210
It looks like melted lies.
Propaganda. I am prevailing.

382
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,620
I drink more water than you do you
think so? You're the water winter.

383
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:22,270
In the same sense if I were to play, you
know, basketball with our son. Right.

384
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,970
And I'd be like, you're the winter
too. I think you agree with them. No,

385
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm not even sorry mommy. Tina, you can't
win against natural talent like that.

386
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,110
So mad because I burned you so
good there, right? You talked to,

387
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,250
but you talk stupid. I just knocked
down to a sippy cup like it was nothing.

388
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,443
That is nothing.

389
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,270
Okay.

390
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,740
Wow. Oh, that's so good. It's
called Watergate Emami desk track.

391
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,580
And just so you know Tom. Yeah. Are
you listening to me? Yeah. And lifting.

392
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,980
The reports are in from San
Jose. I have my eyes on. Yeah,

393
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,400
a lot of Twitter people letting me
know. Yeah, you did not drink water.

394
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:04,170
He did not hydrate at all during your
San Jose said thank you. Wanti minutes.

395
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,680
Yeah. But yeah, I'm sorry.
Did you guys hear that?

396
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,820
He just goes, this is 20 minutes. Yeah,
but if you're a real water champion,

397
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,020
constantly hydrate.

398
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,710
And those of you that saw me in Seattle
in PDX will know that I had a special

399
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:21,350
dress made to contain
to Fiji water tonight.

400
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,060
Walked out on stage both nights
and I drank. No you didn't.

401
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,650
I sure did both feet,

402
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,060
but I brought them out cause I had my
primary water and then my backup water.

403
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,440
How much I hydrate the showmanship.
Oh Wow. And performance. What?

404
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,960
It pours your water, right? You're
sort of the, where's your water?

405
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,360
Donald Trump of the Watergate.
You're like, Oh, you talk a big game.

406
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,040
You got

407
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,720
all these stories. I say you don't
drink a lot. You got wrong, wrong,

408
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,090
wrong. No it never did that. Tom, where's
your water right now? Water Champ.

409
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,130
I drank this already and I put
regular water into this. Can show me.

410
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,220
Show me the regular water in there.
How do I show it?

411
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,930
Let me see it. Let me taste it.
Is their regular water in there.

412
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:09,150
Let me taste it and pour it into where
him and let me taste it so that I can

413
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:10,710
verify that you're finding you got yours.

414
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,220
Let me taste your regular
water and Lacroix can,

415
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,050
it's quiet and I uh, I'm drinking it.
It's mine. You have your own. Okay.

416
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,810
Just so you guys see the people watching.

417
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,030
I have a full huge cup of water and he has
no water on the table. Thank you. Yeah.

418
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,310
Yeah. I rest my case. Thank
you for keeping these reports.
Uh, keep them coming in.

419
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,360
Guys. Let me know. And every city, Tom's
in, whether or not he's hydrating onstage.

420
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,690
Guys, thanks. Wait, wait.

421
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:44,640
Told you get the report from Charlotte
or Manfred disco where I'm up there an

422
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:46,950
hour and they're gonna be like, Holy
Shit, they drink three gallons of water.

423
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,770

429
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,010
Well from the 80s, he used to have
rubber bands and shit and his beard.

430
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:19,550
Remember that?
I remember the Cindy Lopper in that video.

431

message. Hello. Salamay how are you?

440
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,930
I wanted to tell you someone I
wanted someone I wanted to know.

441

442
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,070

we thought she did and she goes, shut up.

443
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,540
You have to go. But she talking to someone
that erupted her. She's a solid man.

444
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm sorry. This person calls me
sometimes. Then they wrote this part.

445
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,880
Falling part is unintelligible.

446
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:33,510
She mumbled something about the person
who interrupted her. Then she said,

447
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:37,680
I eat normal. A regular normal. I know.
Anyway, thank you for your talk salad.

448
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,170
My dear. This is my home number.
You can call me to talk to me. Bye.

449
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,400
Less from Pierre [inaudible] and uh,

450
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,000

bunch of the earlier ones,

451
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,640
um, on, what's it called on uh, Instagram.

452
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,630

slam on? He wrote to me
basically. Yeah, the same thing.

453
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,090
Thanks for the talk. She'll
shut up, go away to the person.

454
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,690
Uh, he says, I've been eating a normal,
I don't eat nonfat stuff. Just regular,

455
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,000
regular, regular. How funny. Yeah.

456
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,640
What is going on? So she's got some
dietary discussions, some squirrel,

457
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,620
and she's thanking solve
me for consulting with her.

458
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,330
They are still doesn't know her number.
Still doesn't have a clue. I know.

459
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,520
I'm just excited that the voicemails
have kept like they're coming again now.

460
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:35,020
I started and now I'm feeling bad for
the color that she doesn't connect with

461
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:38,620
Sallie Mae as much as she wants it
sometimes. She's really nice to sell them.

462
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:41,650
Me Tell him he doesn't even know
how much this lady cares about her.

463
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,510
I know she's always thanking her. I
know. What if settlement is like, God,

464
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,560
she's so ungrateful.

465
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:51,700
I gave her all this great dieting
advice and she never said anything.

466
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:55,060
I told her to put bags in the trees
for the squirrel. I never heard back.

467
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,770
Sallam he was like this
fucking bitch. Yeah. Um,

468
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,890
speaking of ladies who speak aggressively,
you want to see something

469
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,870
this time we're going to say my name.

470
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,690
So you guys don't know that I have
a different name. So are we going,

471
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,140

472
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,920
A R r o y o dash.

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,750
G. U. Z. M. A. N. Okay. You

474
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,160
Okay. Overall your city council
thing. Yeah. Yeah. They,

475
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,780
they put these on TV,

476
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,590
see span or public access and the,
it's the town meeting.

477
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,250
Someone can be on, you know,
there's no, there's a pothole on my,

478
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,520
so Maria used to go, I keep going, keep,

479
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,190
keep driving through it or was she
going to do something there? She uh,

480
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,850
she's all kinds of crazy.
That's like,

481
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,740
no,
my brother was here checking you guys out.

482
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,600
So it was my uncles do you know you have
scratchy toilet paper and he really got

483
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:03,950
treated bad. So you know what he said,
you go buy them some toilet paper,

484
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,380
get everybody to start
bringing toilet paper in.

485
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,250
This is at the city council meeting.
This is her beef.

486
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:16,960
She just busted out a four pack of
Angel Soft, which is a good brand.

487
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,520
But I thought she was going to be like,

488
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:22,960
you guys poison the water and my brother
drank it and died of lead poisoning.

489
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,160
But no toilet paper

490
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,030
because you know what? Let's, let's
do some, let's clear up some things.

491
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,270
I have two boots,
not six.

492
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,740
I have six bucks because when you guys
are talking about me, you have no idea.

493
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:36,574
Who knows me.

494
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,970
Um,
I had twins.

495
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,630
See that young man back there.
That is investigator Schaffer.

496
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Badge number 1193 clap for him because
he protects you guys from people like me.

497
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,280
You know the people you screw over.

498
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,110
Why does she have two boobs
but six buckets? I don't,

499
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,730
she's talking about like her relatives.
Like I have six people behind.

500
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:06,110
Like if there's yeah, my back. But I got,
I got to you don't have six tits though.

501
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,583
No,

502
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,020
but you guys caused the depth
of somebody who should have net.

503
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:12,930
Oh Hey wait a minute.
Women,

504
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,290
I got marbles here because who in their
right mind ever thought it was okay to

505
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:21,180
put a concrete company 50
feet from a family home?

506
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,430
What are the marbles do?
Oh No,

507
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,840
Carl, you got me my transcripts yet.
There's six hours of them. You got them.

508
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,740
I put it in writing. Notarize certified.
That document. Where are they at?

509
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,700
I asked you a year ago for them.
What? You just think I'm stupid.

510
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,680
You guys have no idea who I am.

511
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't know what she wants. She's
been wheel Oh, just a little.

512
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,423
You do think she is?

513
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,560
I mean,
I'm going to ask you just fire it up.

514
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,040
Unless these are select clips from a
bigger piece that we're not seeing.

515
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,460
All the information is just,

516
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,280
she's got the marbles,
the toilet paper,

517
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,150
six butts to tits and
a private investigator.

518
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,440
It sounds a little paranoid.

519
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,540
Come over and look at antelope project.
How come that's fallen down already?

520
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,890
Go look at Harris Bridge.
I got a funny look and Harris Bridge.

521
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:15,880
Why do you already have structural damage?
Because you can't put crappy,

522
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,220
crappy material in the concrete.

523
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,460
But you guys let it all
happen and so you know what?

524
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm going to be here every single time
there's a meeting. Cause guess what?

525
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:26,800
We're going public,
aren't we?

526
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:27,870
Okay.

527
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,200
How much of a bomber or would it be if
every time you're on city council and you

528
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:35,010
have one of these meetings, you see
her in the, in the seat, you're like,

529
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:37,350
God dammit. I know. What did she,

530
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:41,510
did she bring like a fucking a
fishing knife today? I know. Yeah,

531
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,640
but I got a feeling these
city council meetings,

532
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,920
this is the majority of
who shows up. Yeah. Oh,

533
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,960
like lunatics because who the
fuck goes to these like, yeah,

534
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,790
just crazy people with nothing
better to do. Right. Like you would,

535
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,270
you and I would never have time cause
we're too busy leading normal lives.

536
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,213
You know what I'm saying?

537
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,070
Well,
you know what I'm supposed to do.

538
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,060
I was supposed to give Roger Fire
Guard some panties. Got In pink.

539
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,390
I won't say what goes with pink.
These are for Mickey Esposito.

540
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:12,620
Since everybody's panties getting a wad
when I come up here. So send them to her.

541
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,454
Okay.

542
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,660
Wow. I like that she went
shopping for this appearance.

543
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,270
Yeah.
This reminds me of my mom.

544
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,740
My mom had a problems with everybody like
that. That's, that is she would have um,

545
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,370
gone to something like this. Yeah. If
my mom had a beef with the city, yes.

546
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,010
If that would have been her target of
choice versus like my Stepdad and um,

547
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,190
a few other things on the Internet.
Yeah. I feel like could have like,

548
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,150
I kind of wish she had this outlet.
Yeah.

549
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,820
I feel like this is
really good for this one.

550
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,310
Do you think your mother would have
led out four letter words? Maybe? Yeah.

551
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,640
Oh yeah. I'm calling them Edwards and
you fucking these up piece of shit.

552
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:53,980
Fuck you. You fucking cunts. She
loved to call people. Consequently,

553
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,120
I never heard an n word. Really? I only
had a few meetings with your money. Yeah.

554
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,050
You needed to come around
a little more. Oh, really?

555
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,750
Went to clean out her apartment.

556
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,640
There was a black security guard lady
there and I was talking to her and uh,

557
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,340
and, and she goes, yeah, I
know your mom eat it. He was
quite a character. She goes,

558
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,470
uh, you know, she was always nice to me.

559
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:19,920
She never called me a nigger and I
was like, I'm sorry. She was like,

560
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,830
she called other people that but not me.
So you know,

561
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,750
that is a nice testament to
my mother's a manners. Wow.

562
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,850
She called her and she called the front
desk lady at con. My mom tell, yeah,

563
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:37,110
you dropped a big word, but it was
in the context of a story. Yeah.

564
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,780
Yeah. This woman's clearly paranoid and
angry and yeah, it's pretty great though.

565
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,120
She seems together, which
is misleading. Right.

566
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:49,310
And like she doesn't look that crazy
together. Might be the wrong word. Yeah.

567
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,090
She bought panties, toilet
paper. And what else?

568
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:58,400
She brought one more thing with her.
She had marbles. Marble. Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,170
Panties for a man. Pink
panties for men. Yes. Yeah.

570
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,270
So there's a lot of victimization.

571
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:11,230
Did you see me in a book? Not a
porn book either as a Cindy. Okay.

572
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,920
I made a lot of money in
a book and guess what?

573
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,340
My Dad called it dental floss.
And guess what I did with it.

574
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,910
I put it away for something like
this and I made a lot of money.

575
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,870
There's a lot of men has that book.

576
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,540
Uh, yeah. What she needs to meds. Yeah.

577
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,530
She didn't take her shit today. Well,
I have not seen, shouldn't take a mets.

578
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,130
I'd only seen the first clip before
this, but this is the, the clothes.

579
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,750
You already see the clothes.
Oh, what's her clothes there?

580
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:42,960
I can't imagine it gets better

581
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,470
and so you're not in my city.
I looks pretty good now.

582
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:52,960
I'm fat as a cow now.
Remember I have six buckets,

583
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,200
not six boobs.
All right.

584
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,880
All right. That's it. Yeah. My mom would
say things like that too. We were like,

585
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,870
wait, what do you mean I have six
bucks? Not Six boobs. Fuck you. Fuck.

586
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:07,350
You know what? My mom picked fights with
nuns to when I went to Catholic school,

587
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,820
fucking bitches. I'm like, okay,
you're picking fights with nuts.

588
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,700
You're crazy. Yeah. No, I
mean, I wish there had been,

589
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,990
that was so crazy and it's just,

590
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,610
it's too hard to follow because
we just really out of her mind,

591
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,080
you know, I wish I had a
little more focused, like I
don't know what she's after.

592
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,370
Well, AH, yeah. That's the thing is
that when there are that spun out,

593
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,040
they're really sick.
Citing a thing

594
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,640
that could have been like what?
Her beat her prime, right? Yeah.

595
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,250
Usually it's that someone's out,

596
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,110
it sounds like she's thinking
that they're all out against her.

597
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,880
I think the private investigator
stuff, like that's another layer. She,

598
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:51,820
she's being persecuted by all of them.
And the concrete company.

599
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,440
I got to tell you this, so last night.
Yes, sure. So I was in, um, San Jose.

600
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,590
Yes. The odd ball tour. Yes. And

601
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,790
we ride up from the hotel.
It's Swardson,

602
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,520
Diaz and I. Right. And
they're just driving us.

603
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:10,100
Everybody else has their own trends. You
know, people would come different ways.

604
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:15,460
So, but when we want to go back a ds,
and I want to go back at intermission is,

605
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,340
it's just he and I,

606
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,480
so as a driver who works for live nation
and Diaz and me as we get in the car,

607
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:24,440
at first we're just talking about this,
talking about that. And then, you know,

608
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:28,520
sometimes when you're on particularly
longer drives highway drives,

609
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,270
there's just moments where it kind of
goes quiet and you feel the feel of the

610
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,590
highway beneath the,
the tires kind of has that rhythm.

611
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,390
It's kind of peaceful. Yeah. To
do. Yeah. To do at night. You know,

612
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:47,990
you see sometimes you could see
stars are like the way that the,

613
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,040
the highways lit up. Right. There's
kind of a tranquility to it. Yeah.

614
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,350
And we hit that moment. There's no radio
on, so you're just hearing the truth.

615
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,690
I'm staring out the window and that
silence lasts about 15 seconds or so.

616
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,050
And then Joey goes,

617
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,650
I would tell you about the
time I saw a guy's stomach

618
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,250
put on the tenderloin,
1979

619
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,460
I go, no. And I see the
driver's eyes in the rear view.

620
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,560
Like he goes like, oh yeah, it was
cut open from side to side. Yeah.

621
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,370
His blood was brown. It, that's how
long he'd had been bleeding out.

622
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,480
People just stepped over him. Oh
my God, what a fucking up that guy.

623
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,450
It was a crazy time. So
those days I was like, yeah.

624
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,580
And I just keep looking at the
driver and he's like, oh yeah,

625
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:40,780
guys stab each other.

626
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,430
Starting knife fights other than
know what the fuck is going on?

627
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,780
Running the other way, guys just
stabbing each other crazy shit back then.

628
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,440
That's just from a dead silence.
Yeah.

629
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,670
Joey really has a net for
those moments. Yeah, man.

630
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,380
It's amazing what a life it is. A
magazine had a crazy life, Huh? Yeah.

631
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,300
He says a lot of funny shit.
So much of it is not even repeatable.

632
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:08,200
Even in the context of our
show, I wouldn't be able
to set it up. Right, right.

633
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,070
Yeah. He's so outrageous. Yeah. He's not
even outrageous. It's just like you can't,

634
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,400
I don't even know. I don't even know
how to prepare someone for it. Hey,

635
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,850
literally have to experience it.
He's out of his mind.

636
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,000
T do you know who McGruff the
crime dog is? Course doesn't.

637
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:26,770
Joey Diaz kind of sound like him? Um, I
don't remember her bite out of crime. Oh,

638
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:28,900
right. Um, I think,

639
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:33,560
I feel like McGruff the crime dog
is Joey Diaz and you be right.

640
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,823
Could be,

641
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,560
uh, that's Jenny. Jenny's dad.

642
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,080
If he could send it that car and
maybe the last time you'll see Jenny.

643
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,100
Oh my rough.
The crime dog.

644
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,330
He knows kids every day
in his country disappear.

645
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,120
Oh my God,
I'm running runaway,

646
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,310
but a lot are kidnapped by strangers
or even by people I know. So. Right.

647
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,380
The McGruff and teach our
kids to protect themselves.

648
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:05,020
Love the shop by picked up by that I
cry. I mean I could, I can hear the

649
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,190
molarity for sure. I think, um,
I love these ads by the way,

650
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:11,260
that they just terror terrify you.

651
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,900
I have a bit about this now in my act
about how we raised ourselves in the 80s

652
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,130
yeah. And commercials
like this. Yeah. Like I,

653
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:21,100
they just scared the shit out of you
into compliance and that's the way you

654
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:24,610
should do it. Like, hey kids, you'll
get snatched up off your God damn bike.

655
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:28,150
Don't talk to strangers. I think Joey
would be a little different than,

656
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,010
than the McGruff dog. I think he'd
be like, you see this kid over there?

657
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,350
I can take that kid if I wanted to.
I could get now like yeah,

658
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:37,360
you can just tell you about
crimes that he could commit.

659
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,150
You want to do more crimes?
He's committed before.

660
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,000
That'd be [inaudible] guys dealing drugs.

661
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,310
I got drugs to eight kids. Yeah. And
then Joey will be a great McGraff.

662
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,240
Oh yeah. Really, really fantastic.
What's his Dad Boehner thing?

663
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,740
Dad boners things about abstract
painting. Do you know about this? No.

664
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,730
What does that mean?

665
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:01,923
Page?

666
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,730
What is that? I had, I didn't send that
to you. That's terrible. That's horrible.

667
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:12,900
Can you please play the guy,
the touch therapy guy? Oh yeah.

668
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,750
Yeah.

669
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,490
Is this a called all touch therapy?
You email this to me?

670
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,490
I did. Okay. He came in, um,

671
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,260
through our email and I watched
it and I was like drawn in.

672
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,720
I was immediately drawn in.

673
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,970
Oh my God.
What I'm looking at it,

674
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,620
this guy gets paid to cuddle strangers.

675
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,250
My name is Karen and I
do professional cuddling

676
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,210
and the accident and he has vocal
fry, vocal fry, intense vocal fry,

677
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,350
a nice car.

678
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,630
And I do professional cuddling.
Can New York City.

679
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,540
God,
uh,

680
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,340
I'm a professional cuddler.

681
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:12,450
Tom Can do you think he
went to cuddle in college?

682
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,040
God has a bachelor's and cuddles may be a

683
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,390
cad said professor.

684
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,110
Of course. Honestly, I don't even
want to split the word coddling.

685
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,920
What do you like going to
name this therapy? I would
call it alternative touch,

686
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,520
I guess to kind of touch like
everybody loves when the, at the salon,

687
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,790
they shouldn't pull your hair.
Do like that. I like that.

688
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,803
Okay.

689
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,350
No.

690
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:54,350
So con schedules one cuddle session a
week through cuddlist.com $80 an hour.

691
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:57,600
So he has one a week.

692
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,600
Then he charges $80 so he
makes $8 a week doing this.

693
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:05,260
Is that a ton of money for New York City?
There's gotta be more.

694
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,120
How many of those people are just
dudes that are like, oh look,

695
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,660
a cuddle on my mouth. I like alternative
touch right around my asshole. Yeah.

696
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:18,610
Yeah, for sure. There's a spot
on the back of my ball bag,

697
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,130
like some alternative touching too.

698
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,520
If you could alternatively use
your tongue and then exactly mouth,

699
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,570
they'll feel good. Alternative Swirl
might come again down one a week.

700
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,310
I think run a week using this site or
something. Right. Cause it said a site.

701
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,260
I cuddle list.com so maybe it's like a
cuddle, like a Craig's list for cuddlers.

702
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah. Cuddlist oh this is
such fucking horse shit.

703
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:44,430
Can you even believe that this nice
looking girl has to pay for cuddles? No,

704
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,340
she doesn't have to pay for that.
She was so thrilled to see him though.

705
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:49,980
I think it's a friend.
I think she likes him.

706
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:55,350
Look at other like embracing $80
an hour for this lunatic to cuddle.

707

They raced to hospital grade
nanoparticle air purifier.

All these plants are a
little living room plans.

712
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,150
So bringing the first oxygen humidifier
essential oil diffuser that I drink

Yeah.
What's Your Pronoun?

715
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,670
Relax. You don't need to
do all that. Okay. Okay.

716
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,230
Certified cuddlers received special
training to keep themselves.

717
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,230
What are you feeling like
you want me to rub you?

718
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,550
You want a spoon on everything?

722
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,550
Oh, okay. Physical touch.

723
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,190
Some times with clients.

724
00:46:57,191 --> 00:47:00,100
We'll talk about the elephant in the room,

725
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:03,460
which is why are they coming to
hire a professional cuddlist?

726
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:08,020
What is their perfect collation
ships with intimacy? You know,

727
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:10,180
their mom never hugged them.

728
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,720
Their wife is very cold to them.

729
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,660
Yup.
I hear you con all those things.

730

733
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:31,480
intimacy friends, they don't even,
you know, high five their friends.

734
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:35,430
It's just been a very isolated,
physically isolated experience.

735
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,050
It's a lot.
He's just lucky.

736
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:43,380
He's doing stretches and he's got hi
ladies do with the pressures. They go,

737
00:47:43,381 --> 00:47:45,790
you want me to stretch you? You're
like, no, no, no, no. It was dry.

738
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,560
You do that. You're really doing a lot
of offensive stuff. This, wait a minute.

739
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,620
We haven't even discussed this a lot.
First of all, what's your Pronoun Today?

740
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,360
Oh yeah.
Which Braxton are you?

742
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:10,710
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

743

744
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,520
I saw you walk up and be like, Hey,
what'd you promised Dan? Ma? Yeah,

745
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,650
it was a printer.

00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,950
Watch which Braxton?

748
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,650

749
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:38,880
I got the husband, I got, I have so
many things I'm juggling right now.

750
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,970
Um, I feel like I'm, what is the, uh,

751
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,420
what's the big girl? The big
girl. Oh, she's the funniest.

752
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:51,600
Braxton. Yeah. Wait, hold on. Tony. Tamar.

753
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:54,070
Towanda we have to sing the song again.

754
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,100
Oh,

755
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,030
Ooh.
So

756
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:24,950
Ah, ah, wait,

757
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,810
but do you like being
stretched by the Tire Lady?

758
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,130
I mean there's times if I do something
really intense exercise wise, yeah.

759
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,450
Where I feel like it's good for
me. In other words, you know,

760
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,900
your hamstrings are rack, you go,
well this stretch is going to help me.

761
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:43,740
But I don't, I still don't enjoy it. It's
never as good cause I know it's better.

762
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,160
It's always too much pressure.
They go too far with the stretch.

763
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,990
It always hurts. They're like, does
this feel good? You're like, no, no.

764
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,000
It feels terrible. Start
it. And you're like,

765
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,800
oh, that's what it feels like.
Right? If it was like shit.

766
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,280
Yeah. That's what it feels fucking
hate when they stretch me. This guy,

767
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,880
this guy's fucking dad. What do you think
you is Joey Diaz was a professionally

768
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,910
laid out. My took your head, do some
stretches. It was smuggled. Been well.

769
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,043
Yeah.

770
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,970
Why is that a tender?
Like I consider that

771
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,510
so many people, my best friends
from so many different peoples.

772
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,840
Single only best. Oh Man.
Cause I think that is,

773
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,820
that's why I think I'm good at this.
Best friend might know me,

774
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,950
I just have disabilities or make
someone feel like they're the whole,

775
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,910
my whole focus.
Right,

776
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,800
right. He's a nice guy. He's sweet. I
actually think for this week on artists,

777
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,870
right? For people with Asperger's
or some kind of, you know,

778
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,540
social anxiety stuff, that's
probably really helpful. Yeah.

779
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,000
But it is a bit of bullshit. You
know, a cuddlist a professional.

780
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,510
I love when he's like,
I have a an air purifier.

781
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:06,690
I have triple purified water.

782
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,430
He'd done yawning into the mic.
I mean I had to go, am I boring?

783
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:15,830
You know I had Dion. We May. Do
you want some coffee? Yeah, thanks.

784
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,060
It's nice and cold lake you like thanks.

785
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,540
It looks like Brown diarrhea listeners.
Could you say that more?

786
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,970
What? I mean I'm trying to, oh,

787
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:30,660
like that's going to deter you from
did determine why don't you tell him?

788
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,020
Tell him about my neat farts that
I had. No, it was just disgusting.

789
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,140
I just got home a little while ago and
we were leaving a room to basically head

790
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:46,191
up the stairs and you were a step
ahead of me and you turned around.

791
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:49,670
You put your hand back and you placed
it on like my mid section. Yeah.

792
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,560
Just went wait and then you
had like a three part four.

793
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:57,270
It went online
and I go,

794
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,120
do you not want to keep any romance
going? None. That's my line by the way.

795
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:06,540
I say that to you. No, I
say that to you. I said,

796
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,080
are we going to do this again?
What are you talking about?

797
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,430
I say that I've said that to you.

798
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:16,380
Remember last time you farted on Betsey's
head and that's the first thing I say.

799
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:18,150
Do you like,
do you even want me to have sex with you?

800
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:23,100
Is You farted on Mitsis head?
You sat on our chair in the bedroom.

801
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:27,660
Yeah. You were in your Chobani's.
You put your legs in the air.

802
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,090
Yeah.
And her face.

803
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:34,710
She started smelling your be whole and
then you just blast it or be home or out

804
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:39,540
of your be whole and then to her mouth.
That's the secret. It was really gross.

805
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:44,020
What you did don't, Hey, wait a minute.
What? Why are you, you're judging me.

806
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,010
How dare you. Shame me. You've
taught me to be like this.

807
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,480
I was a woman before I started dating you.
What are you talking?

808
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:53,820
You turned me into an animal.
No, dude, I would never do that.

809
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:56,100
When you first started dating.
Yes you would.

810
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,900
And then you turned me into this pig than
I am now. Why are you putting it on me?

811
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,420
Cause he years of being with
you, you've broken me down. How,

812
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,520
how you've been saying that for years
because it's true. I was a lady before.

813
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,690
I mean not totally,
but more of a lady. No,

814
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:13,980

We didn't Toronto a couple of years
ago. She's a mommy. Uh, I think so.

850
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,180
Dan Pena is not a mommy.
That's really good fans. Um,

851
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,340
appears that students aren't terribly
fond of her on rate. My teachers,

852
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,530
um, most commentators slam her
although several are favorable.

853
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,690
One comment was awful. Teacher
bully to all students. Um,

854
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,630
swears that students all the time last.
If you don't know the correct answer,

855
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,040
very unprofessional. She is the
worst than a bully. Immature.

856
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,630
I think this is totally unrelated.
This, yeah. I'm like, wait,

857
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,750
what does this former Ios applied teacher,

858
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,730
Mary Beth Haglin famously had sex with
one of our students a hundred times.

859
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:22,930
She's, she's not stripping. Um,
she's now working at a strip club.

860
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,973
Woody's

861
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,870
just a few miles from where she taught.

862
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,900
Oh that's nice.
That's a nice little button to the story.

863
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,420
Has nothing to do with this story.
I think it's there.

864
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,020
What do you think they put that
there? Cause they were like, hey,

865
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:39,490
who's this girl and panties
anyways, Ligonier, I fart.

866
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,110
Really cool.
You know what?

867
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:45,880
I do regret that we don't have audio
because it could be another kiss my pussy.

868
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,250
Right. I suck as it suck my
pussy on a bloody day. That
was another good one. Yeah.

869
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,850
Yeah.
Like me where I fart

870
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,053
ass.

871
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,620
Yeah. But I wish we could
get a lick. Me where I fart.

872
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:03,850
I think that's a really neat phrase.
It's really cool. It's really cool.

873
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,690
Speaking of phrases,
oh I'm the patrion show.

874
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:12,691
We were discussing how you and I have
used a phrase around this house for like a

875
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,670
couple of years now. Yeah. Which is
same shit. Different toilet. Right.

876
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:23,310
And we never really do it on why image,
but it's in our private lives. We are,

877
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,960
well it came from why IMH though?
Originally. Yes. And then it, it's,

878
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,000
we say it almost daily
around the cigarette

879
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:36,020
was interviewing Adrian Broner
on Hbo and Boxing Fighting,

880
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:40,800
you know, as a whole UFC even. Yes.
Some, sometimes you hear outrageous shit,

881
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:45,801
but boxing especially lets people get
away with saying just the dumbest shit.

882
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,150
And the most, like they don't
have any, I mean, it's kind of a,

883
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:55,800
it is refreshing because you see such
a cookie cutter stuff in the four major

884
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:59,040
sports. It's always like we were trying
to find our identity and I hate that.

885
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,840
So boring loop. It came with it. We did
the best we could. It's always the same.

886
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,310
This is from that.

887
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:09,420
This is one of the Oh gee
clips we played from that.

888
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:10,670
Kellerman Adrian Broner.
Yeah.

889
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,290
Marco, as it were. Just one of the reasons
you are as hot as you are right now.

890
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,240
What do you feel about this?

891
00:58:18,241 --> 00:58:22,950
Which is after all the followup
performance to that masterpiece, you know,

892
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,950
same shit.
Different toilet

893
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,800
chewing gum. That's such a good
line. Yeah. Oh, you know, same shit.

894
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,540
Different toilet. It's a great line. Yeah.

895
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:37,020
What's this guy's name is Adrian
Brody runner. I love that.

896
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:40,740
And I love talking about practice. Those
are my two favorite athlete clips. Yeah.

897
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,090
Tuck. Talking about practice.
Not, not, not, not a Sunday.
Those are home run clubs,

898
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,580
man. Run Iverson. Allen
Iverson. That's right.

899
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:52,470
You finally got his name down after 15
years. Yep. Adrian Broner. Yeah. Yeah.

900
00:58:52,471 --> 00:58:55,350
He's a shit different times. He's been
on the show a few times, actually.

901
00:58:55,351 --> 00:58:58,110
He's done some ridiculous shit to,
um,

902
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:02,940
who's the guy that decked out his van
with $100,000 worth of like Versace,

903
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:05,470
Louis Vuitton. You're talking
about two or 300 guys right now.

904
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,340
Not that pacifically.

905
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:15,280
There's one player and then
Allen Iverson documentary. Yeah.

906
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,400
That he refers to. He's like, oh, that guy
is fucking crazy. He decked out his van.

907
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:24,230
Like he bought a fucking van.
I Dunno. Maybe it's Allen.

908
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:29,880
That wouldn't be surprising to me.
It's not an outrageous claims with me.

909
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,010
Gosh, by the way. So I see
this here. You know, we just

910
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:39,750
played it. That's your hero.
You know that, right? Of
course. I know who that is.

911
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:41,970
He and I go way back.
We have an intimate relationship.

912
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:46,420
Apparently there is a,
uh,

913
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,580
a new documentary coming. Oh,

914
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,610
all about Rocco.
God,

915
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,280
I don't think,
I don't think I need to know.

916
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,720
Very interesting.
Yeah.

917
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:01,780
Uh,

918
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:06,340
he told me some crazy
stories. Yeah, he did. Yeah.

919
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:10,750
He and I were talking when you were
filming something. I'm serious.

920
01:00:10,751 --> 01:00:15,610
Like I was shooting. No, you're
doing a Russell Peters presents.

921
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:20,160
That's where I met Rocco behind
backstage behind the dumpsters and yeah,

922
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,180
in between. Um, now he did tell
me some crazy childhood shit.

923
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:29,140
You told me that, which I'd be fascinated
to see if it's in this documentary.

924
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:37,730
My mother always dreamed up
roadmender like my father

925
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:44,300
or your parents struggling month after
about what do you want from life to give

926
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:48,410
him something better.
That's what I dropped out.

927
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,030
I told myself, you must do something
to help your mother or did it.

928
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:57,670
So I used my cock, helped me out.
I told myself he'll help me. God.

929
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:02,760
Yeah, there you go. Hmm.
Um, so anyway, interesting.

930
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,140
There's an article in vice about his,
uh,

931
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,180
this upcoming film and these,

932
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,750
I guess these guys followed him around
for pro while they asked him at one point,

933
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:18,350
why do you call your penis
the devil between your legs?

934
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,250
And he says, uh, because
the devil takes your body.

935
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,770
It's not you taking him for so many years.

936
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:28,430
I use sex for my convenience
when sex is using you, however,

937
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:30,860
that means you are addicted
and it's the devil.

938
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,910
It's the same if you take
drugs or alcohol. All of this
is what I call the devil.

939
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,180
He makes you do anything he wants.
He makes you do things.

940
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:42,710
You don't really enjoy it, but you
do them anyway. Um, it said, oh,

941
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:43,970
because we've mentioned this before,

942
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,500
it's not the first time he's
talked about retiring. Yeah.

943
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,870
What happened when you were 40 and you
said you'd be working just behind the

944
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:54,410
camera as a director, he said, I
tried to retire from my children.

945
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,750
I wanted to stop performing
in front of the camera.

946
01:01:56,751 --> 01:01:59,660
By the time they were teenagers and
were ready to have sex themselves,

947
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,590
I tried to do things on the other side
of the camera in order not to hurt them

948
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:07,580
on the other side. I fucked up
so many times. First of all,

949
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:10,280
I hurt myself by stopping.
Secondly,

950
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:15,200
I started to go to hookers two or three
times a day, so three times a day,

951
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:19,410
hooker, hooker, hooker, because I
was used to having so much sex. Wow.

952
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,970
So then he went back to performing
for us. It's got a real problem. Yeah.

953
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,600
It sounds like he's got an
addiction a little bit. Um,

954
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,810
this is something that I wanted to,
uh,

955
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,860
show to you because it's, um, yeah,

956
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:40,520
it looks like we have a
picture of the poop pile. Uh,

957
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,730
possible file ladder.
See?

958
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,970
Yeah, I saw that. Come in. Let me see the
top of it. Is that what that looks like?

959
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,770
It was similar to that. It
was similar to that. Okay.

960
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,040
I just want to show if you're,
see there's the steps up here.

961
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:57,670
See the way that we had it, few steps
were nailed to the tree themselves.

962
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,080
And then how so how did you
shut off the steps then? You,

963
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,110
you didn't set up the steps.

964
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:07,111
There was a ledge like this off the side
once you climbed up high enough so that

965
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:11,410
you would face the tree and your ass
would hang out the other way. Sure.

966
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,690
You know what's funny is that in
all the years I've known you a,

967
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,470
I've never seen you climb
steps up a tree you,

968
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:20,960
that's like worse for the last,

969
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,870
I'm saying that you're not
a climbing agile person.

970
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,050
It's not your stairs to climb up
anything and Shit to do anything.

971
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:30,600
It has everything to do with it. Cause
if, especially if we're taking a dump,

972
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,690
you really gotta be committed.
Anyways,

973
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:36,030
I got this interesting
email from the poop pile.

974
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:41,490
The poop pile itself emailed us.
What did it say? It says, Dear Tina,

975
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,070
I exist.
Fuck you.

976
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,540
Love poop pile.
See

977
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,470
I guess I guess you're right.

978
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:57,040
Yeah, yeah. I guess the
poo piles it real. Yeah.

979
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,210
See he emailed you the guy

980
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:07,420
speaking of gross things, we got
an email that says, hey mommy's,

981
01:04:07,421 --> 01:04:11,710
I just wanted to ride to say I just got
done licking my first asshole and it was

982
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:12,760
pretty,
pretty amazing.

983
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,480
I've been dating this girl for a few
weeks and decided I would steal her heart

984
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:19,810
by um, by eating her ass. Yeah.

985
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,780
We talked about it over text
and she was totally excited.

986
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,210
I was extremely hesitant at first as
I've heard Tina's thoughts on poop coming

987
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:31,720
out and all that jazz. Yeah. But
she doesn't even hydrate properly.

988
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:35,300
So what would you be not about eating?
Yes, they go hand and hand. Alright,

989
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:38,230
so overcoming my fears
of the stinky abyss.

990
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:42,160
All I asked was that she shower
right before and then came the fun.

991
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,580
I had her face down,
ass up and I just went for it.

992
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:49,180
I was pleasantly surprised
of the silky feeling.

993
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,460
It gave my tongue and
was even more surprised.

994
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:53,200
There was not a shitty taste or smell.

995
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,890
I won't bore you with my technique
as I'm an amateur currently.

996
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,110
Overall I would rate it 10 out of 10.

997
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:02,950
She loved it and I have to say I enjoyed
it also. I highly recommend Tina.

998
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:07,210
Give it a try to Tom. Yes. No Way.
Your power from Salt Lake City,

999
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:11,800
Utah Johnson. No thanks. Thank
you Johnson. And yes, Christina,

1000
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,880
hopefully this, uh, makes you think,

1001
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,160
first of all,
you

1002
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,020
would have to have your butthole
totally waxed. Like baby soft. Yeah.

1003
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:28,210
And then you would have to have it steam
cleaned, steam cleaned. What's that like?

1004
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,600
You were seen on like the Braxton's they
went to get their vaginas steamed. Yeah.

1005
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:37,870
I want you to go get your butthole steamed
so that it was thoroughly clean and

1006
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:42,580
then maybe I would do it.
Your shits are fucking nasty.

1007
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:47,110
You love town the other day and you left
streaks in the toilet that I couldn't

1008
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:51,420
even believe how many it was. It was
light brown, like real diarrhea. Well,

1009
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,730
I'm not going to do that
right before I go, you know,

1010
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,800
before you go to tab your lunch,
I'm going to clean it up.

1011
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:59,890
You know when you have your lunch too.

1012
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:05,530
When's your um, colonoscopy. I
have to change it again. I do

1013
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:11,560
because of a gig though. I'm gigging
man. I'm gigging Bro. I am though.

1014
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,520
It's interesting bro. I'm Gagan
for real. Uh Huh. All right,

1015
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:18,910
so how long are we going to put
this off? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1016
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:23,560
How long are we going to put this off?
I need a new day. A new day. Oh Jesus.

1017
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:25,630
This doesn't look real.
This is out of habit.

1018
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:28,310
Tantric Orgasm all by
herself to throw off,

1019
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,850
bring them into your being
and he looks like Baloney.

1020
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:35,190
Have we played this guy before?
The rest take care of itself? No.

1021
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:40,120
I'll show you how it was. Remember,
I feel like we have, yeah,

1022
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,780
cause the guy just breeds,
I remember this and then he like goes,

1023
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:49,680
well maybe it was audio back in the
day. Video. I remember a guy like,

1024
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,050
looks like he's no chest hair.
I'm going to fucking puke.

1025
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:56,230
I hate why it's turned on.
It's like watching a guide jacket.

1026
01:06:56,231 --> 01:06:59,980
I don't want to watch her. Oh, it's great.
Look at them. I'm going to throw up.

1027
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,170
I just don't like it,
but I want to know who's not teaching me.

1028
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:11,050
He just watching some guy imaginary.
I want to, I want the lesson.

1029
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:16,630
Well, it's like a wet dream. Yeah.
It's all in the mind, right? Yeah.

1030
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,430
Oh look how hard he's coming.

1031
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:22,650
Okay.

1032
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,710
Thanks for making wine.

1033
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,390
Uh,

1034
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,500
some tight jeans on there.
You have it under one minute,

1035
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:37,010
but here's the, I don't want to see
anymore. Oh man, I don't need anyone.

1036
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,200
I don't want to see him in
speedos either knowing it.

1037
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:43,730
I'm trying to get out of it. I want to
see his erection. Here's he had a boner.

1038
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:47,330
Better tantric orgasm and under one.
Does he have a boner first?

1039
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,510
Get a little high. The guy did a
couple of minutes ago so he's out.

1040
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,870
Sit back. But he's not teaching us. Hello?

1041
01:07:56,871 --> 01:08:01,520
Somebody you want to pull into your energy
field. Okay. I can't, I can't do it.

1042
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:06,620
You went over number one.
One comment. Somebody hand
me a trash can so I can barf.

1043
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,450
I don't want to hear him coming. Can you
not? My friend today is master shake.

1044
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,200
Oh yeah.
I don't want to hear it

1045
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:24,010
bro.
Bro.

1046
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,940
Can't do it out of this one. All
right. Okay. That's just grow.

1047
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,990
I hate hearing dudes do nasty shit
like this. Yeah, he's a nasty.

1048
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,200
Why you gotta you gotta be so nap time.

1049
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,200
Why? Why you gotta be some nasty. Can
I read you an email? We got of course,

1050
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:48,610
but I need you to really pay attention.
Your focus is very important. Sunday.

1051
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,473
All right,
let's do it.

1052
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:54,050
This might be the most interesting email
we have ever gotten. Are you ready?

1053
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,760
Yes. No, you have to listen. It's
very interesting. Okay. Hi, Mommy's.

1054
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:03,620
Do you think if a human eight
only dog food right and or wet,

1055
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:07,100
that their shifts would
start to smell like dog shit.

1056
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,460
And you know that very
distinct dog shit smell.

1057
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,083
Yes.

1058
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,600
What an interesting,
interesting topic.

1059
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:20,500
This might be the dumbest email
we've ever gotten, but I like it.

1060
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,080
It's really dumb. So dumb. But I
like it. Okay, so that was down.

1061
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:31,060
But listen to this part. This part is not
dumb. It really does give me pause. Okay.

1062
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,320
Okay. Also, why is it that animals
don't need to wipe after browning?

1063
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:37,660
Why doesn't brown stay on?

1064
01:09:37,661 --> 01:09:41,930
They're buttholes like it would
ours if we don't want. Hmm.

1065
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,640
We maybe we need to call in
Brown lock to investigate.

1066
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,840
I would love to hear your expert Brown
opinions. Well, you know, I haven't,

1067
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,780
I haven't a couple of thoughts.
Love you, Jen. Thank you. Jen.

1068
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:57,220
What an interesting question. First of
all, thought provoking. Couple of things.

1069
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:02,620
If we just eat dog food
dry and wet,

1070
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,440
it will smell like dog should
I think. I do think so. Yes.

1071
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:11,340
So you think?
Yes,

1072
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:15,900
it would see using his dog food.

1073
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:20,250
The legs, the dog shit smell
like dog shit. Well, why
don't we try and experiment?

1074
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,210
Why don't you do it for a couple of days?
I'm traveling a bunch, but your home,

1075
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,690
what? Just try it. Try it
for like three or four days.

1076
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:32,160
You could eat a little bit of dog food.
I smell Betsey's every morning at her.

1077
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:36,480
Smells horrendous. But FIV has a
nice wet food. His smells real good.

1078
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:39,510
Would you eat it for a few days? Chicken
gravy. We need it for a couple of days.

1079
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,373
I could.

1080
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,930
I want to try it as an experiment and
then you should try the, other than that,

1081
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:50,610
no carb thing. It's perfect. The other
thing, I'm sure there's carbs in there.

1082
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,390
Not In the wet food that Fifi. It's
this chicken. Well the other thing is,

1083
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,030
um, what was the other question?
Oh yeah, so it's a white paper.

1084
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:04,420
I think that part of it is they
squat so deeply when they should. Oh,

1085
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,080
like squatty potty. Yeah. If we start,

1086
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,900
if we started chatting with one
of those and squatting down more,

1087
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,060
like the way you were
meant to actually poop,

1088
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:16,220
I think there'd be less to
clean up. That's really,
really interesting. Answers.

1089
01:11:16,221 --> 01:11:20,880
Tell him. Yeah. I think number one, that
means really onto something. Number one,

1090
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:25,170
it's not the food that dictates the dog
shit smell because dogs get into trash

1091
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:29,310
and they, they eat people's food and
they're shit still smells like dog shit.

1092
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:34,020
I think it's the bacteria in
their guts. Number two, uh,

1093
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:38,100
sometimes it gets stuck in there for
like Betsey's had shit stuck to her for.

1094
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:41,070
I think it's cause there's no
hair around the right thing.

1095
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:44,850
We need you to do the dog food thing
to get a real answer because we're just

1096
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:45,684
both,

1097
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,600
we're just spinning our wheels where
you give it a shot for us for the show.

1098
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,860
Of course.
I'm going to start right after this show.

1099
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,710
A lot of people listen to this show.
Do you want me to eat the kibble?

1100
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,740
Betsey's kibble. She hasn't. She's on a
special design. You're repulsed by it.

1101
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:02,400
So why don't you start with wet food
just to get into like the flow and maybe

1102
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,890
day two you get into some dry food.
If he's got some nice wet,

1103
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,790
it does smell good.
His smells like Chinese food kinda.

1104
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:14,220
It smells like a Moo Shu chicken.
It's good. You should try it.

1105
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:18,340
You should try it. I just lick my
fingers after I opened the gate.

1106
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,640
Know there's no smell worse on your

1107
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:29,940
dog's back before, right? Yeah. Come
on. Milk bone and the heart treat.

1108
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:33,840
It's not good. It's not good. It's like
a cracker. That's my good is not good.

1109
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,930
Have you tried this or this? So
foreign it does. No good. It's no good.

1110
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:41,850
Have you tried it? Oh, um, no.

1111
01:12:41,851 --> 01:12:46,620
I've never tried one. Oh, it just
tastes earthy. Shitty. Their,

1112
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:51,280
their, their taste buds are not advanced
like ours where people and where people,

1113
01:12:51,281 --> 01:12:54,000
we like people. Yeah, I agree.

1114
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,010
I totally think we're
people too. Um, wait,

1115
01:12:59,011 --> 01:13:02,400
what did you eat dog food for
a week so we can do this? No,

1116
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:06,690
because you're the one that's got to
do it. Okay. Would you rather? Hello?

1117
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,960
Would you rather eat FIFO?

1118
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:14,961
Is Dog food for one day or I take you to
the dog park and that's where you shit

1119
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,410
all times.
All Times you have to shit.

1120
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,730
You have to shut like a dog in the dog
park with the other dogs. You got a squat

1121
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:30,210
and then I come around with like a
plastic Baggie. Each one to experiments.

1122
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,440
No,

1123
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:36,441
I mean one day of dog food versus one
week of shedding the one week because it

1124
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:40,530
has the stakes have to be Sam
to dog food will make you sick.

1125
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,850
I don't want to make you
sick for a whole week,

1126
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,910
but I would him humiliate you for one.
Why would you want to do that?

1127
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:49,400
Cause painless. Humiliation dies
emotionally painful. All stop.

1128
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:53,220
You'll see your shrink. You'll be fine.
What is wrong with you? He'll be fine.

1129
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,410
So what do you choose? Dog? Shit.

1130
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:01,230
What would you choose versus one day of
eating fiefs would you do I need fiefs

1131
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:04,860
food. It smells nice. It's got
that gravy to it. You would vomit.

1132
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,910
I will record you vomiting
and play it back to

1133
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,900
wait,
but isn't it people you could eat it.

1134
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,110
It's like poor quality means you
can't eat anything. Did you know that?

1135
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,830
Like you don't have to but you can.

1136
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,520
But I'm saying that how far off from,
I mean there's some dirt outside,

1137
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:29,140
you can't eat it. How far off of from
people's food is dog food? Really?

1138
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:29,980
It's off.

1139
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,050
Not The nice canned stuff that we give
fif that's off the kibble. Forget it.

1140
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,580
But that gravy stuff,

1141
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:40,600
it's nice try by Scott
[inaudible] for the show.

1142
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:45,370
No one bite. No. Why? No,
it's got peas and carrots.

1143
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:50,440
No, no, but you're saying it's not
that Michelle. Yeah, just for the show.

1144
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:53,410
Will you give me,
what do you want me to give you?

1145
01:14:55,740 --> 01:15:00,320
Can I think about it? How about let's
make it happen and I just take a taste.

1146
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:03,800
But how big of it to is the Lupus,
but you cannot today though.

1147
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:08,400
But you can't just do, in other words,
there's the, the liquidy kind of part.

1148
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:11,930
You can't just do that. You got to
get it signed out. Like, okay. Like,

1149
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:16,730
like I'm a veggie chunk. Can I not
eat the meat part? Okay, that's fair.

1150
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:22,950
Well, you buy me this, uh, this
ring I was looking at. Okay.

1151
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:28,380
It's not that expensive. All right. It's
like, it's like a hundred bucks. Sure.

1152
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,080
All right. Good deal.
I'll try the dog food.

1153
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:37,710
When can we have this experiments episode?
We'll try it on the show. Oh yeah. Okay.

1154
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:42,590
Yeah, absolutely. You just
made a commitment. I know.
Okay. Um, I'm going to,

1155
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,690
I have to prepare myself emotionally
for it. All right. I'm really,

1156
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,340
really happy that you're just doing this.

1157
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,320
Do you think it will make my brown smell?
I think it's too little.

1158
01:15:52,321 --> 01:15:55,350
I think if you eat the whole can and
it would make it smell though. Yeah.

1159
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:57,180
What if it's really good and
you just go to town on it?

1160
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,650
What's the song that came in? They
sent me, I haven't listened to it.

1161
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,640
I couldn't download it on my iPhone.
Try it. You want to call it out?

1162
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,670
Let's see if it's any good.

1177
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,100
He wrote, produced this, uh,

now. Oh, just blew up. Yeah. 92 bars.

1179
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:50,910

But he's like Holy Shit.

1182
01:17:55,511 --> 01:18:00,511
Like I was at the live show in Burbank
and he talks some shit from the back row.

1183
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:05,790
He was great. I met him after and he
was super nice. So anyways, we were,

1184
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,810
we were the yelling about something.

1185
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:11,440
I told him I want to come watch how it
makes a beat. And he said, absolutely.

1186
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:14,980
Oh that's fucking nice. Are you going
to get DJ license from the real deal?

1187
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,950
I don't know. I'm going to get DJ lessons,
but I want to see him make a beat.

1188
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,020
So he said I could do that.
Nice. I'm excited for you.

1189
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:25,360
Congratulations on the success of 92
bars. Very cool man. Look at that.

1190
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:30,220
See our diverse listenership. You
guys are amazing. Um, very good.

1191
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:35,030
We play the Stan [inaudible],
Stan, Stan Amman.

1192
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,860
Why can't believe you guys

1193
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:37,570
this year,

1194
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:41,190
Secretary Clinton became the first
woman nominated for president by a major

1195
01:18:41,191 --> 01:18:43,380
party earlier this month.
You said she doesn't have,

1196
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,690
this was a big deal. Big Deal.
Then we didn't know this,

1197
01:18:46,691 --> 01:18:49,750
but both candidates are
listeners of your mom's. Yeah,

1198
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,000
I had no idea.

1199
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,190
Have quote a presidential look.
She's standing here, uh, right now.

1200
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:59,650
What did you mean by that?
She doesn't have the look.

1201
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,720
She just didn't have the stand ma.

1202
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:06,700
I said she doesn't have the Standard Ama
and I don't believe she does have the

1203
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:11,440
stamina to be president of this country.
You need tremendous stand them up.

1204
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,910
You have, wait a minute. She asked me
a question. Did you ask me a question?

1205
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,650
You have to be able to
negotiate our trade deals.

1206
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:24,820
You have to be able to negotiate.
Yeah, that's right. With Japan,

1207
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,860
with Saudi Arabia,
I mean,

1208
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:31,660
can you imagine we're defending
Saudi Arabia and with all
of the money they have,

1209
01:19:31,661 --> 01:19:34,090
we're defending them to,
they're not paying. Well you
have to do is speak to him.

1210
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,960
Wait,

1211
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,760
you have so many different things you
have to be able to do and I don't believe

1212
01:19:39,761 --> 01:19:42,850
that Hillary has the standard
much let her respond.

1213
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:47,470
Wow.
That's from the actual debates.

1214
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:51,620
Trump's a huge fan. David Elliot
sent that in. Thank you, David.

1215
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:54,770
I didn't know that. He was such
a huge fan. There was even a,

1216
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:59,130
wasn't there a video one made to,
a lot of people were on this. Um,

1217
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,250
mommies are on the case
mom, um, on the case.

1218
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,500
Let me see.
That's a mom on the case.

1219
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:10,140
Who was trimming your beard
back when we took these? Oh,

1220
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,800
what did you mean by that?
She doesn't have the look.

1221
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:14,600
She doesn't have the stamina.

1222
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:17,960
I said she doesn't have
the stamina stand him up.

1223
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,890
I said she doesn't have
the stamina stand them up.

1224
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:25,970
I don't believe she does have the
stamina to be president of this country.

1225
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:28,210
[inaudible]

1226
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:33,380
that's ty berry. So a couple of people
and we actually have a couple more.

1227
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:36,630
It's not that then. Oh, I love it.
So like Stan Ama is making kind of,

1228
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:41,210
I'm so confused by it now. I do think
it's stand on my now fucked me up man.

1229
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,480
Or respond well.

1230
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:49,660
Well as soon as he travels to 112
countries and negotiates a peace deal.

1231
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:55,460
A cease fire. She's got the
stand. A mom who's got it.

1232
01:20:56,350 --> 01:21:00,240
All right, Dan. Stan [inaudible], Stan,

1233
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:05,300
Stan Umma it stamina, stamina,
stamina. Sounds wrong.

1234
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:09,340
Why does it sounds so wrong? Because
it does cause Stan. Emma. Yeah.

1235
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:13,460
Now stand on most sounds right.
Does sane it fucked us up.

1236
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,900
That and preposition. I've been saying
that wrong now for proposition. Yeah,

1237
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,330
it's fucked up when you start
saying their words wrong.

1238
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:23,870
I know we always perfectly say them now,
which is so dumb of us.

1239
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:28,730
He knows names are dummies. What's your
Pronoun Right now? Quick. Your Highness,

1240
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:35,240
Your Majesty, Your Highness.
Was that a university? This
is big and college is now.

1241
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:40,040
So what happens is when a student, when
a student signs on for a, you know,

1242
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:43,760
a new semester classes,
you know everything, a lot
of it is electronic today,

1243
01:21:43,761 --> 01:21:46,550
right?
A professor emails his class.

1244
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,580
So now when you see those sign offs,

1245
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:52,370
the signature of the
professor has their pronouns.

1246
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,480
They allow students to
email in their pronouns.

1247
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:02,010
A University of Michigan did like a
whole campus wide thing where to be

1248
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:07,220
inclusive, name your Pronoun
also as you can name anything.

1249
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,530
One of the students there did,
um,

1250
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:15,610
your highness and he said it was to
point out the absurdity of being able to

1251
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:21,700
imagine a teacher having to memorize
everybody's Pronoun and if they fluctuate

1252
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:25,820
every day. Yeah. How has that have
that professor supposed to know?

1253
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:31,530
Yeah, I agree. Um, we've got, uh,

1254
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:35,360
somebody wanted us to rate their
jeans. Oh yeah. I like this game.

1255
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:36,950
If there's deer mountain has,

1256
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:41,000
I have a couple pair of denim jeans that
I've had for about six years wearing

1257
01:22:41,001 --> 01:22:43,460
jeans nearly every day.
At this point.

1258
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:47,270
They have worn to the point
they have gotten lighter.

1259
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,920
Some have phrase on the bottom.

1260
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:52,880
What is your opinion on denim
that has gotten lighter from age?

1261
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:56,900
It is not very light, but it's
definitely not dark now where I live,

1262
01:22:56,901 --> 01:23:01,010
or at least in my childhood home,
the darker jeans were worn by dads.

1263
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,190
It was always dark
jeans with nowhere tear,

1264
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,670
nearly new looking and the bottom hem,
the fat,

1265
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:12,340
two or three inches above the shoot.
I know exactly what he's talking about.

1266
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:17,130
So for me these Lijing seemed more
appropriate. I have attached pictures.

1267
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,250
Yeah, for reference. I
know exactly the type of,

1268
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,120
they're like,
just remember this

1269
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:26,850
and I know you think everything
has to do with genes.

1270
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,130
Well,
I've been on all,

1271
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:33,230
I know a lot of billionaires
and to the best of my knowledge,

1272
01:23:33,231 --> 01:23:35,570
I never saw one wearing
a fucking pair of jeans

1273
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:40,710
just to remind you. Um, okay, so here are,

1274
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:45,350
oh Lord, here are his
jeans. Oh, get your life.

1275
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:50,030
No Bill. Bill. No, no, no. That's
it. That is a no, right Tommy,

1276
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:54,710
those are two knows the one you got
on the one you're holding. Um, no.

1277
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:59,630
I mean the ones you're holding, those
are bad. I know what you're saying.

1278
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:03,050
I just think you need that. You
said two and six years, men,

1279
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:06,950
why don't you just get rid of these?

1280
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,720
I know the dad jeans you're talking about,
you know what the other thing you're,

1281
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:15,730
but you left out those dark dad jeans
are real thick and they look terrible.

1282
01:24:16,461 --> 01:24:19,120
Like they're cuffed too
high. Right? Like you said,

1283
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:22,910
they get them hemmed like above the
shoe to get them hemmed above the shoe.

1284
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:28,010
How dads do it if they official dads. But
I'm saying he should get a darker wash.

1285
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:28,490
Yeah.

1286
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:33,410
But have it tailored to fit for your
sneakers so that it's like perfect course

1287
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:38,090
to don't don't, I mean there's
a, there's a light Jean,

1288
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,470
the kind of works,

1289
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:45,280
but you know these are too
loose or too baggy fitted,

1290
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:49,600
right? Yeah. They're not
fitted and I don't think this
color is good. Just don't,

1291
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:53,300
I think it's too, it's
too light. I tell you,

1292
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:56,770
I got a pair of light denim
recently from lucky works.

1293
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:01,730
A Little Maggie's nineties
style jeans. Yeah. So,

1294
01:25:01,731 --> 01:25:05,360
but you know, it's questionable. I
kinda, I like them. No, they work.

1295
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,130
I think for dudes,

1296
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:12,020
darker is the way I feel like I want to
take this dude shopping and now where do

1297
01:25:12,021 --> 01:25:15,620
you live? I'll go to
the mall with you, Jeff.

1298
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:21,680
I'll go get you. I'll, I'll buy jeans
with you if I'm in new your city. Yeah.

1299
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,220
I don't like these.
These are terrible. Jeff.

1300
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:30,780
Get some new fucking jeans, man.
Get Your Life Jeff. Um, all right.

1301
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:34,550
I've got to get going. I got
to take a nap. Oh my God.
I'm so tired. Let's lay down.

1302
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,110
Um,

called top dog loves what?
