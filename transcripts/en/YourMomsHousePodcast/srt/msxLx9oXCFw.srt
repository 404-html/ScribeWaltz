00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,350
she didn't say it, I don't think to
be like, you know, to make that joke.

144
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,650
She really was making uh,
making the other girl a salad.

145
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:02,050
So when she tells him that,
he's like,

146
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,420
it's so funny to me that that exists in
the world where adults have to restrain

147
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:14,340
themselves. I just don't understand it. I
have a real, I struggle with it. You know,

148
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,070
I used to work in a law firm and that
was the hardest thing in the world was to

149
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,230
restrain myself constantly. They
just really, really shut it down.

150
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:26,500
Right? Yeah. You can't have fun. Yeah. No,

151
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:30,250
you're not supposed to laugh at
your job or be inappropriate,

152
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,860
obviously. Very Sullen, man.

153
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,060
I did. It's so painful. Was it?

154
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,310
Could you imagine working on a morning
show how fucking hard and horrible that

155
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:48,670
would be for one for us.
Wow.

156
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,110
I can't wait to see this new salad.

157
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,530
A big of this show is
spending time just you.

158
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,940
You spend time fake reacting to things
so they have to go like, that's me.

159
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,580
Oh, it takes spending time
with a toddler, like, wow,

160
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,700
look at your salads.
You how much that takes out of you.

161
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,090
Just do that for a second.
I know, but maybe some,

162
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,110
maybe some people are like
that and normally is that
someone's real personality.

163
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,080
Some people's,
but even then they,

164
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,540
it becomes their personality because
they manufactured it for a while. Yeah,

165
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,670
no one's born like that to go like,
that's good gray.

166
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,250
See that they got a new donut
over on main street go. Okay.

167
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,101
Is that,
yeah.

168
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:40,240
Is that socialization like I grew up in
a house where if I'm not happy all the

169
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,350
time I got in trouble is probably,
or maybe it was just, yeah,

170
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,500
don't show feelings.
It was so bad in my house growing up.

171
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,800
I overcompensate by being
like, that's gray. Yeah,
because feelings are dangerous.

172
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,070
You'll get it, you'll
get in trouble. Well,

173
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:58,420
they're like that on the morning
shows a lot, you know? That's the,

174
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,770
whether it's local or even national,
the Good Morning Americas and shows,

175
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:06,130
it's always like an maybe that's just
puts people in a good mood, can know.

176
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,310
You wake up and they're like going to
work and they turn that on and someone's

177
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:14,140
like, Hey, this is really neat.
What's going on here today?

178
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,570
It may be it for the non cynical person.
Oh fuck them.

179
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,990
Maybe for normal people that's like
cheerful. Feels good. Yeah, it was good,

180
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,000
but it doesn't work for me.
I don't work for me.

181
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,100
You know what I don't understand either
are are people who want to be Miss

182
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,220
America. That's another one. Right? Why?

183
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,490
Why is that even a thing for you?
I want to be with American.

184
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,850
You're so going to win this year
and we're practicing your answers.

185
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,300
The best is when they have like the
hardest part for them is answering one

186
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:48,250
question. What was the big, it was
with fucking Steve Harvey this year.

187
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,620
No, no, no, that's, yeah,
that's his friend is the best.

188
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,570
What's the big fuck up with the answer?

189
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,580
Remember the girl who lost her mind in
the answer. No, you don't remember that.

190
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,100
Wait, what do you like? She bluffs.
She flubbed it or something.

191
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,760
She's like kill all the Jews. I'm,
I'm, I don't know what I'm saying.

192
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,210
Yeah know it's 2007 it was miss teen USA.

193
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,660
We're on pause.

194
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,560
Have shown a fifth of Americans
can't locate the u s on a world map.

195
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,480
Why do you think this says,

196
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,640
I personally believe that you had some
Americans are unable to do so because

197
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,370
some people out there and our nation and
I believe that our education like such

198
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:42,940
as South Africa and Iraq everywhere,
like such as,

199
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,903
I believe that

200
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,160
our education over here and then
you asked should help the US.

201
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,750
I should help eyes

202
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,470
and should help die.

203
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,710
I can the Asian countries
able to build on our future

204
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,220
so bad. It's hard. I covered
my eyes for that whole thing.

205
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,960
It's pretty well look at the screen.

206
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,080
I wonder if you ask her the same question
today if you'd have the same response.

207
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,670
There's no way you think she's gotten
over the correct response a few times.

208
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,340
Yeah. Yeah. I think the next day

209
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,140
it was,
it must have been just genuine panic.

210
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,090
You're a bit like just a panic moment.
She didn't,

211
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,570
she blanked and she had no
idea. You could. I'm sure.

212
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,000
Did you have that in stand up?
The first years we were like,

213
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,250
I don't even know what I'm
saying. I'm so nervous. Course.

214
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,720
It's like when you just press
play on your act and you go like,

215
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm just going to just say
what I'm saying. She up.

216
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,750
She was nervous and she's young.
That's miss teen,

217
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,940
but I know that the older broads
they practice, she said the Iraq,

218
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,450
they don't own maps such as

219
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,430
uh, but the older broads,
they rehearsed the questions,

220
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,220
don't they give you worse so you're,
you're rehearsed.

221
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,110
And that to them is the most nerve
wracking event is having a talk. That's,

222
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,290
that's the funniest part to
me is that's the challenge.

223
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,360
I agree. I think the ratings
would pick up significant

224
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,590
Miss Nebraska,

225
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
here's six guys who you start with first
I missed Pennsylvania and I can suck

226
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,570
six.
Can I take the challenge?

227
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,190
Wow. We really, there should be
a porn parody of that where they

228
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,280
think there is. Yeah. There has to
be a miss America porns Google it up.

229
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a great thing.
Miss America course,

230
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:56,240
they're triple x parody where
it's like if you want to win,

231
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:00,140
you've got to blow the judges.
Yep. That's exactly it sounds.

232
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,240
I don't see it. I see
parodies, but, but you don't,

233
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,880
here's the thing with Miss America,
do you win like a,

234
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,210
you want a small amount of money?
It's not life changing.

235
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:15,350
It's not like you win million. Oh No,
no. But it's, um, the exposure, if you,

236
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:19,220
if you play that exposure right, it's
also dwindled. It used to be a big deal,

237
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,563
you know,
that was,

238
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,160
that would be front page news the day
after and they would parade her around on

239
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:27,680
everything is, people just don't
care about it as much anymore.

240
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,740
And I think a big part of that
has been that porn, but no,

241
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,770
the feminist push of the last year,
the growth, you know what I mean?

242
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,840
Where they go, wow, it's seen as
silly now because so many women go,

243
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:42,920
this is silly. It's women. So we're
saying, well, that, and I think,

244
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,920
I think there was a time
in America where the only,

245
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,130
the only place you could see a,
a hot chicken, a bathing suit,

246
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,010
was during the Miss America pageant.
You know what?

247
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,480
Like maybe in the fifties you're like,
oh shit,

248
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,130
everybody get their dicks in their hands.

249
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,090
The Miss America pageants on
and now it's like there's porn,

250
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,570
there's lad mags. There's,
there's so much exposure to that.

251
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,970
This isn't that what they're called Lad
Fhn and maximum they're called lad mag.

252
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,770
I'm from almost, oh,
they're called Chavez.

253
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,760
Somebody wrote in those boys that talk
like, like have horrible do their accent,

254
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,030
master of accents.
This car,

255
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,840
it lifts off mate.

256
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,170
This call moves columns.

257
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,690
I've never driven a car.
Like

258
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,700
why do you have to make your
teeth kind of bucked out?

259
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,150
Cause they do all English
people have butts.

260
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,730
They're using the queen of
England talk. Yeah, she does all,

261
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,130
I'm the queen of England,

262
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,470
England. Um, everybody,

263
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,670
I started drag dead Tay.
Now that what she does,

264
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:04,440
she dictates tee time. Of course,
every day she tells me and Drake,

265
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,970
y'all fucking tight. No
wait, what were we saying?

266
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,360
Miss America, that porno.
Did you find it? No, no, no.

267
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,580
But yeah, you don't win a
ton of money and maybe, yeah,

268
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,770
maybe the exposure for like a minute
and people are like, Oh, you're who?

269
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,390
Cool and you wear a crown.
It seems silly now.

270
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:29,010
So dumb. It seems so, it
also, it seems antiquated.

271
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,530
They feel like,

272
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,160
I feel like millennials are
like what I was Miss America.

273
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,810
What the fuck is Miss America?

274
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,060
Even bathing suits look
silly like bikinis,

275
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,510
the style of them they feel
dated, you know, on the pageant.

276
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,100
I feel like they just feel old timing.
Yeah, they should wear like Brazilian.

277
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,580
I say they should go topless and then
just writing a song like Miss Brazil and

278
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,750
there used to be topless and then a
hole in the front of the front fantasy.

279
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:05,190
You can see how they shaved their
pizza, the gap close. But show the hair

280
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,070
real interesting.
My Fun.

281
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,220
What if, okay, here's
how they should read you.

282
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,490
They need to remix it to
make it for today's audience,

283
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,170
they need to have miss America like in
revenge of the nerds belching contests

284
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,040
who can light her fart best.
That'd be cool. I have my money's,

285
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,800
I Miss Michigan and then uh,

286
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,710
you know like beer drinking
and stuff like that.

287
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:43,410
And then the blow bang thing
and then that's the last event.

288
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,610
That's the most important.

289
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,550
And then we have Miss
Idaho saying she can eat

290
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,750
and she's never been with a black guy,

291
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,160
but she's about to blow eight of them.
Here we go, there's Idaho, go ahead.

292
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,900
Or it's Miss Universe

293
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,360
and Miss Amsterdam comes on and she's
like, no, I'm gonna take this shit home.

294
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,530
And she puts candles and or beaver
and does cartwheels and stuff. Yeah.

295
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,663
Pretty cool man.

296
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm just suggesting it to them if
they want to get their ratings up,

297
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,140
I think the more that we're exposed
to this what I'm going to play,

298
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,370
they're more that Miss
America becomes like, uh Huh.

299
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,080
This is the newest video on my Oscar
gender terrorist playlists on my channel.

300
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,530
Um,

301
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,730
I'm updating all of my playlist because
they haven't been able to post anything

302
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,580
on time. You would like to know why.
Check out my asked Dakota life update

303
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,750
and we can talk there.
You'll find out. So anyway,

304
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,820
this video is something that
I have consistently said
in my everyday life and I

305
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:56,240
feel like maybe I need to reiterate and
just maybe I just want to make a video

306
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:57,830
that I can link people to when I was,

307
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,820
that's cool. I think it is
going to reiterate, reiterate.

308
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,910
I want to reiterate what
I've been saying for awhile.

309
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,770
He sounds like that Tyler Oakley
guy that I love so much. Hey guys,

310
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:13,180
I have absolutely nothing to say
in the world. I got my haircut.

311
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,580
Yeah Blah Blah Blah. I was like,
well it cuts your out or not

312
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,920
dragging and I'm tired of their
shit so my pronouns are not perfect.

313
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,440
You're not a preference. They are
mandatory for interaction with me.

314
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,860
Are you laughing? Sorry I wasn't, I
didn't see him until you put him up.

315
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,950
Well I'd say actually he looks a
little like he's a larger dude.

316
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:49,670
He's got a full beard, full beard,
full must. You know we mustache,

317
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,650
it looks like a Septum piercing safety
pin through it, which is normal.

318
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,670
And then he has your aunt Mildred head
wrap arm after she takes a shower.

319
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,780
And, and some taste, full eye makeup,

320
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,740
shadow with the beard. It
goes nice. And my favorite,

321
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:13,940
I think here as I see either shaved
eyebrows or bleached eyebrows,

322
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:18,230
which is a sign of total sanity.
That's, I've got my shit together.

323
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,590
He loves horrified and he has a tank on.
He has,

324
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,850
he has manipulated. It's no longer
the tank you bought at the store.

325
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,770
He's, he's cut it. That's obviously with
a scissors. Oh, to make it even lower.

326
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,060
It's very low open tank on the front.

327
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,970
Hasn't waxed the shoulders lately.
Um,

328
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,400
something I need to do to pal. Uh, Dakota.

329
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,570
It's a really neat luck.
So a look, this is America.

330
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,020
How do you feel?

331
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,020
So the code is talking about right now
is that his gender pronouns are not an

332
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,720
option.
Right?

333
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,830
I just expect everyone in the
world to understand my identity.

334
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:05,960
I barely understand my identity,
my salary.

335
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,350
That's kind of weirdly fusing.
It's an equal to everyone ever to say.

336
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,850
Like I don't understand that either.
So then maybe,

337
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,250
well then here's the thing and I,
if you're not sure what what and who,

338
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,170
maybe hold off on demanding that everyone
stay updated with the pronouns to

339
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:27,400
refer to you as like maybe hold off until
you've decided and then make a formal

340
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:30,970
announcement and then stick to it
as an adult. You know what I mean?

341
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,650
One way of looking at it,
right.

342
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,830
I understand someone to respect them
or their wishes so I don't have to

343
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:42,030
understand what it is to be a black person
to speak respectfully to black people.

344
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,310
I'm pretty sure that you can do the same
for trans people specifically nonbinary

345
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,050
people.
We're not,

346
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,380
that's what I'm talking about because
I don't think there's any problem

347
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,870
understanding trans people
actually think there's

348
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,640
personally. I understand
nonbinary as a non binary person

349
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,820
this week am and I wish you
would respect my pronouns.

350
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,810
I've been eating a lot of oatmeal and
I'm identifying I'm oatmeal gendered.

351
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,470
Okay. Just if you could respect
that. I do respect it. Okay.

352
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,000
Is there honey on it?
Sometimes brown sugar,

353
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,480
sometimes it just, but
it, it just depends.

354
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,020
They're not trendy. We're not
interesting or something that you can um,

355
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,870
fetishize or try to, you
know, just fucking some.

356
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,010
It's just off. Just shut
the fuck up. Just stop.

357
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:45,320
We're not like so hard and difficult
difficulty mean in inconvenient.

358
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,830
Like imagine what it is to be me and then
you want to tell me how hard it is for

359
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:52,840
you to understand me and my pronouns.
Like wait,

360
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,140
what wage do you think that's helping
and what way do you think that that's

361
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:56,220
fucking appropriate?

362
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,370
Stop prioritizing your comfort as a
cis person over the struggles and the

363
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:06,330
respect and the wishes of trans people.

364
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,100
Your wrong.
So shut the fuck up.

365
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,090
We don't want to hear about how difficult
being around us and knowing us is. He's

366
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,990
not a trans man.

367
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,710
He's saying isn't he saying
he's non good is a good point.

368
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,200
I mean it seems like it's two different

369
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,390
arguments cause there's a trend.
There's, I understand transgendered,

370
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:32,070
I am a man transitioning to a woman or
I feel more like a woman. I'm a man.

371
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:35,610
If you live on the loan for the, he's
saying I'm opting out of both. I am non,

372
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,060
I just didn't know that that was
a neither. I didn't know either.

373
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:42,840
And I'm so happy for you that
you've found that, that thank you.

374
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,110
That is kind of the thing that is nice
for me to celebrate with another non

375
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:54,801
binary person is that we
get to finally say we are.

376
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,900
We think you mean they know we might sell,
but in your mind I need you.

377
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:05,580
I hope you're not saying she and
you're in your mind together. Are We?

378
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,880
And we get to,

379
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,350
we get to finally be in a place where
people are so focused on genders.

380
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,600
I know it's so exhausting
that there,

381
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,520
I know everyone's like noise.
What are you, I'm nothing neither.

382
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,890
It's not going to house.
Why don't you know that?

383
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,120
Would that being said, change your
language like no one is female.

384
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,620
No one is born a girl.
No one is any of that.

385
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,650
Like we are assigned genders at birth by
doctors who look at us and see certain

386
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:47,070
types of Genitalia and decide what our
identity will be from there on out.

387
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,290
That's an act of violence
that should be stopped.

388
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,210
That's not my fucking fault
that that happened and I'm

389
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:57,130
we, but sex is different than gender.
You're assigned a sex at birth,

390
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:58,060
he's saying,
but the,

391
00:27:58,061 --> 00:28:01,690
the doctor doesn't assign you a gender
identity that that's what you do.

392
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:05,830
They certainly do. Well, I'm sorry. Maybe
he, yeah, I thought it was the other way.

393
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,990
I didn't know. No, I guess the doc,

394
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,880
there's your faults prices.
I'm living outside of that, so

395
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,750
yeah. I told her I'm on board
with you dog. I think that
it is an act of violence.

396
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:22,340
When a doctor sees your penis and
testicles and says, you're a boy,

397
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,180
you know? Yeah. No, I, I know what
you're saying. Sorry. I'm not,

398
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,030
I don't mean to offend
they, it's, it's just like,

399
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,940
I guess I'm being really insensitive here
or a doctor pulls you out. He goes, oh,

400
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:40,750
we got got a pussy right here.
Has got to be a girl. Ah, no.

401
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,010
Well, how do you, how should we
messed up with Alice? We, we,

402
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,080
we gender identified him as a boy.
I know.

403
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:51,930
I'm putting him in football outfits
and stuff. Oh No. What shall we do?

404
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,430
We're messing him up.
We're messing him up.

405
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:58,220
I conforming to gender
em up the Hash Shit.

406
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,640
Should we start referring to him as them?
And they of course,

407
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,520
I don't want to confuse the kid.
Um, I would keep playing this video,

408
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,350
but I want to tear my fucking
eardrums out so you can. Um,

409
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,680
we'll put up a link to it later.
You know, and here's this, no one,

410
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:15,480
no one wants to hold anyone back.

411
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,140
I don't certainly deny
anybody whatever they are,

412
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,200
but I think to demand that everyone keep
up to speed with your gender identity

413
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:28,320
at every given moment. Yeah, I mean,
come on. That's a little unrealistic.

414
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:30,930
I just don't know what the
proper pronouns are all the time.

415
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,580
I think actually the reality is these
are just confused people, you know,

416
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,270
they're confused. These, I think
the, I think the folks that are like,

417
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:43,330
I'm astral gendered. No, they
need attention. That's different.

418
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,320
I think when someone's like, I'm a man
trapped in a woman's body that's legit.

419
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,320
Like if you're willing to cut her off
for some of you, but you don't even,

420
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,920
that's a real deal. Even have to go
that far. I think people just feel like,

421
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,930
I don't want it to surgically manipulate
myself, but I am in the wrong body.

422
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:03,010
I think that's totally,
but I think it's kind of,

423
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,940
it is a lot to ask for
you to look at like me,

424
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,870
like a guy with a beard and it'd be like,
it'd be like be go,

425
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,260
hey man, what the fuck are you? Why
are you calling me a man? I'm like,

426
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,650
oh sorry,
sorry.

427
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,030
Your acts of violence. Like
assuming that I'm a man. Yeah.

428
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,240
You kind of fit all the checkmarks so
yeah man with eye shadow and it's still

429
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,390
going to have you look at the
person we were just looking at it.

430
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,660
Most people would assume that's
a guy wearing eye shadow.

431
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,860
You don't go like that's
probably a nonbinary person.
No, you wouldn't know that.

432
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,510
Why would you assume that? God
Give us Allah, give us all a break.

433
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,810
Give us time to come around to
all the pronouns. We don't know.

434
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,200
The mainstream doesn't know
this stuff. No, no, you can't.

435
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:57,310
How are we supposed to
know? God Damn. It's a lot.

436
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,330
It's a lot to ask.

437
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,310
I W I wish we could show like my dad or
your dad that video and have them tell

438
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,460
us their feelings. I think I've
pretty much, I think I can sum it up.

439
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,400
What's that guy's a fag.

440
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,810
It doesn't guy does know it. Please. Okay.

441
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,320
I think that's what
everybody's dad would say.

442
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,550
Yeah. P is, he is a,

443
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,110
he's in a lot of pain and that guy,

444
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,850
that guy pacifically looks
like he's in a lot of turmoil.

445
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,520
He does.
He's not doing so well.

446
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,850
And the nails were painted and he
had a bunch of tattoos on his hands.

447
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,440
Like tattooed. I didn't they, they're
like weird marker drawings, you know,

448
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,850
you can deduce that he's in a lot of pain.
Yeah.

449
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,820
So Real,

450
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,810
real heartbreaking news for a
lot of listeners of the show.

451
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,640
Not that,
not Danny obviously,

452
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,630
but the hey hit the hill ever wasn't
bad girl that we played last week,

453
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,240
kicked off of Youtube.
What

454
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,940
some people actually heard her very
logical videos and flagged it as hate

455
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:19,660
speech.
Hurried him fucking boot.

456
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,440
Just, I don't know if she
was advocating violence,

457
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,580
but she was definitely in the,
uh,

458
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,850
in the school of,
hey,

459
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,610
why does this Hitler Guy have such a bad,
well,

460
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,940
I guess it'd be like isis putting
recruitment videos up on youtube.

461
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:41,630
We really don't allow that. It's
country. Um, that's, um, that's too bad.

462
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:43,950
I was really looking
forward to hearing her, um,

463
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,800
her other work on Saddam
Hussein or subscribe.

464
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,753
Jeez.

465
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,900
She's known as the valley on and she,

466
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,680
she had uploaded videos of her singing
happy birthday to Hitler and another

467
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,390
video on how to spot a Jew.

468
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,860
I know we didn't,
we didn't do that.

469
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,700
One other charming videos
include why Hitler wasn't evil,

470
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:15,701
which is what we played and how feminists
supported rape by causing the migrant

471
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:16,814
crisis.

472
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,430
That's her name and value
on the valley on a l.

473
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,960
E. V. A. L. I. O. N. She said to be
an 18 year old girl living in Canada.

474
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,070
And she, is she a patriots
cousin? Uh, patriotic.

475
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,310
I Dunno.
Pet put that down like shit.

476
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,200
The teenager openly admitted to
being a Holocaust denier. Oh,

477
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:47,000
cheese on April 20th. Oh Dude. She looks
like a just a regular teenage girl,

478
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,010
like a sweet blond, blue eyed. No,

479
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:53,150
she's got a Brunette so she's obviously
not as high up the food chain as she

480
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:53,331
thinks.

481
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,510
She should know that Hitler wouldn't
appreciate her cause she filmed herself

482
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:01,160
singing happy birthday in
front of a picture of the
Nazi shit bag as this is how

483
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:05,240
this is written here. Um,
she had baked for cupcakes,

484
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,710
decorated with swastikas. Um, she,

485
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,810
the channel was terminated
and then Youtube said that
channel was terminated by

486
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:18,770
us because it violated policies
against hate speech. Thank you.

487
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,420
I value one if I am.

488
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,590
I saw y'all many youtube videos.

489
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,090
Thank you for the cupcakes are delicious.
I please shut your mouth.

490
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,150
I am one of Y'all subscribers.
I enjoyed it very much.

491
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,270
At night I would watch the
videos and frank Stratton,

492
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,160
I played with my Schnitzel as I
listened to with your Schnitzel, dude.

493
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,930
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

494
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,330
Jamie just fixed my, uh, my uh, website.

495
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,510
He said it was back up.

496
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,850
So anyways, poor value. That's too bad.

497
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,820
She was really doing the Lord's work.
Really doing something there. Jesus.

498
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,290
Man,
what a nut.

499
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,630
She's gotta be mentally
ill, you think so? Um,

500
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,640
I did my own thing by the way.
Uh,

501
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,820
when I was in smear my
juice over the weekend,

502
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,580
I went on a local morning show.
Someone's doing their own thing. Do it.

503
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:31,940
God doing his own thing.
And uh,

504
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,780
this is one of the great local sports
local sports local shows where they have

505
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:42,330
the segment, uh, like old school, cheesy
music. This is the clip that I'm on.

506
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,860
It's like Tim and Eric

507
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,750
television credits that include
Conan comedy central live.

508
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,440
It got them like when
they use the old button.

509
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:58,670
Well that on your website
from 90 to Gotham.

510
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:01,370

Why are they,

511
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:06,260
what are they pulling from Wikipedia
or something? Look at this dog shit.

512
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,240
Wow. Oh my God, this is terrible.
The backdrop is dog shit.

513
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,950
American flag. This guy doesn't
have an upper lip. That staff there.

514
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:16,840

00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:16,650
He's extra and that's my birth. So fat I,

568
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,030
I had to ask [inaudible] I know.
That's what happens

569
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,180
to a comedian. Oh God. What do you
think's coming next? Here we go.

570
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:31,300
What do you think's coming next?
Million Dollars.

571
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,370
What's the meaning of life or Mary

572
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,630
to a comedian?

573
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,190
Do you guys make each other laugh all
the time? What are you talking about?

574
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:42,900
You think is going to ask that married to
a weird meeting. Yes. So she's a woman.

575
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,820
So is it, is it like just totally
hilarious at home there? Yeah.

576
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,250
Really low key.
Look at my reaction to that question.

577
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,490
Dead Pan Dj deadpan.
It's a,

578
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,430
you hate that.
A lot of laughs man.

579
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:03,350
Lot of smells that you smell your house.
So we have a baby. The kids. Yeah,

580
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,450
no it's one kid kid.
But he fought sometimes at all.

581
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,910
He didn't even want it all it takes,
yeah,

582
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,080
I mean there's a lot of action in
the home too. You know, like I got,

583
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,030
I got kids and she doesn't know about.

584
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,500
So sometimes when she's out of the House
I'll bring other kids over that are

585
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:23,940
older than our baby and they kind of
play in the house. Then they leave.

586
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,370
You know, I do know how it
goes. And speaking of House,

587
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:33,950
let's talk about your mom's house.
Your mom's house. That's a lot of fun.

588
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,540
It's the best man at your mom's
house. Podcasts. It's where, you know,

589
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,720
it's kind of like, it's, I feel like
this is the Bible for a lot of people.

590
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,780
You know, there's, we cover
the important issues, you know,

591
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,800
like likewhat farts.

592
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,590
We cover how you say that with just
such a straight face. So Mercer,

593
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,790
Mercer was the director. Oh, okay. Okay.

594
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,280
So they said he said something before
we rolled and I go, who is that?

595
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,660
She was as Mercer.
He's right

596
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,740
director. Okay. So that's why I shot
at him. Him All kinds of stuff, man.

597
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,760
We cover what was the thing this week.
But I,

598
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,000
I never had a job in my life until
I started doing this. You know,

599
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,020
I've been in that jail

600
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,620
now you walk around with her,
you know what I'm saying?

601
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,050
And Blend reached the pinnacle and so
good right there. I'm right there man.

602
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,920
My sensei. So Golf, uh,

603
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,850
I was telling me about the Buddha
nature is just to be in the moment.

604
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,480
So that's what I'm trying to do right now.
I think you're doing it really well.

605
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,860
She's grieving in the moment.
If you want to join some funny,

Once a week on Youtube.
So those are the original episodes.

620
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:45,650
People asked us for them
all the time and um,

621
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,360
they're gonna we're
starting with episode one.

622
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,960
Shut up. Yeah. Oh No. How embarrassing.
And it says back from red band days. Yes.

623
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,680
As red band. He said it's cool. Oh my God.

624
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,410
So some of these were videoed back in the
day. Some of them were, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

625
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,330
Wow.

626
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,000
So this is going to be,
yeah, this is going to be

627
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,410
how fucking horrible.
Where are we in episode one?

628
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:09,670
I bet I'll have mom embarrassed
already. You know what I'm saying? God,

629
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,460
that was the best one yet.
I like that one the best.

630
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,870
I feel like you've perfected how to do
it now. Like now you got your groove,

631
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:20,260
it's all, it's all your mom's house
nonsense. Yeah. And then they have

632
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,580
really funny how people react
to it who are not, who are,

633
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,240
who know, who know me from
a sand up. Yeah. But not the
podcast. And they're like,

634
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,010
they'll mess would be like,
what the fuck is this? You

635
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,140
know, they don't get
what's going on. Yeah.

636
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,320
That's kind of the enjoyment though
is it's, it's an inside joke,

637
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,850
but it's an inside job with like a few
hundred thousand people who other people

638
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:46,140
are just like, what is going
on? It's pretty crazy. The
podcast is really growing.

639
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,850
It's really kind of bizarre. Like now
I go around and people are like, Mommy.

640
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,750
And uh, I went to like a baby shower
and some total stranger was like,

641
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:58,110
I'm a huge mom's house man. Yeah.
What happened to me at the airport,

642
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,470
which is mommy's just so
crazy. It's cool. It's crazy.

643
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:05,730
Cause we started the show it
just in a Shitty, you know,

644
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,500
in our shitty house in Silver Lake
with the Lithuanian a neighbor.

645
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,530
You know what I mean? Like it's just
neat that it's grown to something.

646
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,070
And we would drive over it
up was burp bank berm. Yeah.

647
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,030
Did we do the first, we did the
first 40 episodes at red man's place.

648
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:25,890
That's right. A few of them were done.
That's right at the Ice House studio,

649
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,550
but most were done at,
at, at uh, at red band.

650
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:33,450
So when we started we would do one and
then be like next month we'll do another

651
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:33,780
one.

652
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah. There was no
schedule, you know? Yeah.

653
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,850
And then we learned that that was
important to drop it on the same day.

654
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,460
It's very important.

655
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,660
People don't know how to find young stuff
and those classic jeans are going to

656
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:46,320
be released every Thursday
on the youtube channel. Cool.

657
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:47,460
So there is a schedule for that too.

658
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,530
There's always something
fun at the Youtube Channel.

659
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:50,940
There's like behind the scenes

660
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,600
and on top of that, uh,
petrout launches June 1st.

661
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:57,310
So if the,

you'll get access and
you'll get extra content.

672
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,130
One of the things we're definitely going
to do is a watch Steven Seagal movies,

673
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,200
um, and comment on those. But, uh, the

707
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,190
[inaudible] magnet going in and we can of,

708
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,490
so then coming back to your homies
and shit. I'm telling you man,

709
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,060
call me [inaudible] you need
anything? Call you. Okay,

710
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,170
but isn't there a point,

711
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,610
this is what I keep saying is it isn't
there a point through all these phone

712
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:08,820
calls when you never get, cause you
never obviously gets the call back.

713
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,200
There has to be some point where he's,

714
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:13,830
maybe she sees Salami and then
at that point isn't it like,

715
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,140
isn't there ever an exchange about hey,

716
00:49:16,141 --> 00:49:18,970
you know how you get my
message about that, or yeah,

717
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,310
my medicine or I told you that yesterday
and then you know what might happen?

718
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:28,311
Is it Salamay might be so sick that when
this person see Salamay and mentions

719
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,340
that insomnia goes, you didn't fucking
call me. They go to me so crazy.

720
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:34,950
Right now she's, she's got
dementia. She's, you know,

721
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,020
she doesn't even know that
I called her earlier. Wow.

722
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,460
I see. I think Solomon is our
age. Do you think so? Yeah.

723
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:45,461
For some reason I think this is a maternal
figure to Salome and this might be

724
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:49,520
like a kid and that's why I've
always pictured sodomy is all, no,

725
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:53,240
I think [inaudible] is younger
and that's why she kind of gives,

726
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,140
I think it's a boy to a pass
because all, you know, Silo May,

727
00:49:57,141 --> 00:50:00,260
he's always out having fun.
And then here's Friday. Yeah.

728
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,440
Yes. Oh man, that ass, I mean
Arigato Heidi, Daniel as one line.

729
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,370
I mean n e m

730
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,770
a new area clean only bacterial AskPat
and maybe I believe in that software.

731
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,260
Can I'm, I'm good. I'm
back to normal again.

732
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:25,200
I don't have any new [inaudible].

733
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:25,930
I know.

734
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,590
Whichever one spending gives it up all
in bacteria in your body and from the EEC

735
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:35,430
is from inside you as no holiday.
I'm telling you my little too.

736
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,073
Okay.
Do you get it?

737
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:43,110
Yeah. See it's, it's a, I
think she's an attorney,

738
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,100
was going to give it up.

739
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:47,770
All the bacteria in your body
and strongly easy is from inside.

740
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,670
You know, holiday. I'm telling you
my little tool kit. Okay. Do you

741
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,570
imagine Jack, he has lots of information
again to give you a ride there.

742
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,730
Can you take care of what
one of you talk to some cause

743
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,010
plants you shouldn't eat. Just how bad.

744
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,340
Crazy bright there. The answer's probably
like, motherfucker, that's 400 messages.

745
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,600
Well the thing is they're clearly
communicating in between because she knows

746
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:19,640
salamis not feeling well and it's
a bacterial infection. Right? And,

747
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,500
and she keeps asking about the lease.

748
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:25,280
This is the second or third
thing about a lease agreement.

749
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,980
So maybe he's in real estate or
something or they're renting a property.

750
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,570
She's kind of all that bacteria though,
man.

751
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,740
You gotta you gotta get rid of that
bacteria from the inside out. I like that.

752
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:38,880
She specified that from the outside.
[inaudible] Sullivan.

753
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:44,070
Tallow may take the fucking bills.
Jesus wanna know Solomon,

754
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:48,060
you should tell your mom that you
changed your number, buddy. Yeah.

755
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,400
Should we call him personally lady back?

756
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,820
I think at this point maybe we should
just do it on your mom's house. What?

757
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,330
We do it right now. Oh, I'm
so nervous. What do we say?

758
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,560
I mean, do you want to just, we shouldn't
keep this going to tell them was sick.

759
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,690
Okay. All right. Let's call
the Persian lady. Oh my God.

760
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,420
Alright. Hopefully what happens
so nervous. Talk to her.

761
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:14,160
I feel like we know each other.
I know.

762
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,080
Do you speak Farsi? I speak for, I see it.

763
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,770
She's not answering. Check. She doesn't
recognize a Skype number. I know.

764
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:28,920
Okay.

765
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,520
Say, let's call from my phone, but
then how do we record the call?

766
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:38,743
Oh,

767
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,360
that is fucking voice.
That's her voice mail.

768
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:52,030
Always feeling message. Three
meows. Dude. Are we being pranked?

769
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,800
Maybe it's somebody's fucking with us.
That could be,

770
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,080
give me your phone. I'm going
to try it from your phone. Yeah,

771
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,870
but then we want to record the
call in case. Solemnly answer.

772
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:03,900
She answers what will
should not be able to,

773
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,080
we can't record this on for your mom's
house. We can't. How can we record?

774
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,900
I don't understand why that
wouldn't record though. Wait,

775
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:13,600
if you call from my
phone, I don't know. Shit.

776
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,740
I think it would still recall you're
plugging in. Oh, I see what you're doing.

777
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,590
Yeah, I can try that.
Yeah. Let's see. Do you,

778
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:25,350
that was the craziest fucking
voicemail ever. Three meals.

779
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:26,520
This woman's out of her mind.

780
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,340
That's why she doesn't know of Salo
may calls her back. That's right.

781
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,730
She's fucking crazy. Dude.
That's so true. Let's see.

782
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,960
So you have this word [inaudible].

783
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:42,080
Oh my gosh. Wait, are you going to,

784
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,890
are you going to do it on? Not on
speaker phone. Oh, there you go. Hello.

785
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,960
You have to wait for someone to pick
up first before you say Hello Dad. No,

786
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:53,794
I had the uh,

787
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,003
hello.

788
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,790
Yeah, I pushed the buttons. How are you
not gonna Answer Solomon Calling? Yeah,

789
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:02,690
just keep it going.

790
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:15,120
Raising. Well, now here's the thing. We
just, yeah, we told him he just can't it.

791
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:19,870
Bang. Yeah. We just get back up there.
Shit. We just tried to put an end to end.

792
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:23,900
Now we've made a wide, you're going
to get a definite fucking, uh,

793
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,770
know she voicemail my legs. I
saw man, I miss the fucking car.

794
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,570
Oh yeah. Three me hours. Three meows man.

795
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,970
And I feel like it was her
making the Miao sounds.

796
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,780
I don't think that was a cat there.
No, Babe. I don't think that was a cat.

797
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,130
Jesus. Oh, it's crazy.
Yeah. She's real crazy.

798
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,170
How's intense?

799
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:53,010
Oh, so weird. Is that my
friend Sarah could be steroids.

800
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:57,380
Are you doing this? She's a
big meal. I saw them. Yeah.

801
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:02,310
Make CD downstairs. I know. We got to play
at one day. We've made that years ago.

802
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,860
I know when we were touring.
Yeah.

803
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:09,540
We actually went into a recording studio
and meowed songs with Sarah Burns.

804
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,500
It was fun.

805
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,640
They still remember me when I went back
to record to to like do my comedy album.

806
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:17,820
My second one. They're like, I
remember you. You did the meal songs.

807
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:24,060
Hey can we talk about my shit yesterday?
Oh,

808
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,780
okay.
Uh,

809
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
what you act like we don't talk
about the stuff on the show

810
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,253
next door.

811
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,030
Brown Todd Brown jar coming up.

812
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,563
Okay.

813
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,820
I just have a question for you.
Sure.

814
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,510
So okay,

815
00:55:49,511 --> 00:55:52,540
I'm going to explain the situation and
then you kind of tell me your thoughts on

816
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,520
it.
Like I'm going to walk you through it.

817
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:59,860
So I was alone with ls. It was Sunday
morning. You hadn't come home yet.

818
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,490
Right? And I drank, my company
selling guy was out drinking.

819
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,700
You were out getting hammered partying.
How'd you come home yet?

820
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,850
Hadn't come home yet.
You're worthless guy.

821
00:56:09,851 --> 00:56:14,320
And then I drink my coffee so I usually
get my cup of coffee ready. I drink it.

822
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:18,190
I go in to get Ellis in the morning. I
wake him up, I feed him, I diaper him,

823
00:56:18,191 --> 00:56:20,380
I bring him downstairs and
then I feed the dogs. Anyway,

824
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,750
I go on to Alyssa's room and I've already,

825
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:26,170
I'm like three quarters of the way
through my coffee. I don't really do that.

826
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:30,940
Normally I feed him and just
as I'm about to change him,

827
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,950
I feel the urge to shit. The problem is,
and you know this since I've given birth,

828
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,930
is that I have a really hard time
holding in my stools and that they go,

829
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,510
it's immediately, we'll have to
shit now I really have the shit.

830
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:48,370
And so I was like panicked trying to
change his diaper and like I change him.

831
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,260
I'm like Oh my God. Oh my God,
I'm going to shit my pants.

832
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:51,220
I didn't know what to do.

833
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,850
My back was hurting so I couldn't just
put them in the crib and go shit cause my

834
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:58,660
backup fucked up in tennis. So I'm like,
oh my God, what do I do? So I hurry,

835
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:04,000
I diaper him. I, we know run
downstairs, I put them in the swing,

836
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:07,710
I strapped him in and then I go
take a shit downstairs. Right.

837
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,420
And it was a lot.

838
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:15,530
It was like a number four and it was
like two number four logs. Yeah. There,

839
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,510
here's the problem.

840
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,000
I went to wipe and it was like a fucking,

841
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,020
like a melted Hershey's
kiss in the toilet paper.

842
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:34,170
It was so narrowly, I like, you
know when you do that first why but,

843
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:37,980
and you're like, oh my God.
Yeah. Oh my God, that is so much.

844
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:43,350
And now normally I would just go into
the shower and fuck my stoma. Yeah.

845
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:49,000
But thankfully the other day and I just
bid day the shit out of it and then like

846
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,940
shit out of my shit and
then I wiped it clean.

847
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,340
But why do you think that happens to me?
Do you think that that's a uh,

848
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,780
post-pregnancy thing?
Does that happen to you ever?

849
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,651
Well,
first of all,

850
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:02,950
I just want to say I'm really glad you
asked this question and I appreciate all

851
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:07,540
the details. Um, that was really
matter because it was, it was good.

852
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:10,680
It was because I held it in a little bit
longer than I normally would came out

853
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:14,300
mushy. Yeah. That's interesting.
Um, I think, you know,

854
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:19,450
it's a real neat, the, that you,
that you told us all those details,

855
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:23,980
pool pool. Um, but that's
pertinent to the case Brown lock.

856
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,250
It's not like random. It's
a good point. Um, yeah,

857
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:30,460
I think it's a combination
of you probably you were,

858
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,630
you said you were holding it in, you're
probably drinking coffee. Yeah. Um,

859
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,070
and you know,

860
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:41,310
maybe maybe a little bit
of what you ate at the,

861
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:47,920
at the previous meal. Do you remember?
Do you recall what you ate? Yes.

862
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,000
Counselor. What did you have?
Well, Brown previous meal,

863
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,031
Brown luck.

864
00:58:53,031 --> 00:58:58,031
I went to a Vegan baby shower or
vegetarian baby shower and I had a lot of

865
00:58:58,731 --> 00:59:03,731
different bean varieties and I think
that may have contributed to my powerful

866
00:59:05,991 --> 00:59:10,190
for yeah. And the coffee too,
definitely contributed to,

867
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,530
he makes it different. Holding it in. I
think the holding it in was really cool.

868
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:17,450
What you're saying is, yeah, it's a
combination of things is holding it in.

869
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:18,500
It's gonna make it worse though.

870
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,190
Wait, but why is the
wipe, it wasn't diarrhea.

871
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:26,510
So why was the wipe so
unclean? That's like,

872
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,260
I'm serious.
Why am I not pinching off alone?

873
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:35,390
Clean the machine. It was mushy. You
didn't have just normal logs, right? No,

874
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:40,160
you couldn't have, they were fours. They
were perfect. I mean words are perfect,

875
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:45,810
perfect logs. They were a little hotter
than normal, but I don't know if that,

876
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,303
yeah,

877
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,730
they're an exemplary for like
if you kind of look at this,

878
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:54,990
they were a little hotter
and a little more torn,

879
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,060
but that heat means that they weren't
perfect because perfect ones aren't hot.

880
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,670
Hot indicates that it's a
little higher up on that scale.

881
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,800
You're probably looking at like a
five and a five and a half, you know,

882
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:12,260
broken pieces. There were a solid.
But if their heaters like that,

883
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:14,570
that means something's up that you know,

884
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,310
you can always tell the heat
factor means this is not 100%

885
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:25,520
and I think it probably has to do with
the fact that you were having a lot of

886
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,430
veggies.
And I'll tell you what happened to me.

887
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,140
I was in smear my juice and I went,

888
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,610
I had three,

889
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:39,670
four meals at a Vegan restaurant and
I got to say I really enjoyed it,

890
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:42,650
man. Really, really enjoyed it. It was,

891
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,920
it was good food and I didn't do it
because I was on some mission to eat that

892
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:52,130
way. It was purely out of
convenience and then it was good.

893
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,240
So I stayed at a hotel
and right next door,

894
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,380
let's see,
I'll see if I can plug the place,

895
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,740
see what you get back to you.

896
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:08,270
But what you're saying that the log was
a little hot and torn and that's why it

897
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:12,130
just wouldn't break clean
because of the texture on hearts.

898
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,830
A lark strong hearts cafe is where I went.
But I'm asking you,

899
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:17,300
it's the texture of the law.

900
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:22,330
You're saying something that could
clench it off and leaves behind Mush.

901
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:29,870
You held loud. He had mud
but, and then I know those,

902
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:34,100
I know those, you know the, the real
blessing and in the skies was though.

903
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:38,180
What's that? That you were home.
I know I've had those in public

904
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,080
cause then you're wiping and wiping and
wiping. AndW and then somebody goes,

905
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,440
can I eat your ass and go, you
sure you want to do that, right?

906
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:53,810
It happens every night. The Persian,
he's calling back, calling back.

907
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:59,480
Oh. Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck.
How did my phone just shut down?

908
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,830
So weird. We're definitely going
to have a voicemail right now,

909
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,050
man. Anyway, so the phone starting,

910
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:11,270
tell me more about your brand's
story and then we'll go back. Well,

911
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:13,340
so I ate these vegan meals.
First of all,

912
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:15,920
I just want to give a plug
to Vegan eating for a second.

913
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,730
They were delicious meals at, like I
said, strong hearts cafe in Syracuse,

914
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:25,480
smear my juice. And secondly, um,

915
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,370
it has doubled when you eat vegan
and it's good. You just feel good.

916
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,380
I was feeling good after meals. That's so
bad. Venus, you know, there's no bloat.

917
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:38,640
There's no like, uh, hitting you like, uh,

918
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,120
you know, when you
travel. Yeah. Road food.

919
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:47,300
You can even go to a great restaurant
and be like, Oh God. Oh yeah. So much,

920
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,690
you know, heaviness to it. You know,
the truth of it is the less you eat,

921
01:02:50,691 --> 01:02:55,190
the better you feel. And the
lighter you eat. More veggies,

922
01:02:55,191 --> 01:02:59,870
more fruits. But his real, she
left a voicemail. Oh, okay.

923
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:03,440
Let's hear it. Um, fuck
can, I do want to say this.

924
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:08,410
I didn't have crazy dumps.
Really. I had a lot of farts. Huh?

925
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:12,500
Dude, it's shutting down
again. That's weird. This so,

926
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:15,410
but you didn't have a crazy
dump after four vegan meals.

927
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:16,743
Yeah.

928
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,363
Isn't that crazy?

929
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:23,730
I think you need to wait a little bit
because you really react poorly to

930
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:28,300
veggies. Right. But I didn't, I'm
saying I had normal bowel movements,

931
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,960
but a lot of farts. I mean, oh

932
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,153
Huh.

933
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,980
That's a neat story. Yeah. I mean

934
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,643
it was,

935
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:45,300
it was note worthy. Can I tell
you my favorite new game that, um,

936
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:50,360
ls plays with us is pull daddy's beard.
Oh my God.

937
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:53,600
It makes me laugh.
Florida just, I hugged me.

938
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:56,960
Absolutely love it when he hugs
my face. So flea takes both. Hey,

939
01:03:56,961 --> 01:04:01,330
he has a strong grip and he
pulls me towards him by my beard.

940
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:06,220
It's so painful and the only person on
earth that I wouldn't punch in the mouth

941
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:10,280
of doing it is my son.
Everybody else I would stab immediately,

942
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:15,050
but he pulled me. I'm like,
ah, it's so funny. Drags me.

943
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:19,610
And then you go his mouth. Well,
something's going on with this.

944
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,960
When I plug it in, it shuts down. Yeah.
Mean I could try it again. That's bizarre.

945
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:27,530
But that's happened twice right now.
So I wonder what's going on. Let's see.

946
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:31,280
You Shit. So how are we going to play
Salamay if it shuts down every time. No.

947
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,510
Okay. It didn't shut down right
there. Okay. Um, let's see.

948
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:39,500
She's gonna be pissed. Oh, she's
going to be pissed. Here we go.

949
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:50,730
Let's see. Not playing. I bet there.

950
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,710
Yeah. She left for a second
voicemail, but it's not playing.

951
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,090
[inaudible] [inaudible] bacteria.

952
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,630
Yeah.

953
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:04,130
I not plain bacterial
infection. Is it on, you know,

954
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,820
the line is working. It's
so weird. I know. Planned.

955
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:13,370
Gosh. See, this is why
we need blue ban here.

956
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:17,610
Why don't you just unplug it and push
play and put it up to the microphone. Oh,

957
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,500
again, it started it
again. No, no, no. Oh,

958
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:25,501
the pub in the Della Mae
measured [inaudible].

959
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,700
Bizarre. Bizarre, bizarre, bizarre. No,

960
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:33,440
I remember playing the Shish
Kebab and Kabobs. Ah, who
knows. Why don't we try it?

961
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:37,880

963
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:48,390
Wow. Fuck it. Okay. Well, uh, let me
restart the phone. Maybe that'll help.

964
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:53,640
Oh well hold on. Give it a minute. Is
My phone still like starting? Okay,

965
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:59,060

How's King asked ripper are doing.

972
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,880
We haven't really checked in with him
in a while. Oh, it's been a long time.

973
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:34,680
Been a long time. He's a, I
mean he's still the master.

974
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:38,280
I don't know. She'll be on youtube
or is he kicked off right now?

975
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,200
He always goes back and forth.

976
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,030
let's see you to see if he's there.

977
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:47,310

Hmm.

978
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:54,200
Anyways, I love Alice new game with you.
That shit makes me laugh so hard, dude.

979
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,040
I love that. He just tortures you so
funny. And then he pulls my hair too,

980
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:02,200
which is awesome. Every time you
lean down to give him a Zuber,

981
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,060
he pulls your hair. It's so fun
to get to sign in to see this one.

982
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,540
It's always a good sign.
Yeah.

983
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:14,541
Let's see what I want to have

985
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,930
just to answer on speakerphone.
You know,

986
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,033
I think he's missing

987
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,990
Dan.
I wasn't Raunchy as far.

988
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,580
Okay, there you go. Yeah,
this is King Ash. Unofficial,

989
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:40,990
so I don't think that's his page.
We don't subscribe to it and goes,

990
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:45,830
he wouldn't go by that. Let's
see. Here he is. Oh, I love it.

991
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,003
The stairs,

992
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:55,250
those set ups are the best
now. He's so clever. Yeah.

993
01:07:55,790 --> 01:08:00,440
Well. Um, yeah he was, the only thing
that sucked about was trying to,

994
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:05,470
he was like the lochness monster cause
it was switching accounts under a new

995
01:08:05,511 --> 01:08:09,200
name area and grows king asked ripper
the FARC guide or whatever. You know,

996
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:13,940
he's always something and I wish we
could just lock down where he's at,

997
01:08:13,941 --> 01:08:16,280
you know. Well you, some people

998
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:21,280
don't want the fame and the glory
that being on your mom's house brings.

999
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,540
Okay.
Yeah.

1000
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,680
We have made people famous on the show
and maybe he doesn't want that and that

1001
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:31,610
kind of spotlight the limelight. But
do you feel like he was doing that? Um,

1002
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:37,910
before he was on like he was always
switching accounts? I don't know. Yeah,

1003
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:41,840
maybe he's crazy too.
That's not a normal cause.

1004
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:46,230
What was the other site that used to
have all the time live leak, leak? Well,

1005
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,070
let me see if I can play
this. Hold on. Yeah.

1006
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,900
Now my voicemails fucked up word.

1007
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,730
Oh it was, I fart in Yo face. I
used to be his right. His thing.

1008
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,480
Oh Man.

1009
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,640
It's like, yeah, it's true.

1010
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,330
It's really like trying to track down
like a mythical creature or something. No.

1011
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,800
Well that's the beauty of him.
That's the,

1012
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,410
let's see if he's back on there.
Nope.

1016
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:31,820
I doubt. Yeah. She's at the door
though. She's going to, yeah.

1017
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,860
I don't know if she's just sniffing
now. That's not an, I have to.

1018
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,190
Okay.

1019
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:43,390
Peace Now. We just had to replace a
couch because of her as fucking dog.

1020
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:47,200
You know that we just got the new
couch on Sunday cause she ran,

1021
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:51,970
she took a pen and ate
up a brand new couch.

1022
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:53,020
So we got in living room,

1023
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:58,380
inked it all up by chewing it on the
cushion and drawing it and it was the,

1024
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,510
I'll tell you have, you know, every time
you buy something now where people go,

1025
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,070
Oh, do you want a warranty? You know,
and try to sell you. If you buy,

1026
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:14,430
if you buy a fucking an
extension cord that best buy,

1027
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:17,500
they'll go to one of the warranty. You
pay this money, you're like, no dude.

1028
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:22,630
But with this couch we did it and
the week or two after we bought it,

1029
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:27,430
there's just ink everywhere and it was
actually worth it to have them throw once

1030
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:31,240
and now we've replaced an entire couch
and thank God we bought that warranty.

1031
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,880
Thank God we'd be stuck with that
couch and I wouldn't buy another one.

1032
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:40,790
No ridiculous. Yeah, no, we just have
our ink stained couch. I know. And now I,

1033
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:44,650
I bought insurance on that.
The replaced couch just to me.

1034
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:50,080
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Okay. What are you doing?

1035
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:53,080
No idea what Solomon is up too,
Huh? No, I stopped playing.

1036
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,400
Well, we're just going to
have to figure this out later

1037
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:02,520
and you want to show
you something? Yeah. Um,

1038
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:08,490
tell me what you think of
this.

1039
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,010
Told me I can't come to fucking

1040

You want to fucking sell it right now?

You fucking beat me. No, fuck
no. Fuck you motherfucker.

1042
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:24,143
Fuck you.

1043
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:29,280
Huh? This is a normal arm wrestling
match. Okay. It's pretty intense.

1044
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:33,000
A little,
it's really fired up this guy.

1045
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:37,950
You were fat, stupid scheming
on my fucking ass. Bitch.
Bring your fucking shit.

scared. Scary Shit. I'm fucking here. Huh?

1047
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,110
You told me I couldn't fuck coastal
something out. Bitch. Come on.

1048
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:48,840
Fucking spitting on you bitch.
Can't take that shit. Fuck you.

1049
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,480
Fuck y'all were you called
them on my tone bitch.

1050
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:57,310
Wear a condom on my Tony.
You know it's fun.

1051
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:01,480
You get that jacked up now
you don't win. Oof. Oh yeah.

1052
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:04,750
This guy's full of rage at arm wrestling.

1053
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:09,670
Maybe a more aggressive Ah,
a sport that you can utilize.

1054
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,440
Pretty aggressive sports.
Higher Body. Yeah, but he's,

1055
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,430
he wants to punch him right now.
I think this soggy needs out.

1056
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,090
She's being a little weird. Okay. Okay.
Let me, uh, let me let her go. All right.

1057
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,610
The bachelor's. You took her
out. She went pee pee. Um,

1058
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,890
let's finish this arm wrestling.
Stupid dog. I'm really anxious.

1059
01:12:26,891 --> 01:12:28,990
I think the guy that's losing
his mind is going to lose.

1060
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,240
I didn't want to fucking filled out

1061
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:43,880
all the table. The Shit.
All the fucking table. Big,

1062
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,790
small. The motherfucker. I'm not fucking
invited. You're not fucking invited bitch,

1063
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:48,653
Huh?
Yeah.

1064
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,030
Shit.
I'm on the phone.

1065
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,123
No

1066
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,170
kidding.
What happened?

1067
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:14,070
He lost the match and then
he swung at the fuses.

1068
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:16,850
That is fucking hilarious.

1069
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,453
Wow.

1070
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:26,610
He got thrown on the ground.
Oh my God.

1071
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,000
Oh my God. These are crazy. Somebody, uh,

1072
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,570
they've got their panties in a bunch,
you know.

1073
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,940
Fuck. You're wearing it on
your phone. I'm on my toes.

1074
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:42,430
Yeah. Jeez. I feel like
that all the time. You know,

1075
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,890
aggressive. No, just like I
want condoms on my tongue.

1076
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:50,770
It was good down or you know,
stupid. As the master of accidents.

1077
01:13:50,771 --> 01:13:55,750
I'm always looking at studying
other accents. This guy,

1078
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,760
he's Asian.

1079
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:04,220
I'm at the stay away fishing and yeah,
I never seen shit like this before.

1080
01:14:04,221 --> 01:14:09,060
Okay. Yeah. Agent. I'm black bolts
with goddamn serious talent. Blacks.

1081
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:09,894
This shit.

1082
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,040
You Never Asian people

1083
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,330
talking black like that.
Oh, it's Texas now.

1084
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:20,670
It's for Shanaze let it go. Of course.
I'm going to let it go. This is like,

1085
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:24,690
this is an Asian guy. Oh my
God. Watch this shit. Why?

1086
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,840
It's weird.
Here he is again.

1087
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:34,740
I want you to know that this man did
this shit with biting our nails and not

1088
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:39,180
paying a nail all living. You all
need a medic, you but this shit.

1089
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:43,610
So the guy is a nail tech.
Hilarious. He's like,

1090
01:14:43,611 --> 01:14:47,780
he's like two nephrons stereotypes in one.
It's amazing.

1091
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,440
It's incredible.
Amazing.

1092
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:54,440
You don't see that usually you don't
see that many Asian dudes talking back

1093
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:57,740
talking black. He's just
sounds southern, right? Oh No,

1094
01:14:57,741 --> 01:14:59,240
I think he sounds like Medea.

1095
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:02,900
I think he's doing a Medea and you know
used to watch all her movies and the

1096
01:15:02,901 --> 01:15:06,440
dead and you haven't put one out in oil.
You never talk about him anymore.

1097
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,930
Well I haven't had much time with the kid.

1098
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:13,320
The baby kind of messed up my
Medea watching. But you know,

1099
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:18,340
you and I got into a show and to the
Americans and there's a guy on there,

1100
01:15:18,801 --> 01:15:23,720
Gregory, who I recognize. I
thought, I know this guy's
face, man. It was killing me.

1101
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:28,370
I looked it up and he was in a Medea
movie. That's how I know him from.

1102
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,560
You were saying that I recognize them too,
but it wasn't from a dia,

1103
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,070
so as I was like, what would we see for
it? You Go, Oh yeah, Medea. I'm like, no,

1104
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:41,210
it's not what I'm talking about.
You would know from that.

1105
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,390
I don't know what's up with Tyler
Perry. I haven't heard of it. I just,

1106
01:15:44,391 --> 01:15:47,960
I just haven't heard. I'm sure
he's still doing a million things.

1107
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:53,620
He produces tons of very successful
as jeans are always up there.

1108
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:58,900
I like the Medea Christmas stuff
and I love Madea goes to jail.

1109
01:15:59,151 --> 01:16:02,480
I think the, no, the family reunion.
That one's actually my favorite one.

1110
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,760
That's your favorite one?
Yeah, my Angela's in it.

1111
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:09,470
You know that she's in the
Maya Angelou that yes. Yup.

1112
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,850
She's like black Yoda. She fucking
tells him what's up. It's awesome. Oh,

1113
01:16:13,851 --> 01:16:18,590
you wanna read some Fan Mail? I
do, yeah. Go ahead. Okay, hold on.

1114
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,980
Oh, there we go. Look at this guy.

1115
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:26,660
Been using your Amazon link to buy stuff
for a while. How about a shutout for us?

1116
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:31,400
Buying Lube? Yeah, you got
it. We, that's so weird. Okay.

1117
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:37,160
64 ounces. She keep my Ding Dong.
It's what he says. How do you say?

1118
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,170
Amazing. Thank you Chris. Thank you.
Thanks Chris. Um, we've got another one.

1119
01:16:42,171 --> 01:16:44,990
I'm a bisexual polyamorous
bear with two boyfriends.

1120
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:50,210
I'd be happy to answer literally any
questions also, I love your show so much.

1121
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:55,360
I would not hesitate to marry it and make
it part of my poly pile. Smack Hound.

1122
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,420
Thanks. Smack Erin. Yeah.
Can I ask you something?

1123
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:04,810
Polyamorous bear with two boyfriends
now you refer to them kind of equally to

1124
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:06,830
boyfriends.
I understand in the,

1125
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,670
in the polyamorous community you
say you have your, that's his,

1126
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:13,400
he was looking right. Oh Geez.
Am I my phone case? Great. Uh,

1127
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:15,860
but usually they say I have
a primary and a secondary,

1128
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:19,670
but I noticed that you kind of equate
your two boyfriends. So how has that work?

1129
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,540
I would ask that. Good question. And
why don't you read the third one? Yeah.

1130
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,900
When Christina was talking
about European nudity,

1131
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,910
I was just chuckling,

1132
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:33,530
but I can say with a lot of certainty
that Polish people both in Poland and

1133
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:38,420
living in the UK would freak out if
you are walking around and just your

1134
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:42,830
underwear. Nudity is Devo, not normal.

1135
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:47,510
Maybe they were in it called
hippie in the cult. Slash. Hippy.

1136
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:51,890
It sounds funny though. Piece and much
love Malar I think. No. Yeah. Well listen,

1137
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,990
uh,
me Milosh I am not a fucking Polak.

1138
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,190
I'm Hungarian and I tell you,

1139
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:02,390
if you go to Hungary and you go to the
[inaudible] hotel and you go to a thermal

1140
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:06,380
bath, uh, which is the most popular
thing you can do in Budapest,

1141
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:09,440
that you have to go nude budget.

1142
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:14,530
What Mila is pointing out is then
we're really adamant about European,

1143
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:18,590
European, European euro. No.
Did any Europe in Europe,

1144
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:21,240
US Europeans in Europe.

1145
01:18:21,241 --> 01:18:25,160
Here we are all naked all the time.

1146
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:29,360
And was telling you that
that is not the case.

1147
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,080
Also too, I believe we're just
more comfortable with nudity.

1148
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:37,700
And I say that because look,
you try the TV at 10:00 PM in Europe,

1149
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:42,200
Western Europe, you know, and there's
tents on TV and commercials for like,

1150
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,510
you know,
fucking lollipop commercials.

1151
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:47,270
There's a girl with her
tits out or whatever.

1152
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,790
So I'm just saying,

1153
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,810
and there's tits and magazines like
normal magazines in England. By the way,

1154
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:58,250
those lad mags, yeah, they
show their tits. Okay.

1155
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,960
Okay. So, uh, yeah.

1156
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,633
MMM.

1157
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,310
Why don't you read the,

1158
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,630
this one?

1159
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,800
Hi, Mommy's here too. Hi, Mommy's,

1160
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:16,970
I noticed you guys talking about
flippers on a few of the last episodes.

1161
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:21,530
So for those of you don't know what
those are, flippers are like retainers.

1162
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,210
What is she doing now? Do you hear
her course out here? Does she,

1163
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:29,790
who fucking knows?
We just have a distracter uh,

1164
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:34,280
flippers are like fake teeth. Uh, it's
a retainer with a tooth or two on it.

1165
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,880
And that's what people do. Instead of
replacing teeth, they'll get a retainer.

1166
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:41,320
And I had a cousin that did that for
a few years. So this person writes,

1167
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:45,710
I make a lot of these pieces of
shit as I work for a dental lab.

1168
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,820
You would not believe what some trashy
people ask for with these things.

1169
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:53,570
Some include gold front
teeth with dollar signs.

1170
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:57,740
Some even want a picture of their
ugly kids put on. Oh my God.

1171
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:01,430
Like they're proud to show off how
poorly they take care of their teeth.

1172
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:05,450
Feel free to ask any more questions
you have in the dental world.

1173
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,540
I'm also poly by,
and when I tell people how it worked,

1174
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:12,770
they look at me like I just burped in
their faces anyway. High and tight.

1175
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,020
You fellow mommy. Nick. Hello. Oh,

1176
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,350
that's so finally hate Hitler.
Yeah.

1177
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,960
Longtime listener from the days you
lived in the ghetto and your neighbor's

1178
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:25,140
stench would come through your
walls. Yup. It's been so long.

1179
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:29,110
That's how I remember the story. Being
a gay man and having many bear friends.

1180
01:20:29,111 --> 01:20:33,120
See, I would have to say Tom is
definitely a California grizzly

1181
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:37,740
care. He is very comfortable
with his primitive ways,

1182
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,870
marking his territory with his boogers
and making brown ferocious. Yeah.

1183
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:46,350
Throughout the day. Otherwise we
would just call him a Pooh bear. Yeah,

1184
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:50,790
because he is cuddly and
likes to eat a lot. You sure?

1185
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,230
Oh my gosh. You know, it's weird.

1186
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:54,570
I was reading Winnie the
Pooh last night to the kid.

1187
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,043
Oh,

1188
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,380
it has the noise box. That's one
of them. One of them in the store,

1189
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:03,010
like Winnie the Pooh sees his friends

1190
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:11,770
and I thought you're the Pooh bear. You
do remind me of pool. Yes sir. Yes, sir.

1191
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:17,140
Equine diarrhea, diarrhea.
Is that on there? Oh yeah,

1192
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,460
I would have added a died down.

1193
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,290
Well, I don't know. Why is it just
the music? I don't know. That's weird.

1194
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:32,430
I don't know.

1195
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:37,430
First we have to understand
the characteristics of
normal equine to Kate fecal

1196
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:38,400
balls,

1197
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:43,400
loose stool Spico balls that have excess
water before or after the application.

1198
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:47,610
Cow Pie, watery diarrhea or
even projectile diarrhea,

1199
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,490
projectile diarrhea,
projectile diarrhea,

1200
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,020
fecal matter or fecal fluid that's dried
on the horses. Russia, crime, diarrhea.

1201
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,040
Wayne,
diarrhea,

1202
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,210
diarrhea by an access of water
or fluid in the horse's stool.

1203
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,540
Darn. That's a good, yeah, it's good.

1204
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:11,050
Yeah. Yeah. Let's see.
Another one. Another page. No.

1205
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:16,260
Let's see. Go old school here.
Oh my God. These are old.

1206
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,270
Real old.
Watch your profanity.

1207
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:25,390
There's the Atlantic Ocean
and the Pacific Ocean.

1208
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,020
But some of you pronounced
specific as Pacific.

1209
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,430
The word is specific.
The ocean is Pacific.

1210
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,810
Okay.
Some of you

1211
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,610
a man. There's a lot. Yeah,

1212
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:50,910
that's

1213
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:55,560
a good one. Jj. Jj, JJ,
Jj fish. Yeah. Yeah.

1214
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:59,850
He's really no profanity.
Oh, shark. Kesha,

1215
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,860
remember it's Turkey
just showing right there.

1216
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,850
Sharky Kesha.

1217
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:09,750
No.

1218
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:15,430
Sharkey Sharkey's

1219
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,440
no,

1220
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:21,580
it was good.
But he supposedly mine.

1221
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:26,480
He's supposed to be money.

1222
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:33,290
He supposedly Meninga Sharkey Shit.

1223
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,740
But he supposed to mean,

1224
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:42,370
oh my gosh.
He's so

1225
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:47,990
honestly supposedly,
man,

1226
01:23:47,991 --> 01:23:51,060
I gotta you have to wipe down he

1227
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,500
Sharkey shirt or no,

1228
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,460
where did, um, she's, I forget her name
that says me. See? Yeah, we met her,

1229
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:08,270
right? Yeah. Do you see, I think yeah,
we actually get to the reader. So amazed.

1230
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:12,900
What is amaze is that you made that
song. Yeah. It was a really good, um,

1231
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,580
there's so many funny people
who listen to this show,

1232
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:23,140
this board. Yeah. The board. So much fun.

1233
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:27,220
White Tigress and yeah.
Yeah,

1234
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:33,640
I remember that. Yeah. Watch
out for Fran and so much stuff,

1235
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:36,550
man. We've done the
show a long time. Yeah.

1236
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:42,070
This is so funny. God, choking and
gagging is certainly a turnoff.

1237
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:46,960
And giving a great blow job doesn't
require that to reenact a deep throat porn

1238
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:47,794
scene.
It's,

1239
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:52,820
Oh Paul do put your Dick between your
legs is that right there and the angel of

1240
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:55,120
the Lord Show Dick Between your legs.

1241
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:59,000
You're going to start with the tip of
your tongue on the top right side of the

1242
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:02,700
head of his penis. You're going to
cross over the shaft to the left side,

1243
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,850
the testicles over to the right,

1244
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,540
and your ego is bevel of the shaft to the
left side. And then you're gonna suck.

1245
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,200
Okay?

1246
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,090
Then you're going to take the tip of your
tongue that's of the head of Red Cross

1247
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,610
over this shaft,
the right testicle over to the left hand.

1248
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:22,020
You mentioned the Tamar is leaving dude.
The A,

1249
01:25:22,021 --> 01:25:24,640
the ta or the real. The real, yeah.

1250
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:28,570
There's the real of the talk. I
don't know. I can't remember now.

1251
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:30,850
You've watched it. I
have, I, you know, again,

1252
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:36,060
having a kid puts you on a fucking warrior
hall and you miss out on everything.

1253
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:40,810
Uh, but yeah, so she was on, I think
it's the real Loni love who I love,

1254
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:45,310
who's a great friend. Uh,

1255
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:49,060
And then there's like, oh, and also
what's her name? One of the twins.

1256
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,590
The famous twins from the stupid sister.
Sister show comp drop balls.

1257
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,260
Yeah. Yeah. They're a full game ball.

1258
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:04,250
Did that guy was in our old neighborhood
and rampart. Yeah. Anyways, so much.

1259
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:06,080
Why is she leaving?
You're the one who told me.

1260
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:09,980
Well I saw, I saw a, an
article about it that said,

1261
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:15,200
um, you know their parting ways. They did.

1262
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:19,070
They did a one of those joints statements.
You know,

1263
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,850

1267
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:37,150
Uh, you, I didn't see the story.
I didn't have a minute too, but I,

1268
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,770
you've just had a tamer is
leaving the view. I mean, yeah,

1269
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:41,990
I keep calling it the wrong show.
It's the real,

1270
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,430
and I'm curious to know if it's cause
she got a better offer or she wants to

1271
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:49,130
tour. I know she just
on Instagram, she goes,

1272
01:26:49,131 --> 01:26:53,480
I'm finally back and she was performing,
singing. It is the real, but she was,

1273
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:56,270
she's like, I haven't sang
in six months. I'm like,

1274
01:26:56,271 --> 01:27:00,750
how far do you don't think for six months
unless you're sick or something. Yeah.

1275
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,280
Okay.
Let's see.

1276
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,510
You had a bio pic coming out

1277
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:11,410
lifetime called Toni Braxton.
Unbreak my heart.

1278
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:15,250
MMM.
Smell my farts.

1279
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,920
Were you in the creative process? You
know, outside of writing the book,

1280
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:24,590
I didn't want to be involved creatively
because [inaudible] is on the page. Okay.

1281
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:25,351
It says buy.
Now.

1282
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:30,150
You probably have heard that Tamar Braxton
has been cut from daytime panel talk

1283
01:27:30,151 --> 01:27:31,800
show the real well,

1284
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:36,830
there has been major speculation
as to why the singers says betrayed

1285
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,770
as to who betrayed her.
Oh.

1286
01:27:40,771 --> 01:27:43,920
Potentially leading to her getting fired.

1287
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:47,640
New Port shut may not have
been any of her co host.

1288
01:27:47,641 --> 01:27:49,690
After on the day before the day

1289
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,250
before the joint statement came out,

1290
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:56,580
she posted on her Instagram that she
trusted somebody that she shouldn't have,

1291
01:27:56,681 --> 01:27:58,210
who betray,
who betrayed her.

1292
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,370
Wow. I wonder, according
to the jasmine brand,

1293
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:07,290
all four remaining cohos were blindsided
by the news of Tamar. His departure,

1294
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:10,710
a source said they were completely left
in the dark and are devastated by the

1295
01:28:10,711 --> 01:28:13,350
news since they all truly
got along behind the scenes.

1296
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,940
The lady's allegedly didn't even know a
show issue statement was being put out

1297
01:28:17,941 --> 01:28:19,320
to the public.
Also,

1298
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:23,370
even if they're remaining host band
together to stop this decision for moving

1299
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:27,180
forward. They couldn't, since they each
have their own individual contract,

1300
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:30,870
which causes them to have
different compensation Blob,
I'm guessing it's money.

1301
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,700
Yeah, it's always money. She probably
wanted a lot of money. I don't blame her.

1302
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:37,680
She's kind of the the star,
you know.

1303
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:42,720
Right. Yeah. I mean, cause the, the
joint statement came out and said,

1304
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:44,820
you know, uh, we're,

1305
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:48,930
we're parting ways and all this stuff
and like we wish her the best and she was

1306
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:53,250
half, but it was one of those
things where, see earlier,

1307
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,040
this is before she the the statement,
I love you all,

1308
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:59,010
but I've been stabbed in the back
by someone I stupidly trusted. Oh,

1309
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,190
not my man or my sisters.

1310
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:04,920
I am not about to be tried
and tested to snitch.

1311
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:09,150
And it's not in a good taste to tell
you who, but as you Tara [inaudible] no,

1312
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:11,850
you're very smart. You can figure
things out on your own. Uh,

1313
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,670
and then it goes on and on.
But,

1314
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:18,360
but the day after that she got the boot.

1315
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:24,060
Wow. Yeah. Cheers. Cause
this is a bullshit statement
here. Read this statement.

1316
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,820
This is,
um,

1317
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:29,180
okay.
This is what Henry and here it says,

1318
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:33,960
the real and Tamar Braxton have
mutually decided that Tamer will not be

1319
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:37,320
continuing with the show for
its upcoming third season.

1320
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:40,170
She will be leaving in order to
concentrate on her solo career.

1321
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:44,210
Everyone is so state of
the Real, associated with
the real appreciates Tamar,

1322
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:48,660
his efforts and the contributions she has
made to the show's success and we wish

1323
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:52,890
her all the best for the future. Wow.
Well that sounds like some bullshit.

1324
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,623
Okay.

1325
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:15,060
How different she looks. Yeah. She's,
I mean, she's had a lot of work done.

1326
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:20,090
You got to work, work, work, work, work,
work. Got To do work on your face, face,

1327
01:30:20,091 --> 01:30:24,290
face.
She looks like a totally different human.

1328
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,230
She really does. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1329
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:30,600
Well you never let me get like
that when I started out with this.

1330
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,460
Really sad if you did that
to yourself. Hmm. Really Sad.

1331
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,350
If you did that to yourself, that's
just a sign of losing your mind. See,

1332
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:43,610
now I'm curious. I got to ask
Lonnie on the downlow one. Yeah.

1333
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:46,790
Well then you can't report it here
though. Cause it's gotta be, I gotta know.

1334
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:48,890
I know.
She told me that they got along.

1335
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:52,320
I've heard that they get along on the
show. I believe that it's just, you know,

1336
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:56,630
like fortunate. All right. Um,
