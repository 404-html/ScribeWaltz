Hey,
it's good to be back.

75
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,180
Always love doing the podcast Hashtag
turned him in its movement on Twitter.

76
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:22,810
Now hashtag she's a snitch letter go.
That's the other movement.

77
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,150
That's the only other psychos would
endorse your side on these things.

78
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:31,690
I'm just saying a lot of people
wait in last week. A lot like crazy.

79
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,490
If he missed it.
Um,

80
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,580
it really took off also on social media
about whether or not I have a ride or

81
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,330
die chick. And I gotta tell
you I do math. And, um, look,

82
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,080
it's just, you know, it's your choice.
You let me know who you are. Is it, is it,

83
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,914
is it,
is it,

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
I chose to protect our children.

85
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,620
You're not protecting your children
and protecting our children.

86
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,820
If you suddenly start going on a murder
spree because the Barista at Starbucks

87
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,340
got coffee order wrong.

88
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,060
You don't think that I have a right to
protect our kids and turn your ass in.

89
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,360
First of all,
I just got upset with somebody else.

90
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,480
They ain't going to sit with my family.
So I don't see how the two are connected.

91
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,760
Okay. Because it's something and I
need your help and you're like, no,

92
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,890
I'm going to leave you behind.
Yeah, you're right. Gosh,

93
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:19,530
I am just a terrible life. Well,
that's the consensus for sure.

94
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,830
I told you I would help you bury
the body in cases of manslaughter.

95
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,320
Involuntary, right? Yeah,
but not premeditated.

96
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:33,830
Only if it's to protect
our family and if you,

97
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,450
if we're hurting like a child molester
or a rapist and I take joy helping the

98
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:42,430
listeners a reality.
Okay. They don't have,

99
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,870
they don't have to children
to protect the listeners.

100
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,370
A lot of comments and messages,
but we also got a bunch of emails.

101
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:53,840
I'll read some of them right now.
Please let me get this kind of be, look,

102
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,830
here's the first email. Tom's wrong. If
someone harms family, I'm all for events,

103
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,610
otherwise runaway and called the cops.
Also,

104
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:06,440
sulfuric acid is used in pool maintenance.
Uh,

105
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,900
is that what, okay. Just this coincidental
that they mentioned that. Huh? Sidebar.

106
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,590
This is what they mentioned. Hello.
Tommy jeans and Mommy, Christine,

107
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:17,920
my wife and I were listening to last
week's episode and the question of loyalty

108
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:21,250
was brought up between your marriage.
Would you wrap me out if I killed someone?

109
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:25,930
I expected my wife to carry the same piece
of shit feelings as Christine but was

110
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,390
done when she said that
Tommy is 100% right.

111
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,160
Sounds like Christine's genes can only
become a certain amount of high and tight

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,950
before she's the one that, that uh,
the very valid she promised. Uh,

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,280
it looks to me that Tommy
is not only the water champ,

114
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,120
but the marriage champ as well. Way To
really fucked that one up. Christine.

115
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,440
Todd is the psycho champ is what
he is. More messages. Hey Man,

116
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,320
Richard Kuklinski Aka the ice man.

117
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,710
Earns a well deserved reputation
as a cold blooded killer,

118
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,550
but manages to keep his
violent professionals secret
from his wife and children

119
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,210
for years. Hey Chris, niches. That's
your nickname. What the fuck? Okay.

120
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,330
These are weighted towards
you in case you haven't.

121
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:08,170
All I needed to slow one for sin is me
and my girlfriend down to ride to the

122
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:13,090
bloody end. Just me and my girlfriend.
That's Tupac. Um, Christina,

123
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,850
I cannot believe how you would
turn in. Tom. Fuck you rock.

124
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,020
That's my favorite email
that's ever convert.

125
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:22,450
These are all slightly weighted
towards your, when you read the emails,

126
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,720
they're all in supportive view.
Let's just put it that way. I just,

127
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,720
I put this together and I just see what
kind of wife and mother would I be if I

128
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:33,370
didn't protect our children from a
psychotic believe the term is half assed.

129
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,510
Wow. Wow. Wow.

130
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,930
Hi, I'm, I'm ride or die.
Up until that premeditated,

131
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm a snapped because some guy cut
me off in traffic. I told you that.

132
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,430
Okay. Who's going to be your
second spouse? Let's talk dummy.

133
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,980
Who's not going to fucking push back and
get me shit. You're Dalmatian wise. Yeah.

134
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,570
She's definitely not going
to say anything. Dalmatian.

135
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:02,320
My wives don't say anything. No.
Yeah. Yeah. They're pretty good. Uh,

136
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,580
whatever. Look, this is
such a ridiculous topic.

137
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,120
You're clearly about to
snap anyways. Yeah. Right.

138
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,450
You watching Ozark now you're 10 episodes
ahead of me. I'm the only one. No,

139
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:17,130
I like that show too.
By the way.

140
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:21,970
If you face farted on people,
he would kill them. Think so.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,510
That was a bad one last.
That's what I was going to go.

142
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,650
That's where I was going on.
Let's get back to her. Thanks
for doing that. Oh wait.

143
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,490
Oh, burp to now. Come on. If
you're going to fart like that,

144
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,880
at least have the matches nearby. I know.
I didn't know what was in there though.

145
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,840
Yeah. Face farting. Well, um,

146
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,760
why don't I show you
what the,

147
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,440
what the moment is.

148
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,560
He's like book. I love this. A setup.
This is part of that, you know,

149
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,850
this is part of the, his arousal is
pretending to not know what it is.

150
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,830
Andrea did pray for her as a show
called her. I Dunno, but mistress.

151
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,370
Why she looks very cute. Um, she's
dressing like me. She's wearing jeans.

152
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,800
I like her. She's not my same. I wonder
if she can part like you. I bet you

153
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,290
nobody can find like me.
This guy's like do not know

154
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,260
if face farts. And she was like, I'll
show you. And He, and he goes like,

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,243
I don't know.
I don't know.

156
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,510
What is it? Can you, can you explain
to the people that watch? What is it?

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,870
Eh,
what is baseball?

158
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh Wow.
Cool.

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Mariachi modality.

160
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,190
Hey Pete Souza.
I'll show you nothing.

161
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,180
Are you ever to go down? Yeah. Dip Shit.

162
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:58,090
That's the best way. If you want
to know what I do in my specialty,

163
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:58,924
you should try it.

164
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,670
And Italians,
they'll fucking do anything.

165
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,240
She animals maybe not in
front of the Jack in the box.

166
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,800
She not one on deck. She's
always ready. Schoolwide.

167
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,660
Wow. She is fully smarter than
them. So she's got a big ass too.

168
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh, she just fired on that guy's face.
He's smiling. He fucking loves it.

169
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,340
And he goes, oh my gosh. I did not know
what you meant when you said if face,

170
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,030
no, I see. So it's that. You
actually fart in my face.

171
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,410
Could you imagine having this job?
This guy's job?

172
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,100
Yeah.
You're going to be a reporter.

173
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,400
We're going to send you out to the Jack
in the box and you're going to let this

174
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,990
chick fart in your face
in the parking lot.

175
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:56,910
This has gotta be just a joke set up for,
for the new facility.

176
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,760
Oh, you're right. This is
like one of those porno. Yeah.

177
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,670
Set up all this stuff better than
me. He's a real journalist. Oh,

178
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,850
I thought he was visiting America.

179
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
I met a nice lady and she's like,
I faced [inaudible]. He's like,

180
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,780
what is this all about? It's how far
and the far comes in. The next thing.

181
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:17,560
He's like, you said it's
harder here. Monday legs.

182
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,100
She's like, yeah, show
me. It's a little gooey.

183
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,940
Stuff comes out.
Do you think

184
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,600
she does? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

185
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,060
He is. Huh? He's very,
he's very dangerous.

186
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:38,180
These because they see that we are in war.
Huh?

187
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,050
Oh my gosh. Eh. Deletions 40 aura.

188
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,540
Your characteristic or your beauty
this because you are a very,

189
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,860
very beautiful girl.
Butter

190
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,570
man. Do you think her dad, hey, here's
a scenario what your dad's looking,

191
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,370
I should try it.

192
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,870
Your Dad's looking to jerk one day and
he's searching for the porn he likes.

193
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:05,340
Yeah. And you know how all the other
subjects come up. All the other types.

194
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

195
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,220
Is Your Dad and then like come to
Christ and it's his little girl.

196
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,130
How many times do you think that
happens? Happens all the time. Yeah,

197
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,310
but if you're, if you're the dad of,
of the metro mistress at [inaudible],

198
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,460
you're like, yeah, she's
dropping farts. I mean it's, I,

199
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,980
it's probably a different feeling than
if you see your daughter in a blow. Bang.

200
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,970
Do you think that's the worst thing to
see your daughter do and porn? Let's,

201
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,200
let's, no, probably it's double or triple
anal is probably the worst. That's what,

202
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,000
no, but blow bang. Maybe Blow Bang, wait,
what's a blow? Bang again? Like blow jobs.

203
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:39,834
Yeah.
But like it's,

204
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,540
it's when there's like eight guys
standing around her and she's like,

205
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,210
like looking up. She then the shows I
[inaudible] she loves it. I love it.

206
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:51,720
I love it. How much do you think, how
much do you get paid for the Blow Bang?

207
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,840
Because the agents got to call her and
be like, all right, I got you a gay.

208
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,540
Normally here's the thing,
I'm going to hook you up normally.

209
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,260
You know how you get like 500
bucks for a blowjob? Yeah.

210
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Well I got you 800 bucks for 10
blowjobs actually for more it's less.

211
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:08,454
Right.

212
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,400
But if you stay long a dollar and you
blow everybody there, yeah. You get $400.

213
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,630
Yeah. Okay. Cause we're
paying for your travel. Yeah.

214
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,050
Free lunch. Free lunch and yeah,
whatever. Whatever you want to eat after.

215
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,510
I can't,
I can't imagine.

216
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm trying to think of what I would
personally consider a way worser.

217
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,660
Is it the blow bang, wait, wait, is it,

218
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,820
what is worse to see your
child doing? Hi. Yay. Ooh.

219
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,910
Fufu cause see something about like
five dicks over the face and just on the

220
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:48,600
face seems really kind of
degrading. Right? Seams, seams.

221
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm talking pure optics.
So,

222
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,170
uh, but then again, if you know, if
there's two dicks in her ass, you're like,

223
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,080
I fucked up. I didn't do anything.
I did, I did things wrong. Right.

224
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,430
So you're saying to me what you're asking
essentially is what's worst parenting?

225
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,750
What's the result of worst parenting,

226
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,860
multiple decks in your mouth or multiple
dicks in your butthole and virgin?

227
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,940
I think, I think I'm going to
go with the double penetration.

228
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,860
I do think there's nothing worse.
I imagine that seeing it then,

229
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,420
I think it's the most challenging of
the things to doing something away from

230
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,720
your face.
For some reason it feels like these guys,

231
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:29,570
they did something to your body,

232
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,660
but there's almost like a,

233
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:36,470
they did it to you and it's not,
it's not on you,

234
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,940
but the blowjob is a voluntary act.
You can just lay there and take,

235
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,400
I'd be like,
it was terrible.

236
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,670
But if you're like and she and she's
going from one to the next around the

237
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,750
circle, you know, oof.

238
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,750
And then every guys are hold on and then
she has to like let it go on and then

239
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,430
then do the big smile.

240
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,880
That's the worst part is that
she's got to act like she's like,

241
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,190
how was today?
It's so much fun.

242
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,250
I was awesome. I was really the top,
she has to pretend like it was a little,

243
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,010
oh my God,
you guys are so disgusting.

244
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,590
Her life was as second all those guys off.

245
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,960
Okay, so here's the thing now speaking
of, I would rather do the fart face.

246
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:34,330
I would do face farts all day over
any of the other stuff in porn.

247
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,450
If I had to pick a lane.

248
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,170
I don't understand. He knows
what it is. Definitely.

249
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,510
I am very excited about,

250
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,280
he ain't too dumb for face farts now
speaking of too dumb to come a lot.

251
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,720
That's also been very popular.
Big,

252
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,940
big issue on our show
and we got this message.

253
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:03,590
I think I found the right photo for
the not too dumb to come shirts. Cool.

254
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,830
Hope you find this useful,
your ride or die, Chris rude.

255
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,040
There it is. And there's forest
and he's got his eyes closed.

256
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,540
It looks like he's choosing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go.

257
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:21,490
He's playing ping pong. Good job forest.
Yeah. He's even got a dumb haircut.

258
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,130
You know, I was just thinking that
dumb, that hairpin persons cut.

259
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,920
There's a certain look. What kind of
luck? Well done. People have a certain

260
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,890
look sometimes, I'm sure.
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

261
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,860
Talk strictly hair if gt kind of an honor.
No,

262
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,810
I got some bad submissions for FTT RTD.
Yeah.

263
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,350
People were like doing things like, oh,
it's FTD RGT. I'm like, Dude, look at,

264
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,970
look at the letters first
before you submit. Um,

265
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,860
so, oh, where's that one? I
wanted to pull up this to you.

266
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,620
God, I hate it for kids
to porn, but for Simon,

267
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,140
it's just as bad if your son does it.
Then if you're a little girl as it, right.

268
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,300
So do you remember our, doesn't
even answer me. Sorry. Say it again.

269
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,320
What's the way worser? What? Your son
doing porn or your girl doing porn? Well,

270
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:25,020
everybody always assumes that
it means that you go, oh,

271
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,020
it's worse than my daughter is doing porn,
but I don't think,

272
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,390
I think it's kind of jokey to be like,

273
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:32,520
I'm really thrilled that
my son's doing foreign.

274
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,750
I don't think that really happened.

275
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:38,730
I don't think a parent of a of
a guy is stuffy. Like, dude,

276
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,820
it's great.
Like my kid fucks a lot.

277
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,920
Like I don't think that
conversation really happened.

278
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,110
There are more of a commodity in this
business because they're so rare. Yeah.

279
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,470
Guy That can do that on command
is, it's a talent. It's a talent,

280
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:55,980
but I still don't think the parents
are like, it's really great.

281
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,010
Where is our kid fell into that he didn't
know how he can get hard all the time

282
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,370
and now he gets to show
Pete come on command.

283
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,760
That's a bigger towns a lot and
he comes down and eat them too.

284
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,720
And just bigger town than that guy
that's claps and slaps is actually,

285
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:15,840
it is a bigger town. Kind of
should be a little more celebrated,

286
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,680
but I think it makes for a lot of
probably conversations that, you know,

287
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,390
I think there's a lot of parents in that,
in that position that probably go like,

288
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,930
ah, he's a, he paints,
he's taking pictures,

289
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,530
performance artist in La. Yeah, no, he's
done some acting, but he really, he,

290
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,260
he actually had making furniture and he
loves it. They're doing stuff like that.

291
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,710
Yeah. They're not like, he's rock
hard when you need them to be. Yeah.

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,130
I wonder if Rocco's a Friday's parents,
were they proud of him? Um, well,

293
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:50,370
didn't his dad die?
His mother died when he was younger.

294
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:54,600
I know his dad died when he was younger
and the mother was alive and then when

295
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,650
his mom died,

296
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,280
he went over to his mom's best friend's
house and put his dick in her mouth and

297
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,410
came immediately and ran away in shame.

298
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah. Yeah. Just what anybody does when
they're grieving grieves differently.

299
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,130
When his mom saw him
masturbating when he was a child,

300
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:15,030
she winked at him and smiled. Oh Wow. That
kind of, and he was like, this is great.

301
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,980
This is a good thing on
the right path here. Yeah.

302
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,650
Is that what your mom did
when she found you? Nope. No,

303
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,870
my parents really were so
fucking weird about sex.

304
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,070
They kind of aren't they? Yes. I
think looking back you go, you know,

305
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,890
when you try to like analyze your parents,
you realize they're just people.

306
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:35,941
You know,

307
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:39,840
there's just people out there and in
most cases people are doing the best they

308
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,890
can in most cases. I don't
know. I mean, you know,

309
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,970
most people's parents are
doing the best they can be.

310
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,730
People are neglectful and shitty. I'm
trying to say that's the best thing. Yeah.

311
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,220
But I'm saying like in my parents' guys,
they're not neglectful and shitty.

312
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,570
We're doing the best they can. But
I think that there was, you know,

313
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,480
they were so uncomfortable with just,

314
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,280
I think my dad would have been a little
different about it if he hadn't been

315
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:11,281
with my mom who was much
more so an old school,

316
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:16,120
Catholic Catholicism. And it sets
South American breed of it where it's,

317
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,870
it's a, it's kind of heightened. I mean
she did boarding school with the nuns,

318
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,160
you know, it's like, I'll tell you
and listen, I wasn't raised religious.

319
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:25,510
My parents were communists.

320
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,760
They weren't coming for their
raised in Communist countries. Yeah.

321
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:31,960
So when we came to the states
were Catholic by tradition,
but not by practice.

322
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,880
I didn't get weird about sex until
I went to Catholic high school.

323
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,820
Middle of the Catholics
will do elementary school.

324
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,300
I don't think I stopped feeling guilty
about it until I got married. I mean,

325
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,180
and that's like not even from my home,
not just from school,

326
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,820
like stuff that I picked up,
dude. My parents were like,

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,770
if my mom saw like a woman
in a bikini and she's like,

328
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:55,090
are you watching pornography?
Seriously? So I'll be like, oh my God.

329
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:59,650
Like I thought just a woman's body. You
shouldn't be, but it shouldn't be like,

330
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,800
that's nice. You know, it's changed.
It's changed in ladder. Like, you know,

331
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:08,620
like as we become adults, it's not as
weird. But when we were kids, oh my God.

332
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,860
But no gotta feed. Everything's
poor. No, like a woman's legs,

333
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,610
Porno. I remember asking my
dad, I mean, think about it now.

334
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:22,270
It's also just a change in culture, like
the way people talk to their kids now,

335
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,433
you know,

336
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,670
but I asked him if he masturbated
when I was a a kid cause I was sorry,

337
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:32,050
I'm not sure. And he goes, no,
I go, did you ever masturbate?

338
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,820
He goes one time, like a one time,
cause you had when I was 16 and I go,

339
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:40,950
what happened is like that's it. So I
just went in my room like, fuck yeah,

340
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,970
you're the Weirdo.
You feel like a real weirdo now.

341
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
That's the kind of stuff I'm
talking about where you were like,

342
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:47,480
what the fuck man, it's not
good. It's not good for kids.

343
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,760
And then I tried to bring it up again.

344
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:52,180
I told you that right where I came out
of the shower and I didn't know how to

345
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:56,830
talk. I was like 10, like, uh,
um, uh, so can I talk to you?

346
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,030
He was like, yeah. And you know,

347
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,820
you could tell it when it's
hard for a kid to say something.

348
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,520
I was taking a shower.
I remember this like it was yesterday.

349
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,410
I was taking a shower and
um, I was washing, you know,

350
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:11,860
my privates and um,
uh,

351
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:16,780
all this stuff came out and then he goes,
next time, don't wash there so long.

352
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,440
I was like, all right. That was it.
And that was, that was the conference.

353
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:27,100
I was like, I'm trying to talk to you
about this and not feel weird about it.

354
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,140
And he was like, yeah, you don't want
to do that. Just watch what's on TV.

355
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,100
Let's watch the football game.
But that's the hangup about sex.

356
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:39,460
And I have to say after having two babies,

357
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,510
you really realize that it's just a
part of the bigger picture of human

358
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:47,300
reproduction. It's
really not, you know, my,

359
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,590
my boobs are food for somebody right
now. My badge was a portal of, for some,

360
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,370
for two people to come into this planet
like you, the, you know what I mean?

361
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,300
It's not, it's no mystery and your sex
and sexuality, it's like, what the fuck?

362
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,950
I would have a whole different psyche
about this. If I was raised differently,

363
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,030
I probably wouldn't find sex stuff
is funny as I, because it's so taboo,

364
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:13,031
so taboo deep like it's in
my brain's DNA that has,

365
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,470
you know, well, cause I had the opposite.

366
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:19,760
My parents were oversexed and it was so
open all the time. We talked about sex,

367
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,391
you know,

368
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:23,780
my mother wanted to teach me and I was
reading books about it when I was like in

369
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:28,280
third grade and she would show me her
edible underwear and her discussing sex

370
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,650
toys and stuff.
Like it was almost too much for me.

371
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:34,850
It was over stimulation to our ninth. Now
I'm totally not, I don't care. I'm like,

372
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,710
oh well that's a body they fuck.
Yeah.

373
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,580
But I wonder where we both got
our love of poop stuff from.

374
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,090
That's a difference to, well, my dad
champion that. That's true. Yeah.

375
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,260
My Dad's a big pen. I can't tell you like
I didn't think it was, I wasn't like,

376
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:52,970
this is awesome. But I did
react. I loved more upset my mom.

377
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,040
Yeah, that's, that was the, that was more
the draw of it to me was that he was,

378
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,210
he would be like, take a
shit. He'd be like, yeah,

379
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,110
he'd get all excited and I'd be like,
yeah, I took it. I wouldn't be like,

380
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:07,400
as excited as he was, but then
she will be so upset. I was like,

381
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:11,640
this is pretty good stuff cause it makes
mom mad. Makes my med. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,450
That makes my man I wanted to do talked
about shitting a lot in my house.

383
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,110
It was just constant.
Every you just want to take a shit.

384
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,380
You talked about it after. Yeah. No, he,

385
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,850
he 100% every day. Yeah. It's still how's,
you can take a shit that was good shit.

386
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,320
Yeah. I got to tell you, tell you
ahead. Kind of, kind of sloppy,

387
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,160
sloppy Joe every day.

388
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:38,120
My mother liked poop stuff and it was
actually my mom. That's hilarious. Yeah,

389
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,010
she loved it. She's always, she,

390
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,340
my mother had kind of what you would
consider a low brow sense of humor and

391
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,290
surprise. And she liked like they call it
like a [inaudible] tumor and Hungarian,

392
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:53,210
like a farmer. And I think that's totally
where I get it from. And my dad too,

393
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:56,240
like Cheech and Chong and
Eddie Murphy and you know,

394
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,680
we're not highfalutin folks
over at the budget skis were no,

395
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,950
definitely fucking dirt dogs. Speaking
of this topic, do you want to,

396
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,020
we actually had our question answered
about queef versus fart debate.

397
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,260
There's no I've answered
no, no. The debate,

398
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,040
the debate was answered by a
doctor for us. Oh, it's your life.

399
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,210
So a doctor or the cock doc reiterate.
What's the question again?

400
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,320
If,
um,

401
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,860
the question was, I think you
pose the question, you said,

402
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,310
is it a Queef if it comes from
your ass or is it definitely from,

403
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,950
but sex? Yeah. So we're like,
is it if there's, if there's,

404
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,720
if there's air pushed in during
anal sex when it escapes,

405
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,930
is that a farm x scapes,
x scapes? Is that a fart?

406
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:49,200
And I thought it was not, and I think
you said, well look, it's a butthole.

407
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,730
So when anything, any air
comes out, it's a fart is says,

408
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,020
well or it's definitely not a queef.
Queef comes from the machine.

409
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,960
I get what you're saying. So let's do
what the doctor says. Another category.

410
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,500
This is a practicing urologist.
I can't believe,

411
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,970
I can't believe doctors listen to this
show. And this guy has messaged me and,

412
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,400
and uh, and I've, I've messaged,

413
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,710
we've sent messages to each
other and he's a real doctor. Um,

414
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,190
allow me to settle your queef
versus fart debate definitively.

415
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,960
This comes down to definition though.
You might be right Jane. Okay.

416
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:26,640
Queef is a vaginal expulsion of air your
email or was raising the question of

417
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:30,660
whether or not it matters what the
origin of source of said air is.

418
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,200
But the answer is that it doesn't matter.
And here's why.

419
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,840
Sex is not the only source of queefs.

420
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,710
And not all queefs are expulsions
of air that has been forced inside.

421
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,851
For examples.

422
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:45,870
There are diseases that can result in
the formulation in the formation of a

423
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:49,680
Fistula, which is an abnormal
connection between two hollow organs.

424
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,060
A Colo vaginal fistula is an abnormal
connection between the colon and the

425
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,930
vagina. This can result in gas from the
colon being expelled through the vagina.

426
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,180
That's crazy. Even though the gas
is a byproduct of regular digestion,

427
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,580
since it's expelled via the vagina,

428
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,990
it's technically a queef air
coming out of the vagina.

429
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,753
Likewise,

430
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
air forced into the rectum during anal
intercourse that subsequently expelled is

431
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:22,371
a fart because farting is the expulsion
of air through the anus regardless of

432
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:27,510
its source of origin. Sorry, Tom.
Christina is right by the way.

433
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,220
Huge congrats to Christina for
creeping out that baby. Also,

434
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:36,810
please add some tampon Florida dates so
we can come out and see you guys. Uh,

435
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:41,590
this is the, keep those jeans high
and tight. Dr Pecker checkers, MD. Um,

436
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,670
he really is, I swear to some guy in
Florida, I promise you. I promise you.

437
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,200
Um, while we're on the subject, your
farts and either way in two parts,

438
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,010
do farts pushed the shit out or
do Brown's push the farts out?

439
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,500
The answer is that it's both.
There's only so much space and split test.

440
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,240
Everything has propelled all
together by the muscle action.

441
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,210
It's possible that Eric and
filter around the browns,

442
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:07,560
but the browns and farts are both
pushed along a by what? Paris.

443
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:11,160
Dallas and those traveled together.
Teamwork makes the dream work. People,

444
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,330
this guy sent me photos from his practice
of stuff that would just make your

445
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,630
eyes water. Shall we see them? Can
we see that? We could see them?

446
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:24,270
I don't know if I should. I mean
you can't. I'm sure you can't bro.

447
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,290
I guess we could under the like, hey,
we're studying medicine here, but okay.

448
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,420
I mean, we're talking like disease
Dick. Dick. Really? Yeah. Okay.

449
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,000
Well let me set it up. Maybe I'll
set it up for when our, sure.

450
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,740
Maybe we could show our guests. Um, what
a neat idea. I can't believe it so far.

451
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:44,800
It's the shit out. Oh, this is
felony shit poses a farts out too.

452
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,400
You're not even going to marvel at this
revelation. It's absolutely fantastic.

453
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,520
Thank you doctor Cock Doc.
I'm just saying that from my whole life.

454
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:53,050
I thought farts push the shit out.

455
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,000
And then doctor drew came by and he said
it was, what'd he say? Neither? Yeah.

456
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,050
He was like, oh fun. I know
they happen there, Eric,

457
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,830
irrespective of one another and
now this guy saying it's both.

458
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,960
So it's like blowing my mind.

459
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,470
It's like when you find out that
light is both wave and particle,

460
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,050
you know what I'm saying? Yeah,
no, I know what you're saying.

461
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,180
Pretty exciting stuff.
Well,

462
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,160
I guess I did think that she has
pushed the farts out. You know,

463
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,590
I thought the farts push the shit out.
My thought,

464
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,220
my mom was right about that because she
would always love for those who don't

465
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:30,310
know, my mother would say whenever
I, whenever I'd Fart and I'd be like,

466
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,810
Oh guy for it.
And she'd be like,

467
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,110
be grateful for the farts because farts
Bush this shit out without the force.

468
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,870
There is no shit. Wow. Yeah.
In a way. And she's right.

469
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,220
Um, our guest is here. Should
we go get them? Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,120
And there's some really important stuff
I want to get to. I mean, I'm serious.

471
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,340
Really important. No, this is good
stuff. Like really important. Yeah. Okay.

472
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,130
All right. All right. We'll
be right back Jean or back.

473
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:00,580
We're doing a little mic
tracking. Okay. Yeah.

474
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,610
Where he sound different
there Tom. That's, thank you.

475
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,630
That's the guy that can't stop coming.
That's,

476
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,730
he comes at his dad's funeral a
hundred times back in the news. No,

477
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,460
you would not believe the
sophos that was prepping today.

478
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:16,300
And what happened was our producer
thought we were recording tomorrow. Yeah.

479
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,410
So usually sends me a folder of
all these files of things to play.

480
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,290
So he messaged me, he's
like, I fucked up. I'm sorry.

481
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,650
So I'm like pulling stuff on my own
and it's not the same cause it's like,

482
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,440
you know, it's usually organized and
I just hit a button and it plays.

483
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,510
So I'm going through emails and
I see this thing about this.

484
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,970
This is probably like the episode
that I would say at least early on,

485
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,480
best to find our shows them. Yes.
We did a huge segment on this guy.

486
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,350
When you're on your knees at your
father's funeral, at his casket,

487
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,390
you were saying goodbye to him.

488
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,850
And then we have nine orgasms right
there by your whole family is standing

489
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:56,480
behind. You never want to have
another orgasm as long as you live.

490
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,920
Why not
just keep on com.

491
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,110
And it was like a documentary like
thing they did on this guy who has this

492
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:09,920
condition where he just comes all day,
every day and it's ruined his life.

493
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,710
But he orgasm, he did. He doesn't come.
Doesn't come right every time. No,

494
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,480
but it's the ability,
he's like,

495
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,330
can't go to like my kid's
soccer games on the side,

496
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,710
but you know like I'm like go.
And then he's like,

497
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,050
you just orgasm and he's got erections
all the time and he feels it was horrible

498
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:24,680
cause he's like,

499
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,670
I feel bad being around my kids cause
I'll just start orgasmic as I'm looking at

500
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:33,440
my kids and, and he's
like, you know, I can't,

501
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:36,500
I can't, I feel like an
asshole if I'm ordering dinner.

502
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:39,980
And I come and like I'm just nothing.
But what's the name of

503
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,350
the condition? Oh man, it's
probably in this thing,

504
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,740
multiple orgasms syndrome or something
that's too clean. That's gotta be,

505
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:49,250
it's gotta be a funnier one for
persistent genital arousal disorder.

506
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,670
That's right. Oh, pst.
Yeah. I just remember that.

507
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,120
I talked about it in my last person.
Persistent genital arousal disorder. Yeah.

508
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,280
Yeah. So there are, they're a wealth of
people like this on the amount of wealth,

509
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,150
but there are certainly, I mean there's
definitely more than one. It's, it's, um,

510
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,190
and they've had, you know, there was
one last year, it was in the news,

511
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:11,850
this woman was hospitalized and she was
like, she just keeps like, you know what,

512
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,850
this guys,
he was so sad,

513
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:18,800
which made it so funny cause you could
tell offering was at his father's

514
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:22,730
funeral. It's just coming. It's just
like, that's what dad would have wanted.

515
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,380
That's what dad would've wanted.

516
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,960
I just had nine rather powerful
orgasmic sensations to my entire body.

517
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,640
So names row, he would have
shit like your parents' funeral.

518
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,760
So you want to hear the big news?
Could I imagine? I'm planning on it.

519
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,320
Here's the big news. Okay.
This guy was profiled on our,

520
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,360
we were obsessed with this guy.
This is a few,

521
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,910
I mean a number of years
ago haven't really,

522
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,040
I had to go back through
these drops to find them.

523
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:57,000
It's like it's in the first like 100
audio things we pulled, you know,

524
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,950
so it's like, it's back in the day.
Okay. Here's why he's back in the news.

525
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,290
Oh, he tran. Oh, nice. No,

526
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,030
it's like he's following our show.

527
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,740
Wow. Yup. Well what that is is he wants
to feel what it's like to come as a woman.

528
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,110
This guy coming is only so fun now.
She only climax is eight times daily,

529
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,130
so I guess that knocked it down a notch.
Maybe that's,

530
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:28,040
I don't know if that's part of the reason.
Maybe it is. How could it not Scott?

531
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,510
He was like, I'm tired of common
transition. He looks tired.

532
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,780
He looks like he's just drained.

533
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,870
I got to say when he was a man,
that's a bad haircut,

534
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,610
but can I tell you I love that guys. Hair
cut. I think that's such a fun guy. Yeah.

535
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,650
The bangs are always bad. We were just
talking about dumb haircuts. Like it just,

536
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:53,140
you look dumb. It's the
same hair over there for us.

537
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,400
Better as a woman. I've definitely fucked
that chick. Yeah, I fucked that chick.

538
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,820
Yeah. Many years ago in a bar or
someone, a dark bar somewhere,

539
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,510
but then not having the testosterone
not down the orgasm number to only 8%.

540
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,230
Only eight a day. You know, how much,

541
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,990
how much coming that is so come so
much company doesn't come anymore.

542
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,560
Like just, I mean maybe, let's
see. I need more information.

543
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,390
The transgender mother of
two hit headlines. Having
the hunter orgasms a day. Uh,

544
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,490
here, look, look, I nailed it. Persistent
general arousal system. Okay. Uh,

545
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,550
Christine Decker, two rivers,
Wisconsin ultra rare condition. Um,

546
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,740
an accident triggered the illness. What's
her name now? Christine. Christine.

547
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,090
Christine Rivers. If you're out in
Albion, Madison, Wisconsin. Come on up.

548
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,620
Comedy on stage. Oh, it's a great club. It
is a great, have you been there? Yeah. Oh,

549
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:50,730
it's the fucking best. I've just got, I'm
going there and two ways. First of all.

550
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,780
Got, that's probably good. I just keep it,
keep it, just keep it straight. Fantastic.

551
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:59,710
Andrew San Te. Hello. Hi. Thanks
for having me. I am such a fan of

552
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,030

554
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:14,410
here. Thank you. That's him
right there. That's him collapse.

555
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,350
So wait, when he walks, if he comes,
he has to like brace himself. Well,

556
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:23,990
sometimes it just, it just, it
just floors. By the way, you know,

557
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:25,320
said that I've never had an orgasm.

558
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:30,200
That good outcomes are just fine.
Everything's fine.

559
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,620
Yeah. All right. And they're unprompted.
Like when you're, you wear a diaper,

560
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,430
how does he see, he's got to say,
you can't just rip through underwear.

561
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:42,840
That's just tear through
like he's out of come.

562
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,930
You know what I mean? Like he
has all gone, all gone. Yeah.

563
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,470
There's no more come every time.
No, but he gets, he gets the,

564
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,510
he gets the feeling. Every time
I hear this, this is actually,

565
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,140
this is the audio from this moment.
Oh God.

566
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,260
Yeah, I remember that.
Oh, how old is this?

567
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,900
Does this, uh, how old is she now? Oh,

568
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:14,250
it says 30 oh two Racine remains
married to are devoted wife.

569
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,400
April 36 no, that's Chris. Christine.

570
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,710
Christine's 40 I think it said so already.

571
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,910
Her wife stuck it out was a real g g we
watched an entire series on this called

572
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:30,210
lost in transition about people that
have been married for like 15 years,

573
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,050
have children. And then the
husband is like, guess what?
I'm a lady. What is don't.

574
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,680
It's really hard to stay together,
but the women try. Yeah, the woman,

575
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,700
the woman here is sort of a ride or
die chick. I would say. I think women,

576
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:45,540
I think women in general assumably try
harder if that's the other way around.

577
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:50,400
Dudes are like late later within seconds,
look at how forgiving,

578
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,330
a lot of times our women are to
a man's physical traits. Totally.

579
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,740
You've seen these super like
these fat piece of Shit. Guys.

580
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,740
I've known guys who were like no fat
chicks and they're the fattest guys have

581
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:06,420
epic, no teeth demanding.
Demanding. Yeah. He's like,

582
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:10,440
he's like, I mean, I don't
fuck with chicks like over
one 20 and you're like, okay,

583
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:11,070
dude.

584
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,720
And like the dude just looks like a
fucking candle melted and then stopped

585
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:19,020
halfway through it. I'm like, just pick
guys. And you're like, Jesus Christ,

586
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,940
and here's the thing that can, I will
score chicks all the time. Totally.

587
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,540
It's an unbelievable that
the woman goes like, yeah,

588
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,380
he's confident as it goes with them.
It's one car.

589
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,510
They take one characteristic to roll
with. Women are like, oh, he's, you know,

590
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:35,320
he's a smart or he's sweet.
Yeah. Yeah. And for this guy,
he's gotta be a tide bud.

591
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,110
Not going to fuck a pig.
I know a girl who just told me,

592
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,630
talk to you about her boyfriend. She
goes, well, he's nice to me. I'm like,

593
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,350
I fucking hope. So. Yeah. Like that
was the thing. She was impressed.

594
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,081
He's nice to me.

595
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:48,040
There was a guy last night with a really
good looking chick at rite aid trying

596
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:51,970
ice cream. You know how they have
the right of the ice cream? Yeah.

597
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,910
He's trying all the ice cream.
He massive, massive, popular,

598
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,690
skinny little tiny girl right next
to him. He's just like, uh, give no,

599
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:01,660
give me rocky road. Do you know? He's
like trying all of them. And I was like,

600
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:05,170
how does this, how does she get trapped?
How does she end up in that situation?

601
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,040
It's just low self esteem.
Yeah.

602
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,600
Coupled with maybe he's got something
else off or you don't know what is hog

603
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,790
looks like or what his bank account
looks like. Yeah. But there's,

604
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,520
everyone's got a penis.
It's gotta be money because the girl,

605
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,950
you can always go get another penis.
I'm telling you.

606
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:21,640
But just someone that sometimes
those broken, broken wings
out there, those girls,

607
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:25,690
if you're just nice to them. I mean that
just got to find the damaged one guys.

608
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,090
Yeah. Yeah. Tip for the
dudes. Get the damage.

609
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,970
Those are the ones you can
manipulate. Yeah. You can own them.

610
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,530
These are healthy girls broken.
Yeah.

611
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,880
You don't want them if they got
their shit together. Right? Yeah.

612
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,920
If they're educated and they're
really got a good family,

613
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:43,220
that's what a waste of time. Yeah. Look
for tiers. That's who you want to. Yeah.

614
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,250
Someone that looks like they
always were just crying. Yeah.

615
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,350
That's what you want just on white.
Right. And they're like, I'm all right.

616
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,090
And you're like, hey, then swoop in.

617
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,120
But those are the girls that settle for
the pigs eating ice cream in the writing.

618
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,260
That's exactly right. Those are
your double anal checks. DVD, A's.

619
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,830
Let's talk. Let's ask Andrew
by the way. Fantastic comedian,

620
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:09,370
actor Anderson Tino about ride or die.

621
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,940
So last week we pose this question
and it got a lot of feedback. Okay.

622
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,260
Listen carefully. Okay.
You're married. Yeah. Um,

623
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,450
so I guess should I pose the question
as to you or what do you think your wife

624
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:24,130
would do? I'll ask you what you
think your wife would do. Okay.

625
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,160
So let's say your wife's out and
she comes home and she's like,

626
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:32,530
hey baby. And you're like, ah,
I got to tell you something.
And she was like, what?

627
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:37,000
And you're like, Hey, you know, uh, you
know that a FedEx guy. And he always like,

628
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,740
he'll just kind of like pull the truck
up and his is a mirror, like slap the,

629
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,640
the mailbox. She's like, oh, that guy's
an asshole. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway,

630
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,890
today I was across town,

631
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,960
I was getting one of my juices and then
I saw him in the parking lot and I,

632
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,770
I dunno, pissed me, I killed him.
But anyways, uh, no one saw it and a,

633
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:00,460
I got the body in the trunk. So,
uh, just want to let you know.

634
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,410
Do you think she turns you in?

635
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,600
No. No Way. Because she's your wife. She's
my wife. Yeah. She wouldn't turn me in.

636
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,160
She would, she would have, she would
first, cause it's me. She'd go, well,

637
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:13,570
you're fucking around.
And I go, no dead series.

638
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,930
I'd show her the body and then she'd
go, well, you've got a plan. Right.

639
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,750
And then that's what she would want.
Yeah.

640
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
She wanted to know if I've got
some kind of a plan. No, let me,

641
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,100
let me be clear here. The
motivation for the murder. Yeah.

642
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,850
It was just that the guys w w uh,

643
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,760
side view mirror dinged our mailbox.
Like, can I tell you something at him off?

644
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:34,140
Stop hitting my fucking mailbox. Yeah.
Here. Talked to him about it and see,

645
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,000
and we've already gone over this.
Stop hitting the male parent and,

646
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,020
and you saw you kill him and then your
wife, your children. No, no kids. Okay.

647
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,490
But Christina, right there she is. She,
that's her. That's her immediate response.

648
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,710
Herniate.
Ricky's been snitching.

649
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,700
She's the fact that he would
just willy nilly kill people.

650
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,550
Kill me and on our children. That's why
you have to put no, no, no. That's right.

651
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,630
No, no, no. If I'm that
kind of ans listen, wait,

652
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,520
if I'm that kind of unstable guy that
kills someone, went over nothing,

653
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,570
then you better do the right thing and
help me out because I will fucking kill

654
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:11,360
you. That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying if my wife was like,

655
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,280
we need to tell someone, I'd be
like, that's it. You're dead.

656
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:17,210
You're fucking dead to you and Fedex
guy will be buried together. Si. Si, Si.

657
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,360
This thing that I think is
nonsense. Right? How pissed
I am at the Barista. Yeah.

658
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,610
Yeah. It might be. I might
be a hot head about it,

659
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,770
but that's why I'm pissed that she's like,
well,

660
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,750
how do I know you're not gonna
turn around and kill our children?

661
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,830
But Andrew just said, if she doesn't
help me, I'm going to kill her if you,

662
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,920
if you go against me. Yeah. That's my
constant fear is me going, Jill's in.

663
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,110
Why would you go against me?

664
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,470
Why would you then I have to walk on
eggshells for the rest of our marriage.

665
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,601
So after this,

666
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:49,601
are you joining the US marshals or
what's your I've got to protect our kids.

667
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:54,290
Tom, you're psycho. Well that's,
but no, that's it though.
I would, I would go fund,

668
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,020
first of all, I'd have to find a backup
wife. Then if you started questioning me,

669
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,330
I find a backup life.
Who's your second wife of choice?

670
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,930
What am I looking for
that might not a Dalmatian.

671
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:10,190
What does your dumb dumb. A total
bozo. You just like a 21 year old.

672
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,940
Barely there. Yeah. And you're more on
him back. I'll see you y'all next week.

673
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,540
That kind of thing. Give her, give
her like a YSL person. She's like,

674
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,110
you're the best and you're like, sit
in this room for a while. I'll do that.

675
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,040
Just give her some snacks or something.
Give her a little cash.

676
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm going to give her, give
her a buyer a, not an iPhone,

677
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:31,280
but like the iPod that looks like the
iPhone, but just tell her it's an iPhone,

678
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,630
you know, just, she's like, it doesn't get
it. The service will get connected soon.

679
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,220
Don't worry about it. Okay, I see that.
I love that girl Labia. I love you too.

680
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,700
She's got some really young
name that they don't, you know,

681
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,150
I'm writing a book about river
jobs and how you can blow jobs,

682
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,830
but that's what that girl does. She
does their time. Not Hands Watch Daddy.

683
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,510
Oh my God. Totally. Yeah. They
call you and they call you daddy.

684
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,320
They have to. That's just a rule.
That's automation wife. She's just, uh,

685
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,100
she's barely, they're being
called Daddy's pass. No thanks.

686
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,790
Hard task poppy.
And I've had it,

687
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,180
I've had it done once before
telling them out from him.

688
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,620
What do you think for me for fucking
three HD graduate from a total fucking

689
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:19,280
gutter slot. But poppies, poppies hot.
If it's coming from a Latino woman. Yeah,

690
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,870
but was it a Latino pig?
Who Was it?

691
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,610
Just some fucking Maria
Jody sludge chaser Jodie. So

692
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,770
pig course. Anyway, but
it's okay if it's from,

693
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,830
if it's a white girl that calls me Papi,
that's what are we doing?

694
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,790
What are you doing? Yeah. So
you're saying that, okay, so you,

695
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,790
you think your wife should be
ride or die with you at the core?

696
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,220
She's gotta be first degree. Okay.
Let me tell you, let's flip it.

697
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,600
If my wife is like,
Hey,

698
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:51,030
you know that bitch from the office that
I fight with for the last fucking three

699
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:54,480
years, I'd have to ask you what your
answer is. I slit her throat. I'm like,

700
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:58,230
gangster, where are we burying this
bitch? You'd be like, yeah, dude,

701
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:00,270
you want to drain it? And then I'm
thinking about camping. I'm like,

702
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:02,550
where can we put it? How far away
can we get and where am I going?

703
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:04,680
I gotta get the temperpedic. Yeah,
you came home and you're like,

704
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:07,740
I murdered someone. I'd be like, what
are we doing? How are we going to do

705
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,491
God?

706
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:16,491
I would take so much pride in coming up
with a cover story on me in the least

707
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:18,330
bit concerned about my [inaudible].

708
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,460
You had a reason even at the time,
if it doesn't make sense now,

709
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:25,210
it made sense then. Now we've
got to, you got to support.

710
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,660
Female killers are way fewer and
far between. True man killer.

711
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:32,550
So I'd probably be pretty crazy.
I mean,

712
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:35,940
if you start looking at me real
psychotic, okay, it's a little different,

713
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,970
but I fucking kill you.

714
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,810
Then I just want you to down afraid
of me stabbing you in your sleep.

715
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:41,820
Not unless you're taking it
to a thing where you're like,

716
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,010
like rocking back and forth, you know,
licking knives. I'd be like, all right,

717
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,090
something's rough with her, but if
you just told me a story, you're like,

718
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:51,720
I got real pissed off. I did
this crazy thing. Yeah, I
would totally be like, yeah,

719
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,450
I'm with you.
How do you know it's a onetime thing?

720
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,880
That's my problem with you and I know you.

721
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,140
You're very impulsive and,

722
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,440
and once you get a taste for killing,
it's not going to stop. Okay.

723
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:07,710
But you crossed that line. We're
not talking about brownies, right?

724
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,260
We're talking about, but once you
cross that light, that's the one line.

725
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:13,620
You're not supposed to Christ
once you do and it feels so good.

726
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:17,610
I know you're going to
like, it feels so good.

727
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,690
I know you,

728
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,500
you're going to like the three probably
does feel really good to take somebody's

729
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:25,210
life. I also think it's probably,
I think it's also like, well,

730
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,940
I'm the kind of guy who so like meticulous
about everything that the cleanup and

731
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:33,180
all that shit. Yeah. That would
probably deter me from doing it again.

732
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,000
It's just so laborious.
So you're like, oh my God,

733
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:40,410
I don't want to fucking bloodhounds
paperwork all the shit out now.

734
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,070
It's like buying a house. I know. They
keep sending you emails. You're like,

735
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:45,870
what is this? What am I signing? I
don't want to do this anymore. I don't,

736
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:49,570
I never will cash. I'm giving
you cash here and I just
take it. Well, the cleanup.

737
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,220
Yeah, it has to be. It's to be a thrill
to have someone tied up, I imagine.

738
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,850
You know what I mean? Like in a
base and just the control over them.

739
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,090
I kind of get that.
Oh my God.

740
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,800
It is kind of,

741
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,800
and it's kind of cool and it's kind of
cool where you walking in the and you

742
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:11,700
just shut the door. Just walk in
and stare at him. Don't do anything.

743
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:14,460
And I closed the door again.
Just give them little glimpses of you.

744
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,000
Help your wife listens to this Andrea.
She's going to,

745
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,920
she better stay in her
cage where she belongs.

746
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,380
Great guys. Okay. Moving right along.

747
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,320
I just want to see if come daddy
has any more fun. Oh Yeah, look. Oh,

748
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:32,980
she's dating somebody. They're
cute. They're cute together.

749
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,720
Full body shot by the way.
I'm surprised.

750
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:35,830
I thought that was going to cut off here,

751
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:39,310
but it's got the golf pants and everything
and I will say it doesn't usually

752
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:43,540
work out. It's worked out for her
quite nicely. I think she looks great,

753
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:47,830
but that shot right there of debt,
frankly arm that looks like literally me.

754
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,530
If I put tennis balls,
has as tits dead friendly.

755
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:54,100
Armed with that little bit of red hair,
that's me. That's me in a tank top.

756
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,560
This condition was prompted for
Christine when she was a man, uh,

757
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,380
and had a back injury. Uh Oh yeah.
Way makes sense to the hospital.

758
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:06,400
In the ambulance. She started
having orgasms and the next day,

759
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,990
according to this article,
she had 236 orgasms. Yeah.

760
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,770
The constant spasm is leaving her
pelvis and agony. It'd be on my knees.

761
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,640
All these people would be staring at
him. He was humiliating. Jeez man.

762
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,030
I've been lying to myself for so long.
I knew I was meant to be a woman. Oh,

763
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,880
I'm glad all these people are switching.
By the way,

764
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,030
if all these people that have wanted to
switch for so long and now that society

765
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:31,590
is like, do it, I'm like, go for it, man.
Whatever. Yeah. I think it's good to,

766
00:48:31,591 --> 00:48:33,520
people want to switch, go for
it. Whatever you gotta do,

767
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,470
there's got gotta be
nothing worse than feeling.

768
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,450
Then honestly feeling like
you're born in the wrong body.

769
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,950
That's gotta be the weirdest
feeling in the world.

770
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,460
Terror feeling in the world is being you
feeling like you're in the wrong way.

771
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:47,260
Like a guy that's such a guy. Yeah. You
transition is just always gonna look bad.

772
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,780
You know what I'm saying? She always
tells me that if I were to transition,

773
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:54,640
I'd be the ugliest, ugliest, but you
wouldn't be a babe. Yeah, yeah, you'd be,

774
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:58,210
you'd be a solid. Uh, he'd be a
big Husky Midwest girl, you know,

775
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:02,080
cause you have broad shoulders,
you know? Yeah. So much hair.

776
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,861
But you see some of those,

777
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:05,920
some of those guys say they got
to be like a seven in Omaha. Yeah.

778
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:10,630
You'd be a babe in Nebraska.
Just cutting trees and shit.

779
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,310
I'd think I'd be an okay chick. I'd
be, I'd be a sluts. I'd be wild.

780
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:20,460
So just fuck Ricky redhead girl.

781
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:24,280
I'd be a freaking red headed
girl running around. I also have,

782
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:26,920
my legs are kind of skinny
enough where I can send them out.

783
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,600
I could send them out and do hot chick
legs. You know, here's the thing,

784
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,810
by the way, all these guys, big
guys, when they start to transit,

785
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,950
we were watching that show and this
guy who trains it was transitioning.

786
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:40,630
It was like everyone thinks I'm
a man and he just decided and,

787
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:44,260
and he was big dude. It's like, dude, why
aren't you running every morning? Yeah.

788
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,910
I gotta lose the weight. Right. You can't,
I mean going to commit, you gotta commit.

789
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:51,530
If you're going to chop off the Wang are
you got to commit it dude. She's like,

790
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:55,650
people say things like, I looked like a
man. Like you're two 25 yeah, it's a big,

791
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,740
big, big broad. Yeah. Stop.
Stop benching dude. Come on.

792
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,840
Stop lifting at some point.

793
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,870
That's why I might switch just
so I can stop going to the gym.

794
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,430
I might just send out. You work out
a lot. I do. Really? Yeah, I do.

795
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,030
I've changed working out what I
work out now. I just try to swim.

796
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,280
I used to just be like, run,
lift weights, run, lift weights.

797
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,050
Now we just do different things to,
cause I just, it's so monotonous, boring.

798
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,870
And the people there are so boring.
That's true.

799
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,940
It's just the whole idea
of it is just kind of grow.

800
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,890
It grosses me out sometimes
when you see people like,

801
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,730
you know when you go to a gym, I don't
have, I don't go to gym anymore. We,

802
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,310
I have one at home,
which is great,

803
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,880
but when I used to go to a gym and I
see the same guy over and over doing the

804
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:39,100
same things and you're like, oh yeah,
this is like very like machines,

805
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,300
like creepy. Like he's doing the exact
same guy. What's up that guy and like, ah,

806
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:43,821
fuck.

807
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:48,140
That's especially weird when you see that
guy over the course of time not making

808
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,030
any progress. No progress. Yeah. Same Guy.

809
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,450
And sometimes you'll hear that same guy
complained like I just can't. He's like,

810
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,900
you're not doing anything right. Yeah.
That's why you're not making any progress.

811
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:58,830
That's even more sad,
stuck,

812
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,960
really sad is when people post
it on Instagram, their workouts,

813
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,460
I think there's nothing more fucking
boring. I don't want to call out anybody,

814
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:10,730
but there's someone I know that post
gym stuff all the time and I'm like, oh,

815
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:15,200
and I really like you,
but it bothers me so fucking much.

816
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:20,740
Does it bother you as much as people
retweet and compliments or, yeah,

817
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,220
that's Fred pretty parallel.

818
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,340
It actually bothers me when someone
I know comments on the gym photo in a

819
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:31,700
positive reinforcement.
Fucking snake. That's so self.

820
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:35,600
So after it dog. Yeah, go get
it brother Luke and Greg, Bro.

821
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,820
Shut the fuck you phony. That's such
a phony. Also the the gym people,

822
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:45,110
the few gym people that I know,
that dude that fucking shame,

823
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,840
like that's the hardest part
is they're not that good at,

824
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,610
they're not even that good of shape.
That's what bothers me.

825
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:53,650
It's not like jazz when you're
like, Whoa, the rack. Yeah,

826
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:58,820
he does his big, big fucking
grin, but it's the cocaine's Ma.

827
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,720
Oh yeah. Is that how positive
that guy really feels? No Way.

828
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:07,430
Cause his smile and he's like, hey,
he's like, feel good in my anchor.

829
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,040
I'm lifting this morning, shot eight
movies yesterday. Shut up fucking films.

830
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,620
That's for, I'm almost done with
my first workout of the day.

831
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,530
And you just see the smile just never
fade. And he's like, all right guys,

832
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,930
get after it. And you're
like, he's 6 million views.

833
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,140
There was an article that came out
that he suffers from depression that he

834
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,040
admitted he has severe
depression and you're like, ah,
I feel like a jerk. No, no,

835
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:32,660
no, no, no. Because if you spend all this
time working this and not your brain,

836
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,170
something's wrong. I'm not making
fun, but you're Gunna get depressed.

837
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,180
Like you're naturally, if all you
focused on was one thing all the time,

838
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,490
it's like, I know what I think is
depressing too. I've thought about this.

839
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:48,530
I think it's naturally depressing.
Those guys that get to number one,

840
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:51,410
number one. Totally.
I think it's gotta be,

841
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:54,800
it's so much attention and there's so
much pressure and I don't think it's a

842
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:59,000
coincidence that all the number one's
workout like lunatics. I think it's like,

843
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,590
I think it's actually kind of
depressing to get to get to that level.

844
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,710
Do you think number one's always self
sabotage or do you think that's just a

845
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:09,650
pattern of it? No, I don't
think they all self sabotage.

846
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,510
I think there's just so much pressure
to maintain it and there's a natural ebb

847
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:15,590
and flow.
Like you look at someone like Tom Cruise,

848
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,650
he was the number one of
number ones for a huge stretch.

849
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,600
Then like obviously it's weird, personal
stuff happens. It's all public, right?

850
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,020
It's like these Scientology theoretical,

851
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,050
crazy jumping. I love this woman, all
that shit. He puts it back together and,

852
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,780
but he also is known for having like,

853
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,960
I mean there's no kind of an odd point
of view personality and it's all tied to

854
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:43,390
staying in that top slot I think.
Right.

855
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,340
I get obsessed with being up
top posts and I won't say who,

856
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:48,700
but

857
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,580
people I follow, they're like
number one, just grinding.

858
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:54,680
That's all I know how to do grinding
work and it's like, dude, what's you,

859
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,100
what's your life about? That's
it. That's all you're going to do.

860
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,130
You are readily a multimillionaire
and just take a break.

861
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,060
I like reading that one. I'm
not doing anything that day.
That's my favorite shit.

862
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:07,480
And you're like, I'm winning today.
I didn't do shit. I feel fantastic.

863
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,970
I don't know who said that.
I think norm was talking about that.

864
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:11,960
That's on something when he was like,
yeah,

865
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,980
sometimes my day is so consumed with
getting a meal and a concern for the next

866
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,090
meal than my whole day is just
going to get food, having it,

867
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,410
doing it than going to get new food and
the day is over. And I did a whole day.

868
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,050
I was like, as like I've
had those days. Yeah.

869
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,680
And then when I see people doing
the thing bragging and I'm like,

870
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,230
I feel good that I didn't do shit.
I also think

871
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,540
that some of the, the grinding
braggers, they're really, they,

872
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,040
they're doing that for themselves. Oh,
totally. Not just as a, um, as a show off.

873
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,210
I think they need it.

874
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,720
They need to do it to keep going because
without the act of documenting it and

875
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,210
showing and getting the reinforcement
something, they lose something.

876
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:59,211
So they need to go check out how hard
I'm working and tell me how proud you are

877
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:00,360
of me for how hard I'm working.

878
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:00,950
Well,

879
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:04,070
I think there's two kinds of people though
that like some people like when they

880
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:07,300
get accolades, they have to tell
you. Yeah, and some people are,

881
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
I'm embarrassed of telling you.
Do you know what I mean?

882
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:12,380
Some people are so scared to let you
know that sometimes when you find out

883
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:14,570
something about a friend and you're like,
I didn't know you.

884
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,580
I didn't know you did that.
And they're like, oh yeah.

885
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:17,750
And they're kind of embarrassed about it.

886
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:22,190
But then I have so many of the other
friends, I have someone that will call me.

887
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:27,080
I wish I could say his fucking name. He
will call me and tell me of great thing.

888
00:55:27,081 --> 00:55:30,200
That's just that he's just acquired or
achieved or whatever. We all know, Bert,

889
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,600
what am I going to say?
What am I like?

890
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,370
I don't know what you expect the
response to be awesome, right?

891
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:42,580
I think I like to brag online only like
I like the online bragging is because

892
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,980
it's there. If you want to
see it gone gray. No. Uh,

893
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,050
but you know what I just realized it
makes me so annoyed about the workout

894
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:55,010
braggers is that you're
supposed to work out diff shit.

895
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,780
I took a shower today. Hey, I'm
fucking shower to brush my teeth.

896
00:55:59,781 --> 00:56:00,950
I took a shit like, no, dude,

897
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:04,880
you're supposed to do that
stuff to maintain your life.

898
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,770
There's no reason to brag
about or we're also all first.

899
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,720
The grind always supposed to be,
we should be grinding.

900
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,690
They're acting like they work hard

901
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,840
to maintain their life.
You work hard, but that's,

902
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,380
you know what the irony is the people
that are like grinding the hardest.

903
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,640
Like imagine the rock band, like on the
grind. Just had my personal chef cook,

904
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:27,670
my personal breakfast and my personal
gym with meanwhile a dude is like,

905
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:31,600
I'm on the grind, I'm on my fourth
job today. I'm tired. I have six kids.

906
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,230
I make 40 grand a year and the rocks,

907
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,890
like I can't tell you how
much that respect you.

908
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,150
Big Ass smile is so true,
Andrew.

909
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:44,150
It's like the guy that delivers my
Amazon package. He's fucking grinding.

910
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,410
By the way. If that is bragging on the
Granby and like fucking on the guide,

911
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,030
I'd be like respect dude.
For sure.

912
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,630
We need more of those grinders and
those guys don't want, they don't,

913
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,190
this is what they're going to ditch.

914
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:59,350
Phoenix 115 shovel in the air
grinder grinding. That's the real,

915
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:01,350
that's for sure.
Those people won't brag.

916
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:05,650
That's because they're the false
narrative of cool guys. Uh,

917
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,700
do what the rock does.

918
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:11,050
Then they feel like I got to get up
to that to do the and watch an insane

919
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:11,884
document.

920
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,730
Viceland put out a piece about these
people in Miami who rent exotic cars.

921
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,210
I started walking.
I got like halfway through.

922
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:23,020
I don't want to spoil it for the fucking
creepy cause I saw the text on screen.

923
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,790
That was like quarter of the way in
where they go. Sure, sure. I'm sorry.

924
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,380
I was just drinking water.
I'm a champion.

925
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,580
They're already saying,
they're like, we could,

926
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:38,170
we were not able to verify any of the
claims, get this guy. And I'm like,

927
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,810
that's not a normal thing
to put up on screen.

928
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:43,490
Like they're obviously prompting
you to pay attention to this. Yes.

929
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,250
And then they show him like
doing coke and like, yeah,

930
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,220
his friends where he's grinding.
He said yes to doing coke on camera,

931
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,920
like an ro one.

932
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:57,790
I am about to hit this town and then
I didn't get through it. I mean not,

933
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,530
I want to see the rest of it.

934
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,700
The basis of it is it to tie into what
we're saying is like, it's this fake,

935
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,770
like we're all winning,
we're all rich.

936
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,120
And he basically is saying how sad
it makes him that he's got to keep up

937
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:13,810
appearances because he can't,
he literally can't.

938
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:18,520
And he's like doing everything he can to
do anything he can to lie, cheat, steal,

939
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,730
do whatever he can look just to
look like it's just a fake it.

940
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,280
That's what's even more, do
you know, do they cover this?

941
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,820
I was trying to figure this out. So
this, this piece is all about how,

942
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:31,930
especially in Miami,
the exotic car rental business is.

943
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,300
I am. No, without a doubt. I mean
they're going to peak a Kansas.

944
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,580
Even the guy who's like, he's like, if
you come and you don't run a hot car,

945
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:47,530
your piece of shit drive that
narrative. So everyone's like, okay,

946
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,900
and it's all crazy expensive card.

947
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,990
We're talking like entry level 250
grand for these cars, Rambo all the way,

948
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:58,330
most Ferrari's Rolls Royce, you
know, Nutley's nothing, nothing.

949
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:02,260
Just regular luxury Uber,
same luxury car,

950
00:59:02,261 --> 00:59:06,280
like a s five 50 Mercedes. They like
get the fuck out of here with that shit.

951
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:09,370
But anyways, I'm seeing this and
watching and you're like, okay,

952
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:12,570
people will rent these cars,
do those businesses acquire all that?

953
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,920
That'd be way too much capital,
right to be with buying.

954
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,430
So it doesn't talk about it on there. But
of course our brains, right. In the same,

955
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,960
I started doing research cause I was like,

956
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,110
there's no way have enough capital
to buy 15 Lambros right, right.

957
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,670
And so there I found a few other articles
so you can look it up about people

958
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,200
that get these,
um,

959
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:35,470
the subsidies from major high if they're
reputable from high end companies to

960
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:39,960
like Lee lease and sublease from them.
And that's how they do. That's how they,

961
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,550
but they pay it,
but they pay a super premium on the,

962
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:47,551
on the leisure to be able to supply
rented one as a prank on Bert like a year

963
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:52,550
ago where I, you know, and
he was like, you bought this.

964
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,510
And I was talking to the people that
rented it to me about this. I was like,

965
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,720
cause they were cool and they were
like, oh they, they follow like comedy.

966
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,140
And they were like, you know, he's had in
the car. I go, so you buy all these cars?

967
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:07,970
And they were like, ah, yeah, like kind of
like dodging around it. I'm just curious,

968
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,090
I'm not trying to get into the
business with you. I'm just asking you.

969
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:13,040
And they were like, yeah,
these are all our cars.

970
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:18,070
Like it wasn't like they
didn't were forthcoming with
how they actually are able

971
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:21,830
to do. I think there's a million little
sneaky holes. Like there's one on sunset.

972
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,830
Um, there's one like right
on sunset next to a bar.

973
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,410
And one time I talked to the guy cause
there's like three cars in the showroom.

974
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,870
I was like, coming to you have, he's
like as many as we need. I was like, no,

975
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,350
that means you don't have shit,
but you're able to find them somehow.

976
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,460
I think they go find real owners or find,
you know,

977
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:41,360
companies that collect or whatever and
they pay them a premium over what they're

978
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:44,270
going to lease it for. It's just, it's
got to make sure it's a shady business.

979
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,600
It's a crazy business. Tom,
when you rented the Lambo,

980
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:52,130
did you put your car insurance or
did they go to jail for that? I take,

981
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:54,650
there's what? I rent cars on the
road. I'm like, my insurance is great.

982
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,440
What did it cost to rent the Lambo?
A G I, it was like a thousand,

983
01:00:57,441 --> 01:01:00,950
something like that. It was for a day.
You know, it's expensive, but I go,

984
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,830
you're not doing enough business to,
you know,

985
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:07,420
to pay off these kinds of car and make
a profit. There's no way, man. No.

986
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,360
They'd have to be literally conflict
the second you bring it back.

987
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,340
Every someone's,
they're waiting and they have,

988
01:01:13,341 --> 01:01:16,010
they're busy moments and everything
here in la too, you know, people,

989
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,140
you always see those high end cars,

990
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,690
Beverly hills and sometimes
it's an owner of a car,

991
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:24,170
but lot of times it's these exotic sunset
strip stuff. You know, it's all rentals,

992
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:27,080
rentals, people from out
of town. Although I was,

993
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,860
I met this guy who was a liaison,

994
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:33,080
you know these guys in La that
don't do real jobs that you're like,

995
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,510
but they get paid good money and you're
like, well how did you get there?

996
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,220
He's a liaison to this rich family
from Dubai and he basically is there

997
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:43,640
everything, go get it, go
do it. You know what I mean?
Like the, the ultimate gopher,

998
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,610
he does literally everything for
them. And he's like, oh yeah,

999
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:50,130
they constantly rent cars. They
won't just buy a car. He's like,

1000
01:01:50,131 --> 01:01:53,750
so they'll rent a Bentley for like two
months and then give it back and then

1001
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,130
they'll rent,
you know,

1002
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:58,340
Ferrari for a month and then give it
back in a Rolls Royce. I was like, what?

1003
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:00,080
That's, they just don't feel
like buying. He's like, no,

1004
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:03,260
they just don't want to have anything
acquired. They just want to like get it,

1005
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,300
give it back. Like everything is
at least everything is to rent.

1006
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,080
There's people like that that I think
come to la that spend absurd amounts of

1007
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:13,160
money on shit like that, and those
companies must make a ton of them,

1008
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,640
but they don't care because
there's so much. They're like, no,

1009
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:18,260
I just want to give it back. My
cousin came here to hear that. Well,

1010
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,520
they wouldn't you like,
oh yeah, if I was that.

1011
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:23,850
Well there is that kind of money in
La. You see, you see it, you're like,

1012
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:24,231
there's not,

1013
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:29,150
there's really rich people living in
that area that you were talking about.

1014
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,250
Yeah. Well, no, I'm Beverly. It
was at the Beverly Hilton. We were,

1015
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,230
some cab driver was telling us that
these girls come during the summertime at

1016
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:41,830
the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly,
Wilshire as Arab and like, you know,

1017
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,700
like Middle Eastern coming and it's like,

1018
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:49,500
before I forget what time of year
for Ramadan maybe? Or is it, yeah,

1019
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:53,190
I think so. Don't respect.
Don't disrespect. Ron was
a dare. Don't you? Dare,

1020
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,360
don't you dare.

1021
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,320
These girls come with like
their chaperones and then
their fathers and brothers

1022
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:00,390
are back home and the other gold country.

1023
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,740
And then they spend all this money on
like Chanel clothes and all these labels

1024
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:09,140
where, um, and then leave them
behind and you can't work.

1025
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:14,250
Oh whoa. It's a back into the
country. That's crazy. Where did they,

1026
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:17,670
where does it go? Does
someone like, they're like, I
don't know, throw the trash.

1027
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:23,100
You see some, some homeless dude wearing
a Chanel dress that's, he looks good.

1028
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,050
The thing is that the hotel was,

1029
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,500
we were there to have lunch with someone
and we were like, oh, that's right.

1030
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,330
We were, here we go, uh, what is going
on? Because it was so like so busy,

1031
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:35,640
but it didn't feel like a normal
day. And they're like, oh,

1032
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:37,590
I don't remember if he was robbing him.
It was some time of the year.

1033
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:41,250
They're like, oh, it's blah, blah
blah. And uh, this always happens.

1034
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,320
We'll get like thousand, you know,
princes and whatever here and there,

1035
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:49,680
like armed security people and they're
like, they're just nothing but lambos,

1036
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,300
Ferraris,
Rolls Royce.

1037
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,440
And then you saw hundreds of shopping
bags from all the rodeo drive cause they

1038
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:00,130
can't wear them back home cause they have
to wear traditional gear or whatever.

1039
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,150
I don't know what that's called. Yeah.
They said like, oh it's just fun.

1040
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:05,660
Like they'll buy it and wear it out
to dinner. And then there's, there's,

1041
01:04:05,661 --> 01:04:08,670
there's uh, he dropped the
[inaudible] job. Is it?

1042
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,570
That sounds really nice. But you
say with that face, I don't know if

1043
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,531
there was,
I watched,

1044
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:19,530
I watched one of these youtube warm
holes where people go about them.

1045
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,560
Don't talk shit.
Talk Shit.

1046
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,720
So if you want to talk some
shit cause that wine box video,

1047
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,790
oh my God. Yes. That's so one of
the best. I love that one. Um,

1048
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:37,690
oh I watched this video about people
that go rent cars in the m and a,

1049
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,750
what does it in Dubai,
in the Emirates or whatever.

1050
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,530
And they leave them at the airport.
Like there's, you can look it up.

1051
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:44,011
There's this video,

1052
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:47,310
there's like thousands of cars that are
like really nice cars because if you

1053
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:51,110
don't pay your, um, if you
skip payments, it's a prison.

1054
01:04:51,111 --> 01:04:53,640
Double offense in Dubai.
Oh dear. So they'll,

1055
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:56,070
what they'll do is they'll drive them to
the airport and they'll catch a flight

1056
01:04:56,071 --> 01:05:00,090
out of the country and, and
ghost. Wow. You look, look,

make their payment on yeah.

1059
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,040
Were they just leave the cars?
It's like a,

1060
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,890
it's like a car graveyard at the airport.

1061
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,240
When my cousin from Peru came here to
study English few years ago, he was with,

1062
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,530
it was all foreign people from all over
the world, his class. And he goes, oh, uh,

1066
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,670
And then they just bought him a place
and he takes out the whole class,

1073
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:48,250

English at USC. Oh, in college.

1074

But it was like at a, you know, an adult
study. Sure. Do you mean the government?

1075
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,130

1076
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:00,070

that if you're a citizen you can go to

1077
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:03,310

all right, and then give you money
and uh, I want to buy a house.

1079
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,590
Here's the money for the house.
If you go,

1080
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:13,120
I want to study anything at any part of
the world. It's on them because they go,

you're going to bring it back here.
So it go study that thing.

1082
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:20,000
It's a pretty flat, pretty black
system. I want this. Okay. I like it.

1083
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,530
I love it. We should move the fuck
are we doing here? They'd be like,

1084
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:26,980
give us the money. We want to
leave. We, these could live there.

1085
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,400
Not me as a little after we murder
that Fedex do, we might have to move.

1086
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:33,900
That guy keeps hitting the fucking
mailbox. What do you want us to do? Yeah.

1087
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:38,830
Damn you to the first
conversation is really nice. Hey
Man, you missed the, you, um,

1088
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,980

I've seen it. You hear that,

1089
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,080

01:06:53,811 --> 01:06:56,390
I didn't hit it, but sorry about that
many of them. Yeah. All right. Okay.

1093
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,080
Second day hits it and then you
go, hey dude, you were yesterday.

1094
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,650
You remember how we just, you know, I saw
the truck hit a 10. Now. I did see it.

1095
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:07,070
I saw it too loud. I think you
heard it. And then he says,

1096
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:11,960
and sticks out a little too
far. If I'm being honest in
mirror. No, no, the mailbox,

1097
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,020
it sticks out too far, so, okay,
well maybe you go around it.

1098
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,700
I can't sit tight turned from the corner.
All right.

1099
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:20,540
I gotta go do some other deliveries now
you start, now you're cooking day three,

1100
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,240
day three.
Now he really gets it.

1101
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:27,800
Now Tom's waiting for the guy you're
waiting outside for me as they say.

1102
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:31,940
And then I say it to you. I
go, hey man, smoked it today.

1103
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:35,500
Sorry about that. I, I
clipped it bad. I clipped.

1104
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,280
Took that turn fast and
I'm a little hung over.

1105
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,640
I'm also one of your packages that you
were supposed to get. It was a big one.

1106
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:45,640
Something important. I don't know. Um,
it broke at the warehouse so, well,

1107
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,280
you know. Okay. You figure
it out with them. Okay. Yeah.
All right. All right man.

1108
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:52,040
Have a good day. I'll see you
there now. You too. That's it.

1109
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:55,870
It's brewing underneath
three days of this. He said,

1110
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,720
then I see him at the juice bar. Yeah.
Here I am at the juice bar. I know,

1111
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,420
and I'm at the juice bar.
I know the guy that works there.

1112
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:06,080
He's been waiting in line for
quite a while. I Walk Right
in. I go, Mikey, what up?

1113
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:09,560
Boom. He, he's got my juice ready. Yeah.
I don't have to pay for it or nothing.

1114
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,690
He gets up there,
wants his juice.

1115
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,560
I got the last of whatever the juice
that he needed it. Oh fuck is what now?

1116
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:18,530
I go see a, now I go out the
stairs to the back parking lot.

1117
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:21,920
It's really like not even a parking lot.
It's like trash cans and stuff.

1118
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:26,340
Dumpsters and I see Fedex fucking frank.
Right?

1119
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,150
And he's just like, he's, he's
like, God damn, this is good.

1120
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:32,180
He's like making a scene of it. He's
bragging about it. God. It's like,

1121
01:08:32,181 --> 01:08:36,470
fuck you get the best mango here.
Best mango here. Why this shit in?

1122
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,220
And that's when I go like,
Oh hey man,

1123
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:43,940
I noticed you fucking parked without
hitting anything here, you know?

1124
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:48,650
And he's like, yeah, yeah. Oh, did you
want this? These are good. He's like, ah,

1125
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,240
I use throws him, check
it out. He goes like this.

1126
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,370
Oh Shit.
Hey look,

1127
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,520
any hits Tom in the head with the
empty one. What do you think happened?

1128
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,830
Yeah, yeah man. How do
you kill him? I mean,

1129
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,950
I think there's probably like a,

1130
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,940
a piece of juicing equipment that
broke that's in the parking lot. Yeah,

1131
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:15,210
there's a grinder type of blade.
They kind of half, half broke.

1132
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:20,780
I luck out and that when I pick it up
if feels like it's actually a handle for

1133
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,140
yeah. Like it's been made almost.
It's made for this and I just,

1134
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:29,030
he's just like eat a dick man. Try ups or
something like that. And as he does it,

1135
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,110
I just right behind them.

1136
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:37,100
Oh yeah. Cause it's a lot
of Blah, a lot of black.

1137
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:41,660
It's too much to be honest with
you. I probably panic, you know,

1138
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,980
a good bit at first and then it just hits
me that like the parking lot is not a

1139
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:50,450
parking lot. Like I, we're both in an
area where there's no cars, you know,

1140
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:52,780
so I'm like, oh, there's no one's seeing.
I look around, there's no cameras.

1141
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:55,790
I'm like, Oh man, I just, all right,
I gotta I gotta get Outta here.

1142
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,490
Clothes are covered in
blood. Yeah, I dunno.

1143
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,890
I feel like the way
that he hit the ground,

1144
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:05,510
most of the blood is like that there
is forward and it's going into a drain.

1145
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:09,560
You slit the throat from behind. Yeah,
but, but look at like this. If you,

1146
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:12,560
if someone came like this oof. And
his arms here, it went out that way.

1147
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,650
So he slipped and push,
push slit

1148
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,710
or the main thing I got to figure out
is yeah. So I, I backed my car up,

1149
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:25,410
I pick him up, I throw
them in the trunk. Yup.

1150
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,630
And then I looked at his truck and I'm
like, ah, just leave it here, I guess.

1151
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,500
You know, I don't think he came here
and it's illegally parked. I bet. Yup.

1152
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,140
What about the tickets?
There was a lady with a dog

1153
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:41,420
walking by. You're not going
to, you saw me do it. Of course.

1154
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,860
This is a new development. She goes,
oh, is it that comedian from Netflix?

1155
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:50,810
Todd Todd. Yeah. I'm
Todd. I love you. Yeah.

1156
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,970
Big Fan. Big Fan. You know what though?
You know you got to do with her.

1157
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,060
Yeah. Her throat. Now he just got to
hit her with your car. Oh, an accident.

1158
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:04,830
Oh no,
that is true.

1159
01:11:04,831 --> 01:11:08,450
You got to hit her with your car
and then if she says my name. Yeah,

1160
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:12,980
hundred percent yeah. Yeah. She knows. If
she knows you, it's just, oh, but the dog,

1161
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,010
you don't want to kill the dog.
You don't want

1162
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,150
to call it.
The dogs are cool,

1163
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,160
but you definitely got to hit her
and you've got to hit her hard.

1164
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,210
You gotta get her nice and hard.

1165
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,060
Now you got blood on the grill of the
car and then you've got a body in the

1166
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,590
trunk. Yeah, but you're
going to burn all that shit.

1167
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,230
Are you gonna burn the holes or the
whole car or the truck? I'll be, I think,

1168
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:28,000
I mean at the truck, first of
all. I mean that thing. Yeah,

1169
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:32,550
5,600 pounds or something. I mean, it's
come on 40 miles an hour. Even that,

1170
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:36,930
it's like, sure. It's over. Yeah, sure.
Yeah. I just try to clip her, you know,

1171
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:41,820
if anything she lives, there's definitely
memory loss. She's probably, you know,

1172
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:45,920
talking with her eyes, looking at letters
where the computer sure. Hey, yes,

1173
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:49,190
one of those.
So it was Todd Sikora that hit me.

1174
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:54,930
It takes me like 25 minutes to
get it out. Um, but I don't know.

1175
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,150
I then I just bring it home. I, I
tell you what's up and I'm like,

1176
01:11:57,151 --> 01:12:00,280
what are we gonna do with
this thing, right? No, now,

1177
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,890
now that you present the scenario
that way, like real talk, I,

1178
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,240
I might have to help. See, I know.
Really. There you go. Here's the thing.

1179
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:13,990
Cause like I would actually love you again
panic. It'd be like, fuck dude. Like I,

1180
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,450
what am I,
what are we going to do?

1181
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,630
I can't have you going away
to prison because you know,

1182
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,010
think about it that you got a tour in
2019 you all these dates coming out it,

1183
01:12:22,011 --> 01:12:24,330
you're selling out all these shows.
Bail on that dude.

1184
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,580
Yeah. Well that's what I, the people
are waiting for you to show up. I mean,

1185
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:29,730
think about all this. That's what I
up the pepper. Pepper. Pepper. Yeah.

1186
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,750
Think about the sex would be so hot.
He tells you this conversation he'd read,

1187
01:12:32,751 --> 01:12:36,330
does it reads the story and you're
like, I gotta fuck this guy. It's true.

1188
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,460
Dead Body or not, this is
hot man. Or I tell you during
sex. Yeah. Yeah. You're like,

1189
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:44,250
wait, what happened? Was that
the juice bar? You're like yeah.

1190
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,100
And then right before I come I go,

1191
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:52,101
Bought Him Guy Black Guy.

1192
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,890

Yeah. It's funny guys. By the way,

1194
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:05,360
this was sent to us so many times and uh,

1195
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:08,930
I'm sure it would have been in the
folder if blue band had prepped it,

1196
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:11,450
but I found it just,
you may have seen it also.

1197
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,230
This was sent to us up fucking
200 times this week. Okay. Yeah,

1198
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,540
I see that guy on Twitter.

1207
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,980
Don't come dry. Obama. Bring
your jug. Bring a blank.

1208
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:56,360
Let's get wet.

1209
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:04,210

Big booty pictures. I love you. Yes.

1211
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:09,570
See this is a perfect example of
what we were talking about earlier.

1212
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,770
The guy with no teeth making demands.

1213
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:16,720
I got to tell you, I like this guy.
Here's the thing. I think it's authentic.

1214
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:21,780
I think this guy really gets high with
women 40 years younger than him and it's

1215
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:25,480
probably cool. Like has like a decent
place where it's like it's not bad. Yeah.

1216
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:28,980
He's like, you got your,
brought it blonde. I brought
all these drinks. You know,

1217
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,960
he's like, come Yas. And
they're like, all right. Yeah.

1218
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:35,440
I just think like he probably, he's
probably super chill about everything.

1219
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,970
You know what I mean?
Like he seems like he's,

1220
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:41,230
he's woke enough that if a girl came
over and was like, I don't want to fuck,

1221
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,480
and he'd be like, that's chill.
Let's just get high as fuck.

1222
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:48,350
He doesn't seem like a foresee,
weird, creepy guy. Where
does he live? What do you,

1223
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:53,230
what kind of digs does he have? He's
in, he's just up by Bob Hope Airport.

1224
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:57,640
Just by Burbank airport. Yeah.
Yeah, like an apartment complex.

1225
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,850
It's one of those old dude. It's a, it
used to be a house now it's a duplex,

1226
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:05,560
you know? Yeah. And he's
got a, he's actually got the
dominant side of the yard,

1227
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:07,090
so like the other side's
concrete for the driveway,

1228
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:09,970
but he's got like a nice little patio
with those little string lights that he's

1229
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:13,600
got. It's pretty chill if I'm not
going to lie. It's kind of cool.

1230
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:18,700
He's gotten a cute, cute,
tiny little fucking fluffy
dog. Absolutely. Super Cute.

1231
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,850
Yeah.
He's not that bad of a dude.

1232
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:26,851
I feel like he's getting a weird rap
guy who's had a pretty decent job for 40

1233
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:32,620
years. He's always got cash on him.
He's got like, he has a cleaning lady.

1234
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:37,550
It was places. Nice Pacer.
Well treats her well. No teeth.

1235
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,740
He did not have,
I think he just had a lack of teeth.

1236
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,770
I don't think he had no teeth.
I think he was, he was, I
think it was, you know, two,

1237
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:48,350
three deficient. He's not new to the
drug game. I don't know if you know like

1238
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,010
getting wet and rolling blunts like,
yeah.

1239
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,900
Well it could be double

1240
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:02,440
p when you dip a blunt
in, in, it's formaldehyde.

1241
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:06,580
It's embalming fluid. We've been in
the game in the game for a long time.

1242
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:11,100
Kill people. We've hid
bodies to go way back. Yeah.

1243
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:16,060
We've been getting wet for years. I
was fucking with me. No, that's real.

1244
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,310
Getting wet means dipping a blunt in,

1245
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:22,330
in embalming fluid for
Formaldehyde or PCP.

1246
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:25,790
He makes you feel good. Feel really
fucking cool dude. We got some nice,

1247
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,930
good, good. Yeah, so he's had a
couple of runs. In fact he used to,

1248
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:35,950
before he got this desk job, he was
working, he was working at a funeral home.

1249
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:39,940
That's how I discovered doing
like getting wet regularly.

1250
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:44,830
It helps him not thinking about his
first wife and those kids that he hasn't

1251
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:48,550
seen in a long time.
So you do you do you get high like that?

1252
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,420
You know what's so sad? Must
Traction. She, Santa Clarita
is not that far. It's not,

1253
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,220
and he should go up there more often,

1254
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,920
but he's working on himself
a little bit right now.

1255
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,500
He can't go see those kids
in this condition now.

1256
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:02,110
And on that child support that
he's had to pay over the years.

1257
01:17:02,111 --> 01:17:03,720
He can't afford dental work.
No Way.

1258
01:17:03,721 --> 01:17:06,250
It's pay the wife and the
kids are fixed my teeth.

1259
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:08,200
Well at this point a lot of his
kids are thinking, you know,

1260
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:11,150
do I introduced him to my grandkids? Yeah,
he's great. He's great. And they're like,

1261
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:12,860
I don't know. I don't think it's
ready. You know? But they're,

1262
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:17,060
that's the irony of the whole thing is
he has a nice little Honda civic that he

1263
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,560
pumpkin and car to drive up there.

1264
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:22,220
But since he's ecofriendly he walks to
work because it's only three and a half

1265
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,690
guys eco friendly yet? No, he, yes,

1266
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:25,580
it's three and a half miles
from his house to his office.

1267
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,490
So he doesn't drive enough. So they
booted his car. So it's like, you know,

1268
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:31,250
one thing he does do Rago I can
tell you that it does do wrong.

1269
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:35,510
He uses too many of those cars smell.

1270
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:39,050
Oh my God. It seems was
like 15 of those like, um,

1271
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,850
it's like a evergreen
wintergreen, wintergreen. Yeah.
It goes overboard. Too many.

1272
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:47,150
Yes. He not only hangs the
trees from the rear view,

1273
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,700
but also on his turning
signal. Oh God, man.

1274
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:52,970
He puts the clips in the air
vents and under the seat.

1275
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:58,340
Do you think when you ask him how
his day's going that he elaborates?

1276
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,170
Like when he's at the checkout,
at the group pens. If you're cute,

1277
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,310
there's a lot of woman.
If you're a woman, yes.

1278
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:07,120
If you're a big booty girl that's looking
to get wet, then definitely. Yeah. Yeah.

1279
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,430
Oh yeah. Got About his day. But if you're
a guy, he's quick to brush you off. Yeah.

1280
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,450
If you're like, hey man, how's it going?
He's like, everything's fine. Yeah.

1281
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,880
He doesn't know if you're a snitch or a
po or what's your, you know what I mean?

1282
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:22,010
Yeah. He doesn't know your deal, dude.
He doesn't know. He's just, you know,

1283
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:25,640
who would snitch right
away? Prison. Chris Nicha.

1284
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,380
Although how you presented that scenario
to me, you guys and I felt the panic,

1285
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:32,570
but you see how that might
help them to say panic,

1286
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,970
but you see how that works because
when you empathize with us,

1287
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:36,850
you understood where that pain came from.

1288
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:40,850
Do you think this has a
similar vibe to you? This guy

1289
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:48,310
just break my heart. Certainly.
I agree. Good man. Merk hard.

1290
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,143
Good bye.

1291
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:56,590
Yup. No teeth, no teeth. No,
that's, that's genuinely no teeth.

1292
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:00,850
But hey guys, at least he
likes, he's educated. He's
watching Anderson Cooper. Yeah.

1293
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,380
Yeah. He's up on current events
and I am a fan of full volume.

1294
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:09,090
While you're making a video,
the camera,

1295
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:13,570
this is out there. Yeah. Framing wise.
It definitely. Can I tell you something?

1296
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:14,980
It hasn't,
has no idea.

1297
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:18,000
Anderson Cooper's gay and would turn
that off if you found out. Oh probably.

1298
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:22,910
You know what I mean? He would be
in such shock and called him. What?

1299
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:27,420
What? What do you mean gay?
Like goofy. Like a weird guy.
You meet a foo foo stuff.

1300
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,720
Totally is. No, no idea. I feel like
I feel like that, you know how many,

1301
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,850
how many people like
Kevin Spacey coming out,

1302
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:37,780
coming out to the world at
a very inappropriate time
when he also got accused of

1303
01:19:37,781 --> 01:19:42,600
touching boys. Yeah. So many people in
middle America where like he's not gay,

1304
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:46,960
gay, no worse. Where are you from
originally? Chicago. Oh, okay. Okay.

1305
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,400
But I know like funny,

1306
01:19:48,401 --> 01:19:53,401
the epicenter of the Midwest is a city
that's like such a diverse create like

1307
01:19:53,441 --> 01:19:55,570
you don't have any. Yeah.
But then like, you know,

1308
01:19:55,690 --> 01:20:00,130
an hour west or south or two hours south,
you're like, oh man, this is different.

1309
01:20:00,131 --> 01:20:03,810
This is different words.
Same in California though.
Same thing. Yeah, same thing.

1310
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:04,930
Yeah, but, but,

1311
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,120
but the population of southern
people in Southern Illinois,

1312
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,490
people in Southern Illinois,
I remember as a kid going down there,

1313
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,700
they have southern accents. Oh, that's so
weird. And you're like, wow, no one, no,

1314
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:16,380
we don't, not in Illinois.
We don't have that.

1315
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:20,760
But people will have kind of like a 20
minute down South Korea and you're like,

1316
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:25,320
what did I know? But they say it like
it's the deep south that's, you can,

1317
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,270
you can run into that in a lot of states.
Yeah.

1318
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,570
They just have southern rural
sense. Yeah. It's so weird.

1319
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,720
It's like you can run into it and
like, uh, mid central California. Yeah.

1320
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,500
That is so strange to me.
I don't know how that ended up over there.

1321
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,680
Really weird to really weird places
with creepy names. Like Visalia. Yeah.

1322
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:46,140
My style. Yeah. Yeah. The way to San
Francisco, right? Yeah. Bakersfield.

1323
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,290
Oh, Christ. This guy.

1324
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,910
Straight up sex or play foreplay.
Look at his eyebrows. Foreplay.

1325
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,240
No, it good. Damn man. You know.

1326
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:05,160
Agree Dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Making
more demands. Anything wrong though.

1327
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:09,750
He's clean now. This
guy's living situation is
significantly different. Yeah.

1328
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:13,950
What do you see? This guy's
pretty unfortunate actually.
He's, he has a house. Um,

1329
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,200
it's a, not really a house
anymore, but it's like a,

1330
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,720
it used to be a nice little piece of
property had in Tarzana and when his wife

1331
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:22,554
left him,

1332
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:26,730
everything left him the need to clean
and take care of it and it's overgrown.

1333
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,530
It's, it's really, really sad.

1334
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:31,240
His neighbors have called
multiple times to Hoa about him.

1335
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:36,040
Do you think he has animals? Multiple.
Any cat piss everywhere and he doesn't,

1336
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:40,380
he lets them roam past tense.
He had animals snip,

1337
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:43,260
but then they just die. You know? I
think he drops on you when you come over.

1338
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:46,590
If he gets you to come over, you have
to all do you take in all this shit.

1339
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:51,030
He's like, mom, my mom is in the back.
Your mom is that. She's real sick.

1340
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:54,440
You don't, you don't make
much noise. She's real sick.
You're like, all right. Yeah.

1341
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,610
And you're like, what's that noise that
by no later. Yes. That kind of thing.

1342
01:21:57,611 --> 01:22:00,060
And he's like, Shit, don't make
you, don't make a fuss. She smoked.

1343
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:02,850
So will be here in the morning to change
it. Don't, she's in the iron lung,

1344
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:06,190
you know,
like she'll say she'll be fine here.

1345
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:09,790
That his lips are also a kind
of a shade of purple. Yeah.

1346
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:14,730
To me could indicate the tobacco
use or he's close to dying.

1347
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,530
Could be good. Could be inching
his way towards death is about,

1348
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:24,300
he's just about a heroine. Wait
a minute. Do you mean to tell me?

1349
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:28,020
Hold on, hold on. You don't
think this guy lives a very,

1350
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:32,280
very healthy lifestyle? I
feel like I don't, let me see
him one more time. Nowhere.

1351
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,450
Bam.
Teeth or in his mouth.

1352
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:38,670
I am an on here.
You know they get shit.

1353
01:22:38,671 --> 01:22:43,550
God don't look great. No.
Stay with you longer. Yeah.

1354
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,840
Cheat on. You worked another one. Okay.
And won't cheat on you with another guy.

1355
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:53,880
Now did he put in the top and the bottom?
I'm only spirit. Bottom. Just the bottom.

1356
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,540
I feel like just the bottoms, right? Yeah.

1357
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:59,870
Yeah. Marking guy. He can have anybody
he wants. Yeah, that's true. Thank you.

1358
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:04,520
Really want you, we want you
for that. I got on my arm.

1359
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,380
What's he watching today?

1360
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,960
This is a game. I think it was actual
high, low game. Full volume. Loud.

1361
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:13,090
You can pick up what's
going on in the game.

1362
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,310
It'd be so great if he
shot this behind the TV,

1363
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,950
like just sitting right behind
the TV hadn't been even funnier.

1364
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,320
It's going to say that halfway in the DV,

1365
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:25,120
one of my biggest pet peeves is talking
to somebody on the phone and like,

1366
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:28,270
let's say they don't get
within the first few seconds.

1367
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,610
If you hear the background like
that, you're like, hey man,

1368
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:34,660
are we going to talk a hang up? Yeah.
I mean my dad's still, I'll be like,

1369
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:38,260
what's that noise? I'll try to
like, yeah. He's like, Oh yeah,

1370
01:23:38,261 --> 01:23:42,080
I got turned TV and stands up.
I gotta find the remote.

1371
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:46,240
Turns it off. Hold on, hold on. You
know what's interesting, so loud.

1372
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,990
This fake wooden paneling and
the background and these beams.

1373
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:54,250
These are like old San Fernando Valley
type household. Definitely an old ass.

1374
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:55,780
You're right about that. Yeah. Did.

1375
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:59,260
We didn't actually show Andrew how
we were introduced to this guy.

1376
01:23:59,261 --> 01:24:03,730
This is actually how he's known
to us. It's from this video. Oh,

1377
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,200
last lady,
10 15 times.

1378
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:11,200
I even went Beaumont's wow.

1379
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,640
Yeah. That's really good. Yup. Do you
guys think he's lying? I don't know.

1380
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:16,510
I always think it's cool,

1381
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:19,960
like when guys brag about how good
they are about on sex, I'm like,

1382
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:22,210
this is a cool guy. I think
he needs us most got, yeah,

1383
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:24,750
I feel like I know how to
flop. You're like, oh no.

1384
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,130
Probably guys knowing how to fuck
really. Well yeah. If you're like,

1385
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,090
I think he's got like some form of are
you super strong too? Oh, that's good too.

1386
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,530
Tough guys. Strong mark.
When they brag being smart.

1387
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,840
I don't know. I think I gotta
be honest. I think he's right.

1388
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:41,380
I think that sounds true.
He'll make you gum. Yeah.

1389
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:44,320
Do you think that's his pitch
when he meets a girl? Yes.

1390
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:48,840
That's like he's calm 10 15 times.
How much time you got? Like, um,

1391
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I guess I got time to come. I would
love to come 15 times. Okay. Well,

1392
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:56,430
but Tom and I were talking about
this is that, that's not the, um,

1393
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:01,150
the lore for women. No, like make
it, you don't want to come 15 times.

1394
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:03,610
I don't know.
I feel like you're Josh in us.

1395
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:06,880
Like that's how a dude would
entice another dude. Yeah.

1396
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:09,160
That's in the gay community
that is letters the same pitch.

1397
01:25:09,161 --> 01:25:11,860
I'll make you come 10 15 times.
Guys are like, heck yeah,

1398
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:14,880
let's go to your house right now.
What are we doing at this bar? God,

1399
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:19,330
it must be amazing. It must be so good.
How much fun? How much fun? My neighbor,

1400
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,440
my old neighbor and the old building, he,
he was a pump king. He was the pump king.

1401
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:26,200
That's what I called him cause
he would fuck all the time.

1402
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:28,720
Always Awesome Fun Party.

1403
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:32,980
Common common new people coming by.
Just in, I'd sit there on my window,

1404
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:36,490
just stay Erin wave and sometimes it's
some of the new visitors, you know,

1405
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:39,970
some of them up like, yeah, fucking good
rid. What'd you do tonight? I did a spot.

1406
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,980
Yeah,
I did one spot and I jerked off my,

1407
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,890
my wife was sleeping in the
bedroom and I'm ate some cereal,

1408
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:49,210
but I watched you three guys
tonight. Yeah, I saw crazy.
Yeah. Sometimes he would.

1409
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,120
Sometimes he would fuck on
the living room and I had a,

1410
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:54,610
he'd leave the blinds open a little bit.
I wouldn't watch from for long.

1411
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,630
Maybe two or three nuts.

1412
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:01,840
We got an email from somebody said last
night my wife and I decided to partake

1413
01:26:01,841 --> 01:26:02,674
in marital love.

1414
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:05,510
I had finished my part of the oral
exchange and it was time to receive.

1415
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:09,440
Everything was going great until out of
nowhere she starts laughing hysterically,

1416
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:12,620
which is never a good sign.
I tried to stay in the game,

1417
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:14,540
but I wanted to know what's up.
Through her laughter.

1418
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,320
She managed to cobble together a,
I'm sorry,

1419
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:23,680
I was just remembering when Christina
said that Tom's asshole is hot and gave me

1420
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:28,790
so thanks for that Brian from Toronto.
You're welcome. That's nice. Yeah. Nice.

1421
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:31,190
Your wife.
I don't want to give it to me.

1422
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:36,100
Does she touch your be whole? Is she
a fanning or be home? No. You know,

1423
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:39,290
she's kind of, she's, she's, I think
she gave it a whirl once and I,

1424
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:42,170
I panicked a little bit.
Sure. Yeah. And I just,

1425
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,870
it's like my no fly zone for some reason.
I don't know why.

1426
01:26:44,871 --> 01:26:47,610
For some reason the shit comes
out of there. Yeah. But I mean, I,

1427
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,300
I'll tell you the hell out of her.
I love fucking looking ass.

1428
01:26:50,301 --> 01:26:54,800
I'm a big ass liquor, big ass liquor.
So it's just, you know, that's,

1429
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:59,120
that's for when she doesn't have to
reciprocate and eat your scrum. No,

1430
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:00,890
I don't know. I don't really want
her to, you know what I mean?

1431
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:05,150
I'd appreciate a little bit more gagging
on the old Knob, but uh, yeah, you could,

1432
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:09,260
uh, he could slob on it a little bit more,
but no, the butthole is just kinda like,

1433
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,810
eh. Let it be, you know, you guys
are so amazing. Yes. Listening.

1434
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:14,630
My has a couple of more,
couple of,

1435
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:17,750
more of those and now the butthole
is just kind of like, um, yeah,

1436
01:27:17,751 --> 01:27:19,880
we gave it a whirl. We can't,
we know. We tried it. Yeah.

1437
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:23,570
We ate at that restaurant and if it wasn't
that good, you know, so it's like, Nah,

1438
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,920
we're not going to come back.
Maybe I want,

1439
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:27,950
I've already tried to get you to just
like take a little test drive, you know?

1440
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,750
Yeah. Just to try to like your scrap.
Yeah. But it's too hot. It's like,

1441
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,260
this is why I said it's hot and
gaming where it's not as Gamey.

1442
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:40,760
You could make up for some, maybe
like some a ball Chokan like some ball

1443
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,140
but like really, but through
the, through the pop,

1444
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,040
that's not even real.
Life is real. It's real.

1445
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,210
It's very real.

1446
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,460
I'm a Baja Baja Baja.
Absolutely.

1447
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,653
Yeah.

1448
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:12,290
Yeah. That's all I want you to do. Little
Huff, you know, I mean just stop being so,

1449
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:17,440
so reserved about it. You know, just get
in there. Are you a low hanging fruit?

1450
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:21,150
Got Low hanging fruit? No, I think
they're pretty, I think that is fantastic.

1451
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:24,080
They're high and tight. Yeah, they're
good now. He's got great balls.

1452
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:27,190
I've always complimented you on your
balls are getting lower and I getting

1453
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:30,620
worried about it. Really. They're
starting to swing. They're starting to,

1454
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,260
they're starting to swing.
Swing a little there are we like,

1455
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:37,420
I won't say that this happens with any
regularity but if it's July and it says

1456
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:41,350
it's the right or wrong toilet.
Yeah, it will get some splash.

1457
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:45,080
It's a couple of swingers I get and I
thought I got a little weird out back

1458
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:47,400
cause I asked another buddy and I was
like, can I see are nuts. Like how,

1459
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,460
how tighten are nuts.
He was like, for sure.

1460
01:28:49,461 --> 01:28:53,100
And he showed me his nuts and I was like,
oh no. Like I think you're really there.

1461
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:56,010
Do anything like my dads,
if that's all future. Okay.

1462
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,820
That's what I'm scared about
because my dad's nuts are the,

1463
01:28:58,821 --> 01:29:03,420
he puts him there on his knees and they're
insane and that looks like a pig from

1464
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:08,070
like a pig's ball so bad.
I was scared of that.

1465
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:11,430
He's never shy around me and I go, Oh
God. I saw him from behind. I was like,

1466
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:14,880
Jesus Christ. He bent over
to put on underwear. I was
like, are those your ball?

1467
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:19,120
He's like, get outta here. And
I was like, dude, crazy. Yeah,

1468
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,730
like grocery bags.
So slumping philosophy on the cruise.

1469
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:24,420
When he lame,

1470
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:28,230
he laid on the bed with in boxer shorts
and each ball swung his legs over and I

1471
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:32,760
caught a glimpse and then he
called, he was like, come on man.

1472
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,020
They're just my nuts son,
your daughter.

1473
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:39,990
So she's seen that sound like your mother.
I was like, I have seen a lot. I know,

1474
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:43,380
but I was like, do you think she wants
to see your balls dude? And he was like,

1475
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:47,820
all right. I was like, all right man.
A part of a part of him was so cool.

1476
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:53,280
Oh sorry. No, go ahead. No, go. Does
it hurt when they get hang here?

1477
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:56,440
Like does it hurt cause my tits.
Yeah,

1478
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:00,690
but that's so the weight differential.
This is so light. Think about how heavy.

1479
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:04,020
That's heavy. That's like that's
how these, no, this doesn't hurt.

1480
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,130
It only hurts when I'm only
hurts sometimes in bed.

1481
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:12,740
Like if I'm in an awkward
position sleeping and if I
roll over a weird way and

1482
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,760
I'm like Ah,
and I got him caught up a little bit.

1483
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:18,400
Or you can sit like especially
wear jeans a little. Yeah, that,

1484
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,540
that line we'll kind of, you'll be
like, oh shit. Yeah, that hurts.

1485
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,410
Cuts your nuts and probably going to
increase more as you get older for,

1486
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,070
she should make jeans for your nuts.

1487
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:30,490
Like the two little nut that comes
through your genes. Huggers, not hug,

1488
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,100
none huggers.
That's what the genes will be called.

1489
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:36,120
Or even like a stretchy panel for that
area of the crotch? Well, they make,

1490
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:40,320
they make, um, they make night pants like
that. I really liked like, uh, you know,

1491
01:30:40,321 --> 01:30:41,280
like nighttime jammies,

1492
01:30:41,281 --> 01:30:46,080
they make really like big cups for your
nuts and your balls. I really love that.

1493
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:47,220
Yeah. It's really nice. Yeah.

1494
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:50,160
And where are these nighttime pants
sometimes and my cock sits in this little

1495
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:52,540
just in this little bowl,
like a little cock and buffalo.

1496
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:56,610
It's like someone holding it up just
gently and it's nice and soft and it feels

1497
01:30:56,611 --> 01:30:59,990
like this sometimes. I love it.
That's nice. Yeah, it's really nice.

1498
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:04,480
You do. Are you a fan of
ball play? Do you like ball,

1499
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:07,530
golf? Everything. Do it, go
for it. Give it, give it to me.

1500
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,800
The only thing I never over the years are,
the only thing I learned is one,

1501
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:12,660
it takes me way too long
to come from a blow job.

1502
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:14,820
That's just an honest fact
and unfortunate truth.

1503
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:18,780
I remember being like getting my
first one and I was like, wow,

1504
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:21,900
I'm never going to come. This
is bad. Yeah, it scared me.

1505
01:31:21,901 --> 01:31:22,920
And then I think it fucked with my head.

1506
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:27,480
Then for years I would swerve women from
giving me a blow job really well cause

1507
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:29,580
I was like, can we just have
sex? And like yeah, okay.

1508
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,220
Like if it was for play it was like let's
just fuck cause I was so scared that

1509
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:33,054
they were going to be like,

1510
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,430
why can't he come from
heard about multiple comics
doing that as a like to like

1511
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:40,800
to Dalmatians on the road. They'd
be like, you want to know something?

1512
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,520
I can't come from a blowjob
and I just got to stick it in.

1513
01:31:44,521 --> 01:31:48,000
And then the girls be like, ah.
And he's like, it's never happened.

1514
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:52,440
And they're like, you haven't had one
for me. And it was just to solicit. Yeah,

1515
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:54,750
that's smart. Yeah. No
mine's more pathetic.

1516
01:31:54,751 --> 01:31:58,110
Mine's like I just am in my head
and I just can't, he can't. Yeah,

1517
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:01,690
I just don't come that fast. And
then I get conscious. I'm like,

1518
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,280
she's been sucking my cock for way too
long. This is bad. I feel like a mean guy,

1519
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:06,881
you know,

1520
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:10,180
cause then they kind of look at you like
you're going to come and you're like,

1521
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:14,560
I don't know. I don't think so. I don't
know. I'm sorry. And they're like,

1522
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:18,160
am I bad at this? And you're
like, yeah, you're pretty bad.

1523
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:20,560
That's the best is when you get into
their confidence and they're like,

1524
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,580
what should I do? You're
like, try harder than

1525
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,450
that. And I don't like, I don't like, I
don't like super aggro. I like ball play,

1526
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:36,310
but I don't like them when people like
some people like hard,

1527
01:32:36,311 --> 01:32:39,770
weird shit.
I've seen those videos that's fun raise.

1528
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:43,060
He like to get some like smacked
and like even this, that hurts,

1529
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:46,570
that hurts on your balls.
You'll see people full on slapping.

1530
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:48,900
The pulling one is weird when they,
you know,

1531
01:32:48,901 --> 01:32:52,450
they wrote the bag and they pull
it down is that one moves to watch,

1532
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,290
watch a Brazilian video.
It was a,

1533
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:59,860
it was a Argent time and it was a,
they love shit like that.

1534
01:32:59,861 --> 01:33:03,560
The guy in the office, it was, the
setup was, um, he's in the office,

1535
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:05,110
like waiting for an interview,
you know,

1536
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,950
and he's like waiting for the job
that she comes in. She's like six,

1537
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:11,170
two and heels like,

1538
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:14,780
like it looks like a real office
worker and I'm here for jobs. Yeah.

1539
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:19,080
And so she right away it's like how
bad do you want the job? And he's like,

1540
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:25,000
and then dude takes his pants off and
he has the underwear on for a while and

1541
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:27,010
sometimes with the underwear on you go,
ah,

1542
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:30,160
this is probably a pad in
there or something. Yeah.
Then then the word comes off.

1543
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:34,000
She starts kicking this guy in the balls.
So God,

1544
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:39,460
it makes me like inside makes me curl up.
She pulls holes,

1545
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:42,710
suffer,
suffered,

1546
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:49,300
his legs would shake.
So then used to ask me to play,

1547
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:52,560
that made me laugh so much.
Your lab is there.

1548
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,210
And then like what the fuck is this?
I want to see blood,

1549
01:33:55,211 --> 01:33:58,720
I want to see blood and they'd
have that bad. Am I dick? No Lady.

1550
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:04,930
Don't make me laugh the most.
He'd asked for more.

1551
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:10,000
I don't know how you can cause
honestly the pain of much,

1552
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:12,880
much less than that makes me collapse.
Oh yeah.

1553
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:15,650
Like I'm at my dad's funeral fucking like,

1554
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:20,440
I won't be able to move one tap one.
So how does this guy take this? It's,

1555
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:22,930
I think at some point it's
mental that they're just like,

1556
01:34:22,931 --> 01:34:27,160
they're so fucking deranged that the
pain is so intense. It's like satisfying.

1557
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:31,240
You know when people do that, he's like
pain fucking Mongols that are like the,

1558
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:32,021
the harder it is,

1559
01:34:32,021 --> 01:34:35,590
the more that the less they
feel in a weird way because
it's like so intense. It,

1560
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:38,720
oh, it takes over. I can't
know. Too sensitive. No,

1561
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,130
I don't like being hurt last week. Oh,
go ahead. Go ahead. I was going to say,

1562
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:45,850
you made me think of like the funniest
porn scenario to me that I see that I

1563
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:49,030
watched the video, but it doesn't turn
me on is you've been steel. You see,

1564
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:53,200
I caught you stealing. You ever seen that
one? No. Oh my God. It's like, it's so,

1565
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:56,800
oh wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's
like the employee that's like,

1566
01:34:56,801 --> 01:34:59,540
you're my new employee and she's like,
I'm your new employee. And he's like,

1567
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,590
did you steal something? She's like,
I don't think I took anything. How?

1568
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,980
How would I have taken something?

1569
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:07,300
And he strips them down and of course
they have something like insane,

1570
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:11,230
like insane. It's like a laptop that
she stole in her. Like in her, you know,

1571
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,780
and like her jeans. Yeah. He's like,
I saw you still stole this. He's like,

1572
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:17,670
I'm going to have to punish you. I'll
do anything. And you're like this,

1573
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,840
it's such a poor, poorly written
scenario. Cause scenarios.

1574
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:25,520
Now we're getting like they're either
insanely good and they turned me on or

1575
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:30,490
they're just so bad and so
shitty and creepy. Like the
brother sister shit. Yeah,

1576
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:35,480
that shit. People love it. It's
fucking everywhere. It was popular.

1577
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:38,570
I think it all incest things are
super popular. Oh, I opened up,

1578
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:40,580
I opened up porn hub.
Any of those right away.

1579
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,840
Stepbrother fucks step stepsister and they
liked it. They always say it. I'm like,

1580
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:47,540
who the role is there? Like
sis. She was like, yeah Bro.

1581
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,790
Like you would talk like that,

1582
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,890
but it's to establish like gives me sister
mom said you were going to make lunch,

1583
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:57,890
which was like, oh I got lunch for
you brother. And he's like, Whoa,

1584
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:58,820
fucking suck my Dick.

1585
01:35:58,821 --> 01:36:01,250
Then then that's like the start
to the scene and she's like, fine,

1586
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:04,610
if you'll shut up about it.
Yeah. God about making lodge.

1587
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,230
I haven't come to any of those
videos today. Maybe it's because,

1588
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:12,440
I mean I don't know. I'm just thinking
about therapy thing. Like are,

1589
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:16,100
do you have to repress looking at your,
I don't know. I don't have siblings.

1590
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:20,050
Like do you have to repress that shit so
deeply? No, it's not a, I think it's a,

1591
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:23,570
just an people love naughty.
I think super taboo. Taboo.

1592
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,230
It's not even the idea that would never
fuck their sister ever gross. Disgusting.

1593
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:29,660
But then they see that and they're like,
it's so wrong.

1594
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,250
Like it's wrong to the wrong.

1595
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,640
It's also cause they're watching two
strangers do it. Like your actual,

1596
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:39,170
like if a family member was even in your
sexual zeitgeists then you really have

1597
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:40,880
an issue.
But I think it's cause they're like,

1598
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:44,180
I don't know these fucking people right
here just to Weirdos and I'm watching do

1599
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:47,810
weird shit is really fucking her brother.
That's nuts.

1600
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:49,100
I definitely got to come to us.

1601
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:53,810
And what don't you think of your own
relationship with your brother? No,

1602
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:57,140
we were sent this last week.
Apparently I didn't know this,

1603
01:36:57,141 --> 01:37:01,670
but I gotta show this to Andrew.
I got to see it. Um, this,

1604
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:04,310
this has been around for a couple of
years. I thought this was new to us,

1605
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:07,310
but this video has been around
for a couple of years. Um,

1606
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,960
I don't know if you've seen this,
but this is what's been around. Uh,

1607
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:13,600
we played it last week.
Oh God.

1608
01:37:13,601 --> 01:37:17,810
And Julia made Joe just wanted to say hi.

1609
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:19,670
Wish you a great day.

1610
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:25,100
Tell you that meeting you yesterday and
getting a look at you was probably one

1611
01:37:25,101 --> 01:37:28,190
of the greatest moments of my life.
You was so beautiful.

1612
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:33,290
You don't know how beautiful you
are to me. So just, you're gorgeous.

1613
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:34,130
You're precious.

1614
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:39,080
The met her at a club and got her
number and then she woke up to this,

1615
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,480
this nice guy. Inbox. Sweet
guy. Sweet. So far. Yeah,

1616
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:46,460
you're gorgeous.
He's got a good goatee.

1617
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:51,140
He combed his hair and he's got the fan
running. I like this. He's almost too,

1618
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:55,620
it's a great goatee. It's in the, in
the, in the world of goatees. Got It.

1619
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:58,920
That's the one. He's got a cute
little bunch and underneath there.

1620
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:00,480
So the more hairs growing in the crevasse,

1621
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:04,170
but it's been sitting in my
mind when you said to me,

1622
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:08,550
you want to go back with
your ex boyfriend, please
erase him from your memory.

1623
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:10,140
Please don't ever go back in the past.

1624
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:14,790
I know because I've been there and I
understand when you know you're trying to

1625
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:19,791
find somebody and you'd go on dates and
not the compares to your Eurex but hold

1626
01:38:21,451 --> 01:38:23,400
on. He was religious by the way. You
didn't see the cross in the hallway.

1627
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:28,950
You know what kind of guy he is? Yeah,
he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He, um,

1628
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:34,160
he also will let her know that if she
were to knock it back to your ex and go

1629
01:38:34,771 --> 01:38:37,560
with him,
that she would forget about her.

1630
01:38:37,561 --> 01:38:41,250
I love you like you've never been loved
before. I believe it. I will cherish you.

1631
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:47,100
I'll make you just fans. Still a woman.
I believe me. After you experienced me,

1632
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:50,760
you won't even know who your ex
boyfriend is. Almost like that.

1633
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:54,000
I make you come guy threat.
Similar proposal. Yup. Yeah.

1634
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,650
And then let's take you
guys on this podcast today.

1635
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:02,280
The creepy guy up a heart
open to making your arms both.

1636
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:04,410
Let's go full throttle.
Oh yeah.

1637
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:07,350
I could see me falling in love
with you just so I don't know.

1638
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:12,210
I just looked into your eyes and I just
melt. Wow. This guy's a fucking bromantic.

1639
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,810
Yeah.
I'm liking this kind of loud.

1640
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,410
I like everything he's got at this
guy up with a sister. Come on.

1641
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,840
Yeah. Let's see what else
he's got to say. I mean,

1642
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:26,010
I'm so interested in this guy's
rhetoric. Do you when you, for me,

1643
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:30,810
when I see something like this
feeling is like my new best friend,

1644
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:35,250
my new best friend who I am so
humiliated for it. But I also go like,

1645
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,240
cause we were talking about last week
that this is what happens in my mind is I

1646
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:42,680
start thinking about embarrassing
things that you've done. Yes.

1647
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,610
And I get washed over with that
shame. I get, I've got videos,

1648
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:50,640
I've got videos are pretty similar
to this. So yeah, pretty close.

1649
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:56,700
Pretty close. 34 when the
first one can now, um,

1650
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,530
probably uh, probably put
out a little, um, God,

1651
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:06,540
I was probably on the cusp of the
first round of Dick Pics and uh,

1652
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,990
sent a, uh, sent a Haffey
I thought that was fun.

1653
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,610
Like just not a fully, just like a half
the half Chubb, you know, like, yeah.

1654
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:18,150
I've never gotten one because he and
I hooked up on the time of Friendster.

1655
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,830
Oh yeah. Never even, I've never
sent my wife a dick pic. No chance.

1656
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:29,180
I got half little Haffey
yeah. As a text. What was no,

1657
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:32,010
I think it was an email to be
honest with Ya. An email? Yeah.

1658
01:40:32,011 --> 01:40:35,570
I think it was an email. A
picky emails. Both spots. Um,

1659
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,590
no and that probably is the nail in the
coffin. You meet this girl and like,

1660
01:40:40,591 --> 01:40:44,130
what's the shit? It was like
friend of a friend type of shit.

1661
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:48,090
Don't really know her that well. A lot
of flirting. Um, I thought real horny.

1662
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:52,060
I'm going to send you this penis.
Pick A, I got no response and got uh,

1663
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,040
nothing ever again. I think it was
indication of my, my lack of skill.

1664
01:40:57,070 --> 01:41:01,390
Really. Yeah. Was there? Um,
but it wasn't like, you weren't
just like, oh, I met you,

1665
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:02,850
here's a dick pic.
There was like a lot of,

1666
01:41:02,851 --> 01:41:06,960
there's a lot of communication
and then she saw it. Ghost. Yeah.

1667
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:12,160
Not a cool penis by not a cool penis
by, that's my name of my bio. Yes.

1668
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:16,540
Send me the pictures and it's a, it's
just half. It's half. That's, yeah,

1669
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:19,690
but here's what I'm thinking. Like, Hey,
I'm getting excited. I bet you it was.

1670
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,830
It's better than you think it is. I think
it got sent around to friends. Yeah,

1671
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:29,280
that hurts. And I was like, Ooh,
I show it to all my friends here.

1672
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:32,370
People. I painted a little
face on it. On the top. No.

1673
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,850
Do you hear people call your city
Chicago? CHICAGO? Yeah, for sure.

1674
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:41,710
I don't like shy town either. That bothers
me so much. Really? We don't say that.

1675
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:44,530
Right. It's like someone being
like the big apple. You're like,

1676
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:47,960
no one's ever said that about New York.
Who the fuck puts this out there?

1677
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:51,980
I was born and raised here
in the big gamble. Uh,

1678
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:56,170
what about Illinois with the
hardest? Yeah. What are you
doing? Yeah, Illinois. Nope,

1679
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,200
it's not, yeah. Chicago. Yeah. Shy town.

1680
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:03,020
That stuff is city. Nope. No,

1681
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:06,970
I never really picked up on the R in
Chicago, Chicago. And it would be,

1682
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,230
she would always joke if we,

1683
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:11,320
especially if we were announcing dates and
we're like, oh, we'll be, and she'll go,

1684
01:42:11,321 --> 01:42:15,780
we'll be in Chicago. And I would laugh.
And then in Chicago, it's terrible.

1685
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:19,270
I don't like the one week I go,
oh,

1686
01:42:19,271 --> 01:42:24,271
I was flying in the United way and he
was going to Denver and the lady on the,

1687
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:25,511
on the,

1688
01:42:25,511 --> 01:42:30,511
you know the PA system and that wing here
at Lex is like flight 26 28 to Chicago

1689
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,650
is boring now. And I was
like, no fucking way.

1690
01:42:33,651 --> 01:42:37,030
And it's like I had never paid attention
to it. Where does the art come from?

1691
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:39,340
They'd throw it in. Why? I don't know.

1692
01:42:39,341 --> 01:42:43,750
I think cause Chicago sounds so Duh.
I don't know. People's, a Chicago.

1693
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:47,760
So it sounds like the this
in the city. No. Yeah,

1694
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:49,600
but in Chicago it's such like a thick,

1695
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:52,630
like Chicago is such a
thick accent that the A's,

1696
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:57,330
depending on what part you're from, say
Chicago, ah, to emphasis all in the APP.

1697
01:42:57,490 --> 01:43:01,120
But when people say Chicago, it sounds
like all, all there and our cargo,

1698
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:04,920
that's where it comes from.
Chicago, Chicago, Chicago. Yeah.

1699
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:09,510
But people in the city. Chicago,
Yeah. Yeah. It's like the most,

1700
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:10,660
it's the worst.

1701
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:15,070
It's almost as bad as like hearing a
woman with a Boston accent. That's the,

1702
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:19,900
that's the most unattractive I
was, I did my, when I did my,

1703
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:24,220
um, half hour for comedy
central in Boston, and when
I left some girls like, uh,

1704
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:27,970
some girls like, Hey, I'm trying
to do a Boston. She's like,

1705
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,390
my friend thinks you all cute. And
it's like, yeah. And she goes, yeah,

1706
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:34,150
my friend wants to fuck you. And
I'm not, I'm not making this up.

1707
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,280
I had a slew of people around
me. I go, thank you very much.

1708
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:40,750
So my girlfriend's right there, you
know, 10 feet away. Another girl goes,

1709
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:43,930
I'm a friend. I'm thinking, I want
to fuck you. Like right there.

1710
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,700
She's talking for her friend right there.
I was like,

1711
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:49,330
this is the most sexy trashy. My friend
[inaudible] she wants to fuck you.

1712
01:43:49,331 --> 01:43:50,710
I'm a friend.
I want to fuck you.

1713
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:54,480
It's like Boston has this like
just brashness to it. The,

1714
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:59,210
that Baltimore accidents. No
good either. No. Or we'll Philly.

1715
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:04,100
It's like hails home. It's the same.
It's like mid Atlantic. Yeah. Uses sexy.

1716
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:09,140
Oh, it's on, it's on. I'll suck your
dick gets on Chicago. For some reason.

1717
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:12,530
Girls that are have hardcore Chicago
accents. Yeah. Especially if they're like,

1718
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:17,840
you know, Chicago girls, you
like it? They said, no, it's
terrible. No, it's terrible.

1719
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,900
Yeah, because I thought you'd be
like, oh, go Scott. Dislike, dislike.

1720
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:24,770
It's just sounds so dumb. Like you guys
want to go out and fuck around and party.

1721
01:44:24,771 --> 01:44:29,150
It's like this weird. It sounds you
sound dumb. It sounds dumb. It's not.

1722
01:44:29,151 --> 01:44:30,830
It's not hot.
I don't think there is.

1723
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:32,930
I don't even the southern
accents not good for me either.

1724
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:37,170
I don't know what chick broadcasting.
You're cutting out most accents. I can't.

1725
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:40,750
I don't like accents. Yeah. What are you
into then? Just people. Just regular,

1726
01:44:40,751 --> 01:44:45,220
regular old girl's. Where's your a wife
from Denver. Okay. They talk like us,

1727
01:44:45,221 --> 01:44:49,040
like people just like regular ass old
people. Yeah. She used to tell me though,

1728
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,810
she's like, Oh, you know you
have a big accident. I was like,

1729
01:44:50,811 --> 01:44:55,190
I have a nondescript accent.
No, no. When we started dating,

1730

right. Yeah. That's what Mites Mites.

1732
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:09,020
My Dad's from North Carolina and that's
so, but that's fun. Those are fun accents.

1733
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,530
Yeah, come on. Come on boy.
Of course. Dana, is he from?
He's from Carolina. Yeah.

He's from this small town called Valdese.
Oh yeah. It's about, it's like this big.

1735
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,800
Everybody older boy.
Andrew Andrew while I was Hollywood boy.

1736
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,670
Shout out to Randolph County
is good. I'll there. Huh?

1737
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:30,170
Also up in Hollywood girl swimming pool.
You're doing drugs. You don't do drugs?

1738
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,070
No. I don't know if that was really how
he talks. That's how the family toughest.

1739
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,590
Yeah. Yeah, he does. And he's lived
in Chicago for so long. He does it.

1740
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:41,900
But everybody else up there. Hollywood
too. Fancy boy. I'll see you when a rich,

1741
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:46,160
oh, that's big. A big on that. I get
that from friends from the south.

1742
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:51,340
My foreign cousins have less
references to show business. Ah,

1743
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:55,820
so they go, eh. How is a
Hollywood Mr as Steven Spielberg?

1744
01:45:57,150 --> 01:46:00,740
I'm not a director and
they're like, you always be at
Victoria. Spielberg. Me? Yeah.

1745
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:03,460
Where are these people from?
Peru. Oh Wow. That's beautiful.

1746
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:08,430
I tell everyone that my cousin
is he Steven Spielberg. Okay.

1747
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:12,470
You are kind of, you look
a lot alike. Yeah. We have
beards. Little tiny Jewish guy.

1748
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,200
Yeah. Same thing. I like
the southern accent that,

1749
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:19,640
I mean the one thing I don't like is the
valley. I grew up in the valley. Yeah.

1750
01:46:19,641 --> 01:46:22,340
That's like, but I really
don't like as, I don't hate,

1751
01:46:22,341 --> 01:46:27,341
I hate vocal fry and up speak and I feel
like a lot of girls now are doing that.

1752
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,040
That's the one that we all agree that
that's the worst of all the ones, but,

1753
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:32,990
but that's,
but that's not even like a regional thing.

1754
01:46:32,991 --> 01:46:36,410
That's like a cultural made up thing.
Yeah. It's not even from a place.

1755
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:40,010
It's just kind of like people
have just made up. Yeah.

1756
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:43,830
Megan and I have been together
for nearly three years.

1757
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:47,730
She's a beautiful girl who I'm very much
in love with and I have a lot in common

1758
01:46:47,731 --> 01:46:49,890
with shit when you get
home and in the pool.

1759
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,860
Cool man. Yeah. Cool. That's a man.

1760
01:46:53,861 --> 01:46:55,460
That's a man who could kill us.
I mean,

1761
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:58,320
I guess I could shit on every
accent like San Diego tough.

1762
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:00,600
I can't like do Debbie.
Great special.

1763
01:47:00,601 --> 01:47:04,080
If you did a special shitting on
shit on every, every single accent,

1764
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:06,420
you just like, you don't have to think.
You start with one that everyone's like,

1765
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:08,910
yeah, that accent sucks and you
just keep every one of them.

1766
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,710
You just do every accident. Fucking
Brits. San Diego's fucking like a,

1768
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,870

1769
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,240
So basically your w nine is
faking and totally filled out it.

1770
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:31,200
It's spot on.
I can't be a pro with that.

1771
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:35,370
What about this sexy accent?
Anyhow, I'm heading off to work.

1772

1795
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:09,500
especially all intensive
purposes last year,

1796
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:13,590
regardless is used all the time. All
intensive purposes. I got to admit,

1797
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:18,360
I thought that was until I was about 36
intensive. I also thought until I was,

1798
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:20,880
I think a few years into dating her,

1799
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,930
I thought the expression was ahead
of the curb. Yeah. Well, okay.

1800
01:49:24,931 --> 01:49:27,720
How about this one? I didn't think I was

the curve, you want to park park?
Is it kitty corner? A catty corner.

1802
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,540
Oh, right. See I say kitty corner,

1803
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:40,020
but it is catty corner. I
it is. It is, but for years,

1804
01:49:40,021 --> 01:49:41,700
I know a bunch of people
that say kitty corner.

1805
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:46,701
Maybe it was accident three off dumb
fucking execute corners or category

1806
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:49,190
wholesome over they are category quoted.
You saying kitty cat a corner.

1807
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:53,890
I thought it was combatative. Remember
I did think that calls for combatitive.

1808
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,990
Yes, and she called me out. Yeah. When I
was like, it was this combative situation.

1809
01:49:57,990 --> 01:50:01,660
He's like, I'm sorry, what did you
call it? I'm like, did he correct word?

1810
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:04,810
She's like, it's combative. It's
comp about additive. Yeah. I have to.

1811
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:07,770
I had to look it up. Hello? Yeah.
That's not your fault. Yeah.

1812
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:12,220
They spoke English wrong. English isn't
their first language. Yeah. Yeah man.

1813
01:50:12,221 --> 01:50:14,740
Come on. No, I learn English
from the television was hurt.

1814
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:17,620
I had one foreign parent
and it definitely,

1815
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:20,670
you just hear wrong shit all your
whole life. All you hear from him,

1816
01:50:20,671 --> 01:50:23,140
you know there's so many.
We don't have the other.

1817
01:50:23,141 --> 01:50:24,460
If I didn't have them to balance it out,

1818
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:28,150
I don't know what I would be saying right
now. No Way. I would talk for a living,

1819
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:33,790
but TV fixes all that. It
does help. I learn. Yeah, for
sure. That's fucking wild.

1820
01:50:33,791 --> 01:50:35,830
And also your friends
coming over and being like,

1821
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:38,200
your mom says the dumbest fucking shit.
That too.

1822
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:41,500
That helped that ls quicken it out.
Parent. Your friends are always like,

1823
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:44,970
why did she say like, it's just out there
later. Don't worry about it. Ignore.

1824
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:45,730
I like,

1825
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:48,250
I used to love going over to friends'
houses and the parents would yell at them

1826
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:50,890
in a foreign language. I loved
that. I thought that was so fun.

1827
01:50:50,891 --> 01:50:52,480
It was so personal in
their own little thing.

1828
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:55,510
You've got to heard that plenty
in our, yeah, I like that though.

1829
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:59,250
That made me an hour cause then you
don't know how much trouble they're in.

1830
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:02,620
You're like, Oh shit, what did she say
to him? We always sounded more intense.

1831
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,470
Oh fuck yeah. Like, like
my, when my mom would yell,

1832
01:51:05,471 --> 01:51:06,910
she's not like a huge yellow or all that,

1833
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,970
but when she would yell it sounded like,
Oh, you're definitely, you're grounded,

1834
01:51:09,971 --> 01:51:13,420
right? Yeah, you're fucked.
And I'd be like, no, she just
told me to finish dinner.

1835
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:16,900
Clean up the plates. It stop
fucking around. Okay. I had it.

1836
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,500
This is a crazy situation. I have to
tell you, this happened two days ago.

1837
01:51:19,501 --> 01:51:22,290
I'm walking home back,
uh, in the neighborhood.

1838
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:27,840
A water balloon almost hits my
wife in the face, not like an inch.

1839
01:51:27,841 --> 01:51:29,550
You're walking in your neighborhood

1840
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:30,560
Water boon almost said,

1841
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,750
and you know those big mcmansions that
are all around West Hollywood. Okay.

1842
01:51:33,751 --> 01:51:36,720
So there's like three in a
row on my street. And uh,

1843
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,810

Finally ring again. Guy Gets on the
intercom. Uh, W can I help you? I said,

1856
01:52:20,821 --> 01:52:22,670
Instantly he comes outside,
comes to the gate, and he goes,

1857
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:25,620
are you fucking serious? And I go, yeah.
She almost hit her in the face. Man.

1858
01:52:25,621 --> 01:52:27,860
That's fucked up. I mean, that could
have really fucked her up. I mean,

1859
01:52:27,861 --> 01:52:31,320
just from a two story roof. And he goes,

1860
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:36,540
Am I go, yeah, sure. Okay. He goes,
hold on, hold on. He goes upstairs,

1861
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:39,570
brings down this little skinny little
15 year old kid. I mean, you know,

1862
01:52:39,571 --> 01:52:43,440

Asian friend who's probably just never

1863
01:52:43,441 --> 01:52:46,790

And he comes downstairs and he's got,

wife. He goes, yeah, yeah, I did. I did.

1867
01:52:56,241 --> 01:52:59,810
And I go apologize to her face right
now. He said, I'm so sorry. Like, I mean,

1868
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,780
I mean you could tell he's like breaking
down. And then, and then his dad goes,

01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:05,150
you know what I told him
and kids icon and he goes,

1870
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:09,560

didn't know he was gonna throw that at me.

1871
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:13,000
And so I'm Kinda like, even as a standup,

time and the kid is low. I mean,

1874
01:53:18,651 --> 01:53:19,640
he's genuinely like,

1875
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:22,820
cause his dad did not look like he's dad
would be like a fucking tough piece of

1876
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:26,090

hiding behind his dad. Like, no, no, no.

And I go, come out here, come outside,

hand. And he's like, give me your hand.

1884
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:48,860
And he gives me his hand.
And I shook his hand, I go,

1885
01:53:48,861 --> 01:53:53,600
don't throw shit at people anymore. He was
like, oh, I watched his whole body like,

1886
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:58,180
oh my God. He thought I was going
to like pull his fucking arm,

1887
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:00,140
do some fucked up to that
is a real one though.

1888
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:02,630
Dude sends a kid every
sends the kid inside.

1889
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:06,140
I give him a big handshake and you know,
we're talking about, you know, and I was,

1890
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:09,050
I, he goes, thanks for doing [inaudible]
that helps me sometimes. How did I,

1891
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:09,501
you know,
he's like,

1892
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:11,970
I don't know if these fucking kids
to control these fucking assholes. I,

1893
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:15,650
I was like, dude, I was a
punk piece of shit when I was
a kid. Yeah. But he's like,

1894
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:17,450
he's like, yeah, but if I
don't do stuff like this,

1895
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:21,410
they just do whatever the fuck they want.
I usually take him belt until them,

1896
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:24,650
I'd beat to shit. Oh. And I was hoping he,
I was waiting for him to be like, yeah,

1897
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:26,150
no, I'll crack them in a
fucking high when you leave.

1898
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,300
But he kept saying it the
way he said it to him,

1899
01:54:28,301 --> 01:54:30,500
cause I told him he could punch you in.
I told him he could hit you once.

1900
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:34,490
It's almost like he said that before and
now it's finally going to happen. Right,

1901
01:54:34,491 --> 01:54:37,300
right, right. Cause I'll let somebody
hit. Yeah, that's fucking brilliant dad.

1902
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:41,540
It was awesome dude. You really
shouldn't be fucking thrown, you know,

1903
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,490
throw those balloons off.
No, I mean you could, he, I,

1904
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:49,460
you watched him go through
the waves of like panic,

1905
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:53,450
like genuine fear, like actually
feelings like scared, like hurt,

1906
01:54:53,451 --> 01:54:56,030
like gonna cry type of Shit that you
watch him go through all those as a

1907
01:54:56,031 --> 01:54:59,010
teenager. Like cause your footing,
you're doing dumb shit as he,

1908
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:02,000
you don't think about anything. You're
like, oh we're just fucking around.

1909
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:05,420
And you'd get away with one level,
then you go to the next one. Yeah.

1910
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:08,630
Like I remember, you know, it starts
with like egging something. Oh yeah.

1911
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,870
You're going to steal some shit from
place. Next you're going to vandalize.

1912
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:15,650
Same with drugs or hooking. You know,
you give out a hand job or a job,

1913
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:18,650
you start hooking wants start eating.
Guy's ass is on the street,

1914
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:23,240
then I'm planting up, you know,
planning, doing crazy shit and wet,

1915
01:55:23,241 --> 01:55:27,330
wet angel. I remember until I got
caught doing stuff, he just keeps,

1916
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:30,320
it keeps escalating because that's normal.
You're testing boundaries.

1917
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:33,260
What can I get away with? How
much shit can I fuck up? Oh Man,

1918
01:55:33,261 --> 01:55:36,560
I was such a punk fucking kid. We used
to garage hop. You know what that is?

1919
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:38,540
That's such a Midwest.
When people leave their group,

1920
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:41,510
people in the Midwest League, their
garage is open, you know, like you know,

1921
01:55:41,511 --> 01:55:44,830
cause they've drove their car home and
they're doing something in her outside

1922
01:55:44,831 --> 01:55:46,370
and coming and going. They
just leave it up. Yeah.

1923
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,020
We would go in there and steal
whatever they had in that. Oh Shit.

1924
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,550
Beer mostly is what you're hunting for.

1925
01:55:50,551 --> 01:55:52,800
Cause in the Midwest most people
have fridges in their garages. Yeah.

1926
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:56,070
You just hunt for beer. And then also
if there's some other shit, take it off.

1927
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:59,460
Just take everything you can. Goes got
nine iron. I'm just going to take this.

1928
01:55:59,461 --> 01:56:02,760
Yeah. Fuck. I like golf. Take it. You
know, we were just pieces of shit.

1929
01:56:02,761 --> 01:56:06,450
We've tried to break in,
steal and do whatever we could
use. Test the boundaries.

1930
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:09,960
Then you get hit by dad and,
and you know that. That's great.

1931
01:56:09,961 --> 01:56:12,630
Cause I think about our two boys.
You're going to have to regulate dude,

1932
01:56:12,631 --> 01:56:16,340
you got a God. If you got to let
them get punched by a stranger. Yeah,

1933
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:20,420
you do have to let them be, you
know, get checked. You don't do that.

1934
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:23,760
It's got to check them, but you have
to let them get checked publicly.

1935
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:26,370
That's cool. I don't know why he
trusted me because I don't, I don't.

1936
01:56:26,371 --> 01:56:27,540
I look like I have it together.

1937
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,600
But for some reason like what would
a bad move if he was like, go ahead,

1938
01:56:30,601 --> 01:56:35,340
hit my kid. I'm like, fuck yeah,
you told me to hit him Bro.

1939
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:39,450
I thought you fucking had some
sense to you. No, no. Right.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1940
01:56:39,451 --> 01:56:42,790
And he's like, sorry kid. Did he
know you were a decent human being?

1941
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:45,300
And that's pretty crazy because the
conversation we had beforehand was pretty,

1942
01:56:45,301 --> 01:56:47,370
pretty obvious. I said, yeah, he
almost hit my wife in the face.

1943
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:51,340
He knew I was going to punch a kid with a
woman with me, but if I was alone, yeah,

1944
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:54,360
you can almost hit me with a balloon. He'd
be like, oh, okay, fuck off. He's like,

1945
01:56:54,361 --> 01:56:55,650
get these brass knuckles,
put these on.

1946
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:00,870
Really hit my kid for knock his teeth
out his fucking job. Where can people,

1947
01:57:00,871 --> 01:57:04,250
are you, are you wrote in it or you road
dogging it in and out a little bit. Um,

1948
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:09,120
um, in Chicago, right here on the
top on Chicago, I go back to Chicago.

1949
01:57:09,150 --> 01:57:09,900
Where are you gonna go?

1950
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:13,380
I'm gonna be at the beat kitchen playing
two shows on Friday night doing my own

1951
01:57:13,381 --> 01:57:16,470
thing because I played venues there
and it's home for me. So I was like,

1952
01:57:16,471 --> 01:57:21,030
I'm just going to do my own little thing.
Yeah. So I'm doing that, uh, Friday, uh,

1953
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:24,510
Friday the 21st, that's this week. And
then the next, the following weekend,

1954
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:29,040
the 26 in September, I'll be Madison,
Wisconsin, comedy on state. Amazing.

1955
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:32,220
Favorite fucking club. Andrew is one
of the best comics working today.

1956
01:57:32,221 --> 01:57:36,760
You got to go see him do
stand. Absolutely. I've seen
you multiple times. So fun.

1957
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,540
You have a special ed that people can
watch. Yeah, it's on showtime. Yeah,

1958
01:57:39,541 --> 01:57:41,370
you can watch it on showtime
if you don't have showtime.

1959
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:44,250
I've ripped it on my Twitter.
Go to my Twitter. Go. Yeah,

1960
01:57:44,251 --> 01:57:47,010
because showtime has this weird,
you know, they don't let whatever,

1961
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:51,360
what's it called? Home field advantage.
Shot it in Chicago. But yeah,

1962
01:57:51,361 --> 01:57:54,360
go go rip it off my Twitter if you
don't have showtime. I don't give,

1963
01:57:54,361 --> 01:57:56,880
I was like fuck. Cause I asked them, I
was like, can I have permission dude?

1964
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:59,520
You guys hide this stuff.
Yeah. People need to see it.

1965
01:57:59,521 --> 01:58:02,610
If it's not on Netflix it's like
I don't think they know that Lord.

1966
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,190
It's hard to find. So they were like, no,

1967
01:58:05,191 --> 01:58:06,420
we can't give you clips
or anything like that.

1968
01:58:06,421 --> 01:58:08,520
So I ripped it myself and
I was like, go ahead. Fine.

1969
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:11,250
Actually it's not on my account.
