Christina,

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,870
here we are. Yeah, we are face to face.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,550
Do you know the song?
A couple of silver spoons.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,930
There's a, it's a really exciting
episode. We've got great guests, Kevin.

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,120
I don't want to sound excited.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,880
That's my level of excitement. You always
make fun of me for that. It's so true.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,550
I think that is your
general level of excitement.

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,560
You've never really gone off the rails.
Like I said before, the during the ads,

13
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,530
like tell him he sold out the wheel
turn. You're like, yeah, that's cool.

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,250
Tell him I'm having a baby.
Yeah, that's great. Tom,

15
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:11,090
watch this video of a guy getting his
legs crushed. What? Then you're excited.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,590
Well that's good stuff. Yeah, no,

17
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:16,640
I've seen you get excited.

18
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:21,620
I'm watching football like that's
probably the most I've seen you. Yeah, go,

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,850
go nuts. Yeah. I mean I get
excited about like free candy.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,750
Every candy's exciting, all cheeseburger
and I though, oh my goodness. You know?

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,850
Yeah.
Is You keep it inside.

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,690
I mean I think what happens
is I'm comfortable in a,

23
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,570
uh,
a certain,

24
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,250
in a certain bandwidth of that of
excitement and I don't allow myself to get

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:53,441
excited in fear of maybe what that will
feel like or maybe being disappointed by

26
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:57,290
that feeling. Huh. I'm sure
that's healthy. Right? I Dunno.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,350
Heres your joy. As long as
you know, it gives you joy.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,840
I know as long as something
gives you joy. Oh for sure. Yeah.

29
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,950
Ah,

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,570
oh yeah.

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,880
Yeah.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,750
Tell Him we're having another baby.
My flat as a pancake and Yup.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,470
Ah,

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,420
yeah. It's good stuff. It's about right.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,390
What's interesting, Huh? Well I know what
makes me excited and I know it helps me.

36
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,010
Murder. What were you watching last
night? It was another Spanish show. No,

37
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,640
I didn't want to just be a no, no, no.
Okay. I watched, remember the, the,

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,750
we played it a long time ago.
These poor girls in Belize who were like,

39
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,120
I booked through the hammock. I
watched that documentary. Oh cool.

40
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,650
And it's about John McAfee,

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,820
the guy who started the McAfee
antivirus software. Crazy.

42
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,710
Cause he doesn't look like a programmer.

43
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,830
Like does this guy work for vice?

44
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:02,650
Like he looks like a photographer
that takes pictures of,

45
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,580
I was like [inaudible] guy's name.
You know what I'm talking about?

46
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,380
Like a cool photographer or
something. You're like, yeah,

47
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,810
that was wild.

48
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,870
I know he's got six different hair
colors in his hair and he's got crazy

49
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,570
shoulder tats and yeah,
he's having to go shit in his mouth.

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,040
Oh Gosh. Why did I forget that?
That's what we just said in his mouth.

51
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,100
I just thought like just shit through
a hammock and then just kind of shit on

52
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,330
and around his mouth. No, and around, no,

53
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,970
I just thought it meant around the mouth.
I didn't really think he did.

54
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:41,320
They say they said in his mouth and he
eats the Pupa or he just, and by the way,

55
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,090
that's the only thing he wanted with them.

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,800
That's a deep fetish because
they asked the girl were like,

57
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,420
did they ever have traditional,
gradual said, oh no, no,

58
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,510
no, no, no, just poofed. And she was like,
yeah, I like how that's offensive. Great.

59
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,050
I'm not going to have sex with this guy.
Crazy.

60
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,280
And she was talking about how it's her
first time ever doing something like that.

61
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:10,420
And then one lady was like,
I was really turned off by that.

62
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,140
But what an easy gig. I mean, if
you're going to be a prostitute,

63
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:18,280
I figured that's kind of one of
the Kush or gigs. I think so. Yeah,

64
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,820
I think so. Wow. You want
to see if I can pull it up?

65
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,270
That's a very specific
fetish. My goodness. I mean,

66
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,250
talk about the level of self awareness.

67
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,040
You'd have to have to really
figure that one out for yourself.

68
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,370
You mean you really have to be
brave to be like, you know what,

69
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:41,050
I think I want to, I think I want people
to shit in my mouth. Yeah. I mean that,

70
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:45,520
that for me would be so deeply
repressed sexually in my mouth.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,090
Like why don't you just repress that
impulse like your whole life and never

72
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:53,740
allow it to happen? I would
never let myself indulge in
that one. It's real crazy.

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,850
Let's see if I can get this ready for you.
I don't think I could indulge it.

74
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,910
I don't think it's safe.
It's definitely not safe.

75
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,600
She did all the girls name.
Nice.

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,710
They're beautiful and the right
stuff the girls want to hear.

77
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,210
I think there will stay there for
the money at first and then, um,

78
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,730
most of them eventually I had
real true feelings for him.

79
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,380
No,
they're yellow too.

80
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,010
It was exciting for them living in this
big house and having chips and stuff

81
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,651
that they wouldn't normally would have
if there didn't meet Mr John drew ever

82
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,720
lived like that before?
No.

83
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Had you ever had sex for
money prior to that or no,

84
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,290
but those were first time I was ashamed,
but then I got used to it.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,390
What did the girl sit down?
This hallmark,

86
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,680
they have my card as a
whole and Patina Hamar.

87
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,750
After that he lays on the hallmark.

88
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,840
Then he m

89
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,070
he would've don't be shy
now and he would sit there.

90
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,850
That's what he used it cause he,

91
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,560
he wanted to have like
Scott Sec then on that.

92
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,960
I didn't agree with that.

93
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,340
What has got sex and when you [inaudible]
and he used to make you should and Mrs

94
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,960
Mouth. There she goes. She
loves it, but she's accepted it.

95
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,130
She's like never had done that before.
And yeah,

96
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,030
most people aren't told an
experience for a man. Yeah,

97
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,590
I seem to shit in his mouth.

98
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,310
Did he ever have regular
intercourse? Vaginal and knows. Wow.

99
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,320
Easy Kid.
That was only thing I did get.

100
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,250
The girls are lucky. I think
I was grateful because I
wanted to finish school.

101
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,690
I wanted to take the shit.

102
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,850
He was helping me so I didn't care
about what he did. I had to go anyway.

103
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:10,380
So I figure why not going
the Hammock and nice mine.

104
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,860
But you know what I want to know from
us. Got in person. How do you stop?

105
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:19,330
How do you keep from
vomiting? I don't know. Um,

106
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,450
that trigger not threat,
right?

107
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,470
Like they must enjoy the smells
and the hotness of it and the,

108
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,250
you know what's so funny? This
reminds me of the piss on me. Beat me.

109
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:34,420
Try it out guy. This is
the same principle. It's
like, do you want free rent,

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,980
free rent? All you have to do
is sit in this hammock. Yeah.

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,350
It's kind of a great deal.
I mean,

112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,600
if I were one of these girls
and I ran this country,

113
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:47,830
I had no options and some white guys like,
do you want to shit in this hammock?

114
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:51,060
And my mom's like, yeah, absolutely. Do
I start? If you want to watch the full,

115
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:56,050
that's a good documentary.
The dangerous life of John McAfee.

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,650
It's on Netflix. Wait, but if
you were a troubled, you know,

117
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:04,240
like a girl who needed
what I do this of course,

118
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,270
of course I would was silly question.

119
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,550
The only thing I think would be really
hard for me is the first time when you're

120
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:16,600
trying to relax and to doing it and
then like by the 10th time it's second

121
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:19,690
nature. But that first time
it's gotta be the hardest.

122
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,500
What if you have a real slopper
coming out the first time even better?

123
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,620
I don't know.
Do you think he needs a certain,

124
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,430
like a Bristol number for him to
be into it? Like four or five?

125
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,420
I think he probably wants like a four.
Yeah.

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,490
Most people do like an easy,

127
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,950
but if you really grind
one out and you're like,

128
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,240
and you grind your teeth and he's like,
he's like oof.

129
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,370
And he can see it slowly come
out and it's like, uh, you know,

130
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:53,350
like a, like an old Plato hard.
But if you have a real blaster,

131
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,280
like it just play a diarrhea. And this
is what country, oh, this isn't beliefs.

132
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,200
Did you see that all the
time? Fed that tweet? Uh,

133
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,230
people send it to me and this girl is
tweet went viral where she is in the

134
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:10,980
bathroom and she's just like trying
to look in the mirror and she's in the

135
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,910
women's bathroom.

136
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,910
She's filming herself and as she like
does this and is looking at her hair, uh,

137
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,050
a woman takes a ferocious done.
She's like,

138
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,570
it's so ferocious.
It's a woman's dump.

139
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,000
Yesterday at the airport.
I had the experience of,

140
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:37,120
I landed at lax and the woman in the
stall next to me how to full speakerphone

141
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,280
conversation in Spanish while she was
taking had a really crazy thing while she

142
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:46,250
was taking a dob. A full answer on speaker
phone. No less. It's really crazy. Yeah.

143
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm, I'm amazed that people's audacity
course. God, aren't you fucking,

144
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,830
I mean to quote Sebastian, aren't
you embarrassed? Gotcha. Oh, my life.

145
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,150
Let me see if I can,

146
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,110
I want to pull this up for you because
I laughed so hard and thought about,

147
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:03,510
you know,
here it is John.

148
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,410
I live in the house and all I
have to do is poop in the hammock.

149
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,400
Here it is here.
Oh my goodness.

150
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,980
Uh, for women it's a great, it's a
big deal. If we're guys are like,

151
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,990
what's the big deal? I see
that. And they're like,

152
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,210
you can see she's like crazy. Yeah. Well
most women don't let it go like that.

153
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,770
Really know.
You Kinda,

154
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,940
you clench and you let it out piece by
piece so that it doesn't make sound.

155
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,600
You're embarrassed.
Women are embarrassed of their bodies.

156
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,210
And their body functions.
Not like dudes.

157
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,400
Why are you guys so open that I
want to know what the differences,

158
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,560
why is it testosterone?
Maybe there's just less shame.

159
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,040
What's up with the show properly? Oh
my God, we haven't even done that yet.

160
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,530
Keep telling me to go next hammock.

161
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,920
If you paid any kind of a
wreck now. Yes, order problems.

162
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,580
I'm here to tell you forget that
bag or forget about Sally's.

163
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:12,040
Forget that Dick and
plants and all that stuff,

164
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,200
so I don't know if you believe me or not.
You like the same.

165
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,430
You smoked some meth with a small limp.
Dick.

166
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,170
Did Dad get hardly any other way and why?
G A harder and harder. I smoke harder.

167
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:24,140
My Dick get,

168
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,153
that's fine.

169
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,040
We'll go to your mom's house.

170
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,350
Did you hear that part? What do you,
because you saw you go like, I don't know.

171
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,650
I heard smoking meth.
Yeah. Yeah. He's like,

172
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,440
forget about Viagra hours. Yeah,
that's what you heard. Yeah.

173
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,120
If you want to really get hard, he's
like, smoke meth. I never heard that.

174
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,160
You can watch me watch my little limp.

175
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:59,620
Dick gets super hard with
the more meth I smoke.

176
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,320
They were not
to.

177
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,980
Dick didn't get hardly any other way and
watch it get harder and harder. More.

178
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,310
I smoke no harder. My Dick get
this. Unbelievable. You Gay.

179
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,030
You won't believe how good it feels.
If you're straight,

180
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,560
you won't believe how good it feels.

181
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,090
You're dickhead becomes hope
sensitive that you don't need lube.

182
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,600
You don't need spit you this.
This happened down four times.

183
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,930
It's just barely do it and
you will shoot an enormous

184
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,530
thick,
hot,

185
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,670
well,
what am I barfed Jesus.

186
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,030
This guy reminds me of
the 10 to 12 Benadryl

187
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,090
sat atop Benadryl guy.
His base code is math.

188
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,940
That's what Judy said.
Hold on,

189
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,980
let me put this on the drooling.
What?

190
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,103
Remember

191
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,370
what part? What's your favorite part
right now and that you're Super India.

192
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,600
He's just too cool.
Yeah.

193
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,790
Just Sharon is beauty tips.
Sharing the story. Yeah.

194
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,820
It's a nice story,
right? Oh, there's more.

195
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,380
I Dunno. Can we just pause like I
feel like, no, I can't. I can't.

196
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:35,000
I can't stop, but I can't. First of all,

197
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,793
oh my God.

198
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,790
Can we just say one thing now that he
meets the criteria of a fantastic your

199
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,280
mom's house video. First of
all, the lighting is dog shit.

200
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,520
He's got the ceiling in the background,

201
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:54,730
the white facing up this true.
Um,

202
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,720
you can barely see his face
because he's lit so poorly.

203
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,740
He hits all the boxes for a perfect video.

204
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,080
Now this guy is going to be
in our world for a minute.

205
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,350
I don't like hearing about as calm.
Do you? I don't like the calm at all.

206
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,330
That part really freaks me out.
What?

207
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,460
You liked that part? Math
Dick Guy. This is on the list.

208
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,310
Oh,
my fucking head hurts.

209
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,080
More calm than I've ever done in my mind.

210
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,800
And I know you get blowjobs.
Yeah,

211
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,340
I'd pay you what?
I cannot wait.

212
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,300
So back that been hot and Horny home,
man. If I lay anybody off second,

213
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,310
get me a blow job.

214
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,420
That's nice.
Really Nice thing.

215
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,140
The best part is right here though.
Okay. Okay. Just, yeah, I know.

216
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,230
Believe me, my brother didn't
go when he smoked with me.

217
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,760
He put his Dick can't
believe how big his dick was.

218
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,250
He jacked off for by and shot the most.
Come here every time.

219
00:14:57,251 --> 00:15:01,370
It's like he's only 49 and he's fine.
He has no neuropathy problems at all,

220
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,440
but his day gets even harder and thicker
and even more coming believes me now

221
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,450
brother,
when they were smoking meth together,

222
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,820
nice testimonial.

223
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,680
Well my brother did it and then his
dad got hard and he jacked off in four

224
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:23,130
strokes. That's the skies
testimonial for smoking meth.

225
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,580
I mean you want to see some come
watch my brother Jack his dick. God,

226
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,800
it's terrible. What kind of
endorsement is this? Well,

227
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,360
he's saying like you want
a credible source. Well,

228
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:44,260
my brother smokes Beth with me. His deck
get so hard, he can barely not come.

229
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,380
He pulled his big
babe.

230
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,790
His brother jerked off in front of him

231
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,930
and he came in for strokes.
It's so disgusting. It's true.

232
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,340
This guy is so fucking fucked up.
This might be the most fun.

233
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,800
I don't know.
It's a close tie between the piss on me,

234
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:11,910
beat me gay and then watching your
brother Jack, his Dick in front of you.

235
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,700
Here's the difference.
I think the Piss on me beat me guy.

236
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,010
Why he trumps this guy is because he
just smoked right before we made that.

237
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,050
So you're seeing a guy in his manic
super high state. There's like,

238
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:29,630
here's the deal myth.
He's laying with his fuck.

239
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,620
Come over here. This guy is actually
not high right now. And that kind of,

240
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,680
I mean, that could take this video
from an eight to a 10. Oh yeah.

241
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,310
If he had done this video. Hi. I agree.
I wish you would've been more hot dot.

242
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,070
Now this is a big problem
in the gay community is uh,

243
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,540
smoking math and doing
gay sex. Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:56,150
Because they don't use protection in San
Francisco. It was a big, our guest, right?

245
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,960
It is our guest. Oh, okay. Let's
take a quick break. Oh my God.

246
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,750
An SF. This was a big problem.
It's like a quick break. Okay.

247
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,800
I want to talk about it though.
All right.

248
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,220
Our guest isn't here yet, but
false alarm. We can, yeah,

249
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,180
we can still play with this
guy, thankfully. Thank God. God.

250
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:20,220
So what's the hat? He's wearing
a, it looks like the, um,

251
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,210
the rim that used to be
snug is all open now. Right.

252
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,160
This has to be one of the
weirdest ones we've ever gone.

253
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,410
I just want to revisit what
happened with his brother.

254
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,310
Believe me when he smoked with me,
but at his dick,

255
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:40,311
I can't believe how big his dick when
he checked off for drove shot the most

256
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:41,040
common,

257
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,660
every shot 49 the Roxy problems at all.

258
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,730
But he's dead. Gets even harder
and more coming. Believes me now.

259
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,330
Who is part of his charm?
I think he's in a public place.

260
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:56,800
Do you hear the background noise?

261
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,040
I think he locked himself
in like a bathroom stall at
a restaurant and he's like,

262
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,370
I got to share this with work.
I'm serious.

263
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,230
Cause he's like, yeah, my
brother shot. He's like,

264
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:11,110
keep telling you it's sweet secret.
Have what?

265
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:13,750
A weird thing like and
my brother shot come.

266
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,410
I watched it and I want big,
his Dick was,

267
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,250
he dragged off in four strokes.

268
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,240
You realize too that his brother didn't
give in on this request the first time.

269
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,560
His brothers like,
you know,

270
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:31,561
you keep asking me to smoke meth and
jerk off with you and today's your

271
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,390
birthday.
I'm 49 I'm going to do it.

272
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,750
It's probably year or sometimes
just beating them down like, dude,

273
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:41,740
are you going to fucking smoke meth
and jerk off? All right. God dammit.

274
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,140
No, not here doing anything illegal. I
don't want you to do anything illegal.

275
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,600
I know what you're doing.
Anything you don't feel comfortable doing.

276
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,870
If you can find anybody you
know that won't get you into
trouble, smokes and man,

277
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,850
the more you smoke up that bow
hardier depot, get your big globe

278
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,180
from Olympic too hard deck.

279
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,280
I will do it this weekend and I'll
videotape it from this. A small deck,

280
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,350
very lamp and watch it and get harder and
harder. That's a prison factor, right?

281
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:18,490
Let me know. That bothered me a bit. If
you say yes, I'll show it to you. Yeah,

282
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,840
it's okay. No blue band. Where's
the, where's the followup video?

283
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,000
Just going to send me this teas
and not follow through due to now.

284
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,780
It makes sense why this was a thing in
the gay community when I lived in SF,

285
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:33,630
because they would have billboards like,
hey guys,

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,880
don't smoke math on but fuck.

287
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,480
Because what happens is you get all hopped
up and then you don't have a condom,

288
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,030
you don't use condoms.
And it was like it was bad for them.

289
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,220
I think it's not just something
bad for the gay community.

290
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,520
I think this is for the all all
decks community. Anyone with a Dick,

291
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,730
no matter where you want to
put it could be. It could make,

292
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,430
I mean if I smoked meth
and I'm like this guy,

293
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:57,390
I feel like I could have problems
too. You know? It's a lot. It's a lot.

294
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,401
I wonder why.

295
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:02,460
So this is a question for the doctor or
like why does the math make your dick so

296
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,890
hard? That's why I love this shit. It
makes it so hard. It's why the Benadryl,

297
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:08,070
that guy loved it too much.

298
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,450
Are you going to try this now? Now
look in your eye like I could go there.

299
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,800
No, I couldn't. Yeah, you
kind of want to do the meth.

300
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,270
Don't get once. No, no. Just
to see what would happen.

301
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,510
It is appealing when you, when
you hear somebody say, you know,

302
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,530
yeah,
kid becomes hope sensitive.

303
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,780
You know,
that's nice,

304
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,010
but you don't need lube
or no bed or nothing.

305
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,750
Hot White Come,

306
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,240
oh my God,
guys are so fucked up,

307
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,093
Jane guys are,

308
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,680
I've never seen a video of a woman
doing something like that being, ah,

309
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,990
it makes my pussy so away.
Well, we played one or two,

310
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,900
but they were real crazy looking
at the old ones aren't even there.

311
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,320
I think all of them are
crazy. Like, yeah, they were.

312
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,150
You won't believe how good it
feels. Good. You're straight.

313
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,680
You won't believe how good it builds.

314
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,220
You're declared becomes hope
sensitive that you don't need lube.

315
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,840
You don't need spit.
You just

316
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,570
do it and you would shoot and
enormous amount of Dick Dick

317
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,590
hot fucking BARF.
Can you turn it off?

318
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,490
He's so nasty. Is the nastiest
mother firearm. Why did guys,

319
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,030
they all have to go into explicit detail.
Just like the Benadryl guy.

320
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,050
Here's what I want to know though.

321
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,280
I don't know what I would have
liked to ask doctor drew ready,

322
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,290
doctor listening is does this in
fact cure erectile dysfunction?

323
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,200
Well, yeah. What are we doing? Because
we're talking about all these, you know,

324
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,130
the silly parts of this.
What about somebody who's
like, I'm really struggling.

325
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,690
I've tried by Agra, tried
Cialis, I've tried injections.

326
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,690
It's not working. My Dick
slipped, but wanting to get hard.

327
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,000
Does meth actually help you out?

328
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,720
And then that will be one of the
medicinal values to meth. Yeah,

329
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,880
bring it back. Bring it back,
man. Try it out it possible.

330
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,720
I didn't know there was any positives
to math, but I'm glad there's one,

331
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,750
at least that we know of. I mean,
besides losing all your teeth,

332
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:16,350
which could be kind of good
sexually to scabs, scabs

333
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,630
and they do like to pick on
getting picking. Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,490
I've been around people that,

335
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,270
that I've been picking at their skin and
it makes me wonder sometimes. Yeah. Yeah.

336
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,070
That's kind of went out, um, a
style I thought really? Well,

337
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,840
it was big in the nineties and
um, you know why, right. I saw,

338
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:38,400
I didn't know people
still were into that shit.

339
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,460
We did remember we played that one really
aggressive woman one time who was like,

340
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,880
you eat that shit. And she was like
Super Aggro about it. She was a lesbian.

341
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,220
Yes. Yes she was. She was really
aggressive girls to eat my, yeah.

342
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:57,840
This shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
do remember that. That was the anomaly.

343
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,040
That's not her. Yeah. Oh, here she
is here. I think this is her. Fuck.

344
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:09,560
My stoma is
so,

345
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,380
it's just so amazing that people's
priorities in their lives, like got guys,

346
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:15,600
I gotta tell you this.
I smoked

347
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,300
[inaudible].

348
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,590
Oh,
is it already there?

349
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,020
But then there was kiss my pussy and
the wells Fargo now was a different way.

350
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,371
That was great.

351
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:44,371
$1 million in this motherfucker.

352
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,440
All right. She said that she
had $1 million Bank of America.

353
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,710
You Chinese motherfuckers. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,900
That was great. That's really great.
Kissing pussies. Yeah. Wells Fargo.

355
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,570
It's kissing pussy since 1782 there's
so many posters around your presidential

356
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:07,520
campaign on both sides that they prefer
not to comment about this. Yeah, yeah.

357
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,560
Sounds good. Yeah. That's my
tribe. But yeah, there's a,

358
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,910
like this guy really went for it
though. Hmm. Wow. The brother thing.

359
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,150
I don't think that's the first time
they've jerked off in front of each other.

360
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:24,110
I'm going to go with yeah, you think so?
Wait, let's do it. Yeah. It's kind of a,

361
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:28,570
that doesn't sound like
a first time thing. Uh,

362
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,640
those two are, yeah. You want to, um,

363
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,730
by the way talking about the fact that Oh,
uh,

364
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,010
the cause the cause is locked up now.
He's not locked up. He's going to be sent,

365
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,350
but he's got convicted.
That's fantastic news.

366
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,110
I wish they would get the other creeps.
I feel like wines,

367
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,600
Weinstein and uh,

368
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,190
Matt Lauer and a sea crest.
And who else?

369
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,480
Dustin Hoffman. Do you remember Kevin
Spacey? None of these guys get locked up.

370
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,920
Was last time when he was walking
out of court. This crazy shit.

371
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,773
Huh?

372
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,760
Fucking real. For those of you who
are just listening to the show? Yeah.

373
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,860
So is planning a clip of Cosby walking?
This is out of court.

374
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:15,670
So He's been through it all day. Yeah.
And this is, this one's from a while ago,

375
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,990
I mean the same trial, but I think
the, the first time they had a trial,

376
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,190
um, that that resulted in a
hung jury and he's walking out,

377
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,160
it's a very serious matter.
It's very serious

378
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,560
Mike. I mean, you're coming
out of court. Yeah. And it's a,

379
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,590
you should look somber and worried.
Okay. That's kind of crazy.

380
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,970
But the latest so crazy
is that he was convicted,

381
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,580
at least fake is convicted.

382
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,560
He's facing 10 to 30 years in prison.

383
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,100
This is leaving the court
house headed to his vehicle.

384
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,250
And I don't know,
just keep an eye on the cause.

385
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,520
Philadelphia home 14 years ago,
a couple of key

386
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,880
he's doing his stupid
fucking dance moves dude,

387
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,460
is just stick on the way you just
got convicted in prison. He's like,

388
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,020
he's like, I'm bad. I'm
doing what the cars will be
playing. I have a Obama. Yeah.

389
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,550
Yeah.
Talk about

390
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,770
three counts of aggravated and decent
assault stemming from allegations that he

391
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:33,961
drugged and molested Andrea constand in
his suburban Philadelphia home 14 years

392
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:36,740
ago.
Unbelievable.

393
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,630
Talk about a true
sociopath. Yeah, he's crazy.

394
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,210
He's so removed emotionally from
what's happening. Like he did.

395
00:26:43,211 --> 00:26:45,510
It doesn't take this seriously at all.

396
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,290
I'm surprised he's not afraid of a
judge saying that. The judge, uh,

397
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,350
and being like, okay, that's
really, it's a good point.

398
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,530
I wouldn't you be worried like,
gosh, maybe the judge will see me.

399
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,010
[inaudible] sentencing is
still to come that. Yeah.

400
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,970
And if a judge sees that
they're going to like,

401
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:03,530
this guy doesn't have this funny
when you left. Yeah. Hilarious.

402
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,260
He was making the crowd
laugh. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

403
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,850
he's still playing with the audience.
It's, he's sick. Uh, it also a dug up.

404
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,610
We played this years ago. My God,
the guy's Spn had him on, oh my God,

405
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:18,720
this is the best one.

406
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,160
And he was just supposed
to kind of tease the clip,

407
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,200
like a tease. The fact that there was a
match up that night between two teams.

408
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,770
One was his, I think Alma Mater.
This one's super weird. It's,

409
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,950
this one is so bizarre.
This is yours, right?

410
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,300
Mack football on a Tuesday temple.
Most of the bobcats of Ohio,

411
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:39,950
the call today from Bill Cosby,

412
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,680
Paul nine don't fiber.

413
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,580
But there's 10 hours,

414
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,890
the Ohio,
you a Chitlin legs

415
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,400
villas down here and tonight.
Ladies,

416
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,680
we're out of time and having fun

417
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,180
and you know that the ESPN, I'd
be like, thanks bill for that.

418
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:14,410
A completely sane renditions of
whatever the fuck do you think that was?

419
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,200
Because I don't know.
I don't know the actual team names.

420
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:20,290
I'm assuming Chitlin legs. That one was
a joke. Yeah. Yeah. That was the joke.

421
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:24,940
But also the bottom of a river that
was supposed to be, I think horns.

422
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:30,050
Yeah. So the idea is that it's if you've
got a live high school or college games,

423
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,930
right, right. Have like the marching band.

424
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:36,931
So he's like this is the temple owls
proper for such fucking nonsense.

425
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,840
I think I want to try to
do that and make it my own.

426
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,820
If I get,
if I get allowed to do that on TV,

427
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:50,350
I'm going to do the same
thing he did. Yeah. His eyes
are all fucked up there too.

428
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:54,340
He just starts to get blind right around
there. Yeah. I this way when I lag,

429
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,610
when I goes this way, when I goes
that way. And this guy's like,

430
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,990
what are y'all for me?
I mean,

431
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,910
he's checked no math and
you can get dick real.

432
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,010
Nobody's is checked out as
it's bill Cosby. I mean,

433
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:10,660
he's a total total [inaudible] off with
that guy. Absolutely drug him. Yeah.

434
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:14,410
He likes him sedated. Yeah.
Yeah. Dick oak is so hard.

435
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,270
You'll have pudding pops
coming out of the tip, so

436
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,280
stop it. I don't like his guy.
His cadences. He's creepy.

437
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,850
She reminds me of the Vegan Vagina.
I didn't like him for the same reason.

438
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,870
Can you believe it? He's,
he's as checked out as Oj was.

439
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,770
Remember when Oj got arrested and he
said, yeah, well my mission from now on,

440
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm going to find the killer. I'm going
to find the person who killed Nicole.

441
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:40,920
I think we did

442
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,320
asshole. Tell me what might have
happened on the night of June 12th,

443
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,390
1900 and let's just walk through
them. Well, first of all, it's,

444
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
this is a very difficult,
I'm going to do this. Yeah.

445
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,540
Difficult for me because
it's hypothetical. I know,

446
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,110
and I accept the fact that
people will not feel whatever.

447
00:29:57,111 --> 00:30:01,800
What are they gonna fit,
you know? Uh, wow. Uh, um,

448
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,580
nailed something. Whatever.
Whatever they want to feel.

449
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,673
Huh?

450
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,250
I mean, a book, the hypothetical
is Charlene a pulse that

451
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,950
laughing.
This guy shows up.

452
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:17,950
The guy we had recently
become friends with and uh,

453
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,690
I don't know why you had been
buying them Cole's house,

454
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,940
but it told me you wouldn't
believe what's going on over.

455
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,360
You've put on, well, captain gloves. Uh,

456
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,550
this is hypothetical.
I'll put all crap.

457
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,140
The gloves and you're
reached under the seat for

458
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,653
a knife.

459
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,160
Yeah.

460
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,490
Huh. It's all, I mean, hypothetically
speaking. Yeah. Do you realize how much,

461
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,150
how difficult it must be for
him every day now that he's,

462
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,960
he's out of prison to know that his ex
wives Keller's out there and like, oh,

463
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,190
it's torturing. He's just trying to
be like, man, I gotta get this guy.

464
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,770
And we've seen him devote his, his
finances his time. Yeah. Fracking.

465
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,903
Keller.
Yeah.

466
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,130
He imagined that was the sociopathy
on this motherfucker too.

467
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,870
It's checked out as he is. Oh
yeah. He's Super Jackie. Yes.

468
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,290
The laughter and love the
goofing off stuff. Yeah.

469
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,060
That's the sign of a real cycle.

470
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,740
The C plus laughter and you're more
hypothetical. Would love to hear that

471
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,140
theoretical learning but not
car for the crazies and stuff.

472
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:26,680
Cause you can't travel with a gun.
And I remember Charlie saying,

473
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,010
you ain't bringing that I,
but I believe he took it.

474
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,450
Charlie took the knife
and the book. Yeah. Yes.

475
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,820
So the back gate,
you go through the back gate,

476
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,220
you realize that and it was open or
broken the whole time he's got a Nicole.

477
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,720
Yes,

478
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,890
we gay like hypothetical. And if you asked
them like a real question, he's like,

479
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:52,550
I don't know. Remember, I mean
I have pathetic. We don't,
some people saw this as,

480
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,040
as a confession. Yeah. That's what it
is. Of course it is. Yeah. But I mean,

481
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,230
I don't know.
Well anyway,

482
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,680
I go to the FARC and I'm looking
to see what's going on. Um,

483
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,370
and I can see that. Did
the peers, like Nicole,

484
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,770
I had candles on all the time.

485
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,100
She really did to keep our
overhead and music was on. And, uh,

486
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:18,910
while I was there, a guy shows up. So
Ron Goldman comes into the back. Yeah.

487
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,650
Okay.

488
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,650
I mean, you said she had candles
to keep her overhead down.

489
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,490
Not because she was fucking that dude
or cause she's like candles. Yeah.

490
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,980
Like people would have candles are
all like, man, he's electric bills.

491
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,450
What is that Tom? You study sociopath's
you love these TV shows. Like what,

492
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,300
what is happening with,
with he and the cause where it's,

493
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,040
it's obvious they've done
things they've been accused

494
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,960
of and yet there's so like, how do
I know? I just like, what is that?

495
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,590
No, I mean the, they just,
uh, they're shameless. You
know, they're like, they're,

496
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,990
they're ultra narcissists
and they're shameless.

497
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,940
So they do the thing that
they want to do at all times.

498
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,540
Yeah.

499
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,540
And they don't process any feeling
of empathy or guilt because they,

500
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:08,730
you know, they, they need to be
number one, they need to be the best.

501
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:13,440
They need to be adored and, and they
need to satisfy their own needs. In his,

502
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,980
in his case, it was more,
uh, I think, um, you know,

503
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:20,200
the jealousy and the rage that he had.
Um,

504
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,660
he had to satisfy that nobody
else could have Nicole but him.

505
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:29,010
So he went there and
fuck them up. And, um,

506
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,030
and with bill,

507
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:35,030
I think he excused his perverse,

508
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,400
really gross,
um,

509
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,980
choice for like a sexual satisfaction
because he drugged people.

510
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,380
Yeah. So they were comatose.
Like they, they weren't dead body

511
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,600
defied what he did. He probably justified
what he did and more than one way,

512
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,400
meaning that,
you know,

513
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,140
if the woman showed up in his
mind, he's like, first of all,

514
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,530
she knows what about she, she wants a
part of this just because she's here.

515
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,000
So that's part of his mentality
of justifying what he does.

516
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,320
Then when she has a drink, he's like,
man, I mean, his mind is probably like

517
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,030
there he's taken. Yeah, she's compliant
because she's drinking the drink.

518
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,110
It's the same way that pedophiles
convinced themselves maybe that like, Oh,

519
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:24,360
this child wants this because they're
coming over here and there, uh,

520
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,480
that he wanted it. They, they're
flirting with me. They, they,

521
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,520
they read the situation
completely differently.

522
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,630
We thought there was, you know, and
he might even really believe it.

523
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:39,631
There's an unspoken agreement between
him and everybody that he assaulted.

524
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,350
Oh my God. It's so crazy. Yeah.
I mean, it's totally different.

525
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:48,310
Obviously things that they did,
but they're definitely,

526
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,100
you know, they definitely are not
people that, that, um, feel badly about.

527
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,711
No,

528
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:58,520
it's true because narcissists can't take
any responsibility even on the lesser

529
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:03,020
scale, like not the sociopathic types of
narcis. Maybe the ones that raised me,

530
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,340
they don't ever want to take
responsibility for shit.
So you can be like, Hey,

531
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,010
remember that time you did x,
Y, and z? And they're like,

532
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:14,340
I don't what you're talking about.
Like they'll totally pushed, you know,

533
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,283
Amnesia.

534
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,730
Yeah.
And they'll find something in their mind.

535
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,280
Great that they did and
that's what they want to,

536
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,210
right. Oh man, isn't that a,
isn't it fascinating at the,

537
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,710
all this stuff fascinates me.

538
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:29,500
Oh yeah. It is fascinating. I mean,
the cause to it was, it's even,

539
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,120
it's different now,
but he didn't murder somebody,

540
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:36,121
but it's so calculated that
he had developed over time
the perfect cover to do,

541
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,520
juxtapose with what he was doing to do
what he wanted to do. In other words,

542
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,340
being America's dad being the,
it's even sicker that he's,

543
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:54,090
of course the suit and tie don't curse
was he's always measuring people about

544
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:54,924
cursing.

545
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,130
You're lecturing people about
their language and you're
drugging and assaulting

546
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:00,520
people. It's like, yeah,

547
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,860
he's the Dad, America's Dad.
That was the sickest part. Yeah.

548
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,220
Well that's because I'll be,
I mean,

549
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:10,000
maybe he's pushing away all the
dark shit in his world, Ryan,

550
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,530
and becoming the moral compass for all
of us. He can't handle his own darkness.

551
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,030
So crazy.

552
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,450
Yeah. Huh. Um, okay.

553
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,110
Our guests or guests, it's really here
this time. Okay. Let's take a quick break.

554
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,120
So we're back. Uh, we were smoking
meth. We were, dicks were so hard.

555
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,270
Weird came a real hard and,
um,

556
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,590
never done that before. Mommy smoke
meth. Yeah. Have you ever spoken to you?

557
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,590
I actually,
when I was talking about in high school,

558
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,210
um, you know, I was, you know,

559
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:46,211
I went to three drug rehabs in high school
and he's just smoke meth too as well.

560
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,950
Wait, you went to rehab because of
Meth, marijuana, math, LSD. You know,

561
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:56,570
the suburban drugs that we got at the
time. Three times. Three times I went to,

562
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:59,570
yeah. Yeah, yeah. Where were you
raised? I was raised in that little,

563
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:04,430
I'm in Korea at South San Diego,
South Korea. So this is San Diego.

564
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,910
When you are raised in San Diego,
right?

565
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,980
Yeah, Korean. Do you feel like, oh,

566
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,320
like the world has a lot of Korean people?

567
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,630
No, no, no, no, no, no. Because I'm older
than I look. Yeah, right. Like I, okay.

568
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:21,590
So I grew up in Minnesota when
I was a kid. You did? Yeah.

569
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,470
And there was only one Asian,
his name was Tom Roach and the,

570
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,860
and the reason why his name was Tom Roach,
he was the guy. Dad. He was adopted.

571
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,660
Yeah, of course. Come on. And he wasn't
full Korean because he was adopted.

572
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:37,490
What are you looking at it going?
I'm looking at the screen.

573
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,700
Don't look that way when I'm
kind of scares me. They're like,

574
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,910
I'm getting a prank or something. Okay,
sorry. So Tom Roach, what was it? Korean.

575
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:49,370
He looked like us,
but he behaved white.

576
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,380
That's when I knew about his white
behavior. Oh my God. He played baseball.

577
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,400
Right. And then like white
people, you go to his house,

578
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:02,000
it smelled like three
things. Coffee, baseball,

579
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:06,770
Nimitz and Pi, some sort of pie.
Rhubarb probably. Okay. Yeah.

580
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,640
Was He adopted? He was adopted. I
don't say adopted, I say abandoned,

581
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,100
but we haven't even done it.
Done a

582
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,200
proper introduction
because we've been rolling.

583
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:20,080
We've been rolling for a while
and, okay. Sorry. No, no, no.

584
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,270
That's how we like to do
a little bit a pregame.

585
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:27,271
And then here you have the great
podcast tiger belly with you.

586
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,280
Yeah.
Your name is Bobby Lee

587
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,010
and your lovely Khalilah. Khalilah.
Yeah. Do you want to have a last

588
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,790
name or say [inaudible] fine.
Okay, that's fine. Okay, cool.

589
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,130
And you also have your team at
my team here. You Tiger belly,

590
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,530
but they're not here.
I know the main,

591
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,880
but I wanted to shout out like Paul and
John. You don't want Ringo and George.

592
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,860
Wow. All right, so we've got the two
songwriters. I feel like you need George.

593
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,280
George was essential.
See Ringo could have fucked off and well,

594
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,920
George wrote like five or six solid
songs from the Beatles, but you know,

595
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,070
we were the main, you know,
yesterday. Let it be. Come on man.

596
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,210
Paul and John. Yeah. Yeah. There you guys
are. What make that happen. Of course.

597
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,270
Thank you so much for saying so Tom.
I enjoyed coming on tiger belly.

598
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,450
I had a good time. You know what?
And I enjoy you. I'll tell you why.

599
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,310
Don't can I tell you why I enjoy you? Yes.
I didn't knew who you were for awhile,

600
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,580
you know? Yeah. Are you talking
about, I know before though,

601
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,260
you know he was coming up like a
years ago. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,070
Know I know who he is now. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Famous Thompson Guru.

603
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,570
But for years I was like,
who the fuck is this guy?

604
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,200
Can I swear this is the
question. Yeah, it is.

605
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,700
I bet the Cosby's in trouble
again. What happened? No, sorry.

606
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:49,380
We were in trouble. Like this
is him leaving court. Yeah.

607
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,590
Leaving court where you've been
convicted of sexual assault. Yeah. Okay.

608
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,390
Just keep your eyes on him.
Okay.

609
00:39:55,391 --> 00:40:00,391
So he knows all that's coming up is
sentencing that he's going to do a minimum

610
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,410
of 10 years in prison for assault.

611
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:10,000
Just keep your eye on and lasted Andrea
constant in his suburban Philadelphia

612
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,040
home 14 years ago.

613
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Cosby dance.
Yeah. I have a story about him.

614
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,860
You do tell us and then I want to know
about smoking meth. Oh, got it. Yeah.

615
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,930
Got To get back to you. I'll
get back to that. But um,

616
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,870
one of my first jobs I ever had
an acting job. This is a back end,

617
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:35,980
like the late nineties. Yeah. I
had a makeup artist and she goes,

618
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,850
my first job was at the Cosby show. I
was an intern as a makeup artist. Hello.

619
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,490
I have the big fan.
I love Bill Cosby himself and goes dad.

620
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,670
Right. Yeah. Great movie. This is why
you guys are a great company. Yeah.

621
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,490
And then, um, she goes,
you know, he did the way

622
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,730
he took his hand,

623
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,460
he clawed my breast to the point
where it was almost bleeding. Right.

624
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,360
And he goes, there's nothing
you can do about it. Nah,

625
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,190
that's what she said. She said he, that
happened seriously. Yeah. And this has it.

626
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:14,800
And she told you this story years
ago. This is back in the 90s. Wow.

627
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:18,580
That's not a made up story. Yeah.
No, I, it may, it may, it may be,

628
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,100
but it's like the fuck would
somebody make up that story? Right.

629
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:24,180
But I knew about his vibe.
Yeah.

630
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,140
Then you hear things right on the streets.

631
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,820
So it's like,
you know,

632
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,820
whenever I got like if I got an audition
for ghost dad too, you know what I mean?

633
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,970
I wouldn't even show up.
I don't want you,

634
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,670
would you have not worked with him after
that at that point? Not at all. Really.

635
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,290
No. I, I can't do crazy. Yeah.

636
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,690
I got offered a show with Christie.
I don't say her name.

637
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,940
Just say that when it was Christie.
Fuck it. Allie Christie, Allie,

638
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,980
I'm sure she doesn't download this party.

639
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,430
And I got offered a part in
like a regular on a show for us.

640
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:11,110
I can't do it really good because I know
that she's crazy and I can't be around

641
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,980
bear witness to that crazy and realize
that every day. Another good question.

642
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:19,370
That is a very good question baby.
The very good question. Yeah,

643
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,260
but I don't want to
bear witness to nothing.

644
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,990
It's like I don't want to be
a witness to elect tragedy.

645
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,330
My mind 100% goes where yours went
because have you ever worked for crazy?

646
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,480
I know it's a rollercoaster.

647
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,350
You don't want to be on it cause you
don't know what to expect every day.

648
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:40,380
I just say press just by your confidence
and boldness and integrity to make that

649
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:46,670
choice. I also feel like being in
this business, if somebody was like,

650
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,810
Hey, do you want to a job on a show
where you're working with a lunatic?

651
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,540
My instinct would be like, ah, yes,

652
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,460
just because of the job and I
don't have the, um, you know,

653
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,920
the, the benefit of saying like, Nah,

654
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,180
but I think you do and I'm going to
correct you on that. Okay. I think you do.

655
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,270
I'm going to correct you on
that. You are Tom Segura, right?

656
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:12,140
I saw you on a late night show the
other day. Yeah. What was it? Cole Bear?

657
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:17,300
Gold Bear. One of the biggest ones. Yeah,
and when I see you on there I go look at,

658
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,880
he's handsome. He's one of the
funniest guys in the nation.

659
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,570
This guy's going to work forever so
you can make those choices. All right,

660
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:23,900
well thanks.

661
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Now if you were like some sort of like
open miker and you were just coming into

662
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:33,680
the business, that's one
thing. But you are a franchise.

663
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:38,300
Alright. Alright. Wow. And you're a little
racist when that Bruce Lee's sweatshirt.

664
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,170
But that's fine. This is not, no,

665
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,270
I just really know

666
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,850
Brianna look roots of fight.
Who? I'm a big fan of.

667
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,060
[inaudible] sent a whole bunch.
You saw those boxes?

668
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:56,540
They sent an unconscious thing on Tom?
No,

669
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,270
just a Bruce Lee Mohammed Ali.

670
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:03,410
You had usually I should go change Allen
Iverson. And you picked out the Bruce.

671
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,540
I like a conscious decision.
Maybe cause you know that Bobby was,

672
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:11,490
who leaves coming here? Billy. Billy does
this. Should I change it? No, no, no,

673
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:13,290
no. You're fine with
it. I like it. I think.

674
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,160
I think you are trying to
make me feel comfortable.

675
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,690
I can get that side. You're going
out of your way to make me feel good.

676
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,520
That's good. This is a
perfect segue. First of all,

677
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:26,260
I'm not going to forget that
math gets your dick hard. Okay?

678
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,130
Order problems. I'm here
to tell you, forget that

679
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,240
bag or forget about south. Let's forget
about Dick and plants and all that stuff.

680
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,410
Yeah. I don't know if you believe me or
not. Yeah, that you'd like to see me.

681
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,540
Smokes meth with a small limp Dick.

682
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,130
The Dan get hardly any other way and watch
it get harder and harder than Norris.

683
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:48,130
Smoke harder.
My Dick get.

684
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,740
Is that your experience?
Yes.

685
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,510
11 it doesn't matter. We.
Let's talk a little bit. Let's
talk about the first time.

686
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,890
Can we talk about the first highest one?

687
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,400
How does one procure math smoke at the
first time? How did it happen? Okay,

688
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:06,320
here we go. Okay. You want
to go down memory lion? Yes.
I'll go down memory lanes.

689
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,140
Okay. To you? Yeah. Number one,

690
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,700
when I was in my late childhood
in May eight nine years old,

691
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:19,040
oh, eight nine years old, I was
like, yeah, I was glean adult.

692
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,470
I was molested. Okay.
What? No, I'm saying yes.

693
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,420
When you were, when you were 89 I was
molested by a guy with downs syndrome.

694
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:34,220
I do it in my act. Goodness. He's
serious. Okay. And then my guys, the guy,

695
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:37,280
I'm sorry, I don't mean his
20th I'm over it. Fuck man.

696
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,500
It didn't bother me at the time.
I don't think,

697
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,430
I don't really find your story
to be like a real molestation.

698
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,630
I feel like it was like a barter or a
trade system because you kept going back

699
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:51,450
to the same guy. Yeah. Yeah.
You're right. Well, that's
how they court you. I mean, I,

700
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:55,010
I understand when you're saying your
card or like you got something like,

701
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,090
I got something in return.
What do you get candy. But See,

702
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:02,450
my dad and my parents wouldn't give you
the other dips. Yeah. The dip stick ones.

703
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,110
Yeah. They wouldn't get me
at, that's my favorite one.
Foreigners. Right. Therefore,

704
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:09,570
he, yeah, yeah, yeah. That wasn't a
question. They don't do it on foreigners,

705
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,100
don't do it. No. Yeah, yeah. It's
fucked up. And so I thought to myself,

706
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,300
he has the dip candy.
Right. And I said to myself,

707
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,090
if I just, you know, all had to do is
like touches junk. Yeah. You're right.

708
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,520
I didn't have to kiss it or anything
like that. Just touch it. Yeah.

709
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,430
And I get the good candy.
Yeah.

710
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,980
So I went by like every
day during the summers.

711
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,900
And how did it get disrupted?
Like we moved. That's it. Yeah.

712
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,800
So you would have been still going.
That was really sad movie.

713
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,990
That's a good buy. The dip
candy I did. Fuck. Yeah. So,

714
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,460
and then my dad was an alcoholic
and he was very violent. Right.

715
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:54,260
He was a rageaholic as well. A man
alive or is he dead? Barely alive.

716
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,180
Yeah. Almost sad about it. I
love my dad. Sure, sure. Yeah,

717
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,140
yeah, yeah, yeah. You're gonna
love it when he's dead then. Um,

718
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:05,480
so with those two events,

719
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,180
as a young man or kid,

720
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,210
it drove me into doing early
drug use. Yeah. That's,

721
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,750
we moved at San Diego and you know,
uh,

722
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,190
I was maybe 11 and I
walked outside my house.

723
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:21,890
I lived in this place called Green Valley,
the suburbs,

724
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,580
and this kid was riding a skateboard and
he just parked it in front of my house.

725
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,400
It just to be,
he was there.

726
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:35,590
He flipped escape would over and he rolled
a joint and I walked outside my house

727
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:38,770
and I go, can I have some? He goes, yeah,

728
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:43,771
I did and I smoked pot and then I had
met a guy named Julio Romero while you

729
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:49,420
pointing at me. Literally
Helene Romero. Okay, thanks.

730
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:54,420
Yeah, it wasn't you. You're
provably Oreo, right? Yeah,

731
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,810
that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
You were a member. Goes a dude.

732
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:04,720
What's up bro? He goes, dude, I
got to go to Lucy's house. Lucy,

733
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,220
I told you about this
and so we could this lady Lucy,

734
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,140
she lived in Rancho
Bernardo. It's fine. Yeah.

735
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,680
Yeah. It's fancy. It's
pretty fancy and you walk in.

736
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:21,190
No couches in the middle
of the living room. Cool.

737
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,380
Was a baby crawling amongst a meth lab.

738
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,450
Oh my God. Train spotting. How
old are you again? At this point,

739
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,100
1112 Jesus Christ, man. And then that's
when I did meth for the first time.

740
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,270
And what? So that you smoked it. Yeah.
And does it hurt when you inhale?

741
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,310
It didn't hurt at all.
No,

742
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:46,990
it doesn't hurt because the
high is so good that immediate.

743
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,740
Oh yeah. And you don't sleep
for days. You don't eat,

744
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,340
you don't sleep for days and
you know the guy was right.

745
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:56,710
You do get erect it,
you get Horny,

746
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,660
but you're the things that you, the
only way you can, can I say calm?

747
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,760
You can say that. Yeah, I can.
Yeah. Ejaculations [inaudible] is,

748
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,650
you have to think of like really fucked
up things even at that age really.

749
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:14,590
So it's not just straight up sex, you're
thinking. So it starts off with like,

750
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,210
okay, a regular woman, whatever,
and your head. Right, right.

751
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,360
And then she's missing a breast.
Right, right. She has no arms,

752
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,360
and then like six hours later, you're just
masturbating to a foot. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

753
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:31,660
yeah. So it gets crazier and crazier.
And then did you do any sorted, twisted,

754
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:35,770
broken foot with blood gushing out? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tom, yes. Sounds out.

755
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,800
Yeah. So that was at a one off and that,
or no, I did college. I did it constantly.

756
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:46,310
I stoled like 15 grand from my parents.
Save that.

757
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,650
Yeah. Smoked a lot about the law. Why

758
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,310
don't don't don't mention that here.
So you were 11. I know it said,

759
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,830
don't mention that you were sucking
dicks to, you mentioned that,

760
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,140
don't mention that hair. Oh, not on the
baby and baby. I know. I don't know.

761
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:04,590
But I wasn't even going to bring
that fucking vibe and well, this guy,

762
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,900
this guy was saying something. Tell
me if this is true or not. Yeah.

763
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,110
You won't believe how good it
feels. Good. If you're straight,

764
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,640
you won't believe how good it bills.

765
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,970
Your Dick Becomes so sensitive that you
don't need lube. You don't need spirit.

766
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,680
We this trip that dictated
this up and down four times,

767
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:26,681
it's this hot band and do it and you'll
shoot an enormous amount of very topic.

768
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,070
Dick

769
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,040
hot white castle. Okay. That's disgusting.

770
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,190
How do you find videos like that?

771
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,870
Oh my God. Oh yeah. He's one
of your, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,830
It's uncomfortable. That's
not comfortable. Right. Is
it thick? Is it fair? No,

773
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,440
I have never heard of like
math making your calm thick.

774
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,010
Your promise thick from
not ejaculate a lot. Right.

775
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,040
So you might, he might go, you know
what, I'm going to do math in May. Yeah.

776
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,570
I say this right now it's
January, right? Yeah.

777
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,650
So I'm not going to masturbate
until May. Yeah. He's on that.

778
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:10,300
And it's all the explosions
in the sky, but it does it.
Now. Did you ever, um, did,

779
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:15,110
did you partake in crazy sexual
activity because of math?

780
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,040
See,
that's the problem with your mouth.

781
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,940
Sometimes the problem with your mouth
sometimes is blame it on the math.

782
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:24,430
Instead you're admitting to
actually wanting to suck dick.

783
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,560
That's okay.

784
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,560
But I don't even know right now who
listens to this podcast is the demographic

785
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:35,550
of your people might don't
get, don't, don't judge me.
I'm not, and I'm just asking,

786
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,840
you know, are they children? No.
No. Okay. Well then yeah, I did.

787
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,220
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,040
Our, our, our audience is actually
very empathetic. Very sweet.

789
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,910
Yeah. Very nice people. So I wouldn't
know. Here's a, here's the thing,

790
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:49,760
here's the thing. Can I just say this
and I just want to justify my behavior?

791
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,930
Yeah. You're on meth. Yeah. I mean,

792
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:57,400
I'm not a math every day,
once a month event. All right.

793
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,360
Acid. I did all kinds of stuff. Okay.
Yeah, yeah. I used it to get drunk a lot.

794
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:04,650
But the point is, you're not
as, you're not of sound mind,

795
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,170
so you don't have full
responsibility for a child. You know,

796
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:11,830
the don't feel responsibility. Well,
thank you. Yeah. That's what it is.

797
00:52:11,831 --> 00:52:14,110
Then why would you decade,

798
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,410
but also when you're traumatized,
I swear to God, when you're,

799
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,340
when you start doing drugs and
you're traumatized, you're, um,

800
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,240
development stops at
that age level stunted.

801
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,510
So you actually are going into the
world as an eight or nine or whatever.

802
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:32,770
11 year old for like a decade. Dude,
I listen to fucking doctor drew.

803
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:35,260
I know you hang out with Bobby
for 10 minutes and you're like,

804
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,300
oops. Yeah. Emotionally. Yeah,

805
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,620
but can I just say something to your
fans and whatnot? Sure is, is that,

806
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:46,530
I'm 16 years sober now.
Congratulations.

807
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:50,040
And I was when I was 17.
I got sober for 12 years.

808
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:54,600
So big chunks of my life. I've
been in sobriety. That's great.

809
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:58,860
And I've done God's work.
Yeah, right. No gay here.

810
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:03,000
It may just not doing gay thing. What?
No shrimp now shrimp. Yeah. No, sorry.

811
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,460
Yeah, I've been a, I've been, um, I try to
give as much as I can. You're giving guy.

812
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,290
Yeah. And I want to be
spiritual, you know,

813
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:14,460
so people can listen to me right now
and go, I'm a heathen. That's fine.

814
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:18,150
Now there no one can repent and one

815
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:22,370
changes behavior. You Dad though.
Yeah. It's not your fault.

816
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:23,840
Your parents weren't on the list.

817
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:26,100
And let me tell you saying my
kid doesn't take a dump for a day

818
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,120
and I'm all over him.

819
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,480
If your parent doesn't know that you're
smoking math and you're out in the

820
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:33,330
streets and you're doing stuff that's
on them and they should have had, uh,

821
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,680
an eye on you, it's not your
responsibility. Like, how am I

822
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,500
gonna go?
I want to

823
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:46,700
fuck with the Dick socks start head.
Are you naturally good at it?

824
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:51,630
Cause I feel like, oh my God, I feel
like, I feel like as a guy you're like,

825
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,320
I know what I like. So you have like
certain skills, right? Well, it's silly.

826
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,920
I just want to say this to you and I'm
not going to go into detail about it.

827
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:03,540
Okay. But when you're young you
don't know what you like. Yeah.

828
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,140
So I think it was pretty much amateur
hour. Okay. You know what I mean?

829
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:11,340
I would probably be like, I wouldn't go
down to the sack where the taint. Right.

830
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:16,260
And Go. You like that. Right. I
think it was more like, you know,

831
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,890
licking the tip and going,
does that suffice? Right.

832
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,060
What?

833
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:32,330
Yeah.
Like if I am like how happy.

834
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,290
Joyful. Yeah. If I was never
a gay man and I was in,

835
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,570
you were gay and you and I were having
sexual out sexualities with each other

836
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:47,340
[inaudible] you and I would probably be
like, we probably know what we, we liked,

837
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:51,140
you know, of course. And we would
do extra things, you know, to,

838
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,590
to please ourselves. Sure. I would like
to please you. Thanks. You're welcome.

839
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,280
I like that. But yeah,
he was a kid. Baby kids.

840
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,890
The kids don't know how to give blowjobs.

841
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,810
Are you blowing adults? No, no,
no. Oh my God. You can't let it go.

842
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:12,810
Let it go. Kenya. And this is
your fault. Do you like that?

843
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:17,610
Yeah. It's your, it's your phone.
Like, so check this out. This guy

844
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:22,620
with his brother,
something cool happened.

845
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,920
I'm rather man, believe me, when
you smoked with me, he put his dick.

846
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:30,240
I can't believe how big his dick was.
He jacked off board,

847
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,130
drove by and shot the most
common with every shot.

848
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,460
He's fine. He has no problems
at all. It gets even harder,

849
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,470
thicker,
and even more coming.

850
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,220
This is a pretty good ad for math.
I think it's, yeah, but it's a,

851
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,820
it's a dangerous dog because
you can go fast. Yeah.

852
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,440
Or you start losing teeth
really quickly. Yeah. No,

853
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:00,090
because I didn't do it. I mean, when
you're in middle school, he fell off.

854
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like 40th
crowd. I can't do it. No.

855
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,070
If I showed you the inside of
my mouth, it's crazy. Maybe,

856
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:09,630
I dunno what the fuck
you're doing right now,

857
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,450
but you're calling me out and
you're like exposing things.

858
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:16,590
I don't want people in those
days I can't use seriously. Yeah.

859
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,310
I want to say this. Okay. This is that

860
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,850
it on its own? Yeah. Can I just say
this? Good now I'm defensive. Yes.

861
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,050
Yes.
Right.

862
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,040
That I have a bunch of teeth
missing and I can't chew steak,

863
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:36,760
but I don't think that's from the math
and then that's because they don't floss.

864
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:42,370
So when did those teeth get removed?
It's been years of deterioration.

865
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,970
Do you go to a dentist at all ever?
I did. To get them removed? Yes.

866
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,350
What is your pain? Well, you know
Steve Simone? Yeah, his brother did it.

867
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,350
Brothers Lawrence.
Yeah.

868
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,450
Have you thought about replacing
the teeth that are missing?

869
00:56:55,570 --> 00:57:00,050
They wanted to do metal rods into my arm.
Bone of your jaw.

870
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,800
You know how they did
implants and they screw it in,

871
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,950
but I just said life is
better with Maulers get these.

872
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:09,640
You should choose to do it now.
No, because I'll tell you why.

873
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,150
I'll tell you why I know because I'm fine.
Okay.

874
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,550
Because you can chew with gums. I don't
know if you know that. No, I'm not steak,

875
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:23,230
not, yeah, but you can chew
Brussel sprouts. You can,
she do everything up front.

876
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,270
Everything's, yeah, everything.

877
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:29,770
You go to Korean barbecue and you get
your Kalbi and you're chewing in the

878
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:31,690
front.
The front end.

879
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,300
I have a couple of like rogue teeth
in the back that you, that you know,

880
00:57:36,301 --> 00:57:39,750
like I'll have gums on top bone.
Your bones.

881
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,780
Yeah. But yeah, I have that. But you
know what? I'm on a Sitcom right now.

882
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,360
They don't make it up. They
can't tell. Can I see her teeth?

883
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,320
I smiled like this and they can't
open your mouth. Okay. I'll show you.

884
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:58,150
But can I not do it in camera? Yeah, of
course. You're going to look down here.

885
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,650
Okay. Okay. Oh my God,

886
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:08,440
I don't up here. Wow. You
definitely can't tell.

887
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,630
You can't tell, but I'm surprised.
Uh, it just doesn't matter. You just,

888
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,060
why don't you just be
being around being real.

889
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,380
I don't know what's
wrong with you right now,

890
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,360
but like it just whisper into my ear and
then tell me you're going to be saying

891
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:25,620
stuff and then I'll go, no,
don't do that. Because it's like,

892
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:29,680
now I have no teeth.
You know what I mean?

893
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:33,930
There's so much going on right now.
I'm being offensive by the way. Yeah.

894
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,620
So, okay. Asians listen, I love him

895
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:46,540
and he thinks my people
are garbage. Filipino. Oh,

896
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:50,650
interest. I don't because
I know. No, no, that's not.

897
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:54,100
Your inner skin is kind
of a third world country.

898
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:59,050
Colonial colonial life. We never really
got a true independence. We're sovereign,

899
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:03,240
but not really. So he thinks Koreans
generally think Filipinos are shit. No.

900
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,960
Yes you do. No, we don't

901
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,780
all think I'm dating you.
Why would I think I'm dating you?

902
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:14,740
I don't think that you're a mud person.
There you go.

903
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:20,370
If I'm dating you, if I'm eating and me
doing it, sexualities with you and doing,

904
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,640
you know why he has a colonial

905
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,840
mentality.

906
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,070
You're like the Spanish conqueror that
likes to fuck the poor peasant Filipino

907
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:30,430
girl. I could see that.
Yeah. You could see that.

908
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,740
You can see that I'm saying that that's a,

909
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,350
that's a viable idea that she threw out.
I'm not saying it's true,

910
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,970
I'm saying it's,
it's plausible.

911
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:42,370
Can I say this song? Yeah, yeah. You know.
Okay. You two together. Right, right.

912
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,770
You know that, you know, you
know deep down inside, right,

913
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:50,410
because you're out here in the country.
Yeah. Right. You're on which lane road,

914
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,930
whatever that thing is. I never even
heard of that road by the way. Yeah. Yeah.

915
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:58,310
Right. And you know that this is
real love because you guys, you know,

916
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:01,330
have your character defects and
you're able to like, you know,

917
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,830
forgive and um, you just love each
other. Right. This was the same thing.

918
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,080
How could it be a colonization
kind of a situation?

919
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:12,810
Could you tell me everyday
my people are garbage?

920
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,070
What's what, what do you, what
do you think is wrong with,
if I do it as a joke? Oh,

921
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,750
what's wrong with them?
I don't know,

922
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:23,350
cause I've never heard anything negative
about Filipinos. Call it like what,

923
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:27,690
what are the stereotypes? Well, they're
more intense within Asian cultures, right?

924
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,280
Like, well, Dave, it, can I just say this,

925
01:00:29,281 --> 01:00:33,270
I want to give you props probably
the most talented out of the Asians.

926
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,570
Really talented and what saying,
oh, that's true. Singing,

927
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,330
dancing. Yep. Billiards. Billiards.
Yeah. All kinds of stuff. Okay.

928
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:45,470
You know, and what are the negative
stereotypes about Filipinos?

929
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:46,490
We really don't know.
Yeah.

930
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:51,330
I think that we have any true innovation
in terms of like creating electronics

931
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:54,440
because that's what's, that's what
Koreans do apparently on good yogurt.

932
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,790
But what did, that's just the
Koreans thing and not, you
know what I'm saying? Like

933
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:06,060
I have a theory strokes.
Can I hear my theory? Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. I think that, um,

934
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,530
groups of people that they have climate,

935
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:15,210
like the seasons change, what would they
go from summer to winter? Yeah. Right.

936
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,560
That they have to, um, create
more technology to survive.

937
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:24,950
So they're constantly in a mode of
creating things out of survival.

938
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:30,770
Right. And when you were at in a jungle
place, right. Which is beautiful. Yeah.

939
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,910
We go to jungles all the time. Right.
Why Aloha? Yeah. To you, my column,

940
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,870
I follow two of you in
front. Right? Right. Yeah.

941
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,090
It's just that they don't
really have to do that.

942
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:41,410
So they don't create know
that's why you don't,

943
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:44,040
no, no, no, no. You're, you're
logic askew because, okay.

944
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:47,430
What about like the inner weights and
shit? I mean, they don't have technology.

945
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,350
They live in Igloos and they
eat. I know, but he's saying me.

946
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:54,120
Is she saying that they don't have a good
day? They don't have a Samsung. Right.

947
01:01:54,121 --> 01:01:54,661
And I'm shit,

948
01:01:54,661 --> 01:01:57,590
but he saying that the cold weather
is conducive to people creating tell.

949
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:02,591
He's saying that the people that don't
have a necessity all you're all correct.

950
01:02:02,821 --> 01:02:05,640
They don't have shit. I understand
that. Right. But there's six of them.

951
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,183
We need more.

952
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,910
Yeah. Yeah. If there was a
hundreds and thousands of them,

953
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:14,330
I think they would computers and no one
would live out on the Tundra like that.

954
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:15,170
That's a little ridiculous.

955
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,790
It's a little extreme. So do you
feel like when you're done with him,

956
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:20,170
you'll move on to like
a guy are just like, oh,

957
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,033
stay with it.

958
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:26,400
I told you that I would probably get with
like a east coast Indian. That's right.

959
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:30,030
Yeah. Indian from India. No, no,
no. It's close to New York Indian,

960
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:35,070
like New York Indian, native
American? No, like from India. Oh,

961
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:36,830
right. Okay. Sorry, just
to clarify, I mean, yeah,

962
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,350
but like like a Jersey guy or something.
You know, it's interesting. Max,

963
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,340
I don't know if I've ever met that Max.
That's interesting. Yeah, they're good.

964
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:47,750
Yeah. What's, what do you like about,
there is a different swag about them,

965
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,180
but not the La Indian.
It's all planned out.

966
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,890
This has been here.
What was it again?

967
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,120
You said your game was
when I started dating.

968
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,850
When you guys went on a few dates. You
said my game was, what was it like?

969
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I pretend like he didn't know if the
whole Tinder thing where you're like,

970
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:13,680
is this working? Oh yeah. He's
like, how does this work? Lol.

971
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,940
That's funny. You pretend that you
don't know cause I get it every day,

972
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:22,000
but I pretended, I always pretend
like you're the first one. Yeah.

973
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:23,750
I don't know how it works.
That's kind of,

974
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,290
I would say high twice. And then the third
thing was it, did you say high twice,

975
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,630
right. To make it like funny.
That was pretty good one.

976
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:40,740
I like it. I like that. That's endearing.
Let me go to my agent question now.

977
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,870
Did you follow the controversy
over the prom dress?

978
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,170
I knew what I know about it. Yeah. All
right. So I could show their audience.

979
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:54,090
So here's the, the dress, this
girl, what's your take on it?

980
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,490
Is that, I'm going to throw
this out there, right?

981
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:02,460
I should, sorry. The
drama is that a girl, uh,

982
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:06,930
went to prom and she bought a white girl,
white girl,

983
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:10,560
a white girl, but I guess you
call it traditional Chinese dress.

984
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,140
She saw it was like, I want
to wear this, the prom.

985
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,750
She posted her pictures like
going to prom and uh, anyways,

986
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:21,840
somebody else,
a Chinese guy to be specific,

987
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:25,210
did a tweet where he
quoted it and we said, ah,

988
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:30,140
my culture is not your goddamn dumb dress.

989
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,340
And that thing exploded.

990
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:37,260
So then she's kind of in this middle
of this firestorm about whether it's

991
01:04:37,261 --> 01:04:40,320
cultural appropriation and all this
stuff. So anyways, the old white,

992
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:45,210
so we have to ask Asians with the, I
have two things to say about that. Okay.

993
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:46,044
Number one.

994
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,860
The only thing that makes me mad about
it is she would never fucking Asian guy.

995
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:55,230
Oh, she'll wear our clothes if she
was knee deep in Asian Dick. Yeah.

996
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,940
Where would it be one. Oh really?
Yeah, but the guy with her was Asian.

997
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:02,550
You'd be like, oh, I would be like,
yeah, he's killing it. He's killing it.

998
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,490
Here's my second,
and I just thought about it and love it.

999
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,120
I just thought about this. Okay. In Asia,

1000
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,800
this is how we used to
dress. Correct. Okay. Okay.

1001
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,760
But this closing right here,

1002
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:19,060
all the clothing I'm wearing right now
is more western developed. That's right.

1003
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:22,330
Right. So essentially I'm
wearing western clothing, right?

1004
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:26,530
Which is white people clothing. Right?
Right. So why is this okay? Right.

1005
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,460
Are you culturally appropriating the
white guys? I know it bothers me.

1006
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:37,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'll get, I'll,
I'll start with dressing like that.

1007
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:41,680
You showed up like that, but that's
my thing. And also on top of it.

1008
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:45,130
It's like the only thing that I had a
problem with like girls that were like,

1009
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,850
look, I got a tattoo of like a
Chinese symbol on their body. Right.

1010
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:53,340
And then they would never like fuck. Cause
they'll have, you know, are I get it,

1011
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:57,970
are riding on them permanently. That
would drive me crazy. I get that. Right.

1012
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:04,510
It's interesting that Asians
perpetuate this, you know,

1013
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,260
they perpetuate it. They get angry
when something like this, this worn,

1014
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:11,800
but they sell it to the masses.
Right. So if you were to go to Asia,

1015
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:16,510
let's say for instance the, um, my, my
Indian friend actually told me this.

1016
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,320
She goes, you know, when they were the
jewel in the middle of the forehead,

1017
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,740
she's like,
we sell them everywhere and then we,

1018
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,140
you're suppose you get
angry when people wear it.

1019
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,780
Chinatown in San Francisco, they're
everywhere, right. So it's like our,

1020
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:37,090
it's true. You're supposed to, I
guess. I mean to further that point.

1021
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,250
It's like if you are,

1022
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,080
if you the person are selling the thing
and I buy it to wear it, you're also,

1023
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,920
you are profiting from it so
you have a win. In other words,

1024
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,940
I gave you money to get this thing.
She gave him money for the dress.

1025
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,910
So isn't that a nice exchange?
But if she was,

1026
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:59,020
if I found out that she was a
Ku Klux Klan member, oh Geez.

1027
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:03,930
That'd be hot right then. Yeah,
we've kind of hardly, yeah, but that,

1028
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,070
that would have a probably
with that. Would you, do you
get off on the, I'm like,

1029
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:12,470
how did you ever sleep with somebody and
the lamb?

1030
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,100
Did you ever ask somebody to, to, um,

1031
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:21,700
to like call you racial slurs as you had
sex or anything like that or no? Yeah,

1032
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:26,650
yeah, yeah. Call me Glueck or
whatever. Are there other, no,

1033
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:31,150
I know you put some adjectives before
it call me pants phase goop. I, uh,

1034
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,870
I just, I put out there, by the way,

1035
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:37,890
that I hope everyone that's
given this girl Shit, uh,

1036
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,850
gives Steven Seagal some shit too.

1037
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:46,600
He's the biggest cultural center.
Yeah.

1038
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:51,630
I met him once and he said to me 12 times
in a row and he didn't see any other

1039
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:58,490
words. Nama stay, oh my
gosh. Did they go, hey,

1040
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,540
this is Steven Seagal?
He goes, no, I'm a stay.

1041
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,830
But there was other white people with me,

1042
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,710
other comedians at whatnot
because this at mad TV, no,

1043
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:08,920
it was at some sort of like billboard
awards or something like that. Right.

1044
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,930
I hosted at one year and went
back when I was on that TV. Yeah.

1045
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,590
And he met all the other ones.
You said hello, how are you?

1046
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,670
But you wouldn't look at me and go,
Nama stay. Yeah. Even your culture.

1047
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,850
And also I don't even know what
the fuck that means. He's, I,

1048
01:08:22,851 --> 01:08:25,460
I used to make fun of him
for this in my act about,

1049
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:29,570
cause I used to watch that show a law man,
which was the reality show,

1050
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,600
followed him around like Jefferson parish.

1051
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:37,080
And he was so blatant about his,
uh,

1052
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:41,610
how he would switch up for
different races. So when, you know,

1053
01:08:41,611 --> 01:08:44,210
he'd pull over black and he was like,
what's up with job at night?

1054
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,390
Getting into sho nuff he would really,

1055
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:54,590
really ham it up, back it
up for them. Asian people,

1056
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:58,460
I swear he was like bowing. Yeah.
Would bring up martial arts.

1057
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:01,930
And they're always like, I
called you about a fucking, uh,

1058
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,530
there was a fire next door.
Like,

1059
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:08,120
I don't want to get this conversation
with you saying you would happen then,

1060
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,870
you know, with Latin Pete, like Hispanic
people, he would start speaking.

1061
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,180
I know those kinds of whites
and those kinds of whites,

1062
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,290
their heart, they mean, they mean
well, oh, that's a good point.

1063
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,190
And you know that it's like
he was on a flight, right?

1064
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,070
And there was this like southern
Asian guy next to not white guy,

1065
01:09:28,071 --> 01:09:29,360
me and southern white guy next to me.

1066
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,480
And you could tell that he was
a kind of wanting to talk to me,

1067
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,720
but he didn't know how, what angle,
because you can tell that he doesn't,

1068
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:39,140
he's not around a lot of Asian.
Yeah. So he just said, uh,

1069
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:43,850
my daughter loves hello kitty.
He said that to me.

1070
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,140
If I did, I wouldn't be in the middle
seat. Southwest Airlines. Yeah,

1071
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,610
it's true because my father is that
white guy. Yeah, 100% and you forgive it.

1072
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:59,690
Yeah. I mean like I'm a, a
rant, like I get to observe him,

1073
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:04,330
so I as an, I'm also as kids, so I
get, oh my God, embarrassed and all,

1074
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:07,340
you know what I mean?
But I know his heart's in a good place.

1075
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:10,400
If he were here right now meeting you,
you know,

1076
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:15,110
he would only be able to bite his tongue
for a few minutes right before he'd be

1077
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:19,200
like, uh, yeah. You go like, yeah,

1078
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,050
Japanese occupied

1079
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,070
and you'd be like, they're brutal people.
He just tried to get you to go off. Well,

1080
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:32,750
that right there would be a, you know,
a fresh of breath, of fresh breath,

1081
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:36,710
of fresh air. He would definitely bring
up the current news. Yeah. I liked that,

1082
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:40,310
that the Korean occupation of the Japanese
occupation of Korea because that's

1083
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:42,350
never brought up. People didn't
even know about that. So I would be,

1084
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,890
I would be engaged. Then he'd be like,
look, chaps are nuts. That's, yeah.

1085
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:50,770
And I would be like, yeah, they are. You
know, he would love that. Yeah. Yeah.

1086
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,990
I've seen him do it. It's,
you know, as an ethnic person,

1087
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:58,670
and I want to tell people this, you
learn how to survive in the world. Sure.

1088
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,481
And you know,

1089
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:04,481
I'm not as sensitive about things as
like other Asian people in show business.

1090
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,580
You're also a comic. Yeah.
That's another thing.

1091
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:12,300
You've been around dickheads for
30 year. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,190
He's you shit club owners,
I'm sure

1093
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,150
saying stupid shit. Crazy things.
Yeah. Yeah. But you know what? Um,

1094
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,460
[inaudible] oh hell yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1095
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,590
yeah. You've, you've heard
all kinds of, I mean,

1096
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:27,210
shit in the parking lot of the story,

1097
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:30,090
you've heard the wildest shit anyone
will ever say. Yeah, but you know what,

1098
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:33,360
I give it out to, of course you do.
You know, it's like, you know, um,

1099
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,640
like if a black guy kissed
me on the cheek, I go,

1100
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:39,690
did I just get sickle cell anemia?
You, it just sounds like it happened.

1101
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:43,000
It did happen. Yeah. Yeah. And
then you would like, um, I'm,

1102
01:11:43,001 --> 01:11:47,160
I'm also very touchy feely with comics.
I would grab people's junk. Yeah.

1103
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,890
Which you can't do anymore.
So I don't do it anymore.

1104
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,650
But back in the day you would
just fuck around with comics. I,

1105
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,710
I'm pretty strong when it comes
to stuff like that, you know.

1106
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,140
Who are your parents the
most racist about growing up?

1107
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,530
What did they based, no, they based it on,

1108
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,210
they owned a clothing store called fashion
Gal [inaudible] and it was basically

1109
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:14,190
like, you know, Lane Bryant or
for ethnic people, so Samoans.

1110
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,720
Okay. But every once in a while Indians
would go walk in and they wouldn't buy

1111
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:21,820
anything. So I heard
that a lot. You don't,

1112
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,920
by not being babied, they come in,
they look around, they look around,

1113
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,500
they look around, you know what I mean?
Yeah. And you hear it, you're like,

1114
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:30,940
all right dad. But that doesn't
necessarily mean that there are, you know,

1115
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:35,760
cockroaches
or he did do a list of like,

1116
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:40,830
you know, one time he get made a list of
like who the hierarchy, the hierarchy of,

1117
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,010
Oh, who's not, who's at the top?
Koreans. Yeah. Well naturally.

1118
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:48,120
And then who's second place? The second
war? Uh, uh, oddly enough Japanese. Yeah.

1119
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:51,540
Really? Yeah. The Korean
to give them yeah.

1120
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:56,130
Because they give it in terms of like
economic strength and their position in

1121
01:12:56,131 --> 01:13:00,750
the world and all that stuff.
Yeah. Number three was Chinese.

1122
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:05,220
Okay. Okay. Number four
was, um, cousins. Snakes.

1123
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,880
Yeah.
And number five was Mexicans.

1124
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,890
They were like animals in between
it. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1125
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,670
And then my black friends go, where
were we on the list? I got it.

1126
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,900
Only lists was up to 100.
Yeah.

1127
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:24,330
So they, you know, they're
pretty racist, but you know what,

1128
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:28,870
my dad's on the verge of
death. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Well,

1129
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,880
isn't that,
but that's also generational.

1130
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,970
Like I feel like, you know, we can't,
we can't shit on them. It's like,

1131
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:36,820
that's the time they came up and
it's like, what are you going to do?

1132
01:13:36,821 --> 01:13:41,040
Change a 70 year old guys
life around his brain, around

1133
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,470
you to this. I know you're about to give
birth. I know you're a couple months,

1134
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:49,540
but I know, I know, but I'm saying
like, I know you're in this thing.

1135
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,350
I know you're semi
happy in a relationship.

1136
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:58,660
Let's say you're single.
All right.

1137
01:13:58,661 --> 01:14:03,580
Take yourself to a single place. Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. It feels good. Right? And uh,

1138
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:08,680
this guy sends you a video,
would you?

1139
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,010
No. Shit. Here we go. Would you
go out, was this, would this play

1140
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,280
for you? Basically? You know,

1141
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:19,840
we call this outdoor
fuck. Okay. Walking Nate,

1142
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,540
I'm tapped out.
Come on.

1143
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,290
Oh yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1144
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,400
All right, well, hey, I saw
this as a public school.

1145
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,920
A lot acquire was in public school.

1146
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,120
Like dudes are just do this shit to you
all the time, right? Yeah. It's fucked up.

1147
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:41,600
I mean, no one monitored it back in
the day. Fuck the ground. I got to say,

1148
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:44,810
I'm just surprised. So
nasty. Uh, uh, the reaction.

1149
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:48,470
I thought it was going to be real
problem. Huh? I thought you'd go with,

1150
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:51,470
we're going to be like, what's his
number? Let me get it. It's like that.

1151
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,990
It's never worked for him.
You don't think so? No.

1152
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:59,480
You don't know that has that move
has never worked. You don't know.

1153
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:01,970
But the why does he keep doing it?
I don't know why,

1154
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,010
because I don't know why he does it all.

1155
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:08,480
Just more on my dad is a nice living room
though. It's a nice house. Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

1156
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:13,030
Oh my God. I like that. I contact her.

1157
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:17,690
Relentless. Sure. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.

1158
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,660
Yeah. That's exactly what guys did in
high school year. Yeah. Joel Green,

1159
01:15:23,661 --> 01:15:27,740
you would just flip his stick
out and yes, he, Huh? Yeah.

1160
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,880
There is a kid that would just run out
of the bathroom at my school and he would

1161
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:35,570
rub his crotch and go, Ooh, I got
a boner. Like just stuff like that.

1162
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:41,170
No, no. I actually, I'll be honest
with you, I was very, um, I'm very,

1163
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:44,090
I was pretty Christian about
my stuff. Really? Yeah.

1164
01:15:44,091 --> 01:15:46,130
Because you have to understand
in high school I was, you know,

1165
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:49,520
because I went to rehabs and stuff like
that and I, it's a low self esteem. Yeah.

1166
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:52,280
That I would never behave that way.
I was more,

1167
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:56,600
I would do all my sexual deviancy
and stuff in private, but I was,

1168
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,890
when I was out in public,

1169
01:15:57,891 --> 01:16:02,570
I was so shy and scared of
the approval disapproval of,

1170
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,720
of just people in general.
Yeah. I just wouldn't, you know,

1171
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:08,120
I wasn't outlandish in that way.
Right.

1172
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:13,140
I think a game time, you're pretty, um,
you're, you're pretty square that square.

1173
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:13,983
Yeah.
Yeah.

1174
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:18,920
It's only when I was 23 and
I started doing stand up is
when the first time I go,

1175
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:23,840
oh, this girl wants to hook up with me.
Really? But it took that long. I mean,

1176
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:28,820
I, you know, aside from the couple
of penises, I sucked as a kid. Yeah.

1177
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:31,200
Yeah. And then aside from, you know, I,

1178
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:34,460
when I was in my last
rehab in high school,

1179
01:16:34,461 --> 01:16:36,290
which is the Mcdonald's
center in La Jolla,

1180
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,960
I met a Japanese man by the name of
Donald Jasta Wachee and Donald Watch.

1181
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:45,280
He owned all this farmland in
ocean side California. Yeah.

1182
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,040
And I worked on his farm when I got
sober it my senior year in high school.

1183
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:54,320
And then one day he goes, hey, you
want to, you want to fuck, I could not,

1184
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:57,710
you know,
like let's go to Mexico.

1185
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:03,020
So he would rent out this hotel in La
Fonda. How I like Lafond yeah, right.

1186
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:04,700
The beach.
And then he would have,

1187
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:08,720
he would have clients from like Ralph's
and Vaughn's that pot vegetables from

1188
01:17:08,721 --> 01:17:09,960
him and he,

1189
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,490
I was invited and so I would sit there
with these like CEOs and like these

1190
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:18,491
people that own like with money and he
would Katelyn like just 20 women and I

1191
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:21,920
was able to choose and I was
such a hard worker. Yeah.

1192
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:25,700
That didn't have to pay for it.
Wow. You knew that was sober too?

1193
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,040
Because I was diligent about my sobriety.
Yeah.

1194
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,540
That there was like little gifts that he
would get to shout out to Daniel. What?

1195
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:35,300
Donald? Donald, he hooked it up. He
did hook it up. So did you go to town?

1196
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:39,650
I mean you were a young, sober,
like a horny kid. I mean,

1197
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:44,510
were you just like, like a rabbit? We
went through like that. Yeah. And then,

1198
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:47,510
um, we were pretty straight forward lovers
what you're saying, right? Yeah, yeah,

1199
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,080
yeah. I'm pretty straight
forward. I'm very Christian.

1200
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:54,620
Christian about bring out all of
his deviants out of him. Well,

1201
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:59,270
the reason why I fell in love with her
is because she was violent. I what?

1202
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:00,770
I was really,

1203
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,580
well, he was just really
Christian about his shit and he,

1204
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,230
he put out a completely different vibe
in the beginning where I was like,

1205
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:10,100
oh yeah, this is going to, yeah, yeah,
we'll come game time. He, you know,

1206
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:14,870
he asks permission, can I kiss
you all that bullshit in this era.

1207
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:15,710
It is.
Yeah.

1208
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,710
But you know what she did?
Was she, um, she goes,

1209
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:22,340
she smacked me in the face as hard as
you can. Really? Yeah. And then she goes,

1210
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,670
yeah. Then she goes, put your arms
around my neck, so hear me out.

1211
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,250
And then she goes,
tell me what you want to kill me.

1212
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:32,480
And this is like two weeks
in, right. What do you,

1213
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:35,240
and now this is where I expect Christina,
it'd be like red flag.

1214
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,500
Yeah. Yeah. I would have been
like six times a day someone.

1215
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:44,320
But for me it was like a spiritual
revelation. Like an awakening.

1216
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,940
Oh, I went, wow, this is
new stuff. Yeah. And then,

1217
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:52,180
but it's so funny with her is in
the beginning she was like that,

1218
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,300
but then when she started falling in
love with me, now we're Christian. Yeah,

1219
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,620
that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:01,730
Now does she ever eat your booty?
You guys ever gotten offered? Really?

1221
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,740
He's not into it. I'm not
into it. I just, you know,

1222
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,310
I'm not into giving it and Tom has
been begging me for years and I won't.

1223
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,900
Beggar well, bag is probably, he's
always making his case, but I'm like,

1224
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:18,090
it's so gamey back there. And I knew,

1225
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:22,180
you see how big of a guy he is? Yeah.
Dumps or just gnarly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1226
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:23,920
I hear them through the wall,
you know,

1227
01:19:23,921 --> 01:19:27,480
and I just can't imagine putting a mouth
on the bus because be compromised like

1228
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,970
ass. Also known as talking this
out. I mean cleaning the kitchen,

1229
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:35,170
playing the rusty trombone, anal Lingus
and Carlos sex is actually pretty simple.

1230
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:36,460
Step one,
as your partner,

1231
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:39,880
if you can any interest in me licking
your asshole the next time I go down on

1232
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:42,640
you, how would you feel if I made out
with your butt while you masturbate?

1233
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,380
I want that Lazy Maya. Yeah, right.
Her specifically. I, in fact,

1234
01:19:47,381 --> 01:19:50,790
I only want her to eat my ass. I don't
think I'd ever want, Bobby does. Yeah,

1235
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,420
I think I'm with you on that. Right. It
just doesn't seem hygienic. Hygienic is,

1236
01:19:55,421 --> 01:19:59,960
that's where you know mean disasters
happen. The crown comes out. Right.

1237
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:05,020
I think in the first year it
seemed like a novel thing to do,

1238
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,890
but after five years together,
I don't think I'd ever put,

1239
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,900
yeah, I'm not a medical
man either, but like, okay,

1240
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:17,730
so even no matter how much they wash,
correct. Right. The rim. The entrance.

1241
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:19,830
Right. Could be clean. All right.

1242
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,130
Let's suppose they like did
a little analysis and they
found 1% pool in the ring,

1243
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,570
1% probably,

1244
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:29,760
and the wrinkles and the fall and
the wrinkles in the fall with ride.

1245
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,490
The calamari part is what I like to say,
right.

1246
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:37,410
But inside the walls of the inside of the
tube may be even the little bit of the

1247
01:20:37,411 --> 01:20:42,360
entrance, but if you go like maybe a
quarter inch in right, it elevated,

1248
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,600
now you're getting 60 50% and at that
point it's to me it's like no thank you.

1249
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,330
You turned down though, you
turned down an offer, right?

1250
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:55,400
Well she stuck her finger inside
me once I'm, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1251
01:20:55,510 --> 01:21:00,030
Thank you.
And she goes like skinny,

1252
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:02,940
like Iti fingers. So that's fine. You
know what I mean? But if it was like,

1253
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:07,270
you know, Joe Rogan's to fingers, it
would be like, oh my God, that's a Dick.

1254
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:12,360
That's a date which has your
diet. I mean, we had Sushi,

1255
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:16,470
he had Sushi last night and it really
affects his diet and where he gets

1256
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:20,280
diarrhea and stuff.
I don't get that really.

1257
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,390
You said it was very runny.
No Sushi. It was just 40. And,

1258
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:29,240
and they smelled bad. Right. Do you
go to an all? You can eat Sushi.

1259
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,440
You guys go high grade, right? All right,
good, good, crazy. Come on dude. Come on.

1260
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,110
No,
we splurge.

1261
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:48,190
We go to Hamas and little
Tokyo and Gari. Yeah, like we,

1262
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,710
we spent some Duquette's

1263
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,310
top shelf, the Sushi man. Cause
you said you get Ronnie and stuff.

1264
01:21:56,311 --> 01:22:00,040
I've had maybe she stopped Nobu.

1265
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,910
It doesn't matter where I
go, the fish, but I still,

1266
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:08,850
I still go deep every time it can.

1267
01:22:08,851 --> 01:22:13,830
I tell your fans though how I
really fell in love with you? Yes.

1268
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,330
Is it weird? Not at all. So I didn't, I,
you know, I knew you guys were married.

1269
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,920
Right? But I didn't
really know him. Right.

1270
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:25,830
And so I get invited to this thing
called the, um, what's it called?

1271
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:30,240
Odd Ball comedy. Comedy disaster.
Right. And I look at the lineup,

1272
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:34,410
it's Sebastian Dane Cook, and then I
see Tom on the line. I'm like, oh cool.

1273
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:37,020
That's cool. I don't know him,
but I'm sure he's a nice, right.

1274
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,290
So when I show up at
the Berbick amp airport,

1275
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:44,580
of course we had to get our own tickets
and I'm, my manager only got me a coach,

1276
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:48,360
but everyone else got first class.
So I had a walk through the sea of life.

1277
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:51,990
And Tom was so funny because he,
when I was in coach,

1278
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:55,900
he would come back with a pillow from
first class, throw it, throw it up,

1279
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,800
which in my head I'm like,
oh, this guy's cool. Right.

1280
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:02,490
And then apparently you were supposed to,
when you landed in to it,

1281
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,590
I don't know what city it was,
Houston or whatever,

1282
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,930
you were supposed to have an arrangement,

1283
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:12,130
a car arrangement for yourself beforehand.
Of course, my people didn't do that.

1284
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,250
Right.
And so when everyone got off the plane,

1285
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:19,270
they just went straight to their
cars. And I walked out of my, Oh,

1286
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:20,860
I didn't have a guy,
I had to take a cab.

1287
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,760
But then I see Tom
standing there and he goes,

1288
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:28,600
I just make making an assumption that
you didn't get a car arrangement.

1289
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:34,450
And I got, I didn't. And he goes, well,
that's why I waited. You want to ride?

1290
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,350
And, and, and, and I'm about to cry, but

1291
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,920
I'm being real. But who does that
nice people on the man. I married

1292
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:49,960
as a comic. That is very rare
to do something like that.

1293
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:54,520
I, um, I'm selfish because I,
I also did it because honestly,

1294
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:58,840
cause I was a fan and I will, that's
ridiculous. No, it's true. It's true.

1295
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,560
I was like, I'm a Bobby Lee fan,
so yeah. But that was still like,

1296
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,980
but also that you knew that I didn't
have a ride, which is that goal.

1297
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:10,960
It's a clever of you. I put it
together. Yeah. But, um, that,

1298
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,980
and then when he did that, those
gestures in my head, I'm like, wow,

1299
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:19,450
this guy is legitimately a great guy.
He's the best. He really, really,

1300
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:23,300
he really is, right? Yeah. Yeah.
Well you're the best as well

1301
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,250
dudes in this business,
especially in Chavez,

1302
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,360
were just talking about this
at the very top of the show,

1303
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:34,240
how normal he is and how sweet he is.

1304
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,140
And I want to say this about youtube.

1305
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:40,300
I don't really recall people sets ever.

1306
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:45,690
But one time I was at the Ice House in
Pasadena and I walked into the annex.

1307
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:50,440
Right. And you were on stage and I think
you were doing new bits or whatever.

1308
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,910
But I sat there,
I was,

1309
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:55,280
you know when I walk into a room I
just kind of hear one joke. Yeah.

1310
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,490
Paul was so fucking funny.

1311
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:02,530
Then I sat there for like 20 minutes
and I had to go up in the other room.

1312
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:05,950
I said, fuck it. I gotta watch this
girl. She's fucking amazing. Right.

1313
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:11,190
So do you two together as a wonderful
thanks buddy for striking you guys.

1314
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:15,130
My smokes a man. You're
very sweet, but no,

1315
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,430
but know you guys are sweet people.
That's all we try.

1316
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,650
Well you don't like compliments? No,
I think it's very nice. I'm, I'm a,

1317
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:24,310
I think it's very,
I think you're a hundred percent accurate.

1318
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,980
I've never heard a bad word about you.
Like there are people in this,

1319
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:31,420
you hear stories like that
as if I can douche bag.

1320
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,760
Have you ever heard anybody say
anything bad about Bobby law?

1321
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,770
So I have some enemies that
term at all. They do. They,

1322
01:25:38,771 --> 01:25:41,890
if you just talking to the wrong people,
well first of all,

1323
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:45,410
I'd love to find those people. I could
tell you who those people are. Oh,

1324
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:48,940
give me their number. Well, I
want to hear them talk shit.

1325
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,250
But there are people out there that
dentists that they don't like me.

1326
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:56,200
You know what it is though. Can I
just say this? This is what Mitzi,

1327
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:59,210
Mitzi always said to me.
You know, you, you, you,

1328
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,620
you to become a star.
Yeah.

1329
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:06,890
You kind of have to both people that love
you and people that hate you. Oh, 100%.

1330
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:07,724
Right?
Yeah.

1331
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:12,500
And so I'm not really good at trolls
and people like ripping me apart like I

1332
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:16,220
want to show. Right. And, and you
know, when the show premiered,

1333
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:20,120
people on Twitter were like,
um, you're a terrible actor.

1334
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:24,530
And as a comic, you know, you,
you're a little paranoid when you,

1335
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:29,210
I do acting work and ask her, I get
really paranoid. Sure. I know. And I've,

1336
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,480
I've done movies, I've been
on a lot of shows, but still,

1337
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:37,160
I don't really have the confidence
yet to say I'm a good actor. Right.

1338
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:42,050
I'm passable and I've been, I've been
series regular on things, so it's fine.

1339
01:26:42,051 --> 01:26:43,910
I know how to do it,
but it's like,

1340
01:26:43,911 --> 01:26:48,020
so it's very like difficult for me
to read bad things. But you know,

1341
01:26:48,021 --> 01:26:51,590
in many ways it's just inevitably
going to happen and I just got to,

1342
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,180
I have to grow past it. Yeah. It's, it is
tough to read horrible things about you.

1343
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,170
I mean, who likes that? No,

1344
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:01,070
but don't you find that the longer
you do this and you know, I mean,

1345
01:27:01,071 --> 01:27:05,030
I'm sure you experienced it too because
you come into it from not having

1346
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:05,893
probably a lot of it

1347
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,930
public three weeks ago.

1348
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:12,630
Oh yeah. Tell him I think it's
even worse for me because I don't,

1349
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,493
I'm not,

1350
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:18,570
I'm trying to break in the industry at
all whatsoever and I just do a podcast

1351
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:22,740
with him. So I'm, um, a few weeks ago,

1352
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,130
some guy decided to take something out
of context about me and it became like

1353
01:27:26,131 --> 01:27:30,930
the number one thing on Reddit and the
headline was Bobby Lee's wife admits to

1354
01:27:30,931 --> 01:27:35,610
being with him only for his money. First
of all, I'm not married to this bitch.

1355
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:39,790
Yeah. And I can tell them, I can sell.

1356
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,260
It's not going to happen. Yeah, it is.

1357
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:46,200
But that's all I'll ever be reduced to
is that because it's not like I could

1358
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:50,160
ever out credit that Internet,
you know what I mean?

1359
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:51,510
Like I could never,
yeah.

1360
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,110
Yeah, you will. You can. And you will.
If you want to like it, it'll disappear.

1361
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:59,260
First of all, it being not
rooted in truth that you will,

1362
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:04,320
uh, out credit that, that claim
that's just internet, uh, gossip.

1363
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:08,400
You know, it's like, it doesn't, it
doesn't, it's not like a valid source.

1364
01:28:08,401 --> 01:28:11,030
It's somebody saying something and,
right.

1365
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,050
And so the guy ended up writing this
long essay of an email apologizing for

1366
01:28:16,051 --> 01:28:20,520
using click baity headline
and like, you know, but,

1367
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:21,760
but she lost sleep,
sleep

1368
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,290
over it. It was a devastating
time. I should blood for a
week over there. Yeah. No,

1369
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:29,890
I really did. That's
terrible. Well, no, I know.

1370
01:28:29,891 --> 01:28:34,180
I listen in the beginning it's you very
sensitive to it and then you'll get used

1371
01:28:34,181 --> 01:28:36,840
to the venom and the poison.
Don't you prove it?

1372
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:40,660
How it used to it a little more?
Yeah. Do you guys get that?

1373
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:44,830
I feel like you're just the most likable.
My, my, my thing is just not reading it.

1374
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:46,660
Oh Shit. Yeah. Yeah. It
helps not to read it.

1375
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,090
Don't fucking look like if
someone had told me, hey,

1376
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:51,640
there's this reddit thing and I'd
be like, great, I'm not looking,

1377
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:55,480
I don't even read comments on like
Instagram posts. You learn to do that.

1378
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:58,060
I don't read anything,
so therefore I don't get hurt.

1379
01:28:58,090 --> 01:29:01,080
Definitely stay away from youtube
comments. Don't even look at it. Yeah,

1380
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,130
know you don't want to know

1381
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:07,320
if you've looked it up. There's like nine
pages of how terrible I am. Oh my God.

1382
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:10,500
I used to be, you know, and I
used to read them. Oh No, no one,

1383
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,250
I haven't checked in 10 years or
whatever. But it's like, you know,

1384
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,820
let's take a wipe subject myself to
that. Yeah, exactly. It was much easier.

1385
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:19,580
Oh I hurt.
Okay.

1386
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,600
But it was much easier in like the
eighties and nineties or sixties yeah,

1387
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:29,160
of course a comedian because like you
could be on a show, you could be terrible,

1388
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:30,120
but where are you going to read it?

1389
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:33,930
No one says anything or they have to
write a letter and send it to the network

1390
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:37,570
and you're never going to see it.
All the, the studio or whatever.

1391
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,110
Much easier with that.
So great.

1392
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,960
Have you realize these are people
that are unhappy with their own lives?

1393
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,270
Whoever started that about you.
It's not about you.

1394
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:48,930
They're just looking for a target
somewhere to put their anger and rage.

1395
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:52,800
And maybe this person's jealous of
you and your beauty and your happy or

1396
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:56,180
whatever the fuck. And it's not, and
not even to do with you man. Yeah,

1397
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,810
you're right on them
because the thing about it,

1398
01:29:57,811 --> 01:30:01,090
would you start a reddit about
someone you didn't even know? No.

1399
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:04,410
About a fucking pot? No. Cause you're
not, you're not a miserable can't,

1400
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:09,140
this person's a miserable, can't
heal. But what makes people let,

1401
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:13,500
let me just say that we wish, she said,
I know, but it's, you know, you know

1402
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:15,730
it's going to hurt somebody's feelings,

1403
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:19,330
but usually they don't think that she's
a person. That's why they're always like,

1404
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,130
there's a level of disconnect,
right?

1405
01:30:21,131 --> 01:30:24,310
So you don't feel like that talking about
Bobby, the guy sitting in front of me,

1406
01:30:24,311 --> 01:30:28,600
it's a guy who was on mad TV,
a big TV show.

1407
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,200
They don't think of you as,
as a real person. Right.

1408
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:36,210
And you think about you are not in a good
place if you spend time creating that

1409
01:30:38,711 --> 01:30:42,820
out there. In other words, if you're happy
with like what you're doing, your life,

1410
01:30:42,821 --> 01:30:47,230
your dating, you don't go like, I'm
going to take time out of my day.

1411
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:50,700
Ruined this girl's getting life.
You know what I mean? Like, so it's,

1412
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:53,620
it's people who are in a
place that they're not happy.

1413
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:57,190
You channel energy into that.
And it's like if you were happy,

1414
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,270
you don't have time to do that. You
don't have any desire to do that. Yeah.

1415
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:01,590
If you didn't care for somebody

1416
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,060
podcast or work, you would just go,
I don't want to listen to this. Yeah.

1417
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,980
And then you click off all you
would do. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Does it make sense?

1418
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:12,780
It's illogical and I think it would be
easier if we knew who they were too.

1419
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,250
It's like you don't want to know.

1420
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:19,230
I don't want to know who it was. The
reality is you'd be like, oh wow.

1421
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,840
Like this is a pathetic, no, we

1422
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:26,310
get out who it was and what the
shy look she did research did,

1423
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:31,420
went down the rabbit hole and we asked
her fans to find him and they found him.

1424
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,120
They found him. And then um, he
wanted to come on the podcast.

1425
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:40,770
No, he wanted to be plugged his
own youtube comedy channel. Was it?

1426
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,510
Cause he's a troll. See he's
trying to profit off of it. Have

1427
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,920
you, that's, you know,

1428
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:49,950
they always say that thing that the person
that espouses that hate is actually,

1429
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,440
they love you and don't
know how to say it.

1430
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:57,390
You know somebody that that is obsessed
with you saying negative shit is

1431
01:31:57,391 --> 01:31:59,980
actually somebody that
kind has like a crush

1432
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,810
on. You don't know how to channel
it so they go negative, you know,

1433
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,210
comfortable with saying like,
I think you're the best.

1434
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:11,800
The opposite of love isn't hate,
it's indifference. Same coin.

1435
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:16,840
They're just haters going, hey girl, I
got extorted for money on our podcast.

1436
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,630
You actually blackmailed, you paid. No,

1437
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,690
but they said if you
don't send us 15 grand,

1438
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,430
we're going to put this thing out that
I already said on the podcast that's

1439
01:32:27,431 --> 01:32:32,170
already out there. Right. And so I
just ignored it for weeks. Right.

1440
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:34,950
We got a bunch of emails,
put it out.

1441
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:40,620
But then what happened was I got a
commercial and I was on the commercial,

1442
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:45,910
like just sitting there and the
lawyers came up to me and said,

1443
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:46,930
can we talk to you a second?

1444
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:51,340
And I'm sending that sitting next to it
with Jane Lynch because this is her and

1445
01:32:51,341 --> 01:32:52,390
I in the commercial,
right.

1446
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,500
It was before like some good money and
I go outside like what's matter because

1447
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:58,660
we've got a complaint from you.

1448
01:32:58,661 --> 01:33:03,490
It was that same person that was gay
went out of their way to call the ad

1449
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:05,230
agency.
Right.

1450
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:09,610
And to prohibit me from
participating in the commercial.

1451
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:12,070
Will you give me that face for,
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

1452
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:15,970
Did it actually stop you from
doing the commercial? No, they go,

1453
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:19,630
you know what's so great? They said,
you know what, we're just kind of,

1454
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,920
I mean we did get the complaint,

1455
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:24,850
but we will also want to say that we
vetted you and we know that you see crazy

1456
01:33:24,851 --> 01:33:28,750
things and that, so you know, you're
doing a great job for our commercial.

1457
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:31,810
We love you and thank you. Oh Great.
What's that? I don't know what that is.

1458
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,450
Our nanny texting me back about our child,

1459
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:41,020
but people go to great lengths to
fuck you on this thing. Yeah, man.

1460
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,950
I feel like it should
be a separate diagnosis.

1461
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:49,690
I think that the whole science of trolls
is really interesting and I think it

1462
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:51,370
should be like a new,
um,

1463
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,880
diagnosis and psychology
because they're faceless.

1464
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:59,881
But there are like dads and regular
people who really live in inside the

1465
01:34:00,911 --> 01:34:04,420
Internet. There's somebody
doing that right now who
probably teaches at a school.

1466
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:08,890
Exactly right. Yeah.
Taking it out. Well, it's,

1467
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:11,950
when you think about it, it's such an
easy outlet. I'm angry. I'm pissed off.

1468
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:15,250
I'm just going to throw my hate
towards a stranger. Of course.

1469
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:20,640
Where's your baby inside? Oh,
you're a baby. I don't know.

1470
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:24,610
I'm in the crate with the dogs. Right.
Good. Lock him up. Who has the baby?

1471
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:32,530
Okay. It's, this is not your
first baby. This is your
second baby, right? I think so.

1472
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,100
It'll be honest. You
have another baby, right?

1473
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,050
Having his lunch pretty soon.
But does he speak English and stuff?

1474
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,830
He does like mostly Korean,
but he has like, he has,

1475
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:52,420
he's a boy. Yeah. Christina. Tom
said that your ex was um, Asian,

1476
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,070
Chinese. Was he like the handsome
Asian or was he one of these

1477
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,860
dairy?
I didn't even know it.

1478
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:04,694
What does she say?

1479
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:10,900
She said what was he a handsome good
looking at one of these are one of these.

1480
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,100
I'm broken. I got fucked
up. He's very only Bible.

1481
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:20,000
He's clearly,
he didn't have facial hair.

1482
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:23,870
He couldn't grow it like that. Well,
there you go. Are you going to do the

1483
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:31,500
no. Seriously. What? Can you grow
a beard? Can you grow a full beard?

1484
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,950
Yeah.
I wanted to look like him.

1485
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:39,910
I already told you my look. Right? In 10
years you're going to do the full beard.

1486
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,960
Going to do a full beard, right? Yeah.
My hair's receding like yours. I've got,

1487
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,100
I know,

1488
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:49,280
but I'm going to grow the sides out to
my shoulders and the have the beard and

1489
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:52,340
I'm going to have these like weird
like doctor strange glove glasses.

1490
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:56,570
I like this idea and I want to wear
Hawaiian shirts only open. Yeah.

1491
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:01,900
I want to be really Tan. Most every. Yeah.

1492
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:05,210
That's the plan. Yeah. I like
your hair this length. It's,
it's good. God bless you.

1493
01:36:05,211 --> 01:36:05,820
It's quite nice.

1494
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:09,770
You want to see somebody trying to scare
someone and they scare the wrong person.

1495
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,680
I think it's pretty great.
Okay.

1496
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:20,970
Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.

1497
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,593
Ah,

1498
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:36,210
oh my God. That's so funny. Oh my God.

1499
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:40,720
It makes me sad. That was
me. What would you do?

1500
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:44,140
I go crazy.
Yeah,

1501
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:53,950
I hate that shit. There'll be a,
there'll be a problem. Houses.

1502
01:36:53,951 --> 01:36:57,690
I don't like it. She used to do that
on an houses. No, she used to like hi.

1503
01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:02,350
Like I'd come home and she'd hide
and you jump out and then tape it.

1504
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:05,670
I remember you did it like two
or three times and post it.

1505
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:11,110
I did you post it over one time. She
posted that. But she has a heart.

1506
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:14,400
She has a heart problem so I can't do it.
Oh,

1507
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:18,280
that's not fair because if I do
a back she could die. No socks.

1508
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:24,450
Yeah. Nobody answer your question. He was
a handsome, very handsome, a Chinese guy.

1509
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:28,740
He was, I met him. Sweet guy.
Super Smart, super everything.

1510
01:37:28,741 --> 01:37:33,720
Korean girl friends are saying Chinese
men are the way to go with husbands. Yeah.

1511
01:37:33,721 --> 01:37:36,460
Yes. Not saying she made the
wrong. Tom's the best dressed.

1512
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,700
But here's the problem with
the Chinese guy. I dated,

1513
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,030
we were together for four years. So we
were serious. We were living together.

1514
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:46,950
And then um, there was the, that whole
idea of taking care of the whole family,

1515
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,960
taking care of mom and dad and everybody.

1516
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:51,750
So I think that that put a strain on him.

1517
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,040
He was really stressed out and I knew
that if we had a family that like our

1518
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:58,110
children would never be number one.
You know what I mean?

1519
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,230
He was always taking care of mom and dad,
the sisters and the,

1520
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,280
it's part of the culture.

1521
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:08,370
But how did you meet him though?
Because I knew her when they were dating,

1522
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,340
so we were all that's right.

1523
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:13,290
Open micros and then she would
show up when she'd be like,

1524
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,280
here's my Chinese boyfriend and be like,
hi. How are you liking it? Yeah. Yeah.

1525
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:20,080
It's all is just to, trainees
gets a fetish. Do you like it?

1526
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:24,830
But did they break up before you made the
moves or did you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1527
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:29,500
I got like, yeah, I got a phone call.
Like she's single swoop in there. Yeah.

1528
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:32,520
Yeah. But did you like him when
you were dating the Chinese guy?

1529
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:35,500
Uh, I was, uh, I liked
him as a person. Yeah.

1530
01:38:35,501 --> 01:38:38,430
I didn't have like crushes or nothing.
Yeah.

1531
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:42,560
But then I always liked Tom because
he was so mature. Like when he,

1532
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:47,080
I met him when he was 23 and I was 26.
Yeah. And he was just like a man, like he,

1533
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:51,190
he would carry it himself like a grown
ass man. And he was so funny at 23,

1534
01:38:51,191 --> 01:38:54,490
like Tom Ziglar has never
not been good at stand out.

1535
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:58,120
Like the first time he did it, he was
fucking amazing. And so I always was like,

1536
01:38:58,121 --> 01:39:00,820
that guy is so special.
Like you were so special.

1537
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:05,670
I remember, um, that I
would go to your, uh,

1538
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:09,240
that you use to run your show.
Tangier and those fellows. Yeah.

1539
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:13,990
And like you were, you were the boss
lady at at that thing. Yeah, she was,

1540
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:18,960
she was in charge. So you had,
I mean, you weren't just doing,

1541
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:23,700
um, I always felt like, you know, when
you, when you fart, when you start doing,

1542
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:28,670
you fart the first time, uh, when
you part, when you're doing standup.

1543
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:33,000
That's funny. Yeah. No. And
you start standing up and
you're like, oh, this lady is,

1544
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,470
she's running shows. And I was, I was
almost intimidated. You know what I mean?

1545
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:42,560
Yeah. Because you go like, oh,
you're like a gatekeeper also. Yeah.

1546
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:45,360
She's trying to make a buck, actually.
Yeah. I was trying to get out of,

1547
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,470
we're going, we're going to day job.
Was this after MTV and all that? Yeah.

1548
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:53,780
That happened in like 98 or
99 and I graduated and then

1549
01:39:53,930 --> 01:39:55,640
yeah,
I started saying so funny that you,

1550
01:39:55,641 --> 01:39:58,850
and you know who's similar to that
as the Oh yes. Yeah, but you guys,

1551
01:39:58,851 --> 01:40:02,540
it's so funny because you guys come
from that world that was like earlier in

1552
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:07,100
your life, but you guys are legitimately
comedians and like legitimately funny.

1553
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:11,150
It's so long ago, like 20 years
ago. But it's hard to, I can't, I,

1554
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:15,410
I believe it's difficult to
reinvent yourself in that way. Yeah.

1555
01:40:15,411 --> 01:40:20,240
It took a break of that history.
It's like for me, I was on mad TV,

1556
01:40:20,241 --> 01:40:23,780
so it's kind of along those same lines
of stand up, right? It's the same lane,

1557
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,030
but for you guys it's like,
wow,

1558
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:30,410
you guys were really transcended the
theory that I was only able to date her

1559
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:35,210
because I didn't watch.
Oh, stop it. Absolutely.

1560
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:39,650
If you had been on one of the shows
that like if you were on one of the real

1561
01:40:39,651 --> 01:40:44,480
worlds that I watched and then
I'm like, oh, I think I would've,

1562
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,060
I would've kept my distance.
In other words,

1563
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:51,620
you're like all those tricks, but here's
the thing. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't great.

1564
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:54,040
It wasn't like a puck.
Like I barely was

1565
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,420
on the fucking thing cause I kept
my distance weird. Just just um,

1566
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:02,470
feeling like, oh yeah, I, you know,
I feel like I know her. It's weird.

1567
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:07,810
Like she is, I just know,
you know, not played out.

1568
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:11,980
She's, I knew you're out there can deck.
So yeah, that's what it sounds like.

1569
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:18,320
Hey. Yeah. I know you had quite the
resume when it came to that. So good.

1570
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:20,860
I mean you were over there in Australia.

1571
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,200
No,
it's true though,

1572
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:26,500
because I did really work against me when
I tried to get an agent because a bag

1573
01:41:26,501 --> 01:41:29,390
then reality TV, we were
in the dumpster. Yeah.

1574
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:34,270
People thought of us as like just used up
fucking porn stars. Really? We weren't,

1575
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:36,970
you were considered shit. So, yeah. Now,

1576
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:41,530
now you can have an entire brand
and be an a, a reality personality.

1577
01:41:41,531 --> 01:41:45,970
But back then we were really bottom of
the barrel. Even with me too though. Yeah.

1578
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:46,360
Because

1579
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,910
when I got off a mad, I remembered a
perfect segue, but it's odd because I,

1580
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:55,500
I remember there was a movie called
dinner with smucks. Yeah, yeah.

1581
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:59,800
Steve Carell. Right. And so Ken
Joan got offered a role. Yeah.

1582
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:04,900
But then he couldn't do it scheduling
wise. So in my head I'm like, Oh shit.

1583
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:09,310
Well he can't do it. I'm going to get in
and the casters or wouldn't even see me.

1584
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,960
And I go, we'll tell them why. And
they go, cause he was on mad TV. Oh,

1585
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:18,380
he's like a clown. Yeah.
He's not real. Wow. Right.

1586
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,130
So, um, I had it, I had to,

1587
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:25,870
there was a bunch of movies like that
where I couldn't even get in because of

1588
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:30,130
perception. They say it's a perception
thing. Yeah. It takes a while.

1589
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:31,420
It takes a while.
And,

1590
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:36,460
but what happened was because of the
success of key and Peele Barron halts will

1591
01:42:38,801 --> 01:42:43,420
sass. So to a degree, all these guys,
they've shaken that meant mad TV,

1592
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:48,160
you know? So I think it's helped now
things are great, but it took me a little,

1593
01:42:48,161 --> 01:42:51,280
very long time. Do you feel like
there's too many Asians working today?

1594
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:58,720
Well, you know, the thing is, is that, let
me say something to you and then there's,

1595
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:02,930
what were you about to say? Oh No, no way.
I was going to say is this though, is,

1596
01:43:02,931 --> 01:43:06,160
is that you have a point there?
What do you mean?

1597
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:10,000
What's my point in May?
I'm,

1598
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:13,450
I've never been threatened
of other Asian actors. I,

1599
01:43:13,451 --> 01:43:17,560
when Steven Yeun was on walking dead,
I was so happy cause he's number one,

1600
01:43:17,561 --> 01:43:18,490
he doesn't have an accident.

1601
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:23,250
Number two is handsome and he's dating a
white girl in it or whatever. Amen. And,

1602
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:26,920
um, I know him, he's a really
nice guy. You know, I'm happy.

1603
01:43:26,921 --> 01:43:28,690
But you know,

1604
01:43:28,691 --> 01:43:33,100
when you have more Asians but you have
the same amount of opportunity as you did

1605
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:37,800
10 15 years ago, then it becomes
hard. I see there's more, yeah,

1606
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:39,520
yeah.
Same amount of slots,

1607
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:42,670
but let the same amount of opportunity
or more opportunity you're think,

1608
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:45,620
I think there's a little bit
more opportunity for us, but, um,

1609
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:49,360
there's a lot more of us. Right.
And you know, and also you're not,

1610
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:52,460
I'm not getting younger,
right? I'm getting old,

1611
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:54,470
but I'm so isn't the answer there though,

1612
01:43:54,471 --> 01:43:58,700
or the solution to kind of get
rid of some Asian people? Yeah.

1613
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,400
Yeah, yeah. How do you do that? What
you're saying? How did you do that?

1614
01:44:02,690 --> 01:44:04,610
There's no way to do it.
Yeah. Just kick them out.

1615
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:09,860
The more the merrier to be honest with
you. Build that wall. So here is, um,

1616
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,430
two deaf people, the pass
gas real quick. Okay.

1617
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:18,770
Is this real?
Why would you put this in here?

1618
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:24,170
Can I get you really just foreign isn't
the next round when he really stay there

1619
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:28,730
for a while. I don't want to smell that
I'm pregnant. I'll fucking BARF. Smell.

1620
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:30,681
What are you eating?

1621
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,380
You're eating Kimchi or eating
all kinds of fucking nasty shit.

1622
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:39,000
And you're Korean food. Does he
eat Korean food? Do you eat wild?

1623
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:40,693
You know what I mean?
Like

1624
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:47,840
the silkworms. No Korean food. I go,

1625
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:52,220
I go high class with that shit. Where'd
he go? I'm a fancy Korean. Are you? Yeah.

1626
01:44:52,221 --> 01:44:55,250
I'm not like working class.
Correct. You're going to take
us, we talked about this.

1627
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:55,981
Yeah.
I told you whatever.

1628
01:44:55,981 --> 01:45:00,980
You want to have any good ones around
the one in the valley that's decent.

1629
01:45:00,981 --> 01:45:05,120
Yeah. The Korean barbecue,
like dinner spot, like fancy
spa. I go to a place called,

1630
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:10,160
I want to say what it's called.
Yeah. We've been there once.

1631
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:12,110
I was trying to tell
him that we used to go,

1632
01:45:12,111 --> 01:45:16,310
we had that joint in k town when
we lived there on sixth street.

1633
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:17,121
I forget the name.

1634
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:21,570
I forget what it was
really Grand Kimchi trough.

1635
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:24,980
You know when they put the Kimchi and
then the meat juices go into the Kimchi.

1636
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:25,490
I really like,

1637
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:28,960
is it that little mini mall where there's
a seven 11 and all that stuff? Yeah.

1638
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,640
Is it?
Yeah.

1639
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:35,830
I used to go there with the lady
would like the lady ate garlic.

1640
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:38,300
All the flight attendant would
call it late at night. Yeah. Yeah.

1641
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,290
I don't know if this is the same. Sorry.
I'd have to check. Yeah, there's a lot.

1642
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:45,900
I mean, you know all about parks.
You go there on Vermont. No,

1643
01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:51,950
John's great. Late at night.
She's great. We go there a lot.

1644
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:55,650
He spit that shit when you're there.
What do you mean? Like if, uh,

1645
01:45:55,680 --> 01:46:00,280
if it's an authentic Korean joint, do
you drop it on him? Well, I can see it.

1646
01:46:00,281 --> 01:46:04,410
Like pop Duke is your sale.
Yeah. So can we have to rise?

1647
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:05,793
Uh,

1648
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:10,640
I can say Dr Gco going
to be stuff like that.

1649
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:13,650
How about dammit mother fucker. Do
you know how to do all that? No.

1650
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:18,440
I only know how to do like sexual stuff.
Like what? Like go to which that penis.

1651
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,200
Oh,
don't go mark butthole.

1652
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:24,560
Don't Jut is breast bogey is a vagina.

1653
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,180
Dong is shit.

1654
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:31,240
Don't bungalows far Pungo
and Chinese Pigou. Yeah,

1655
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:36,000
yeah, yeah. That's all I
remember. And then I know, um, um,

1656
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:41,270
[inaudible] which is the n word.
Once more,

1657
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:42,104
please

1658
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:49,980
don't say it. Don't say it like that. It's

1659
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:54,570
unconscionable
words.

1660
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:01,230
All right. The show is tiger
belly. It is a weekly podcast.

1661
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:05,480
It's a, you can download it every week
for having us on was this device, was it?

1662
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:10,040
I thought we had a good time. What
did a great job chemistry. No, we got,

1663
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:12,420
you guys need to come back.
And I did. This was good.

1664
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:16,500
We should go to Korean dinner. Let's
do this. Let this be a couples thing.

1665
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,430
So let's do it again. Uh, it
was podcast for sure. Again,

1666
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:25,090
let's give dinner and at dinner I want
you to reveal more Bobby. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1667
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:29,670
now I feel like I can really learn from
you about being kind to your partner.

1668
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:36,420
I feel like he is such an antagonistic
type of person that if I come hard or on

1669
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:40,320
the offense, yeah, he just rains
down. Can I tell you something?

1670
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,750
That's your dynamic and it is.

1671
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:46,570
You need to keep that a provocation
and antagonistic side too.

1672
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:51,120
You're absolutely, and give him
shit. That is what makes us look,

1673
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:53,610
you guys are happy, but he
likes don't. Yeah, he likes it.

1674
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,950
I feel like if I were to be
like a meek librarian though,

1675
01:47:57,630 --> 01:48:00,480
he would have broken up with me four
years ago. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

1676
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:03,960
If I don't crunch his balls on a daily,
here you go. It makes it stick hard.

1677
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:06,480
Makes us tick. How long have you
guys been together? Five years. Yeah.

1678
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:10,470
So that makes her Schmeichel hard. That's
it. So it's whatever fucking tickles.

1679
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:15,420
I know with him, if I get abrasive and
Shitty, that's it's not good for us.

1680
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:18,750
The bare likes nice pets
and treats and stroke.

1681
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:21,840
I take care of my bare that way.

1682
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:24,900
That's my natural inclination
is to be kind and nurturing.

1683
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:27,590
But he doesn't know how to repeat
doing. Yeah, it was a comic too.

1684
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,180
So there's a fair amount of ball bus.

1685
01:48:29,181 --> 01:48:33,910
Don't forget talking about a
real math head here. So, well,

1686
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:37,500
comedians also don't like intimacy.
It's very hard for us to trust.

1687
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:42,270
There's no cuddling, there's no
beg for it. Check out tiger belly.

1688
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:44,960
I'm going to plug a couple of things.
Yeah. Where else? Tiger Valley.

1689
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:49,170
I'm on a Sitcom called splitting up
together. Nine 30 ABC Tuesday night.

1690
01:48:49,171 --> 01:48:52,320
Wonderful. And then, um, that's it.

1691
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:54,600
You're going to have to hook up to
college football games. You know that.

1692
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:59,730
What does that mean? Because we'll talk
off. Okay. So, um, yeah, tiger belly.

1693
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,150
What's the show called? Splitting
up together. Putting them together.

1694
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:06,780
Thank you for a, I love that sky. Great
time. What a delight. All right, we'll uh,

1695
01:49:06,781 --> 01:49:08,940
we'll see you guys next week.
Thanks for listening

1696
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:12,520
Elizabeth. I'm fucked up. You got good.

1697
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,880
Got Away

1698
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:25,730
with that way.

1699
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:36,350
I have a vague idea what
you were just talking about.

1700
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:43,130
How could you miss this?
He got a sword. Shit.

1701
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,583
Mom's house.

1702
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:52,130
Do you better watch out for popped out
the motherfucking knock out real when at

1703
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:57,100
your mom's house.
You Better Watch out.

1704
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:01,440
He called up to pop out cause he
loves the most fucking knock out.

1705
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:06,220
Know what I mean? And you
know what I'm saying? We what?

1706
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:11,400
Know what I'm saying? What you're saying.
All right. What you mean when you ride?

1707
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:13,720
No,
stay in your home.

1708
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,630
When you see me in the streets

1709
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:22,590
for the phone with the top dog.
No Buck.

1710
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:27,070
It's trying to be your mom's phone

1711
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:30,540
shipped.

1712
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:35,540
Probably not spitting all the times and
all you other motherfuckers fall enough.

1713
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:40,260
They're like, what's up?
What? The jeans. The jeans was

1714
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:46,270
a loose and got fucked up,
saves my boxes,

1715
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:50,290
trying to stack this cash to my bill.

1716
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:52,450
Fold won't fall twice
as fast as for Christ.

1717
01:50:52,451 --> 01:50:57,451
He says he can't vocalize to a local guy
who got fried with the wrap on a track.

1718
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:01,990
Like
it ain't no surprise,

1719
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,140
but the wax of the pig,
I'm gonna fill out like a motherfucker.

1720
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:08,320
Put some respect on Monday

1721
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:14,800
and I don't mean no direction at all.
Feeling like Steven Seagal.

1722
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:17,380
Linkedin itself will shit,

1723
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:25,000
Bro.
You know where I'm at,

1724
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:29,840
right? The fuck. Why I
need to be Bob's house.

1725
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,520
You Better Watch out.
Hold up.

1726
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:38,530
Popped out crazy blogs to my fucking
knock out real scowling at your mom's

1727
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:40,950
house.
Tell you that he better watch out

1728
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:45,300
because he loves the
motherfucking fucking knock out.

1729
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,470
And you know what I'm saying?
You Ain't

1730
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:55,630
know what I'm saying. What you saying?
What you mean when you're riding them them

1731
01:51:58,990 --> 01:52:00,460
when you see me in the streets.
