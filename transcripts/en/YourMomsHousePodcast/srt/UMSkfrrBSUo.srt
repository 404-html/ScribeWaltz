4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,583
Christina,

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,840
did it have bat bit up, up skidded at
sketch, sketch, sketch. I ended up,

6
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,390
you know I was on the Graham last
week and you texted it to him?

7
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:43,470
I did and there was a woman on there
to me now so I can just pull it.

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,430
Let me find it is terrible.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,670
There's a woman who got
some kind of an award,

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,080
like a grammy nomination for scatting.
Not throwing her shit in someone's face.

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,860
Scott play is when you play it.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,880
That's a different game hoopoe but it was,

13
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,100
it's probably the most annoying
thing you've ever seen.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,590
I have to search through here.
I don't know Tommy.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,520
It's really great how you don't have
this ready already is just beyond me.

16
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:13,840
You know?
This is what the show's about babe.

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,190
What do you like best about listening
to somebody scan? I mean it's just like,

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,090
I just feel it in me. [inaudible] up it
up. I'd be, oh here she is. Here she is.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,060
You email it to me? Yeah. Hold
on. Yeah. What a fucking it,

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,580
it kind of feels to me like a racket,
like come on.

21
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:35,530
It's not really a talent. To me it
feels like someone is really hard.

22
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,490
I just emailed her insides hurts
everything. Well, it's not real.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,210
It's not singing and it's not
rapping. It's scatting, right? Yeah.

24
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:47,690
So it's like here I,
she's like,

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,840
I just feel it. I don't have
to write it, but if I did

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,530
set it,
how has that a talent?

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,460
If you don't have to write it and you
don't have to really learn how to do it,

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,840
we just did it.
Yeah.

29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,793
Ski.

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,080
Well Bart, like it's, Oh God, there
she is. She's got, and it's an NPR.

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,380
Yeah. Grammy nominated jazz
vocalists, Jazz. Mia Horn.

32
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,540
Scatting is more than a technique.

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,950
It's a means to honor her and ancestry
and empower herself in the moment.

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,590
Oh my God.
Okay.

35
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,950
I'm a greater stage is mine.
You ready to,

36
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:28,220
you ready to hear my favorite form of
music that exists? Yeah. All right.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,073
Here we go.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,593
Okay.

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,630
Think about a horn player.

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,340
I just become a horn player.
That did do date.

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,920
It's called a kid called
scanning improvisation,

42
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:49,750
but 10 times because they give out
a whole body is the instrument.

43
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,933
I mean

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,180
for me it's important because my ancestors
did it and they had a reason behind

45
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,920
doing what they did.
They didn't have horns.

46
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,620
The reason couldn't afford cool shit.
Yeah, I know, boy. Oh come on now.

47
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,560
It goes to like a fun Jesus.
They will. It's on Instagram.

48
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,730
I don't think about a horn player
B.

49
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,710
Did I just get scared and you got the
grammy num cause I don't know if I could

50
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,401
do that with a horn.

51
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,370
I think if you gave me a horn and he told
me to imitate the horn, I'll be like,

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,293
I don't know how to do this.

53
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,580
You have somebody give a try and go
cause that's a talent is what I can go.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,193
I'm a horn.

55
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,340
My ancestors didn't have horns and a,

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,150
even though I could go get one
now I want to be like them.

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,650
You know my ancestors didn't
have either running water. Yeah,

58
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,510
they didn't have electricity. Sanitation.
We had to do stuff the old way roofs.

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,220
None of it beds, but that's
the old way, Yada, Yada.
Preserve the cool stuff, right.

60
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,600
It's the worst is when someone was like,

61
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:07,530
but people used to do this and
they didn't have what you have now.

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,330
That's why he did that. She's like, yeah,
I don't need the horn. I am the horn. No,

63
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:15,780
you're not, but you're not the horn.
You know, you're not. Honestly,

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,290
I don't even like the way the
horn plays just by itself.

65
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,180
I don't like that shit either. I mean,
I like jazz, but even when I hear a lot,

66
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,460
I'm like, oh my God, my
head's going to explode.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,540
One of my friends likes free flowing.
Oh my God,

68
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,560
Jess sessions.

69
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,543
Oh,

70
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,130
and especially when, I don't know
how you wash that. You're like, man,

71
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,360
he's one of those guys like, Oh yeah, I
really loses himself in it, and I'm like,

72
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:52,360
yeah, he lost me to mission
accomplished now. Damn. Yeah. I mean,

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,360
I know there's talent. There's clearly
a lot of skill involved in that stuff,

74
00:04:56,361 --> 00:05:01,310
but for me it just gives me anxiety
listening to it. Yeah, that's pretty bad.

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,090
Good night through a proper show.
Open. What are we doing here? Let me,

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,280
hold on. Let me do the horns for
it. Yeah, you want to do the, Oh,

77
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:15,190
you went to your mom's house horns.
Why don't you to all the instruments.

78
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,293
Welcome.

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,540
How's really good. Thank you Jesus. My
ancestors taught me. Yeah. Here we go.

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,010
Here.
Here you go.

81
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,283
Up Top.

82
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,950
We explain to me why I could eat for it.

83
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,000
If you eat,

84
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,430
eat 10 mother fucking peaks

85
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,950
up consuming as much
as the speaks of pork.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,890
Oh,
is Randy

87
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,910
[inaudible]. Well, welcome.

88
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,960
We'll go to your mom's house
for us,

89
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,870
Christina pledges.
It's interesting.

90
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,973
Wow.

91
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,300
It's like we're instruments not
playing the horn. I am the horn.

92
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,920
I was the guitar right there. Bam,
Bam, Bam. And the thing is my,

93
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:02,220
uh, to my ancestors, they couldn't
play guitar and neither. Kat,

94
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,910
I'm just carrying on the great tradition
of having no musical talent in my

95
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,930
bloodline. Yeah. Ba, Ba, ba boom,

96
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,550
ba boom. Wow. Yeah. Good stuff.

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,230
Truly is. It truly is one
music for him. I don't,

98
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,240
I just don't get, yeah, I don't get it
either. God, you can listen to that shit.

99
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,910
Like,
I don't get it.

100
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,610
A lot of stuff to talk about gene.
Yeah.

101
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,070
So the Christians or are some of them
are against putting their mounts on

102
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,280
penises, right? Yeah. Cause
jeans and stuff. Yeah. The,

103
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,990
a lot of them I think if you're like,

104
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,170
what is it is evangelical
and like old school baptist,

105
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:49,820
they really read the Bible
literally and then they, yeah,

106
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,060
no,
it really will change your opinion on,

107
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,600
I think religion being a grownup
piano growing up being adult,

108
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,430
any photo from space. Right. You
know, when you look at a photo,

109
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,370
I was looking at a photo from space.
Yeah.

110
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,480
That was taken by some satellite
from Saturn towards earth.

111
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,070
And you just see a dot
and there's an arrow.

112
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:14,320
It's like this is earth
kind of makes you go like,

113
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,620
it'd be like if someone said,

114
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,760
and then the people on that star
think that a magic man comes down.

115
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,150
You know what I mean? Yeah. It makes
you go like what they read the Bible.

116
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,450
It's a book said to not eat pigs.
It's,

117
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:31,451
and it's absurd to think that of all the
galaxies and all the solar systems and

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,360
yeah,

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,360
we only know of this planet having of
life that like we're somehow special only

120
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,100
made up of mythical story.
Yeah. And some, someone,

121
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,640
a man in the sky is keeping track of all
of this. What'd you do that in there?

122
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,650
Did you eat a bite of you suck
somebody's Dick. Did you do you jack off?

123
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,000
No big trouble. Yeah.
Okay. You fuck your mom?

124
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,350
Did you eat fish on Friday? All that
stuff is just nonsense. It, yeah.

125
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,320
I don't think God even has time.
Let's say that there is a god,

126
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,410
he hasn't had time to keep track
of all that. A lot going on.

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,220
There's so much more happening.

128
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,630
Especially things like
if you do something,

129
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,710
let's say self indulgent,
it's kind of selfish and greedy.

130
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,160
Maybe it's something
mundane like eating big. Um,

131
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,960
but then there's also
fires and my slot genocide.

132
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,110
He was like, Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, whoa. You have sausage.

133
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,540
Put that back down. Right? Well God
doesn't even care about the biggies.

134
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,170
Like all this stuff you've just named
the fires. And the eye doesn't stop them.

135
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,290
How costs Nazis.
He's always like,

136
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,790
I hope you guys learn freewill.
Yeah.

137
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,880
Better stop being bad.
That's where this happened.

138
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm going to send that hurricane and
all those queers. Killary buddy. Yeah.

139
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,520
Stop being gay.
I hate it.

140
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,190
That's one of my main things
up here and I hate gays.

141
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,630
I think about it all the time.
I made you,

142
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,530
I made the possibility that
you gave but I can't stand it.

143
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,210
God's a big homophobe.

144
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,890
Yeah, he really, really
is like, ah, stop it.

145
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah. That's really
cool. So, so ridiculous.

146
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,610
It's just like the gays I know. Got, it's
just like the gate. Just let this guy,

147
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,670
that is God's thing. Right? Here's God
right here. I have a quote from God.

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,120
I have come all over my face.
What?

149
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,580
She sent me an MP three. He sent
you that? Yeah. Um, so yeah,

150
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:37,790
this lady here has like some
pretty strong views. Yeah,

151
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,990
there you go.

152
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,320
It's interesting how, I mean you're
taught these rules kind of early.

153
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:03,520
If you're a grownup and religion and then
there is a turning point where you go

154
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:07,240
like, wait a minute, wait a
minute, why can't I do that?

155
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:10,820
Why can't I eat pork or why can't I have,
cause the guy said,

156
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,490
why is this even like

157
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,310
all the stories make no sense.
No sense.

158
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,490
And also the idea that there's a book
in even in his historical context,

159
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,140
human history, it's like a
hundred thousand years old,
but we're going to like,

160
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,450
but 2000 years ago they're like,
that's when the guy was here.

161
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,330
It's the right one.
And that's when the book was written.

162
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:35,800
And then people are like,
that's the book.

163
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:40,801
We all should live our lives based
on a book that's 2000 years old.

164
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,050
He didn't know that. Yeah. Okay. Well,

165
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:46,090
and also there's two then
all the people before him,

166
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,120
were they doing things incorrectly
or Doug didn't know here yet?

167
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,190
Well, uh, for it when I was going to say,

168
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,580
yeah, I, yeah, it's, it's all fucking
so stupid. Here's what I think.

169
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,100
This is what God is doing all day
long. Every day. Rob, Rob, rob,

170
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,000
just jerking off, watching
TV. I think we're TV.

171
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,150
You think every time he comes it's,
and that's rain. That's a really good,

172
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,410
really good. No, because these guys, so
his comes gotta be, that's the hurricanes.

173
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,910
Oh, it's right. Hurricanes. Tornadoes.
See, that makes a lot more sense.

174
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:26,650
It's God come when, when there's a
hurricane. Yeah. Or blizzard or something.

175
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:31,150
We should run this by my mom
thinks she would dig it. Yeah.

176
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,600
It's interesting too, what people have
a couple of religious jokes in my act,

177
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:38,850
right? Yeah. Yeah, man, it's
so funny. Most of the time
it goes pretty well. Yeah.

178
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,540
But there's been times when it's gone
sideways and it is amazing to me how

179
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,730
seriously people take that
still. Yeah. But like I,

180
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,150
I do feel like it has something
to do with being really,

181
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,990
you're really inundated
with it as a child. Yeah.

182
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,330
And you kind of have to under your
childish beliefs. Yeah. As an adult.

183
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,770
And a lot of people don't. And
you're like, wait, that wasn't,

184
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,480
or the idea that our Bible is
the right one is kind of crazy.

185
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,710
I tell you about the conversation I
had with a woman on the plane. No,

186
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,150
I only talked, I don't have those
conversations anymore on a plane. Um,

187
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,340
so I was sitting there and I dunno,
it was pretty mundane stuff.

188
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,160
And then I saw a peak

189
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,680
at the cover and it was something
about Peter the Apostle. So I'll go,

190
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,600
I said something like, good book. And
she was like, it's really good actually.

191
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:29,580
He's really good. And I said, oh,
okay. And then said, so are you,

192
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,140
I mean, are you just like studying
for educational purposes or like,

193
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:37,560
in other words, is this, you know, you
learning something or is this like,

194
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,090
you're just free to join us? She's like,
no, this one, you know, I mean it's,

195
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm learning, but it's
what I, you know, I was,

196
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,710
I was looking forward to
reading this and I was like, oh.

197
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,970
And then we started talking about that
a little bit and I kinda, you know,

198
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:55,290
I didn't say anything provocative to her,
but then I was like, Hey, do you ever,

199
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,290
she said something about, Oh yeah.
She was like, yeah, you know,

200
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,820
it's like when people,
she was like,

201
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:04,110
do you have you accepted Christ as your
savior? And I was like, sure. I go,

202
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,270
I just had like,
I was raised,

203
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:10,410
that's what I always say when someone
is how I was raised in a Catholic house.

204
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,820
In other words, I'm trying to tell
them, you don't worry about me,

205
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,660
like don't try to sell me. Yeah. But I'm
also not trying to further, the guy goes,

206
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:22,140
raised Catholic. She was like, oh,
that's good. And, or whatever. She said,

207
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:26,400
but then she was like, yeah, you know,
and it's kind of my mission to like,

208
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,600
you know, I try to save people before and
I go, well, what do you think happens?

209
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,580
I go, if they don't, she goes, then
they go to hell. And I go, so you,

210
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,960
do you really think that people go
to hell if they don't accept Christ?

211
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:44,880
And she goes, yeah. I said, what about
um, cause there's a lot of people,

212
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:48,300
billions of people that are
another religion. Like back
to what you were saying.

213
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,190
Okay, sure. And you know Jews

214
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,680
dude, I go, do you think they
go to hell? And she goes,

215
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,330
it was a really hard conclusion
for me to come to. But yeah,

216
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,610
so all Muslims go to
hell. She was like, yeah,

217
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,350
and I go and all Jews. She was like,
Yup. And I go, all right, I go have,

218
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:12,510
have a great trip. Hope you
have a blessed, blessed.

219
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,430
But isn't that crazy that this
human is walking the world with us?

220
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,690
Well,
and especially because if you,

221
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,100
I mean Jesus has messages of love and
acceptance and he accepted the prostitutes

222
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:31,790
and he accepted all the people that, you
know, we're a marginalized in society.

223
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,930
But except for those, you know,
Jews and then those loans,

224
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,050
I mean I get it.
If it religion gives you comfort,

225
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,880
I think you should have your comfort
for sure. Then your messages,

226
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,710
everyone's going to hell was kind
of a crew. Hey, contradictory. Yeah.

227
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,090
This lady is also a little crazy

228
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,520
in your fucking mouth

229
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,730
and it all falls under
the same umbrella. Yeah.

230
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,740
She said she added a syllable
to umbrella umbrella umber.

231
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,050
She did it at the Rihanna Barella

232
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,220
oh
man.

233
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,600
Fuck you up.
Let's be in a religion though.

234
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,540
It's funny cause I flew home
yesterday from Portland and was that

235
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,760
our audiences are by far the panning
out that these are being recorded at a

236
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,740
different pace because of the
fucking movie schedules. Excuse me.

237
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,890
Because of the Goddamn fucking movie
schedule. You're a movie star now.

238
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,860
You should have no more regal of it.
A vocabulary.

239
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,180
I'm just letting our listeners know.

240
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:50,120
I mean I'm thrilled to do the movie
and I always love doing this show.

241
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm just saying that's why
you're maybe starting out.

242
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,270
You think you should really clean up,

243
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,530
clean up my act of the waste to act the
everything. So I came back from Portland,

244
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:59,330
which was amazed.
The audiences were amazed.

245
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,860
You guys are fantastic for coming out.

246
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:04,810
I really do appreciate
Portland [inaudible] have
the best fucking crowds are

247
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,900
just amazing and they're so, they're
so down to have fun. I had, you know,

248
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,441
it was great.

249
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:14,441
So I know Portland and Portland and I
came home and we were texting and you go,

250
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,160
is it weird that I don't
give a shit about Easter?

251
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,170
Don't give a motherfucking shit about
Easter Sunday as I'm flying home on Easter

252
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,640
Sunday and I will go, neither do
I could give fucking zero fucks.

253
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,370
But I honestly think it's two fold for
me. Why I don't like Easter one. Uh,

254
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,050
because of the stations of the cross.

255
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,880
Because in Catholic school it was like
they didn't focus on the Easter bunny or

256
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,820
on the fund or the chocolate
Catholic school is like,

257
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,900
and then the suffering Christ for
people that listen or watch the show,

258
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,070
we all have different backgrounds,

259
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,810
but the kids that grew up in Catholic
homes know that, you know, Catholics,

260
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,270
if you had real Catholic
parents said a real,

261
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,720
a nice way of ruining child's like fun.
Yeah.

262
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,750
It should just be Easter
baskets and Shire,

263
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,920
they were ruined Christmas with
Christ's suffering and you know,

264
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,920
you're like presence there. Like it's
not about presence. And you're like,

265
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,730
all right. And then you're like,

266
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,460
everyone else was talking about presence.
Yeah,

267
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:21,000
well they're stupid and they're
going to hell. And then Easter. Yeah.

268
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,470
Easter's like bunny.
And they're like,

269
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,560
well the real part about Easter
as God rose after he was murdered.

270
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,740
Oh four.
So yeah,

271
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,010
but they really dragged it out. When I
went to an all girls Catholic school,

272
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:37,530
you realize that's why we
fucking go like God, Jesus

273
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,310
ruined before you go.
And we had to walk.

274
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:43,920
I remember our campus was
beautiful and they had,

275
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,670
they actually did the real stations of
the cross and we had to walk around with

276
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,280
a non, you know, sister Ann or
whoever. And then she's like,

277
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:55,281
and this is when Jesus fell again and
Jesus falls like a hundred times over and

278
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:55,771
over.

279
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:59,940
And they beat him and whipped them and
people point and laugh and he had a crown

280
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:00,920
of thorns in his marriage.

281
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,670
I remember being a kid and then
showing us that on an Easter too.

282
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,180
What I mean, like not in school. I
mean, being a young kid, you know,

283
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,810
maybe five or six and you're like, have
your basket where you're Chucky treats.

284
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,390
And then they're like, there's an image
of, and you're like, what happened? Jesus,

285
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,860
he's, he rose from the dead today while
you're eating your fucking chocolate.

286
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,560
And then I remember I had this teacher
who had to teach us exactly how the nails

287
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:38,460
got put in. Did you know that?
They did not. By the way,

288
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,730
it's inaccurate historically that
they put the nails through Jesus,

289
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:45,690
his palms through the risks. Right.
Because that would slide off the cross.

290
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,290
If you nailed somebody,
palms,

291
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,190
it would just tear through
it and the person would fall.

292
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,280
So they crucified you by
nailing it through your wrists.

293
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,540
But it was cool for them to discover
that I bet back in the room. Yeah.

294
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,060
They were like, Oh, you know the nail,

295
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:04,470
the weight of his body just slid through
his hands when he fell, he still died,

296
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,230
but kind of fucked up the
decoration we were going for it.

297
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,750
So what we've done is
innovated this whole thing.

298
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,740
We nail through the risks and
then we nail through both feet

299
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,440
and they bleed out. That
way works well. Yeah. Okay.

300
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:23,550
So that's one reason I hate Easter.
The second reason has to do

301
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,130
is my dad,
I had this childhood memory,

302
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,390
it was right around the age where I
was kind of starting to figure out that

303
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:36,990
Santa wasn't real.
And I think once that domino falls,

304
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,040
all the others do like the Easter bunny
and the tooth fairy and Santa hadn't

305
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:45,930
fallen just yet, but I was starting
to catch on and I remember my dad,

306
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,240
I was staying with him at the time and um,

307
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,540
it was the night before Easter and I were
going to sleep and I was like, so dad,

308
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,870
the Easter bunny is going to come
right like these. I kept asking him,

309
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,960
the Easter bunny is going to come right.
And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

310
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,430
It's going to come like it.
Co of course ignoring me.

311
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,380
And of course I woke up Easter
morning and there was nothing like,

312
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,150
my dad didn't even buy me like a
chocolate, like nothing in the house.

313
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,200
And I remember just being
like, wait, there's no Easter
bunny. It's like, oh yeah,

314
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:21,340
no, there's no Easter bunny like he,
that's how he told me. I don't remember.

315
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,000
It must have been like around the
age where you start to realize,

316
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,850
so let's seven or something seminary.

317
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,980
And then I remember going to my mom's
house and just crying cause like it was

318
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,160
like

319
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,410
there's no,

320
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,790
and she's like fuck. She's like, yeah.

321
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,060
And I remember she took me to the store
and I bought an etch a sketch and that

322
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,100
was like my Easter present for the day.

323
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,390
But like he really fucked up the
biggies for me cause he was just lazy.

324
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,010
He was like, Nah, I don't
want to buy nothing for you.

325
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,320
So that sounds cool
parenting, right? Yeah.

326
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,630
But we don't say, here's the thing is
that we don't fuck up our kids good time.

327
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,890
I keep trying.
I just pull that back.

328
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,310
As much as I don't give
a fuck about Easter,

329
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,190
I made sure that our child enjoyed Easter.

330
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,420
Yesterday we did an Easter egg
hunt for LJ and he got, you know,

331
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,370
we didn't do the Jesus stuff to him.
Yeah. She got to do it for your kids,

332
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,790
man. You got to do it for your kids.
So we don't give a shit. I no, no, no.

333
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,930
That's the whole thing. That's what
being a parent is a good parent.

334
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm just saying that that's what being
yes, that yesterday and hiding eggs,

335
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,800
that's us being good, but
my dad was so selfish, like,

336
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:39,490
why wouldn't you just be like,
and I remember him blowing
me off like, yeah, yeah,

337
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,290
sure, sure. It's going to be
here tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,770
Like it was so dismissive and shitty.
Like you couldn't have gotten,

339
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,390
I know you went to the liquor store.

340
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,540
I know you went down to the seven 11
you could gotten me like a fucking

341
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,160
chocolate bunny with your six or a
Heineken. I mean that's just fucking lazy.

342
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm sorry. No, I'm fine.

343
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,120
I'm just saying it's really
lazy parenting. Yeah, no, I
hear you. I hear you. Yeah.

344
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,220
Could have gotten down to the
fucking rite aid or whatever. Cvs.

345
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:11,490
I definitely think most men
would fall short if they were,

346
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,910
that's true. That's true. You guys have
no, but that's not, not this generation.

347
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,010
I mean all this generation is
different though. It is a different,

348
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,050
it's a different world.
We're also,

349
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:24,840
this generation is much more
emotionally aware, you know?

350
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,010
I'll be, your dad will probably just like,
oh, here's your, I don't know Steg Buddy.

351
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,550
Here's your Easter steak. Yeah, yeah. Like
steak. And then he'd be like, all right.

352
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,650
Uh, I owe her some chocolates too,
but I don't know where they are.

353
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,030
Okay.
And that would be your eastern,

354
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,360
probably the women kind of
ran the show when it, right.

355
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,400
But if your kid says pacifically, Hey
dad, Easter Buddy's coming tomorrow.

356
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,300
You know what that means? Yeah. Yeah.
A cute little girl asking you for shit.

357
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,370
I mean, come on. Jesus Christ. Oh,
fucking leave. If she has specifically,

358
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:06,270
I'm sure you would try. It was like I
was reminding him. Yeah. So fucking lazy.

359
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,990
He's unbelievable. She's Christ. Uh,

360
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,470
but you're right, the women tend to keep
up the traditions they do. Yeah. I know.

361
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:20,270
It sounds like I'm being a antiquated
with this stuff, but it's true.

362
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,500
Well, yeah, I, I'm the mom, so I
make sure Christmas looks nice.

363
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,940
The House looks nice, never do a
decoration. I'll tell you that.

364
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,570
If it was just me,
not a single thing,

365
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,820
you would never know
what time of year it was.

366
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,910
If you were just dropped into this home,
you'd be like, I dunno. Is it March?

367
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:41,540
Is it June? Is it November?
You had no, no idea. Yeah, no,

368
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,480
but I liked that you do it of course,
because I know it makes everybody,

369
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,320
it brings joy. Just like at
Halloween, I decorate the house.

370
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:52,010
I like to have that stuff. Maybe because
my parents were so great at it, you know,

371
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm just carrying on their
tradition on this circle of fun,

372
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,630
just like my ancestors did.

373
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,750
Yesterday's court blood pressure
come fuck you up on it in a long run.

374
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,360
Fuck you up in alone.
Drawn from the inside.

375
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,650
That's why we got aids and all
this other bullshit around. Okay,

376
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:16,660
so the term eating, eating
vagina, uh, it, it, it's, it's,

377
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,710
you're more so licky you're
not really eating it.

378
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,510
You consume and the shit that comes from,

379
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,690
you
know,

380
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,450
either I'll be okay.

381
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,850
I love her.
I wish that was my grandmother.

382
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,850
She didn't have a lot of fun in her youth
and her grandmother didn't talk like

383
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:41,700
that at all. But I wish, I wish you did.

384
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,550
He's why we got eight

385
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,090
Carl from oral. Yeah. And
vaginas and stuff. Yeah.

386
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,210
I love it.
I think it was bud fucking actually ma'am,

387
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,160
but fucking there's the medical
term when you, but fuck,

388
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,980
you can get eight. Yeah,
that's what they say.

389
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,890
So the doctor says that fucking disease.
Yeah.

390
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,570
I don't think it's a dick suck disease.
So not down with that pork.

391
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,330
No. Pork is really a big, the Muslims
don't eat the pork, right? Yeah, no.

392
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,540
Yeah. By the way, did you see this?
You've seen this filthy animal.

393
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,010
They're all filthy animals. Cows
are filthy too. They're all,

394
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:25,230
they all step in their own ship
to change your filthy animals. Um,

395
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,630
this guy, what is his
name? Jamie. Jamie Lee.

396
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,180
Parker is a tattoo artist.

397
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,830
And I know what you're going to bring
up and I can't believe how good it is.

398
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:41,700
So I have a,
I have a joke in my latest special about,

399
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,220
which is true about sometimes throughout

400
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,390
my life and including recently,
people will be like, oh,

401
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,450
Segura is that Japanese?
And I have a,

402
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:54,090
so there's a bit about it in the special
home and do the whole thing. But,

403
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,890
so anyways, I guess, you know,

404
00:26:55,891 --> 00:27:00,891
people have been commenting and
messaging me a lot about it and you know,

405
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:03,290
they right there. Are you
Japanese like as a joke? Oh yeah.

406
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,720
When people who think it's Japanese
relaxing uha sounds Japanese.

407
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm like, alright man.
Anyways, that's the joke.

408
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,420
He did a tattoo on someone,

409
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:20,250
craziness of me as like a Samurai.
Um,

410
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,000
it's so good.

411
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:26,080
I mean I will say detail is like,

412
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,960
he really got your face, your nose, your
beard, and you're like the guys really,

413
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,760
whoever this is is an amazing
beard. Colors, right? Yeah.

414
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,280
Like down to the the whisker. Yeah. Like
where, like this white hair right here.

415
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,030
Yeah. I know what you're talking
about. Yeah. And he did a 14 hours.

416
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,370
Damn.
It's a real fan right there.

417
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,810
This is so amazing. Especially in
contrast to that Instagram page.

418
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:52,440
I think it's called sucky
tattoos or suck my tattoos.

419
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,010
That shit is so fucking hilarious.
Cause it's,

420
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,690
it's basically tattoos that
were done in 14 seconds.

421
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,070
Yeah. It's sucky tattoos. Hmm.

422
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,310
And then the tagline is stopped getting
shitty tattoos. [inaudible] says it's,

423
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,850
it's so unbelievable.

424
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,740
I'm going to try to pull it up
right now and show it to you, um,

425
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,100
that people would, especially when
you see how bad these are, um,

426
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,970
it's like, why would you,
this isn't like you paid,

427
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:25,860
you bought a painting and your
pride, you're, uh, you know,

428
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,340
you're like, I'm going to hang this
up. This is on your body. You know,

429
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:33,300
this is on your body forever and
so hard to commit to something.

430
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,410
Oh my God. I mean, that guy says,

431
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,960
it just says keep it real stupid.
Ooh,

432
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,060
I dunno what that's supposed to be.
That's misspelled.

433
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,470
Believed in myself.

434
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,360
P. E. L. I. V. E. N. O. Shit. That's bad.

435
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,560
That says be live in, and this is what
about believing in English? Yeah, I mean,

436
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,610
as shit like this, it's funny.
Eyes on your ass cheeks.

437
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:04,611
The ones that are really crazy or
just like the really poorly sketched.

438
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,500
Well,
you know where the the line work here,

439
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,100
you know like the outer
edge is and then look,

440
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,890
they misspelled California
and then rode over it.

441
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,600
California dreaming and
I mean look at the font.

442
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,320
It's like somebody free hand.
You let them,

443
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,030
does it make any sense?
You know,

444
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,110
no prison tattoos.

445
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,560
I don't think that's fair cause
it's like that dude's in prison.

446
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,910
Oh you think something's
wrong with this guy though? Or

447
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,100
you think something's wrong with
him? No teeth in the mouth, but no,

448
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,420
but I mean like you can't, you can't
really rank a prison tattoo. It's like,

449
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,070
all right.
Ah Man,

450
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,740
I don't know. Just this they
misspelled too. You know there's,

451
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,970
there's two o's too weird
to live. Too Rare. Yeah.

452
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,870
Yeah.
I thought

453
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,330
they do a stencil first
so you can proof read

454
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,530
like nobody, nobody
proof writers. No regrets

455
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,610
a lot, bro. Yeah. Anyways,

456
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,160
what a great contrast. Right?
When you see this work,

457
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,120
you know that somebody paid someone
for that and then you have fucking

458
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,170
sky that's amaze through this. I think
it's crazy. Jamie Lee Parker. Oh,

459
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:34,260
Jamie Hart. Yeah. Where do you
know where this person is? No, no.

460
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:37,800
I just see it in this email here, but
pretty amazing. It's incredible. Yeah.

461
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,850
Jesus even got your silly, I work, I
keep forgetting because I look at it,

462
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:45,300
I see a painting. Thank you. Keep
forgetting to this is on someone's body.

463
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,870
That's another thing you have to
take into consideration is like that.

464
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,280
That's on an angle. Like yeah,
it's a round surface. Simon.
A flat. It's like an arm.

465
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,590
But even right now I keep,
I keep forgetting as a

466
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,830
looking at it cause I'm looking at the
artwork and then I have to remind myself

467
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,720
somebody is walking around with that.

468
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,880
No, I know. What if you offend him
on your next special, I don't know.

469
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:07,520
You're like hates me. Yeah. And he's
like fuck fucking eight times bigger.

470
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:09,450
And now I was like, what's
he look like? And he's like,

471
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:13,910
well actually I have a photo
like tattoo of him on my body.

472
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,950
Gmo Farms. Is that on his leg? You think

473
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,010
arm? Uh, I dunno. I
can't tell. It's around.

474
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,253
I think that's a leg.

475
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,900
Oh, you're right. I
think you're right. Yeah.

476
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:26,920
So like not only does he have to get you
in your life, your likeliness, perfect.

477
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,430
Your likeness, sorry. But he has to do
it on an angle. So like how does he even,

478
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,930
how do they fucking learn? How do you
learn to Tattoo? That's the real thing.

479
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,230
That means you got to give a lot
of bad tattoos I'm assuming, right?

480
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,520
I'm assuming. Yeah. But hopefully
most of them are just, you know,

481
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,950
not tattooed on someone. Maybe you
learned all your bad stuff on paper.

482
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,970
You learnt. Yeah. But then, but then you
can practice it. Yeah. Do it on skin, man.

483
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,250
And I'm going to town

484
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,580
right now. So I do this regularly.
Well, because I freak out.

485
00:31:59,581 --> 00:32:03,690
I personally have my own anxiety about
beard length and hair length and I,

486
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,260
you know, when it gets to a
certain point you kind of go like,

487
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,620
I got to get my hair cut today.
I gotta get my,

488
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,760
yeah. Yeah. I get the same way.
I feel like I look horrible.

489
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,070
You got to do it just ugly.
You get your head like

490
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,980
this over a week.

491
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:18,981
But I can't touch it myself because I
go to shoot more of the White House to

492
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,120
look the same as it did last time,

493
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:24,720
so I have to go tomorrow and let them
do the cut and make sure it matches the

494
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:29,310
earlier stuff. Anyways, it's making me
absolutely crazy. Shout out to Plymouth,

495
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,720
Minnesota is suburb of Minneapolis and
wearing my twin cities hat today and

496
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:38,220
shout out to Zachary Lane. Elementary
school where I went for one year. Okay.

497
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,070
You think a lot of those people

498
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,890
are listening? There's definitely someone
right now who's like no fucking way.

499
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,500
I went to Zachary Lane.
Yeah,

500
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,010
I went there for fourth grade and
then we went to the Catholic school.

501
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:53,480
I forget the name of fifth grade
and sixth grade raised. Yeah.

502
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,510
It's cool.

503
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,410
Your parents moved you around every
year and then we moved again for seventh

504
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:00,860
grade. I went to lake shore, Middle
School in medicine. It's really bad.

505
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,730
Did your kids your beard? I don't. I
don't feel like it's that full right now.

506
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,590
I know how full it is compared
to how I've been wearing it.

507
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,163
Do you,

508
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,550
so do you smell the smells
more like it cause I know,

509
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,630
I know that your beard's traps
more smells a little more.

510
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,520
It is a little more trappy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

511
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,550
I will say when your diet was way worser.
Yeah.

512
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,770
When you were eating like pizza and stuff,

513
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,910
your beard would smell a lot like like
cheese and stuff more. Thank you. Then.

514
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,240
Yeah. It doesn't smell bad now,
but I can tell what you've,

515
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,520
what you've been doing like memory,

516
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:39,010
you came home last time and I
sniffed your beard and I was like,

517
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,300
did you smoke cigars? Yeah.
Yeah. I can smell that.

518
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,390
Smoked cigars the day
before. Right. But it's,

519
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,390
it's still in your beard and in your
skin and you hadn't showered. Right.

520
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:53,590
I'm assuming. I think I had showered.
That's what I was amazing. Yeah.

521
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:57,340
I can smell it all in your
beard. Yeah. Pretty interesting.

522
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,650
Let you go on your hikes. Who knows
what happens there? Hiking lately,

523
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,450
smelling that beard

524
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,501
meeting guys.

525
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:10,330
A lot of Nice guys having a muscle spasm
in the same spot for a couple of days.

526
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,200
It's now where spot is it right here.
It's moving right now

527
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,970
on there. You see it? No,
don't you feel it right now?

528
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,480
I wonder why they're right here. I
Dunno. It's interesting. Um, well we're,

529
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:24,120
we're going to talk about,

530
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,990
I wanted to bring up that Netflix
show you and I got into, uh,

531
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,690
that beach body show. Oh,
with people go to Thailand.

532
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:33,030
Beauty and the beauty and the
beach or something. Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,850
Thailand for cosmetic surgery. It's
people from New Zealand and Australia who,

534
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,890
who can't afford to have it,
I guess done there.

535
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:45,030
And then they go to Thailand for discount,
major plastic surgery.

536
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,810
And I'm talking like removing penises,
creating vaginas.

537
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,670
Face Work Major.
Oh yeah.

538
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,390
Major shifts.

539
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,540
Chin implants.
I had no idea how much,

540
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,640
even the discussion of removing
one's penis and testicles.

541
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,210
I would feel so, and I, and I,

542
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,220
this is not to belittle or demean
or humiliate entity does it?

543
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,870
Uh, I think you know, by all means, do
what? Whatever you want to do to be happy.

544
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:18,700
I think it's great if
that's what you want to do.

545
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,940
I'm saying that when the person
was consultating with the doctor,

546
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,090
I could feel my testes jump,

547
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,980
I could feel my asshole go
like yeah. And he's like, yeah,

548
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:35,220
and then we'll remove the
penis. I was like, ha ha. Yeah.

549
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,860
And then we'll invert everything
and you a vagina. I was like,

550
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,530
I couldn't, I was, I was having
this visceral reaction to it that I,

551
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:46,970
I didn't expect at all. It was tough. I
know you couldn't watch the whole segment.

552
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,620
I couldn't watch that segment.
You miss it.

553
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:51,910
Cause they show the Dong in
her hand at one point. She's
like, yeah, y'all painted.

554
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,970
We caught it all. And he's like,
what? Uh, what did you just say?

555
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,990
I'm joining the Thai accent, ma'am. I
can do it now. My mom is my new moms,

556
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,670
Vietnamese, so I can make fun of rob. Rob.
Yeah, rob. It's fine. Yeah. And his tie,

557
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:09,610
his tie. Oh He's, yeah. So
he's your rub rub. Dr Rob.

558
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,710
All right. It's, it's fascinating. Yeah.

559
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,873
Yeah.

560
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,150
I guess there's this port,

561
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,400
there's four women in Australia who her
uterus is coming out of her vagina cause

562
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:27,420
she had five babies and she has like
public health care and they told her she

563
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:31,510
had to wait nine years to get the
procedure. So she's kind of a fuck that

564
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,960
sizable wait nine years.

565
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,460
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

566
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,960
I mean tell someone that their
genitals or is it public health care?

567
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,310
That's what she is on. I don't know.
I'm not familiar enough with their,

568
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,470
the big things about public health care
in different parts of the world is they

569
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,380
will pay for it but they sometimes they're
like you got to come back in years.

570
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,790
Gosh, I mean and in that case
I understand going to Thailand,

571
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,130
it's closer for obviously for Australians.
Yeah.

572
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,450
You get it done and it's a nice
enough place. It's, it's fancy. Yeah.

573
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,760
And there anyway, there's this one
lady cause you, they don't show you,

574
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,100
first of all,
they don't show you a year later,

575
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,170
which is really when you want to see
what plastic surgery looks like was the

576
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,320
very true when the face is relaxed and
you see how the muscles have kind of come

577
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:19,560
together and the work that they've done.
So you only see like two,

578
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:23,010
three weeks postop and they're all also
geeked to have the work done and they're

579
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,480
so excited and they're all shiny.

580
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,710
And there's this one lady
who had a facelift done.

581
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,620
Well you tell it. I like
you telling it. She had,

582
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,510
she had a facelift on whatever. She's
all black and blue, which is normal.

583
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,440
And then eyelids all stitched
up. Yeah. Faces all crazy.

584
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,110
And then she's looking in the
mirror. She was like, I look great.

585
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,360
And then about 10 days later,
swelling has reduced. Oh my God.

586
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,200
So brutal. Watch it. I keep thinking
about it. I wish I was a logger,

587
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,640
meaning a transcriber on home, uh, extreme
makeover. It was the name of the show.

588
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:00,640
Extreme loved that show.
That was the network version.

589
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,440
They would air this show on ABC I think.
And they would basically take people,

590
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:10,441
busted ass people and give
them a total makeovers.

591
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:14,520
I mean plastic surgery, new teeth, hair,

592
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,600
great new wardrobes, everything. And then
you know, they would have a big reveal.

593
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,280
People would be like,
what the dog,

594
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,530
they should just have a teeth
make show because that alone,

595
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:27,350
I remember what just
transform people to were huge.

596
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,520
The teeth were done by a dentist out here.
Oh yeah, I remember that doctor. Yeah,

597
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,350
doctor fuck nuts. Wash bag,
big Douche bag. And He um,

598
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,140
he let us get like free widenings
and we went there and then his uh,

599
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,840
assistance or like, do you have that?
That's where they told me they were like,

600
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:48,340
you have like 20 habits happened to
me by the way. Later I happened to me.

601
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:52,810
Same thing. We know, I told that story
for a long time when I had insurance,

602
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,410
dental insurance and this one job and
they're like, you have like 13 cavities,

603
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,520
13th actually the number, that
number. And then I was like, fuck you.

604
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:03,730
And I went to my Hungarian dentist and
he's like, you have like one cavity,

605
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,050
this is a lie, but this story, whatever.

606
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,740
I'm so I'm glad it's documented because
people have called you out on it.

607
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,730
I asked my friend Eric, I was, he
was there when it happened. Okay.

608
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
We worked together. So anyway, go ahead.

609
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,910
When you worked at America's most
wanted so that I know I know that much.

610
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,650
So this lady has like the 10
day she's 10 days removed from,

611
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,220
from her intensive plastic
surgery where they're,

612
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,790
and slides under her fucking
face pulling her drain.

613
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,250
Anyways, she's like, I'm going
to go see the doctor today.

614
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,660
And when she says she's going to go see
the doctor, her left eyebrow, she's like,

615
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:48,910
I'm going to go see a doctor. I have
someone want to talk to them about it.

616
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,080
And you're like,

617
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,350
I think she's going to talk about that
eyebrow as she goes in there and she's

618
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,700
like, um, there's one thing
I wanted to ask you about.

619
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,510
I remember you mentioning it and I didn't
realize it was an issue until people

620
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:04,510
kept re-explaining things for
me. Like, I didn't understand,

621
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,110
is this a left eyebrow,

622
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,430
I'm going to come down or is it gonna
stay cock like I'm in a permanent state of

623
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:15,030
Huh. And he's like, Hey,

624
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:20,070
we'll come now she had a case of Tom
Cigarettes cause he got that eyebrow.

625
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,110
That's your eyebrows. She had
a case in the meanies. Yeah,

626
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,550
I mean that Shit looked just one.

627
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,210
And I remember dude right before
she went into the dark, I was like,

628
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,100
it's her fucking eyebrow higher
dude. I was like, look, that eyebrow,

629
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,580
it was slowly creeping up.
Creeping up. Yeah. And then

630
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,180
with him it looks really bad. It looks
horrible and he's like, it's very normal.

631
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,920
It will come down under. And I was like,
no way, no fucking way. The muscle him

632
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,710
need full body massage.
Open your mouth.

633
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,660
Let me pull up my, my taste. They do not.

634
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:06,290
Those doctors are very good.
No, those two, those doctors
pioneered, um, that whole,

635
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,340
you know, cutting the weaning off
surgery. That's what it's called. Yeah.

636
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,200
Dick up inside you,
they created that stuff.

637
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:18,850
That's why they have so many
good lady boys there. It's,
they, they innovated that.

638
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,560
And thinking about it now,
it's like, uh, I dunno.

639
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,140
It's just that like they in Edinburg.

640
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,370
Yeah.
And so that becomes your canal somehow.

641
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,060
You stay with good sensitivity to, well,
here's how, here's how they did it.

642
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,270
So they took his scrotal skin actually,

643
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,600
and then they show the nurse plucking
the hairs off of the scrotal skin and

644
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,220
making it soft,
like kind of scraping it.

645
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,920
And then that's the skin that they used
for the internal part of the vagina is

646
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:58,040
when I'm understanding.
And then the, yeah.

647
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:02,090
And they use the tip of the penis
to make the cliteracy. Ah, yeah.

648
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,570
And then the penis skin, I
think is the outer, the Lavia.

649
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:11,580
Isn't that amazing? It's
amazing. And I wish they would
have shown more detail. No,

650
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,360
I have so many questions. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

651
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,780
no, no, no. You want to have
that done while they explain
it to you. They're like,

652
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,200
bro, bro, bro, bro,

653
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:32,270
bro, bro, bro,

654
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,560
bro, bro, bro, bro, Bro.

655
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,020
Oh my God. So moving along, topic
wise. Yeah. You and I went into a bar.

656
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:46,390
Stocks. Uh, we go, we dropped what we were
taking fifth to the vet I think. Yeah.

657
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,870
And we were on our way back and I had to
go pee in the Starbucks and when I went

658
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:54,871
to go pee there was a woman next to me
who came in hurriedly hurt hurriedly.

659
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,990
Is that the word? Hurried
hurry. In a hurried manner.

660
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,590
And she dropped trout and
she had a full diarrhea.

661
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,403
Yeah.

662
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,510
Yeah. I have to say in girl world,
that is very rare. It's extremely rare.

663
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,730
It's as rare as hearing a double pipe.
Classic cars.

664
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:21,150
Generally women don't drop massive
brown load in a public restroom.

665
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:26,110
Really? No. So what happens? Like,
can you hear a little bit? Oh my God,

666
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,510
I heard everything. No, no. Normally, oh,

667
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,780
ps you hear p number one
only smell too though.

668
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,220
Sometimes some nasty
bitch you'll hear like

669
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,900
and like, like a two will slip out like,
and then you'll know like, oh she's,

670
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,440
she's shitting but you don't sell them.
Do you hear like the full,

671
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,950
like all of it nice world that you live
in because let me tell you something

672
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:54,820
about the men's room. Yeah. In a lot. In
most place, especially a busy men's room,

673
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,640
like I'm saying multiple stalls.

674
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,020
It is a symphony of sounds
and it smells like death.

675
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:08,340
I mean, you go to lax. Yeah. Well that's,
yeah. Any major airport like those,

676
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,320
those bathroom stalls are wrecked.

677
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,610
I mean it stinks to high
heaven. Well, at the airport,

678
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,210
you know you've got international dumps,
international time zones dumps,

679
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:24,090
and you see the, the fucking travel
nurses of humanity walking through there.

680
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,990
Yeah. Garbage, garbage people. Yeah.
No it is. This is like what it's like,

681
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,550
uh,
in the men's room it's like,

682
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,000
but why do you guys have no shame
and why do women have the shame?

683
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,510
Dude do, I mean, I had time in my life
where I was a little more like, Ooh,

684
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,790
but like, I dunno, I think guys are just

685
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,370
like, I got a shit. What do
you want me to do? Help me.

686
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:06,100
Sensei. Yeah. How do I, I mean I don't,

687
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,400
I usually just shit with reckless
abandon if I have to shit, I shit,

688
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,480
I don't fucking care. Yeah. For the
other gals listening, how do we get them?

689
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,100
How do we get over the hump of,

690
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,060
cause I feel like I would like that
this woman was just going for it.

691
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:20,950
I mean it was Starbucks.
Yeah.

692
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:26,050
They basically serve you bal torture and
then some of them don't have bathrooms.

693
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:30,280
We just heard an eruption though.
I heard diarrhea. Yeah. Very rare.

694
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,090
Very rare in the women's bathroom.
You just got to realize, yeah,

695
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,100
doesn't matter. Doesn't, who cares?
You got it. When you got to go,

696
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:37,790
you should just let it out.
Let the vowel

697
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,500
and the farts.
I think it's the fart.

698
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:42,940
So women don't want people to hear
the farts. I hear the sounds right.

699
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,600
It's embarrassing.
It's not lazy like there's,

700
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,470
and there's no one that
you can't see the person.

701
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,690
That's what I always feel
to it was up around you.

702
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,540
It's anonymous and you can wait for that
other person. That's what I've done.

703
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,600
Ones where I'm like, Ooh, like,
and you know the person that I've,

704
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,500
I've heard people go like,
Jesus, I've heard that before.

705
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,730
So if that happens and you're
feeling a little timid, you know,

706
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,630
but I've also walked out and have people
just look right at me and you go like,

707
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:08,520
yeah,

708
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,340
have you ever had someone after
you violent shit in public?

709
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,070
And then they're like, hey, you're
Tom secure. I know you're a comedian.

710
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,700
I've had them

711
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,580
say, I've had them say like, Hey, yeah,

712
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:22,110
I'm while I'm at a urinal and I've also
had it while I'm washing my hands. Like,

713
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:22,500
you know,

714
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,050
but not like after you just
had that like age or dad.

715
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,740
I walked out of the stall,
but I've had it, you know,

716
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,890
washing my hands 30 seconds later.
Right.

717
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,800
They know that you just shit. That's
what I'm saying. I don't know.

718
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,630
I don't know if they know I
just shit, no, I don't think so.

719
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,800
Cause I, that would bother me if I took
a shit. And then they're like, oh hey,

720
00:46:38,801 --> 00:46:40,690
I don't like when they try to
shake my hands in the bathroom.

721
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,900
That's nasty as fuck. I've had a guy try
to shake my hands on at the urinal. Yeah.

722
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,360
Holding your winger.
Yeah.

723
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,650
And I'm like, well, I'm a little busy
right now. He's like, Oh yeah, yeah.

724
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,340
I was going to come see your show,
but I didn't. I'm like, thank you.

725
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:58,140
That's always the fun I was going to
see ya. But I chose not to. Thank you.

726
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:03,780
All right. Yeah. Um, so you remember I was
a few weeks ago. I wonder if I have it,

727
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,760
uh,
in here,

728
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,680
there was a guy and he had a proposal,

729
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,350
I think.

730
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,380
Yeah. This is a year I think about
him from time to time. Yeah. Okay.

731
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:15,850
This is the guy and he's a real,
I'm

732
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,490
looking at and I want
to have kids someday.

733
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,150
I'm prepared to offer $1,000 to the woman
with similar needs when it wants to go

734
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:28,420
out with me to dinner
at Churchill in Spokane,

735
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,530
you please post a video response,
um,

736
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,700
detailing why you want to go out with me.

737
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,280
Okay. As a really insane. Yeah.

738
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,540
At first we felt bad for him.
Like, oh, that guy's nice. Yeah.

739
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,740
He kind of was just down

740
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:54,080
really shitty whole. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, but essentially he's like, Hey,

741
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,170
I'll give you $1,000 I have
dinner at a nice restaurant,

742
00:47:57,171 --> 00:48:01,430
but I want to have a family with you. I
Dunno. Anyways, he has another video out.

743
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,930
See, I know. He's like, you should
be under 25 years old. Here's this.

744
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,850
Oh No. How do you, my lap right
now under 26 right now, no frills,

745
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,150
no big titties in intelligence.
I don't care. She's a hood rat,

746
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:14,640
punk rock or any kind of anything wrong.

747
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:18,030
She's hot in here right now and my
37 year old big right now. Right now.

748
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:20,490
Right now. Right now. Right now.
Right now. Already know already now.

749
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:23,450
Okay.

750
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,890
He's high as fuck. I think
so. I think everything's
worked out or not. It's on me.

751
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:31,160
Beat me. He's like, he's
like that level of mania.

752
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,790
The, he just came from Churchill's and
he's just, he's just full of steak.

753
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,240
He was like, I enjoyed dinner, but I
want something to top it off. No, no.

754
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,230
Jesus Christ. Yeah. Again, you
don't have to express this feeling.

755
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,483
You can feel it.

756
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,550
You just don't have to share it.
Well,

757
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:49,790
when you're high on cocaine
or whatever it is, yeah.

758
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,470
You're not really thinking clearly. That's
true. I bet he's coked up. He looks his,

759
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:55,630
the eyes are kind of wild

760
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,970
dude. Yeah. He's um, he's
not doing so well. Well,

761
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,280
no, but this is a, this is when you make
videos like this when you're on drugs.

762
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,520
Oh, for sure. I mean,

763
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,200
I would argue that the majority of
videos we play or drunk are high.

764
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,730
Hi. We're having anything is everybody
else gets weighed in. Great here. Beers,

765
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,040
use the research on Tullamarine pupils
are dilated. Then you just go with that.

766
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:25,340
Oh, why won't you do it with me? I
don't need that question answered.

767
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:28,490
I need right now, right now.
Right now. Right now. Right
now. Right now. Right now,

768
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,360
after 3000 doors giving food away to
the homeless, I think I deserve it.

769
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,420
I think I'm entitled Bloke and
I think that I deserve it. Now.

770
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,140
I'm not going to believe in
your diet or in, you know,

771
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,990
and since I'm not going to
believe in fate and either.

772
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,050
I just want to hear right now, right
now, right now. Right now. Right now.

773
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,620
This is a good one for doctor [inaudible].

774
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,240
I was literally just putting this
on the doctor drew list. Yeah.

775
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,860
I think he's going to say drugs,

776
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:54,250
but I think he's also going to talk about
mental illness is in that first video.

777
00:49:54,321 --> 00:49:56,870
I didn't think it was mentally ill.
I just thought he was kind of a snobbish.

778
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,020
Yeah, I thought it was
kind of a narcissist. Yeah.

779
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,150
I'm going to go with the double header
of double hitter of cocaine is drugs and

780
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:11,060
mania. He might be bipolar. Yeah. Some
kind of an episode happened in here. Yeah.

781
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,220
Well that's definitely one for drew.

782
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,040
Yeah. Wow. Hold on. There's a little
bit more of a, see what else this is,

783
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,690
we need to get rid of this age will be
from chicks under the age 26 because it

784
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:26,100
tell him Murray's research, the father's
35 to 55 you couldn't live longer,

785
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:28,460
have longer telomeres,
more dinner.

786
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,490
We need to get rid of it and like we
need to get rid of incest and pedophilia.

787
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:32,720
We need to get rid of it right now.

788
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:33,663
Get rid of,
what

789
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,660
did you catch that he said we need to
get rid of something at the beginning.

790
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,340
We need to get rid of
this page will be okay.

791
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:44,980
Age Phobia. Phobia. Yeah. He looks like
the incredible hulk right now. Yeah.

792
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,490
And the choice to go shirtless and a
video is always a bold one and it's always

793
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,120
an indicator. Yes. Um, and we,
we've seen that many times.

794
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:59,980
Back ground lighting in the drill
was shirtless. Try it out guys.

795
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,410
Shirtless. Yeah. Right. There's a
lot of, there's a repetition here.

796
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,010
Consistency with shirtless. Sure.
You know, who doesn't post shirtless?

797
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,250
Former presidents.
Ceos.

798
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,210
Yes. Anyone not high. I mean, look
at those pupils. Ooh. Yeah. They're,

799
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,870
they're pretty big right now.
He's really in a mania.

800
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,230
Oh, you're only having sex.
You're telling Murray's abundant.

801
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,100
You're just going to get
stressed and anger and,

802
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:31,120
and make everybody depressed and stressed
and angry as you roll with the guy and

803
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,240
just go fly.
And later in life you have cancer.

804
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,270
I want a hottie in my lap right now.
Right now. Right now. Right now,

805

He's just went from 26 to
18 did you notice it? Yeah.

808
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:50,010
The age keeps getting lower under 26
originally and then he goes 18 I'm like,

809
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:54,460

He's a good ad guy. He is.

838
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,860
He's the ad man who knew.
Yup. Yup, Yup. Yeah. No,

839
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:37,110
don't tell me you know something. Tommy.

840
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,410
Uh, speaking of mental
illness, how about this person?

841
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,450
The video seems like it
staggers a little bit.

842
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:44,880
I don't know what that's all about,
but check out this lady.

843
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:47,220
Here I am a sole fork.

844
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,720
What that means is from nonphysical
energy. So most people in the planet,

845
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:55,710
there are nonphysical energy
that is projected forth
into a physical human body.

846
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,510
I am nonphysical energy.
This perfect projected fourth
and two and arturian body.

847
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,800
An extra terrestrial body. Hmm. It's a
mom last night I like to hear more. Okay.

848
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,450
Lucky for you.
An extra terrestrial.

849
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,060
Damian has chosen to then project
forth as a human body 12 times.

850
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,360
This is the 12th incarnation.
It's quite funny and ironically,

851
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:18,030
because before I even came down,

852
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,110
there was an entire control of beings,
arturian beings,

853
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,160
six dimensional beings who even chose
the way I would look in this life.

854
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,733
I just,

855
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm also kind of fascinated where you
acquire the vocabulary to speak like

856
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:36,200
arturians this before. Actually, it's
not just one word I'm saying. You know,

857
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:36,580
she,

858
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,580
she's able to speak freely with
some command of basically language.

859
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:47,960
Most people don't.
It's a glossary of nonsense.

860
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,730
That's a great title for your next album.

861
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,850
I love it. Yeah. Yeah. It's like
how does she come? How did they,

862
00:54:56,851 --> 00:55:00,750
I guess all these Weirdos that buy in
to this shit or she's read some weird,

863
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,790
she read some bullshit book
about, you know, the, the Seti,

864
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,630
whatever messages of
extra terrestrials the,

865
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,890
now there's a whole subculture want
to go full circle on this episode.

866
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,510
It's basically no different than
the Bible. Just a bunch of nonsense.

867
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,580
Did what now? What are you talking
about? The same. It's the same thing.

868
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,070
Kinda.
Would you like to know what,

869
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,460
so I came down here with the intention
of reaching people in every single

870
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:33,720
continent. They like to pay attention
to what's attractive, right?

871
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,210
But based on where you are geographically,

872
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:38,550
certain things are attractive and
certain things are unattractive.

873
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:40,980
So a really beautiful
woman down in Africa. Mike,

874
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:45,420
come up here to us and be
considered pretty ugly down there.

875
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:49,260
Why is it we up?
We see in the continent of Africa,

876
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,600
not all down there.
Well,

877
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:55,963
the earth is flat.

878
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,290
It's not like my looks are so
gorgeous to one demographic over.

879
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,340
Another demographic is that there will
not be a person on the planet regardless

880
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:08,850
of what country you go to that does not
perceive some level of attractiveness.

881
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,940
Gus, they'll pay attention.
She basically just said,

882
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:16,270
I'm attractive to any to everyone
on earth. Oh, oh, okay. I, I like,

883
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:20,580
I didn't want to devote the mental energy
to figuring out what horseshit she's

884
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,530
talking about. She said that she like
I out halfway through it I was like,

885
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,700
I don't, I have, he said, I'm attractive
to iron on earth. To some degree.

886
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,500
That is what this person just
said about themselves. Cool.

887
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,300
I'm attracted to everyone.

888
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,500
18 to 26 we could set her
up with $1,000 state guy.

889
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,620
They seem like a couple of delusional.
At the very least,

890
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,720
people we've heard of make $1,000.
Hey, that's money in my pocket.

891
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:49,510
She might not be under 26 now. She's too
old for him. How will you think she is?

892
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,580
32 oh yeah, she's way too fucking
old. One foot in the grave,

893
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,360
a soul fork.

894
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,780
This is the 12th incarnation.
Oh Wow. Yeah. Those are drugs.

895
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:08,380
Right? Or maybe she's just sick, you know?

896
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:13,180
And I also think there's just
people that are so wounded and they,

897
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,790
they really just need
something to believe in.

898
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:20,791
And like aliens and incarnations
and spiritual forks and all like,

899
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:25,390
you know, I am a spiritual fork. Okay.

900
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,160
Okay. Hey Man, it's your world.
You got it. Yeah, go for it.

901
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,590
I can bullshit. Speaking a
spiritual forks. I was in, um,

902
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,630
the airport and I saw a woman
wearing a house slippers,

903
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:41,640
like fuzzy house slippers.
And it's actually not the
first time I've seen that.

904
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:46,210
It's, I've been seeing a trend of young
girls wearing like house slippers out.

905
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,080
It's kind of a thing now. Yeah,
I've seen that a lot more. Right.

906
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,920
It's not the open tonus cause
somebody commented like,

907
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,550
Oh do you hate feet is Otr as
like now it's not the feet.

908
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:01,900
It's that these shoes are not meant
to be worn out in the streets.

909
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,200
They're covered. They have an open back,
you know. So sorry. Which one? Slippers.

910
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,370
Just having an open back.
That's what these were. These
were like fuzzy slippers,

911
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:13,630
like you know, old school, 1960s fuzzy
slippers. So they were, there was no heel.

912
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,300
It was just like a Shitty, it's a
trend. It's a shitty flip flop. Yeah.

913
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,630
Not even a flip flop. It's got that
one bar so your toes are exposed,

914
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:26,830
your heels exposed. It's really not
a supportive shoe. It's a crummy,

915
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:30,010
a soul. You know, I've seen it.
I've seen all different versions.

916
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:34,000
I've seen the Sandal version where you
see the whole foot, but it's just covered.

917
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:37,780
It's like fuzzy. But I've also seen
like the house slipper, in other words,

918
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,980
your foot slides into it. Oh God.
Oh right. Yeah. It opened back only.

919
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,820
But it's clearly a slipper.
But I think it's just,

920
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,240
I think it's a fad where the the fad
is like the more that's meant for home,

921
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,730
the more you're seeing it out.
Yes.

922
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,760
I'm saying that it's a statement like
this is such relaxed where I take it out

923
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:02,480
cause that's how chill I am.
Right.

924
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,030
I wear my pj's and my slippers when
I'm out and I saw a lot of boys wearing

925
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:09,850
pajama bottoms, like
straight jammies. Oh yeah.

926
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:14,200
I like to really like Jeff [inaudible]
did a standup in them a few weeks ago. No,

927
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:18,580
he didn't. No bottoms on stage. Yeah.
Wow. It's Jeff tape. He could pull it off.

928
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,950
I'm just saying that's how relaxed he is.
He's that guy though.

929
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:24,600
You believe that he just rolled
out of bed and did stand out? Yeah.

930
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:29,510
Well I mean like it is diet. Look at his
whole Gatorade on stage. He did. Yeah.

931
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,270
Gatorade and hot dogs. Hot
Dogs. We did bring Gatorade.

932
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,340
You know what I remember about that week
that he stayed with us besides when we

933
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:40,220
lived next door to a seven 11 that's
all he ate. But that's how we got that.

934
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,360
You're saying, excuse me, is that
when he would drink the red Gatorade,

935
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:48,500
he would have a ring around his lips,
red and his beard.

936
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,110
It would like the color would
bleed into his beard too. Yeah.

937
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,420
So it was kind of a neat bonus with the
Gatorade drinking Gatorade and he had

938
00:59:56,421 --> 01:00:00,530
the full sugar, not even like the g
two, which is what you like to get.

939
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,980
Like when you're sick you get
like the lesser sugar Gatorade,

940
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,610
like serious diarrhea. Yeah. Uh,

941
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:12,260
then I will have some electrolytes,
electrolytes.

942
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,260
The GTO drink it regularly.
I don't like, no, no.

943
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:19,280
We have it as an emergency for
when you have diarrhea, diarrhea,

944
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,980
like Chicago,
Chicago.

945
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:27,290
The funniest thing is we were joking about
Chicago once about like as a nickname

946
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,910
for it. And I kind of laughed at it and
didn't really, you know, he's like, oh,

947
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:31,820
he has a joke name.

948
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:36,620
And then I went to the
airport and this lady,

949
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:40,520
it's a lady in the United Terminal.
Uh,

950
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:42,440
if you fly United out of lax,

951
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:47,890
she's a black lady in maybe her
somewhere between 45 and 55 and she wears

952
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:52,670
sunglasses. But they're clearly
like prescription sunglasses,

953
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,480
but she wears them at the gate.
So you,

954
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,010
she stands out because you're right,

955
01:00:58,011 --> 01:01:03,011
the woman has sunglasses on and she was
like flat 1528 to Chicago was born in

956
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:09,230
now she said it and I was like,
Oh yeah, what? And anyways,

957
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,250
I saw her a couple of weeks ago and
I said, is there a flight to Chicago?

958
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,270
Because Chicago goes out of gate 57.
Yeah.

959
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:22,160
I approached her and such a
car and she to Chicago. Well,

960
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,170
I hear,
I've heard lots of people say Chicago.

961
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,420
I think I didn't really pay
attention to the series.

962
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:29,390
Oh cause that's one of the first
ones that I really, I mean,

963
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:31,490
I saw her do it over a year ago,

964
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,020
but I wasn't really key on
Chicago. Oh No, I've heard it.

965
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:40,880
It's very prevalent. It's a common,
a common thing. People say Chicago.

966
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:46,460
Oh yeah, I've heard Washington,
Washington. I've heard that
too. And it's like, wait,

967
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,810
what? That's terrible.
And uh, Euston my dad's.

968
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,570
But when Washington is,
it's not forgivable.

969
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:00,320
It's not worship when you cancel a
friendship for sure. So it was like,

970
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:05,240
I'm going to Washington, Washington.
Nice, stupid. Fuck. It's not Washington.

971
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,620
It's not Chicago. Chicago. Why do you,
why are you throwing a heart in there?

972
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:12,140
Why people do,
but why?

973
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,720
Why are you adding a letter
that's not even remotely close to?

974
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:20,980
What I hate to is people who call San
Francisco Frisco because the natives do

975

does she entered? Double Anal.

994
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,350
I think she's just your run of the mill.
Like what do you need to do?

995
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,400
What do I need to do today?

1005

Name Peyton Lafferty. I wish you'd
think of my show business. Yeah.

1012
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,020
I don't think she, I mean according
to this thing, here she is,

1013
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:50,340
she did a few different things.
I don't want to pull up a porn thing.

1014
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:55,350
Is there such a thing as like a porn star?
Wikipedia kind of took us there.

1015
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:58,640
You can see there I MDB and stuff. Oh
you can? Yeah. Yeah, there is. Yeah,

with showing it Baja Og.

1018
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,260
See what you see a lot farther.

1019
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:14,830
Like you see here we go, QT

Pain Lafferty outside sucking
hard dick. Yeah. Pain laugh.

1022
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,480
Are you bouncing her bubble blood on a
hard cock? So it's pretty run of the mill.

1023
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,710
There's nothing sucking Dick.
The category small.

1024
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:34,390
It's hardcore anal. Yeah. It's
pretty run of the mill. No soon.

1025

Deep Ass screwing things. Yeah. Yeah.

1026
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,740
She did her thing and stuff like that.

1027
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:46,330
That will always be remembered
as a ball hog. I feel like she,

1028
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:49,960
that site said she retired.
Yeah. No longer in the game.

1029
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,780
I don't know. And she's so young. She
current career is just beginning. No,

1030
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,920
she's in her thirties some porn that's,

1031
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,790
You ready to do your Guelph porn,

1033
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:11,380
She loved man.
Oh yeah.

1034
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,040
She's one of the real prize class brass.

1035
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,250
Where's she from?
Kim?

1036
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:23,530
It was Kim.

1037
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:27,700
And remember she,
she definitely says it in that one video.

1038
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:32,590
We used to play Fam Thailand's yeah,
I think so.

1039
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,800
Hi,
I'm Kim

1040
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,230
and I'm here to fill.

1041
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:42,310
This is such a beautiful villa.

1042
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:47,550
The villa we sitting with the first time
ever experience in my life with young

1043
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,060
men and they have big,

1044
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,450
hard car to offer me.

1045
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:04,180
This villa is really quaint
place and it's really,

1046
01:07:06,501 --> 01:07:11,501
really comfortable with a lot of artifacts
inside the house as well as outside

1047
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:14,640
the

1048
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,110
viewers.

1049
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:18,410
I want to go do you think that the men
watching are super stoked to hear about

1050
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:20,180
the artifacts?
Probably.

1051
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:25,430
Probably a lot of art collectors and we
watched all the money in the world last

1052
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:28,710
night. Great. How funny was
that? Well, we're halfway.

1053
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:33,530
I fell asleep halfway through it,
but John, Eddie, you're good friends.

1054
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:38,270
Mark Walberg is in it. Sorry.
You were just talking about
it from my friends with,

1055
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:43,000
um, that's one of my
good friends. So anyways,

1056
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,690
my buddy marks in it and
I'm kind of out of shape.

1057
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,790
Yeah. I'm going to tell him not really in
shape and you're getting fat again. Uh,

1058
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:56,930
who plays the mom? Michelle
Williams. Gosh, she's so great.

1059
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:02,020
She's great in it. This is
the infamous film that, uh,

1060
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:06,680
Kevin Spacey last shot about 50 days.

1061
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:11,240
It was shot ready to go, ready to be
released 47 days before it's release.

1062
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:16,250
This the, it comes out that he's
trying to fuck accused the fucking

1063
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:20,220
teenage boy under age boys.
And he's a huge,

1064
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:25,460
huge how allegedly allegedly
allegedly harassing people,

1065
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:29,960
allegedly going after
underage guys for a long time.

1066
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,370
Anyway, that, that's
the storyline. They go,

1067
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,160
we can't do this movie with Kevin Spacey.
It's all ready to go.

1068
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:41,390
It's edited already.
So then Ridley Scott,

1069
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,840
the director says,
I'm going to reshoot all of his scenes.

1070
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,540
This isn't already
completed films so crazy.

1071
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,360
And he cast Christopher
plummer at as the reshoot.

1072
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,230
Uh,

1073
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:58,760
so they have to bring in actors that
he's obviously in scenes with and reshoot

1074
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:02,720
those again, those scenes. Girl, boy,
boy, girl. Right. But isn't that amazing?

1075
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:07,430
So what they did was the editors sent the,

1076
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:12,580
edited the scenes with spacey to set
and they would see how they were lit,

1077
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:17,690
see how they were blocked, shot
everything. And then they would mimic,

1078
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:22,010
they'd go to the same space that they
just had and they would reshoot it

1079
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,130
basically exactly the way they did before.

1080
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:28,160
But with Christopher plummer
instead of Kevin Spacey, it's crazy.

1081
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:28,911
The thing of course,

1082
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:33,230
it's amazing is that even though spacey
is a bigger star than plummer, I mean,

1083
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:37,640
you watch plumber and he's actually
an elderly man playing an elderly man,

1084
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,760
which makes sense, right? As opposed to,

1085
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:42,820
he was all in makeup to
make them look older,

1086
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,510
but the character was amazing.

1087
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,340
It was based on the real
John Paul Getty who, uh,

1088
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:55,580
was a infamously wealthy and stingy man.

1089
01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:00,590
And he had such, like, there
was some things we were
really laughing at like, uh,

1090
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,320
as well as I am sure a lot
of rich people experience,

1091
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:08,321
they get letters about peoples hardships
and want to know if the rich person can

1092
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:11,360
help them. So this, you
know, they're in the movie,

1093
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,770
he has his grandson reading him a letter
that someone wrote, dear Mr Getty,

1094
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,230
you know, my, uh, brother needs
a liver or he's going to die.

1095
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,940
And I would hope that you can help
us out. God bless. And he's like,

1096
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:29,990
he dictates to his grandson.
He's like, write dear. So and so.

1097
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:35,500
If I gave money to everybody that asked
for help and I'd be destitute like you,

1098
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,930
I also so funny that made us laugh so
hard. What a shit head that'd be poor.

1099
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:45,010
Like you.
Boy,

1100
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,340
it would be important some of the
vigil you and you know what I mean?

1101
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:47,961
One of the things,

1102
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:50,120
I mean there's not that necessarily
didn't necessarily have it,

1103
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:55,121
but in real life when his grandson was
really kidnapped and the kidnappers did

1104
01:10:56,901 --> 01:11:00,710
demand ransom,
he wouldn't pay his own grandson.

1105
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,100
And you know in the movie they have him
saying things that he probably really

1106
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:08,690
said, which was like, I'm not paying
that. And they go, even when his,

1107
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:13,560
a guy that works for him is like, you
know, it's a drop in the bucket to you.

1108
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:17,310
And he's like, no, because if this
thing doesn't work out, I'd be exposed.

1109
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:20,040
I don't really have any money
to spare things like that.

1110
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,030
Or he had a pay phone in his house for
guests. That was great. Yeah, that's real.

1111
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:24,920
That's real.
He had,

1112
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,950
he had a real pitiful in so that you
wouldn't make long distance calls on his

1113
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,784
dime

1114
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,690
and then he would do his own laundry by
hand and hang it up in the hotel room.

1115
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,120
Now it's amazing.
Yeah.

1116
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:39,850
It's such an interesting personality
trait to have so much money. The,

1117
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,800
I had billions of dollars and
yet he wouldn't spend, it was,

1118
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,100
I wonder what's going on.
But you know, he'd been,

1119
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:48,770
he lived this very luxurious,
I mean,

1120
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,160
the homes and they were
outrageous, you know, and he's,

1121
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,140
he was perhaps the greatest art
collector in the world. I mean,

1122
01:11:57,141 --> 01:12:01,040
you look at the Getty museum's now
and it's unbelievable what was in his

1123
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:06,020
personal collection, but he wouldn't
spend it on, he'd spend it on art,

1124
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:09,110
but not on, you know, laundry
service. I mean, like, yeah.

1125
01:12:09,111 --> 01:12:11,090
Little convenience is like that.
I mean,

1126
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,250
see, to me, that's the only reason
to have mine. That is the reason.

1127
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,970
Can you park closer?
Yeah. And uh, you know,

1128
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:22,440
it's $25 to park here. Okay. Can I
not do my own laundry? Like that's,

1129
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:24,390
that's fantastic.
That's why you have money.

1130
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,730
You don't have to do all
those annoying things in life.

1131
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:31,590
He a, yeah, it's gross. When someone's
that rich and his pension at that heart.

1132
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,360
Oh my line billionaire. I don't like
that at all. I don't like that either.

1133
01:12:35,361 --> 01:12:37,970
What's the point? What are you willing
to do with all your money? I hate,

1134
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:38,270
I hate it.

1135
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,980
What I hear, I mean, I guess I like cars,

1136
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:44,150
but I also hate when I hear about rich
guys drive in like whack ass cars and

1137
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:49,040
like the fuck is wrong with you man. I
love cars. I know that, but this ones,

1138
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,580
it's really reliable. I get
great mileage. Make you rich,

1139
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:55,130
the fuck are you doing man?
Live a little.

1140
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:55,971
I know.

1141
01:12:55,971 --> 01:13:00,920
I get upset when I hear rich people not
spending money on like education for

1142
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:03,170
their kids or they're like, we're sending
kids to public school. I'm like, yeah,

1143
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,320
but it in California and a nice,
I know that some public schools are great,

1144
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:10,940
but where we live it's really
not fantastic for the most part.

1145
01:13:10,941 --> 01:13:14,990
It depends on your neighborhood, right?
But it's like to just spend the money.

1146
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,970
I'll fucking send your
kid somewhere. Nice. Yes.

1147
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:21,210
If it's a, if it's, it's a, it's eat
that. Well, it depends on which, uh,

1148
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,540
what part of the country
and what, what, you know.

1149
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,860
Yes. No, I know. I know, but
I'm saying that there's a,

1150
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,950
I'm thinking of a specific
family. Oh, that we know. Yeah.

1151
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:34,000
One of the best schools I ever went to
was a public school. It wasn't California.

1152
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:38,710
That's true. Bottom of the barrel. That
shit. There's definitely a New York,

1153
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:43,710
New York is good. No, there's
some like regional. Yes.
Obviously. But yeah, I don't,

1154
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,820
it know, that's my, I actually wish I
could have gone to that school from,

1155
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,200
we went about. What about people
that don't fix their teeth?

1156
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:53,630
The have all the money in the world.
That's fucking crazy. We've seen people,

1157
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,670
we know people like that.

1158
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,420
Yeah. So it's, it's nuts. I know
where you're like, you don't want to,

1159
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,500
it's what everybody sees. First thing
they see your fucking dirty mouth. Yeah.

1160
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,920
Fix it.
Get your two fees fixed.

1161
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,530
They're colored and
there's holes in there.

1162
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:12,550
It doesn't look like you
know how any of it works.

1163
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,190
[inaudible] you will see some wild shit.

1164
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:20,740
This guy who also doctor drew could give
an evaluation and I'll put that on the

1165
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:24,730
list. Goes to in the Burger King Margaret
came and he kind of start some shit.

1166
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,313
Hey.

1167
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:43,080
Yeah,
look at that though.

1168
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:45,791
Oh,

1169
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:50,440
so he is talking shit knocking shit off
the counter and I think he just pushed

1170
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:53,980
her register off the counter. Oh,
that's a pretty aggressive. Okay.

1171
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,333
Pretty good

1172
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:03,590
clock him.

1173
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:13,000
He's kind of thing on his leg like a
brace. He was being all aggressive.

1174
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:17,440
I know that too. Just clocked him
hard. Yeah. Well he needed it. Okay.

1175
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,540
To calm the fuck down.
Hold on a second.

1176
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:20,703
No,

1177
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,680
we're standing on his head.
He ain't,

1178
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,320
he's got a good reason to Jesus Christ.
Come on up.

1179
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:37,670
I say stay on that fucker's right.
She said no, just to get up.

1180
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:39,140
I'm going to tase his ass.
Yeah.

1181
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,610
Good for her. Crazy mother fucker. Good.

1182
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:51,220
He's crazy. He's out of control. Oh, she

1183
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:53,650
came up.

1184
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:57,530
She's just kicked him again.
Yeah,

1185
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,410
I dunno how funny this is Tom.
Huh?

1186
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:01,933
Okay.

1187
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:07,050
What part's funny? So you were
getting tased or kits? Well,

1188
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,890
it's just that he's getting
it because he deserves it.

1189
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:14,070
He went in there and started
some shit and then stranger,

1190
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,450
like that guy that just came in and
slapped him doesn't work though.

1191
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:21,330
He's just a patron that was
like, oh, I can get in a slapped.

1192
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,370
So she just, first of all, it's one
thing if you act out and then like,

1193
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:30,720
like that first guy punched him because
he, he, he shoved him first. It's like,

1194
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:34,050
all right, now he's laying on the
ground and someone was like, hold on,

1195
01:16:34,051 --> 01:16:36,420
I'm going to tase them.
Like he's already down.

1196
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:40,020
So she goes to tase him and then she

1197
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,330
gets in a little phase and
then this guy comes in slack,

1198
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:52,130
kicked and tased again. Ooh. Oh.

1199
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:56,060
I do think the slap was unnecessary.
The head slap. It was, it was,

1200
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:59,780
that was a bonus. Slap wheelies, a bonus
lab. He didn't need that at that point.

1201
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,510
Not entirely,
but you can justify it for sure.

1202
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,870
I definitely think the Taser was good.
That was a good move on her part.

1203
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,860
Tasing some ass. Go girl. Get them again.

1204
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,360
This guy's out of his fucking mind.
Yeah. Get out of their asshole.

1205
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,433
Good for them.

1206
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,070
Yeah. Defend your soul book. And he
has something. He just, this is his,

1207
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,050
this thing here at the end. He just
grabbed something there. Oh, Mike,

1208
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,940
something like he parked there. Can
you see what it is? I don't know.

1209
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:33,780
Like a wheelchair or a little wheely
thing for all the A's. I got like a scoot.

1210
01:17:33,781 --> 01:17:38,700
Scoot for his leg. Oh yeah. Of scoots
goods has a scoot scoot and he's,

1211
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:43,650
he's talking shit and burger king
is crazy. Wow. That's pretty wild.

1212
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:48,510
Yeah. Well Deb, shit, that was great.

1213
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:50,190
Start some shit made my day.

1214
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,730
I don't know if I feel the
same way, but really, I mean,

1215
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,140
I just wish she hadn't had done
that in the first place, I guess.

1216
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,550
I mean, you know, you go into Burger King,

1217
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:06,551
someone says you go into
Burger King on one leg yelling,

1218
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,320
push it off the counter, uh, start
talking shit, getting peeves,

1219
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,920
people's faces. How do you
think it's going to go? Right?
Like, is that a good idea?

1220
01:18:16,921 --> 01:18:18,000
I'd be like,
mm,

1221
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,780
gotta be so retarded.
I don't think I would do that.

1222
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:26,060
So he's definitely started some shit.
Shit.

1223
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,920
Some shit. Crazy person.
Yeah. That's completely
unnecessary. Well good for them.

1224
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:35,170
They defended themselves. Psych. I could
have gone way, way crazier to man. Um,

1225
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,940
somebody wrote to us on or something.
You want to answer that?

1226
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:41,990
Why don't dogs have to wipe? I
have a question for you. Mommy's,

1227
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:46,010
why do dogs not have to wipe
their ass after pooping?

1228
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,480
But humans do. Justin from
Portland. Yeah. Well I don't know.

1229
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,110
I don't know because I actually think
our dogs need a wiping sometimes because

1230
01:18:54,111 --> 01:18:58,220
we've actually had the white bits.
He's a pooper after, after a shit.

1231
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:03,530
So they kind of do sometimes I'm guessing
because their glands or anal glands

1232
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:07,790
are stronger, maybe able to
pinch it really comes off, right?

1233
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,160
Yeah.
But like I've said,

1234
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:14,230
we've had the butts stamp on
several pieces of furniture
in this house. So yeah,

1235
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,050
it's remember at fie fuse to
do it a lot back in Redondo,

1236
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,310
we had a carpet that I got from like
some cheapy place, Ikea or something.

1237
01:19:22,311 --> 01:19:23,080
It was covered in

1238
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,840
dog shit. And that means my
brother or sister in law.

1239
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:28,600
And I were wondering what
you thought about which, uh,

1240
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:33,660
which of a conjoined twin pair would
have to push to piss the person you

1241
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,530
horrified by even entertain the subject.

1242
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:40,750
But I'm sure we are not the only curious
ones about the question. I mean a mommy,

1243
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:44,260
Tina tore it up an SLC, uh,
best show I've ever seen it.

1244
01:19:44,261 --> 01:19:46,890
Wise guys ever and way to go.
Thank you. Thank you for the car.

1245
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:49,090
Well that's an interesting question.

1246
01:19:49,091 --> 01:19:53,560
They're saying who initiated the puss
when they're, when they're conjoined.

1247
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:56,140
But from what I've seen from the
interviews with conjoined twins,

1248
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:58,450
all those questions about who does what,

1249
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,720
it's one of the phenomenons of
what happens. It's neither one.

1250
01:20:01,721 --> 01:20:03,310
They both do it at the same time.

1251
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,710
So you're telling me they both feel
the urge to shit and they both just,

1252
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,320
it's the same. Like how do you
know which leg to put in front of?

1253
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:14,180
Like who goes first? It's just,
it just happens on radical. Yeah.

1254
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,600
So there's some things like you,

1255
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:19,740
you just have an automatic body
whereas they share those organs.

1256
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,280
And then who initiates masturbation?
That's the same thing.

1257
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:25,920
It's like I feel like coming and the
other ones like me too and then they just

1258
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:26,754
go for it.

1259
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:34,110
Some of those hoes are
married. Those co-joined. Yeah,

1260
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,870
those co-joined thoughts are married.
Yeah.

1261
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:43,340
Even I know that's silly.

1262
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,600
True. Do you think so? No, they are.

1263
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:51,870
One of them's married and the other one's
not. I think two of them got married.

1264
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:54,480
How the fuck that guy
marries both of them.

1265
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:59,370
Then he married one and then when she's
just along for the whole marriage.

1266
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:03,480
Right. Of course. That's how
they live their life. That's
terrible. So she wouldn't,

1267
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,950
she would if she doesn't
want to be married, that guy,

1268
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:09,570
cause she's married that guy to know the,
they both have their own husbands.

1269
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,310
God, you're just blowing my mind right
now. So they all say goodnight, goodnight,

1270
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,170
goodnight. And then those guys end
up being like, hey man, all the time.

1271
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,510
Who's going to fuck her?
But did they have one vagina or to

1272
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,540
stop it so the guys take turns.
It's like my night, it's my night.

1273
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,710
Sometimes I go in there together.
No, they doubt. Sure they do.

1274
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:37,870
Yeah, they do. She doesn't do
dps. I didn't see that as a DP.

1275
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,530
Double Vag. I'm sure our
audience will inform us of
whether or not she's gone. Oh,

1276
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,170
I know there's a lot of experts out there.
I can hear them typing right now.

1277
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:51,230
He hasn't found it was released March
8th two guys get your information strain.

1278
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:58,380
You guys are not fact checking on this.
Yeah, we know. We need to know the truth.

1279
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:02,760
Want to get to the real state in Lafferty.

1280
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:08,180
Lafata I'm a ball hog.
I am paid 10 Lafferty.

1281
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:15,990
It's too bad she's in retirement.
I feel like we just boosted her career.

1282
01:22:15,991 --> 01:22:19,910
You know what? I know I would. I would
have her in studio just to talk about,

1283
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:21,540
talk about that clip that day.

1284
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:24,210
How'd that feel to be a ball
hog and what was that like?

1285
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:29,100
Was it funny to you when they told you
about the, I mean those poor women,

1286
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:31,560
cause it's dumb things they have to say.
And men actually,

1287
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:35,540
there's all these silly things. I mean
you, you gotta be able to sell those diet.

1288
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:36,540
Let's stupid dialogue.

1289
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,860
Just like on any TV show or thing you're
doing with those balls. Yeah. Yeah.

1290
01:22:40,861 --> 01:22:45,570
Like it's all part of Showbiz.
What's up Mr High and Mrs Tight.

1291
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:51,050
Big Old fan of both. You notice y'all
burp some times on the podcast? Yeah,

1292
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,270
I can't do that for as long as
I can remember. I rarely, Burt,

1293
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:58,380
I've tried many times. Please friends
have described how to do it and nothing.

1294
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:01,260
I can't drink a lot of beer
at a time because of it.

1295
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,990
I just get full when it happened.

1296
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,410
What happens is I will Burt maybe once
or twice a month and even then they are

1297
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,450
always puny little wimpy burps.

1298
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:14,170
This means the odds of me being
blessed with a double pipe classic.

1299
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:18,310
Extremely rare. It makes me sad now
when it comes to farts. Oh my God.

1300
01:23:18,311 --> 01:23:22,810
Do I fart a lot. That's my gut is
a toxic waste pant plant. Anyway,

1301
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:26,500
just thought I'd let you know. Keep up the
good work. Gene Salute Jake. Well yeah,

1302
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,660
I think you just nailed
it, right? So it's going,

1303
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:33,420
it's going down instead of going up. He
just didn't ever goes up for him. Yeah,

1304
01:23:33,421 --> 01:23:36,530
I mean I'd be sad. Well,
without burps I have,

1305
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:41,110
I know somebody very dear to me and
get close to me who can't burp either.

1306
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:44,020
It's a girl and I've tried for a year.

1307
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:48,580
It's been like situation like I
don't want, I won't go there. Okay.

1308
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,060
But I've tried training her
and we tried sewed. I've tried.

1309
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:54,430
There's different things you can do.
You can,

1310
01:23:56,910 --> 01:24:00,940
I say it'd be okay,
but you can't suck in the air.

1311
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:04,390
You can train yourself to burp that way.
See,

1312
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,440
I just did that on command.
I can do this guy says he can.

1313
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,760
He drinks a soda and nothing happens.

1314
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:13,030
What happens is he farts
choosing to go down.

1315
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,910
But you think that's like what is going
on in this person's body where that

1316
01:24:15,911 --> 01:24:19,180
happened? It's just the way they're
built and yeah, it sounds like it.

1317
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,700
I mean I don't Burp as
much now that I'm pregnant.

1318
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:25,080
I think cause I have so much acid
reflux happening and I don't want a burb

1319
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,780
look at you. You just did
that. You just did that.

1320
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:32,080
That would have made his whole
year. Wow. Maybe it just did.

1321
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:36,310
I think some people are more inclined
to be burpee than others. It's a gift.

1322
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:40,450
It's a genetic blessing. All
right. Yeah. I don't know.

1323
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,140
You can train. I mean, you
have to suck up the air.

1324
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,750
Have you tried sucking
it up from your stomach?

1325
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:52,000
Like I just did that. Yeah. I don't
understand. Just I just did that.

1326
01:24:52,001 --> 01:24:56,290
Swallow more air and then put the swallow.
It's not, he said that he swallows air.

1327
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,740
It's bringing it up and does and to
sound that's causing him trouble.

1328
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,150
I don't know how to teach it.
I don't know how to teach it though.

1329
01:25:02,151 --> 01:25:05,800
I feel like there's just some things
that you just know in life, you know?

1330
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:11,810
I agree. It's an innate
skill, guys. I just is.

1331
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:16,390
He's just not your calling now, next
lifetime or anything else, June?

1332
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:21,700
No. All right. How about you, Eugene? I'm
good. Yeah, we've got to wrap it up. Okay,

1333
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,550
let's go finish our John Paul Getty
movie. Okay. Alright. I love you.

1334
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:33,330
I love you.
I love you.

1335
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,360
It's a stupid, Huh? All right. Bye guys.

1336
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:40,030
Thanks for listening to the
show and see you next time.
