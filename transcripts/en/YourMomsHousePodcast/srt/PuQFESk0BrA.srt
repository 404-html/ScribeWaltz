Let's get this party started.

41
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,660
Alexa,
what do you look for in a man?

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Black guys who look good.

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,240
If you were hot black guy and he
wanted me at 2195. If you want to move,

44
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,730
then you can move in, but you got
to me, I, I need to be a lot man.

45
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,100
Free Food, free rent and everything
else. Now here's the deal,

46
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:33,480
man. Then from jail, homeless
world, if you're a thug,

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,620
you want to come move in.
Your a friend can move in to rent.

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,450
You give a lease in a key me,
this on me. Beat me. Oh, here.

49
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:47,070
Now if you see me and you want to
come over today and try it out,

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
try it out. If you're in
my building, try it out.

51
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,840
If you want to piss on me,
no serious repairs.

52
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,460
Just me.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,770
I'm looking for hardcore guys and mean
it and want to do it and I want it

54
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:05,310
delivered. I'm a hot way
trash dump. That's him.

55
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,930
Well,
go to your mom's house,

56
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,353
Christina.

57
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,973
Wow.

58
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,780
I thought we were just
doing a little teaser.

59
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:06,560
I didn't realize were going
to get the whole, the whole
thing, the speech on that.

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,840
I thought it was just like, here's
the deal man. That's real quick. Yup.

61
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,430
Well I like Alexa saying.
Yeah.

62
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,960
And especially with the emotion taken
out of it, you really get a man,

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,300
you really get to understand
how crazy that guy is. Yeah.

64
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,830
And how absurd the, the speech actually
is. Oh yeah. With all the emotions

65
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,530
have no emotion. No. Just on a verbal,
like on the page level, you're like, wow,

66
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,950
this guy's really out of his
fucking be like reading the car.

67
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,470
Like if you're writing a
script and being like, yeah,

68
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,650
what am I gonna do with these words?
Yeah. I'm not sure what choice to make.

69
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,770
It's pretty amazing. Uh, I don't know
who did that. Do you know who, um,

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,320
put that together. Oh, no.
Shit. I'll, I'll look it up.
Okay. Yeah, we should probably,

71
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,180
I didn't know you could train Alexa
to turn your lights on and off to,

72
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,033
what was that all about?

73
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,050
Whereas the last

74
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,260
episode, Tom is a hard, hard dick.

75
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:06,210
Nick or whatever his fucking name is hard
hard shits nick.

76
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,230
Shit's nick. Yeah. Taking glass dumps.
Yeah. He was um, really something, right?

77
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,020
Yeah, man. Try it out.
Try it out. Try it out.

78
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,550
Your episode is on the beat me all man.
Out homie on yet.

79
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,360
But you know that now I think about him,
the tryout guy.

80
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,420
What? Yeah. I think about
him like once a week.

81
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,620
You should think about it
was that was home. You're no,

82
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,820
no home here? No. Leon. Yeah.

83
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,210
No hold man out as people think it's,
I think it's home here now. Yeah.

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,140
Oh me. No, I'm home. He and
now I'm home here now. Yeah.

85
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,010
I'm home here now. Uh, but I think about
him every now and then and I, you know,

86
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:55,011
what I really think about is how he's
managed to be this internet famous and he

87
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,491
hasn't reached out to us or like somebody
in his life has got to have heard it

88
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,840
at some point and been like, Hey, do you,

89
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,870
do you know that you're on this podcast
and these people are like talking about

90
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:10,200
this video. You May. And
he's like, oh yeah, I kind of
fucked out. That was silly.

91
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,130
Like, what do you think his
reaction? Oh God, it would be, oof,

92
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,970
it was garlic has it together
in any way whatsoever here.

93
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,150
Now guy is not, his life
is not like, oh yeah,

94
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:27,870
I finally pulled it together and
I can reflect back that time.

95
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,110
He's getting pissed on
and beat on right now.

96
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,460
But that's what I wonder too is
do you think his dreams came true?

97
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,570
Did he get what he wants?
Yeah, in some way. I don't
think someone moved in did it,

98
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,790
but I think, I think someone is, there's
probably a couple of ups guys, but like,

99
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,650
yeah, I've been in that building. You
on that guy beat the fuck out of them.

100
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,180
Do you think he found a black
guy who likes to flash? Who
Likes A and photo? Yeah.

101
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,590
Yeah.
Black guys at a jail.

102
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,680
That has to be the craziest
video besides Terry.

103
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,600
But even Terry is of sound mind.
He's just an exhibitionist.

104
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,840
Yeah.
Scotty Kay did the lox I clip,

105
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:10,670
so thank you Scotty k for
submitted that opening clip.

106
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,570
That was really good talent.
You got a real, yeah.

107
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,170
So a couple of weeks back I shared
a bold confession with Eugene.

108
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,190
Yeah, I can if I should. I
shared the for the first time,

109
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,260
Michelle. Fuck it. Oh
fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,580
Oh
dammit.

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,310
See that guy's lucid though. That guy is
just having a good day. Yeah, that's true.

112
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,670
He's cast came too fast.
I feel like the guy,

113
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,480
the try it out guy, he's trying
to improve his life. Yeah.

114
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,820
He's looking for the answer.

115
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:53,380
And the answer is black guys who like
to fuck and fuck gut. Yeah. Yeah.

116
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,160
You know, what was your
big confession? Oh,

117
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,420
so my big confession a couple of weeks
back is we all remember it was a y a

118
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,540
matrix inclusive,
uh,

119
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,160
that I had my very
first liquid chart ever,

120
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,750
ever in my life. It was a big deal.
Yeah. Yeah. And so interestingly enough,

121
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:14,751
this last weekend I ordered the same
exact meal that produced the first shirt.

122
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,650
Yeah.
And what it is,

123
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:21,651
I order from a company called Pizza Rev
and I get the cauliflower crust pizza

124
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,950
and I order all the meat toppings on
there. I get two types of Pepperoni,

125
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:30,210
spicy and regular.
I get the Italian sausage and garlic.

126
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,950
And what I noticed was because
I ate the same thing this time,

127
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,600
halfway through my meal,
I thought,

128
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,840
I think it might be the garlic
that's giving me diarrhea. Yeah.

129
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,320
And I took off the garlic
and lo and behold, yes,

130
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,590
I had runny dumps the next day.
But it wasn't bad.

131
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,560
It wasn't as bad as it was before.
And I think it's because of the garlic.

132
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:54,000
That's my, my hip hop. Sure. What are you
thinking? Uh, I think it's really neat.

133
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,180
I had a sharp scare.
Your kid in Washington,

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,790
a scarer legit sharp. Well,
here's what happened. So, wow,

135
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,670
I'm on the bus or about to get off
the bus to go into the theater.

136
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,210
I'm, I fart. Like I'm going to
rip it this far right now. Yeah.

137
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,750
And I'm like,
that's more than a fart.

138
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,020
And I panic because you
don't shit on the bus.

139
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,050
So I learned to like
shuffle over to the theater.

140
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,190
I dropped trout and I realized I don't
see anything in the underwear. I'm like,

141
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,440
God. But like I don't check my butt
cheeks. I just sit on a toilet,

142
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,350
but a disaster come out. Yeah.
Well, here's the thing, I,

143
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,090
I started having like a couple other
loose ones after that. I'm like fuck.

144
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,820
And this is like an hour before the show,
the first show.

145
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,070
So I asked them for Pepto, I, he's
drink some pepto drink a little soda.

146
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,310
You don't try it on. Yeah. And
then I'm okay. I do the first show,

147
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,530
I forget about it,
I forget about it.

148
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,690
Then I'm in the green room with Jeff
Tate and I go check this shit out.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,390
Ha fart.
And I feel

150
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,650
the same thing I might because I forgot

151
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,210
sketchy asshole. Oh yeah. And
so that's scary when you forget

152
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,730
a little more comes out. And again,
I got lucky with the underwear.

153
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,890
I didn't get any underwear but yeah,
I was,

154
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,070
it was definitely and I think I can
check out what it was, you know?

155
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,920
Yeah. Well it's probably just a
road week cause you were on the law.

156
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:22,460
A lot of different cities.
Bacteria,

157
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,510
cause I often forgot about my shark too
and I would fart in the kitchen again.

158
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,810
Like oh I better not now.
I don't want to,

159
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,580
I'm not going to write
out who in this office,

160
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:36,380
but somebody here also had a sharp, they
know they would prefer their identity.

161
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:37,610
You know,
there's a lot of charters here.

162
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,510
And it occurred to me that
because there's so much happening,

163
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:44,690
it's kind of a short week here.
It is for our week. Yeah. Yeah.

164
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,820
It's rare that there's a guest
coming in who I'm sure has. Sure.

165
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,770
If you told me to bet on it, I'd be like
$1 million. Let's ask him. He comes in,

166
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:58,480
how many sharks he's ever had. Well,
should we get into who's here and what,

167
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:02,610
what we've been talking
about? Of course, man. Um, um,

168
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,690
we have the great, uh, Bert Kreischer
is going to be joining us here. Um,

169
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,210
very funny,
very funny.

170
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,030
Also very fat as we all know and very
racist and we've been looking at pictures

171
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:18,160
of him. Oh my God, that's
him at the store. Gene.

172
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,890
That's him at the comedy store
during the main room. He's shirtless.

173
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:24,590
And that to me yesterday or
the day before to oo four,

174
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,340
that is not at snap. Now.
His belly is so distended,

175
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:34,430
swollen, like an African child
starving African version or him,

176
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,380
we will give birth.
All right.

177
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,830
Ooh Boy,
that's a big fat.

178
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,430
No Sunday at the last or
like a week ago in Vegas,

179
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:52,060
he posted that. I was like,
Jesus, he's so fat now.

180
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,150
Do you think Burness better now
than he was before you guys?

181
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:59,650
Weight loss competition.
Mm. Clothes is clothes.

182
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,950
It's not good. Whatever it is. You know
what's crazy though about his body?

183
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,880
You can tell that he's meant to
have like a rad body because,

184
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:10,880
do you see like his cutlines Joe,
what I'm saying like his hippo. It's,

185
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,900
it's weird because he still has like
chiseled doesn't wear underwear. Yeah.

186
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,140
He never does because he has that sensory
basically looking at a naked guy with

187
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:24,670
a cloth. Yeah. Yeah. But
do you see what I'm saying?

188
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,270
Then he's got that hipbone yeah.
Like Ryan Gosling has that.

189
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,340
You should tell him
that. He'll be like, Yo,

190
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,460
look at that guy in the front
row with the arm folded. Yeah.

191
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:41,400
He's looks guys discussing, hey, just sit
here. He's fat too. He's like, who's fat?

192
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,980
Burger meat.
Um,

193
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,250
so we, um, we were looking at like who,

194
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:51,850
because we remember when this all started
and the whole fashion thing started

195
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,040
when we were talking about that he
kind of looks like Gerard dip our toe,

196
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,770
right?
Cause he had,

197
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,710
he had like naked scenes in this movie,

198
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,820
but then paper it has a new look now and
I think he looks more like these guys.

199
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,330
Like there's Dennis Hoff.
That guy kind of has Burt's vibe.

200
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,470
Well here's why though is because Burt's
face is getting redder and redder and

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,170
swollen. It looks like I'm right
there. I think he really looks like,

202
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,560
like this guy in that,
uh, there's candle to me.

203
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,900
He uh,

204
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,590
why he kicked it getting Delphinia.
There's this other piece

205
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,140
that's Birtle hundred percent the smile,
you know,

206
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:42,340
like the energy and the essence.
I feel like you put a beard on that guy.

207
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,960
Does Burt? That is Bert. Yeah. Who's he
with? Wow. Oh, who's he with? An author.

208
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,330
You don't know who that is?
That's JK Rowling.

209
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:52,250
She wrote the Potter series.

210
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,700
Pulitzer prize.
Or

211
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,810
somebody could put Burt's head on
that photo. That would be great.

212
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,920
Here's Harrisburg,
too bad.

213
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:11,921
TMZ hasn't caught on and they're not
covering it in detail and some fat there.

214
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,400
Fini my favorite to this day.
Soprano's I mean,

215
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,800
I love that show and he's so
talented. This dude, God dammit.

216
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,720
Um, when do you think Burt's is going to
die? Oh, Jesus. Don't go there. I mean,

217
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,060
God, well, no, I mean, let's be realistic
here as my friend. I don't want him to,

218
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,960
he's my friend too,

219
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,820
and I care about him and that's why
I'm being a little harsh because

220
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,180
it's like that. Huh? Just like that.

221
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,460
Yeah. Because here's the deal, man. Here's
what I'm thinking. Yeah. This new, uh,

222
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,010
bus life that he's embarked
on has probably made it a
lot easier to party. We,

223
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,440
we've gotten into it. Yeah. You know what
I'm saying? Oh yeah. Yeah. He told me,

224
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:01,010
he's like,
we got a grill for his bus.

225
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,110
I think I grilled company gave him one.
He was like,

226
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:07,020
we smoked meats and we drink
until it for every night. Oh,

227
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,160
I love him so much. And I, I don't,
you know, I don't want him to lose him,

228
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:17,450
obviously. Of course.
That is not up to us.

229
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,490
You can only try so many times. You
know you can't, it's, it's up to him.

230
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,280
Chuckleheads laughing. I don't know.
Why are you laughing at Blue van?

231
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,860
I Dunno what's going on.
What's going on? I'll stop.

232
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,630
Um, should we, uh,

233
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,280
should we go ahead and take a break
and one of them taking a shit in our

234
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:44,750
bathroom. Let's ask him about those
charts. We will in just a moment.

235
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,370
We'll be back to talking about

236
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,290
give it up the fastest and most
racist comedian working today.

237
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,390
Man, I can't wait to see what, what
moniker I add on to that today.

238
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,560
You get a lot of comments like
that. Oh yeah. There's so much fun.

239
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,001
There's so much one.

240
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:19,001
This is the most fucking exhausting
because you have no idea because

241
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,290
like your dad or your wife's going,
why are people saying

242
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,070
my agents promoters? Yes.
Everyone has said, hey man,

243
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,720
we're going a lot of
feedback that you're racist.

244
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,830
And is that what you bring
to the Joe? No, not at all.

245
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,110
Is My fucking dickhead friend Tom
started it as a lark and I fucking hit it

246
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:39,944
under the park.

247
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,310
Sorry, I fucked that up. Yeah,

248
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,390
it's a do with those body shots.
World tour.

249
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,570
No blacks allowed.

250
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,860
Wow. That's, I did not make
that. That's not sanctioned.

251
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,640
I normally spend as a whole is just going,
okay, that's not real. It was awful.

252
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:11,570
His wins when people comment
on it in the comment section,

253
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,460
this is,
you're such a fat ratio and then,

254
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,720
and then new fans that have just found
me from Netflix, it's offend me. Yeah.

255
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:23,990
They're like, he look good. God, he's
a Joe and there's no reason to joke.

256
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,680
Eric don't even have a racist joke in my
act and there's nothing there and were

257
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:31,490
like, it chokes to be killer now to take
a joke. He makes fun of everyone equally.

258
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm like, I'm not thinking about
anybody. It's a picture of my daughter

259
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,370
and they yelled out, it shows you're
racist and people go, hey, we all are.

260
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:47,510
I'm like, shut the fuck up.
Oh, it's fucking exhausting.

261
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,010
I even have a joke in
my act now where I go,

262
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,620
I just had a baby and I'm fatter than
Bert Kreischer and the place just,

263
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,310
they light up.
That's great.

264
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,660
I'd like to keep it in a special if I
may. Uh, I get, I still, I mean every,

265
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,120
every city, everywhere. People
Yell Shit Bro. Fuck Bird.

266
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:11,470
I like your tour bus.

267
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,190
But here's pictures though. So
here's my picture. Wait. Oh,

268
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:24,750
what is he up picture of this
tour bus and not the outside.

269
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh, that was the funniest
fucking, I never saw it. That one.

270
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,420
Jesus has that birds tour bus or yours.

271
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,960
I took a picture in
front of my adult these,

272
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,610
I didn't retreat that I guess I
didn't see it. So I took a picture.

273
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,170
I didn't see that ass
Photoshop to make it more sad

274
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,830
because your body language, it was so sad,
dude. The best one was the Rogaine one.

275
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,780
That was a good one. Oh, like
Mcdonald's. Did you hear?

276
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,170
We lost our Mcdonald's sponsorship.
So bummed. I would love,

277
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,680
I love Tacos. Oh,
cheeseburger. What we need.

278
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,500
You take half of the bone
off and just talk about, but

279
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,730
you have all these health secrets.

280
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,400
Yes. Tell me more. On a
Sunday, on a Sunday night at
4:00 PM take a Xanax. Okay.

281
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,480
Chase it with a double Tito's and soda.
You go to bed without dinner.

282
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:28,570
You'll wake up Monday a skinny,
and if it's president's Day,

283
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,150
you'd take an ambien first thing when
you wake up Monday and you sleep off

284
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:33,820
Monday and then it that night, you've
had no calories. It's two days.

285
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,040
Health advice with Bert Kreischer

286
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,780
such good advice. Most
doctors, Oh fuck is this?

287
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,160
What are you doing here?
Can we see this?

288
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,100
Not Ours.
Just couldn't get up

289
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,660
and I can't ask my dad to get me up as
to where I needed him to help me do so.

290
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,660
God, they put just hang
on, stop. They put my face.

291
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,080
I didn't realize what was happening.
I was like, wait, that looks like me,

292
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:03,800
but that doesn't sound like me. They put
my face on the 600 pound life guy. Yeah,

293
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,770
that's fucking genius headquarters to
be doing when you're in your thirties or

294
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:13,230
whatever. It looks like I had a stroke.
It looks, it looks bad on, you know,

295
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,980
it's interesting. Is that the hands,
the arms match actually. Yeah.

296
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,730
How many gestures, but I would say
like the way that your face like that,

297
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,200
that expression on your face.
Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, there's a lot.

298
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,330
It's pretty accurate. Yeah.
Especially that big, right nut. Yes.

299
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,960
Do you have a big write one and one that's
big. Starting to get up Hoopa. Yeah.

300
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Before we move any further, this is
a Fart, Mike, if you have to Fart,

301
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,820
go ahead and let us know and we'll hand
it over. By the way, my body's reacting.

302
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:47,140
I'll probably shit my pants.
Oh, interesting. Hey, your
mom's house exclusive.

303
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,700
This is short week and we were going to
ask you if you have any excellent sharp

304
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,650
charted on my bus over the weekend.
I sharted in bed with Leanne yesterday.

305
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,860
No pants on, shorted onto the
sheets and then had to run,

306
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:06,970
you know like tippy toe it into the
bathroom and then judge rifled it out.

307
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,050
Hold on. I'm going to, so the night before

308
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,350
I was Vegan for a while.
Describe a while.

309
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:21,050
Everyone has this kind of
subjective roughly three days. Okay.

310
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,440
Roughly three days with a few
cheap meals. That's good. Ryan.

311
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,210
No. It's part of the way that told you
that the health book you're writing. No,

312
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,170
we were, I was drunk at an airport. Felt
like you were going to vomit. Right.

313
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,030
I was drunk at an airport.
How? I'm fucking sweating now.

314
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,180
I was drunk at an airport and I was like,
I bet I can go fucking Vegan.

315
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,520
And they're like, you couldn't go
Vegan? I go, yeah, I can. I can do it.

316
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:48,380
Everything I put my mind to and so
we get on the plane and I'm like,

317
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:50,420
fuck it. I'm going Vegan. I'm going
to lose some weight and go Vegan,

318
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,480
so drink a double Tito's and soda.

319
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,980
She brings me a beer with it and
then lunch comes around. I go,

320
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:01,940
what do you have? Meat and pasta. It was
Ernie cheese on the pasta and she goes,

321
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,730
no. I said, is there any meat on
the pasta? She goes, no. I said,

322
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,160
I'll go with the pasta. So the guy
next to me, he's kind of watching me,

323
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,740
he gets to meat and we start
eating. And he goes, hey ma,

324
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,390
what are you like allergic to cheese?
I go, no, I'm Vegan. And he goes,

325
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,530
really? I said, yeah. He goes, you know,
there's AG imposter, right? And I go,

326
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,420
I didn't know that. He goes, how long
have you been eating pasta? I go,

327
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,940
my whole life.
It goes and you call yourself Vegan,

328
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:27,290
this is what's wrong with you people.

329
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,070
And he starts fucking jumping into
my lifestyle choice on an airplane.

330
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,890
By the way, he didn't know, I've
only been Vegan for like 45 minutes.

331
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Tell him I just kept eating the pasta
and then order to an ice cream Sundae in

332
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:43,940
bed with Leanne my, my stomach. Okay.

333
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:47,350
So after three days ago a my
stomach got really kind of, uh,

334
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,390
not as toxic as has been like all my
shit's come out back of the bowl up under

335
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,624
the toilet seat

336
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,530
and the ones where you got to wipe your
legs cause it splashes up sometimes.

337
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,440
Yeah. And so, um, but I mean
that's like his regular morning.

338
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,150
That's Tuesday, Monday
morning. Shit, it's Tuesday.

339
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,230
And so I go and uh,
I start,

340
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,330
I go right out of veganism, veganism,
a rec tech sent me a travel smoker.

341
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,410
So I go right into Veg,

342
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,040
out of veganism into a fucking brisket
and it just fucked my stomach. Yeah.

343
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,450
I just wolf like animal fat and all her
right after my Tampa show me in cow head,

344
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,470
Dave Williamson just in Fez Watley sat
at the back just eating brisket and then

345
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,700
the next day I was just
shitting like crazy.

346
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,560
So then you meet up in Vegas and
your wife goes there and you drank.

347
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,410
I'm sure we did bottomless
Mimosas when I landed.

348
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,190
Then did the show you had the bottomless
mimosas until like four o'clock once.

349
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,720
See before o'clock show wasn't until
10. Oh Wow. Yeah. And so, but I,

350
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,300
my stomach was just racked and
then the next morning we woke up,

351
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,280
I don't know what I ate
or drank that night,

352
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:01,670
but the next morning and World Cup and
I thought it was a fart and it just shit

353
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,710
on my butt cheeks and then had to
carry it into the bathroom. Yeah.

354
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,960
Like wanting like a little here.

355
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,840
We're like one of those egg
spoon races in the new fare.

356
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,940
Ooh Shit.
No she didn't.

357
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,940
She know I shit my pants right before I
went on stage in Fort Lauderdale and my

358
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:23,780
camera man was following me and I shit
my pants right before I want to stage and

359
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:26,750
then it was fire coming out
of my ass fired, you know,

360
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:29,240
like you know when you eat
spicy food in your lipstick hot,

361
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,290
that was happening to my asshole. And so
I shoved an ice cube up there and like,

362
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,740
uh, like a suppository to
cool it down. You know,

363
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,490
cause I'm figured something was hot and
then I couldn't get it out and I had to

364
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,850
go on stage with an ice cube up my ass
and it was literally dripping out of my

365
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,430
asshole there. No, I know.

366
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:51,431
I know you shit in your pants right
before you go on stage in Fort Lauderdale

367
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,230
and sit my butt cheeks. I didn't Shit
my pants. I shipped my butt cheeks.

368
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,520
Wipe it up. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I clean it up before you perform,

369
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,350

hour with shit in your no,

370
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,810

God. Yeah. You're savage. Dallas,

371
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:06,470
Texas.

372
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,150
Christella Alonzo is supposed to go and
do 20 minutes and she can all can shoot

373
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:15,470

374
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:18,980
seven minutes and I'm shitting
and I hear my name couldn't proud.

375
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,590
I didn't even wipe, I didn't even know
why. Couldn't have time to wipe it.

376
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,490
And I was like, oh. And I had to
perform a shit. My pants the long hour.

377

381
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,120

were in Lexington, Kentucky,

382
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,890
at Brook comedy off off Broadway,

383
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,980

shit in the middle of my hand.

384
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,120
I brought the comic up. I said,
some will put a timer on the clock.

385
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,760
I'm going to bring the other comic up.

I'm going to go run off
stage shit and come back.

388
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,010
I Bet I can do this in under two minutes.
I was back in a minute.

389
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:09,630
Now why I push,

390
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm a big pusher. You pushed a little
too hard. A lot of times when I shit,

391
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,140
it's about art.
It's like a bouncer kicking out.

392
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:19,350
People that have a club at 2:00
AM just let's go, let's go.

the reason I put an ice cube up my ass.

397
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:40,170
Cause he shoves,
wads,

398
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,890
plugs of toilet paper up his asshole
to stop the blood from coming here.

worth it. So anyways, uh,

402
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,430
Yeah. Like yeah, he's got a
hemorrhoid testicle out of his ass.

403
00:27:56,431 --> 00:28:01,140
Like a, it's like a ball, right? It's just
a hemorrhoid, but it looks like a nerd.

404
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,440
It's like a fuck sleep.

405
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:06,830
It's like he got railed for
months and years in his asshole.

406
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,790
It's got a pink sock. Just kind of, okay.

407
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,170
So wait,

408
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,240
those ones one, when those ones happen,
it's so easy to clean up. Just real quick.

409
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,990
Spit on the toilet paper.
Wipe your ass. I'm out.

410

That's what your dad does called
Mississippi wet wipe my specialty.

417
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:49,440
So then you start spitting on your pay.

418
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,730
It actually makes a big difference
on your toilet paper holding it out.

419
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,923
Let me tell you how to do it.

420
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,420
Spilling your toilet paper right on
your finger where your finger is on the

421
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:00,270
toilet paper. Right? And then
just take it. It's just one wipe.

422
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,110
You're not going back and forth.

423
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:06,230
Just one wipe gently to just kinda just
get everything off like a cursory go

424
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:10,800
dry, then go one more spin and
then it, I don't mind the wet idea,

425
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:14,950
but why can't you just reach
to the sank like board?

426
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,700
It's the same reason you don't
use water when you jack off,

427
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,820
you spit in your hand and Jack
off or you know what I mean?

428
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,290
It's spit is got a little more lubrication
to it. A little more viscosity.

429
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,960
So when it rubs chasse drafts,
we'll saying nice.

430
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,220
He kind of knows what he's talking about.

431
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,990
I've been spinning on my toilet paper
for eight years is still sexually

432
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:38,850
attracted. That was the best day
of very certain about that. No,

433
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,410
no.
She sees you as like a nice guy,

434
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,950
but I'm home sometimes cash cow

435
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,070
on the road. Yeah. It's like
a rods agents. They're like,

436
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:55,390
I don't care if he's using steroids. Have
you seen my bucket new? She's just like,

437
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:56,350
when are you leaving again?

438
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,920
Like going like if she does she get
like a platinum card. She was like,

439
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,130
this is kind of fun. Oh really?
Shopping now, you know she's doing,

440
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,020
I'll tell you right now,
looking at houses. Oh,

441
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,130
looking at houses and just,

442
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:14,131
I mean just the fucking modest
woman you met fucking 15 years ago,

443
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,730
you wouldn't unrecognizable.
Unrecognized. It's my favorite thing.

444
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,310
She, that new truck we got, she was not
wanting to get it. Oh it's too expensive.

445
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,920
It's so silly. And then
she got it. She goes,

446
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,890
this is my favorite thing we've
ever owned ever. She goes,

447
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,380
I've really feel like I'm driving
around in luxury and I'm driving so much

448
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:35,830
picking up George at softball and islet
school play practices. One on, she goes,

449
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,620
she goes, this makes me feel like
driving's not that bad. And I go,

450
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,660
you should get treats in life.
That's why I don't understand.

451
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,480
I've just been trying to work this bit
out of my life and my act and I can't

452
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:46,840
figure it out cause I got, maybe people
don't relate to the way my brain works.

453
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,930
But if you don't have treats in life,
what life's not worth living.

454
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,210
Like I don't understand the guy that
lives treat lists that they just go your

455
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,450
treats all day though.
Yeah. But that's yeah,

456
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:59,110
be concentrates and I have a low threshold
for reward. I'll give you that. But,

457
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,040
but guys who deserve treats that
don't get him. What's the point? Yeah.

458
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,970
Like I used to think and all that. If
you can afford it, that's the caveat.

459
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,160
If you can afford it, get the
treat. If you can't afford it,

460
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,050
don't get the fucking tree.
And it was just,

461
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:15,050
it should making your treats onto
like, uh, on, on like a sliding scale.

462
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,430
I've been treating myself my whole
life. I have, I, like I said,

463
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:21,610
I definitely think I earned treats
when I don't earn them, but my treats,

464
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:26,410
I've never, they haven't like, gotten
outrageous. It's just like a new car.

465
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,550
Like why not have a new car?

466
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:31,180
We had a car that was 10 years old and
was breaking down like lamb broke down on

467
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:35,470
Ventura. I go, what the fuck?
We can afford a new car.
Let's treat ourselves. Yeah,

468
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,680
you deserve it. Tommy's captain treat
over here. Oh, he's taught by placing,

469
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,050
I'm more likely an where I grew up in
the communist Cold War and I didn't treat

470
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:47,740
myself to shit and he's taught me how
to enjoy life. But here's the thing,

471
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,420
you guys go blow it up.

472
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,330
Both of you taught me how to treat
myself because I remember we were talking

473
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,190
like, I was like, I want to get the hands
on. They want to get something nice.

474
00:31:57,191 --> 00:32:01,220
You can go. Oh Tommy just gets
it for me. Just for me. Yeah.

475
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,660
In Vegas this weekend we're
doing bottomless mimosas.

476
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,360
There's like a mall by the Aria and I go,
that's my tree.

477
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:13,030
And that was my trip by the way.
No, she got sick. She got sick.

478
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,910
The shakes from him.

479
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,120
And so we go to the thing
and I just disappeared.

480
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,680
I got myself a treat and I bought the
treat. But you gotta tell the streets,

481
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,940
come on my treats silly. It's okay. He
was a drunk and treat. Okay. What was it?

482
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:31,990
It was a Gucci Fanny Pack.
That's the family. Awesome.

483
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,310
It was good to push. I think
you had one on him. He got me.

484
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:41,290
One is a push present child
years and I was like, Oh Gucci,

485
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:41,850
Panty peg.

486
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,380
This is all so silly.
Yeah.

487
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,520
Oh cause it's such a silly item.
And then to get a designer silly,

488
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,860
it's like whooo.
This

489
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,910
all the toe it all through Vegas. Yeah. I
had it filled with all my merchant cash,

490
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,590
so it was like stacks up cash.

491
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,690
So then I went to Tiffany's and I bought
land and Nicholas not super expensive,

492
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:08,610
but it's just a nice necklace. Nicely.
You Man. I see you soon. Oh, I like it.

493
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,570
It's really nice. Enjoy it. Good. Yeah.
Cause you're going to die one day.

494
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,300
You May as well enjoy, you
know, the benefits, right? Me.

495
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:18,720
What are we getting this house man? Yeah,
let's talk about it. We looked at one.

496
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,740
Yeah. Yeah. It was a little out of our
price range, but I thought, I thought,

497
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:26,250
you know, roll the dice on
life. Now, if we had had, um,

498
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,450
it was at the foot of Fryman
Canyon. Uh Huh. I can tell you the,

499
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,270
I should probably shouldn't
have it on the Internet.

500
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,020
It was at the foot of Fryman Canyon
had had a dinner. It was really nice.

501
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,790
It was an old house.
I was part of a compound,

502
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,230
so all the houses around it and was like
excluded. You couldn't get, that's cool.

503
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,250
But a weight, it doesn't matter. He'll put
it on Instagram anyway. Yeah, definitely.

504
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,770
That's why we got to move.
I gotta get out of my fucking house now.

505
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:52,620
Everyone knows where I fucking
law. Really? How that happened.

506
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,460
Me Describing things in my neighborhood,

507
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,670
all my podcast people like
a jack in the box. Huh?

508
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,330
I think I figured out where you
live. Your crazy with that. I didn't.

509
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,530
I was before we knew that anyone listened
to these fucking things. Yeah. I just,

510
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,530
I overshared.
I've overshared way too much in my life.

511
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:16,050
Like that's where you guys have done
a really smart job and I tore a board,

512
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:20,510
Georgia and Eila didn't even ask and I
talked about their periods on Conan. Yeah.

513
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,670
Yeah. That's funny though. I left the
period party. You described those lovely.

514
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:24,570
Imagine if your island,

515
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:28,680
you've got to go to school the next day
and it goes viral and little Jason. Huh?

516
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,420
You named me period. Jason. She's
like, I don't know who you are. Yeah.

517
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,960
Four girls.
So let's say this though.

518
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,720
We made fun of my tour
bus. Yeah. You know,

519
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,660
and my picture with my tour
bus. Yeah. Uh, what about

520
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,430
the body shots world?
Hitler did nothing wrong.

521
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,480
This is your thing.
Jeez.

522
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,190
Who does voiceover for you?
That's a, my guy Jake. He's great.

523
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,050
He's a really good voiceover artist and he
is too bad. It's all anti me. No, no, no.

524
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:14,550
He's got some other stuff. Oh,
cool. Wait to see it. Yeah, no,

525
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,560
that's great. If you're
listening, it's just,

526
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,780
that was just burnt on a Nazi
train. Just to be clear. Yeah.

527
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,710
Of what we were, oh, the I pull up,
hang on. No, hit pause. Hit pause.

528
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,700
Yeah. Pull up the one that's
titled Birders are racist. MP Four.

529
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:35,130
I'm dying to see this. What
we'll see. We'll see it in a bit.

530
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,933
Let's see what this is.

531
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,040
Cleveland's, Oh my goodness. Daimler,

532
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,610
you're in there. Right
there with him shirtless.

533
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,540
Wow. What was he like?
Not that bad. Really?

534
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,250
Well, very artistic. Yeah. This
is actually good footage. I know.

535
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,050
All right.
Okay.

536
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,510
The body shots world tour,
Hitler did nothing wrong.

537
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,170
Wow. You got your whole logo on the
side of the plane there? Yeah. Cool.

538
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,220
That's not bad. You know, Ron
White had done that to his plane,

539
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,710
so I feel like I'm in good
company. Yeah. That's pretty cool.

540
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,490
How much would you like to get a
plane, dude? Is that the next step?

541
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,010
Almost got one to find me
home from Vegas yesterday,

542
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,860
but it was $6,000 and I can't write my
head and I wrapped my head around that.

543
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,950
Yeah. Like I was like, I was
like, I thought it would be like,

544
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,550
I literally thought it'd be like two grand
and I was like, I could do that. I can,

545
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,520
I can just go like, fuck it. I had a bad
night of the casinos can gamble much.

546
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,940
Yeah. Um, but yeah, I can't, I don't know.

547
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,310
I'm never gonna be able to be able
to do that whole thing. It's crazy.

548
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,420
I don't like flying though either.
So that's the other thing.

549
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,920
Wouldn't buzz life has really enabled
your lifestyle choices. Dude, it's me.

550
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,420
I'm so much healthier on this
fucking boss than I've ever been.

551
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,160
Let's talk about it. Uh, it's
great because here's what we know.

552
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,650
I was trying to figure out like why
I'm not getting hung over and I'm not

553
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:14,720
getting fucking super wasted at night.

554
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,140
It's because you're going into
the tour bus and drinking. It's,

555
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,930
it's kind of like drinking at your
house and so then you go, I'm tired,

556
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:24,440
I'm going to bed. As opposed to what
normally happen on the road as you go,

557
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,590
you have to club and then everyone would
go ends up at a bar and then you're at

558
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:30,220
a bar and everyone's like,
all right, we're going to go.
And you're like, one more,

559
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,140
would you get one more? And then you
get what? You go back to your place.

560
00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:36,380
Maybe open one there and for
here you just get like you go,

561
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm going back to my room and you
just go to sleep. So I loved it.

562
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:43,250
That are you sleeping better? Asleep.
Fucking amazing. Yeah. I think we have,

563
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,570
I don't know what kind
of matches you have,

564
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:48,710
but it's one of those like fits
your body like your tempurpedic.

565
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,240
Like it's kind of like a Lisa mattress.

566
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,220
He's got one of those like it goes up and
down on the tour bus. Oh yeah, me too.

567
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,070
Me Too.
That

568
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,030
it is not one light those up right
next to his chocolate fountain.

569
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,810
Do you have a chocolate
fountain on your mouth? No.

570
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,950
Do you really not have two
bathrooms though? No, we have
two bathrooms. Okay. Yeah.

571
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:12,890
I was like what the fuck? No. Do
we do shit in your tour bus? No,

572
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,710
we don't sit in our tour bus. Can I
tell you the invention I came up with?

573
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,970
You made an invention? Yup. It's called
toilet condom. Okay. What you do? Oh,

574
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:24,230
it's like a hot bag. Yeah. Yeah. You take
it and you put it around the seat. Yeah.

575
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:28,100
And then it's got like a little thing
here but you shit into this bag as soon

576
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:29,480
was almost with a reservoir tip.

577
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:32,750
So you ended up in the reservoir tip so
then you can just bag it and throw it in

578
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:36,160
the trash. Yeah. Yeah. I mean
people do. Yeah. Yeah. They called

579
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,790
hot bagging. Yeah. Really?
Yeah. Yeah. They just shit in
the bag on the bus. Oh boy.

580
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,700
You just buy like a $2 million bus like
Brian Regan and then you can just shit

581
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:45,220
on your bus. Why is he, cause
he has the state of the art.

582
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,000
They have like a grinder and all
types of crazy shit done his back.

583
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,200
I will do it too.

584
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:54,250
I would do a TV show based on tour
buses of obsessed with tour buses.

585
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,620
I mean the really nice ones
are really nice. Like, Oh,

586
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,990
like I think mine is
probably low end. My, okay.

587
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,710
So I have four different tour
buses. Yeah. Because I didn't,

588
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,770
there's weeks where it doesn't make
sense for like when I'm doing tampon

589
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,120
Lauderdale I'm like, I don't want a
tour bus for that week that um, yeah,

590
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,771
I'm like a,

591
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:17,771
I don't want a tour bus for this
a week where I have a Portland,

592
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:21,140
Maine and then I have just fly
to fort on to the next day.

593
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,440
Or you're going to drive? I
don't know. I don't know yet. Oh,

594
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:27,330
see for me driving it makes it easier
on my stomach. Like I just got,

595
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,650
I mean I probably will. That's
a three, three and a half.

596
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,650
So what I'm saying is,
so those weeks don't like,

597
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,550
but then I have weeks where it definitely
makes sense because of the way those

598
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,510
companies work.

599
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,190
I was able to get like quotes from
different companies for all the different

600
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:46,024
runs,

601
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,060
compare them all and then I pulled the
trigger on the nicest one for a couple

602
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:55,180
runs. So I'm going to see what it's
like, what the differences for that bus.

603
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:58,140
That bus is state of the art
though. Okay. I want to it.

604
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,920
I might hop on your tour for that,
but that bus is like,

605
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,150
it's way more than really. Yeah.
Then like the one I'm on now,

606
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,520
the guy, so the guy goes, uh, you
know, when you like, you know,

607
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,950
if you're at a restaurant and you
might order something and you're like,

608
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,340
this doesn't, I don't know if
this is a, this tastes right,

609
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,290
but you'll second guess
yourself because you're like,

610
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,780
I don't really complain about the
way something tastes. You know,

611
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,130
like you're like, I don't want to make
a thing of it. Right. So you go like,

612
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:29,350
and then you eat and you're like,
no, something's wrong with this.

613
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,240
So like on the one of the first, like
second night on this bus, I was like,

614
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,580
man, I feel like it's fucking loud
back here. Like really loud, you know?

615
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,930
So then I'm like, we were at the neck,
we're in the next city. And he's like,

616
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,190
how was it back there? And I was
like, well, I gotta be honest, man.

617
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:52,910
I don't want to complain about it,
but it does seem pretty loud.

618
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,510
And he goes, yes, they need
to train new transmission.

619
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,570
I go like, do you know this? He was
like, Oh yeah, I told him, you know,

620
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:05,410
and they, uh, they rotated the tires,

621
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:06,850
they replaced the rear axle,

622
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:10,600
but she's got some miles on her and she
really needs some work. And I was like,

623
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,850
so does this happen soon? Or one
second does. He's like, yeah,

624
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:20,690
I don't know. I'm like, okay. And
then it was like that. It was like,

625
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,840
Hey, this water didn't really heat
up. He's like, yeah, the plug came.

626
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:27,460
And I told him the soundbar also came
to attached in this TV's not working

627
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:32,350
anymore. And I'm like, so when
like do I, do I deal with this?

628
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:36,590
He was like, yeah, just till it's
fixed. Oh my God. Fuck that. I know.

629
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:40,490
But I mean, you know,
[inaudible] got Wifi, egg,

630
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:46,310
then the Wifi, the guy.
Here's the thing though,

631
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:47,810
what a difference.
Like a nice,

632
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,010
like great driver makes
the guys the best and um,

633
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,080
you know, it's not like, it's not that
big of like, I fall asleep, I get up,

634
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,110
we're in the next city. I'm like, I don't
care man. Yeah, you're sleeping anyways.

635
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,900
Yeah. I'm like, it's not that
big of a deal. There's shit like,

636
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,480
like when the soundbar did work on
the TV, the sound bar was dope. Like,

637
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,120
like you could watch movies and
like I was, I was digging that,

638
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:13,760
but for the most part
this bus has been falling

639
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,370
dude. And they'll fix it. Probably
as I hop on that other bus,

640
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,160
I want to see what it is. I wouldn't
mind splurging in order to get mine.

641
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,680
I had to have it for the whole three
months. Yeah, that makes sense. Good.

642
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,210
I wanted to wrap it,
which might have been a miss couch.

643
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,513
No

644
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,020
move. It is son Joseph said to me last
night, he goes, cause Yo, what's up?

645
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,750
Did you fucking rapping it? And that
kind of like, I couldn't do that man.

646
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:41,750
I'm too low key. I go, Yo, I don't think
I would do that again in the future.

647
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,540
Although I know I now
will cause it's dude,

648
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,630
it is literally people
just knocking on the door

649
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,180
gotta be shitting. I come in, it's
burden there. And they're like, yeah,

650
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:56,790
he's sleeping. Wait,
wake them up. Somebody.

651
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,080
They know we're doing these ridiculous
post to each other. My boss was in DC,

652
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,450
we'd driven through, mind
you, jersey, Pittsburgh,

653
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:08,090
since he Cleveland land in DC,
it's filthy.

654
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,750
And they wrote tour bus champ
and the dirt. Are you serious?

655
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,130
The Aye. Aye. Aye. Getting the face on it.

656
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:21,790
The first night I realized it was like
there's people waiting outside the bus

657
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:23,890
and you was trying to get into
the venue and I was like, oh,

658
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:25,840
this is a horrible fucking idea.

659
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,050
And then knowing that people that
know that that's where you are,

660
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,160
I wasn't comparable Dan by 10 by,

661
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,980
by the time we got to Tampa regionally
and Atlanta, I loved it. I was like,

662
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,190
well it started being like people were
taking pictures of them outside the bus

663
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:40,120
and I thought that was cool.

664
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,330
Like people would rip their shirts off
and take pictures outside and I was like,

665
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,020
oh, that's awesome. And then, uh,

666
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,880
and then it never wear a shirt again.
I know you're Korean,

667
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:52,790
you're going to be hopefully 80 years
old and you're going to have to be like

668
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:56,210
the shortlist of the geriatric.
Get Soggy.

669
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,710
Ladies and gentlemen.
Any of the other machine.

670
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,570
How long ago was that was that
was yesterday. Was it yesterday?

671
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,890
That was yesterday.
I think if I just did sit ups.

672
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,040
The Bu's has nothing to do with it.
The sit ups and then where's your,

673
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:18,800
where's your, uh, where's the one
underneath it? That's your Vegas picture.

674
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,810
Jesus Christ. How many beers in
my worry? You know you had the,

675
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,700
what's the shirt is that

676
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,800
it says a gator belts melts.

677
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,270
Eldorados Monte Carlos and Eldorados
is from the beginning of this fresh,

678
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,140
so fresh and so clean. Oh, that's your
boy. Big Boy. Big Boy. He's my buddy.

679
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,480
That's your dog. I remember
that. Yup. It's really cool.

680
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:45,070
Everyone lightened him up with the m
word anytime he comments on an Indian.

681
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah. Some people don't get the
joke. That's what kills me about it.

682
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:51,870
It's like some people get
the joke and it's funny,

683
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,030
some people really don't have
a sense of humor. It's like,

684
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,270
it's almost like watching Lenny from
of mice and men play with animals.

685
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,630
They're like, oh, and then
you're just like, oh man,

686
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,080
you're not doing this right at all.
The nuance of the whole thing.

687
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,760
Someone painted a picture of
outkast and they're like, Hey,

688
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:09,750
I made this poster for your boss.
And so I had to buy only place.

689
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,370
I have it as like a big picture of outkast
above my bed. It's weird. Very weird.

690
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:18,900
Yeah. Hmm. Um, do you have those
pictures of like the lookalikes.

691
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,260
So remember how we had
Gerard Depardieu at one time?

692
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,020
Don't you think you kind of
looked like this and this off? No.

693
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,340
You don't think you'd look at him? What
about him in the white shirt though? Well,

694
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:34,200
there's Gandel feet. No, not even remotely
in the smile and energy. Not even close.

695
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,560
No. No, but put a beard on him. No.

696
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:42,600
You kind of have his build a little bit.
You have right there.

697
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,920
I do not. He looked like
that. That was a week.

698
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,860
And we're like that.

699
00:45:48,861 --> 00:45:53,490
Then I lived like that last
night and he let her men goes,

700
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:57,030
uh, she touches my belly. She goes, Oh
yeah, that's right. I forgot you were fat.

701
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,050
She goes, but you're like hard
fat. Tom's like a soft fat,
right? And I'm like, yeah,

702
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:05,520
he's just, he's a gentle fat. Yeah.
I had done, it's off all my podcast.

703
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,680
It was a long time ago when it was
just me doing all the audio and stuff.

704
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,540
So I bring him to the podcast.
I started the podcast.

705
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:15,630
He brings a girl with him and the first
thing he says is, show him your pussy.

706
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,310
All my couch, like, she like took her
pussy out on my couch and I'm like,

707
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,260
there's a leather couch like to
fucking ruin the leather. You know?

708
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:27,120
That's Nikki Haley, the former
UN ambassador. That woman
right there, there was no,

709
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,810
yeah, she, I don't think that's accurate.
That's, that's who she is. Yeah.

710
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,660
She's going to do a speaking tour
pretty soon. Cool. Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

711
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:40,710
I can't wait to hear what she has to
say. Wait, God gave her vocal cords to

712
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,950
you don't think you look like that? No,
not at all. Gonna look like that. No,

713
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,080
I hate when I go.
I hate when I see,

714
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:52,440
you know that Guy Vance Heinz
is almost skinnier than me now.

715
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,640
This is pretty great. It's probably
way, hold on. I have to, okay,

716
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:59,400
we're going to make fun of this,
but I have to say at the very beginning,

717
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,750
he's putting an amazing fucking work to
get where he is. Of course, I'm not like,

718
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,820
I'm going to, we're going to
make jokes about it, I'm sure.

719
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:08,610
But like I am so impressed with
this guy's fucking mindset.

720
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,250
You don't know anything about
this Van Times gone. Okay.

721
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,690
It goes back to the original weight loss
challenge, right? This is when I know,

722
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,670
I think it goes to sober October.

723
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,080
Go sober October because of
that weight loss challenge. He,

724
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,420
he started his weight loss journey right
in November, I think a full year ago.

725
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,840
Okay. Okay. So a, a little or more,
more than a year ago now. But, uh,

726
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,300
I said on the podcast, I said I could
run a marathon in under five hours,

727
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,050
which I did and I ran it and five 33 but
yeah, in building up to the marathon,

728
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:44,560
I ran a half marathon and Vance Hines,
listen to the sober October,

729
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,480
listen to the fat shaming,
listen to all that.

730
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,980
But he saw me run the half marathon and
then literally it was like, well, fuck,

731
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:55,210
if Burt can do that, I can do something.
And so he started trying to work out.

732
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,720
He was 475 pounds and today
he's like 42 to 50 wow.

733
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:03,100
Amazing.
He looks amazing.

734
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,060
But then he came and did my podcast with
Diamond Dallas page in Atlanta at the

735
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,390
Tabernacle, by the way, fucking
tabernacle. It's awesome.

736
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:11,650
It's the weirdest venue
in the entire world.

737
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:13,330
Did you know that was all white church?
He has a,

738
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,640
it was a baptist church
is all white church.

739
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,640
I thought it was an old black church.
No,

740
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,250
I didn't know that for us it was
baptist. Yeah. And I said to them, I go,

741
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:24,430
so this used to be an all black
church and they go, no. I said,

742
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,530
what do you mean they go, it was a
white church. And I was like, well,

743
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,600
it's the tabernacle. And
they're like, yeah, do what?

744
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:32,830
What part of the 19 hundreds do you
think they let black people come in here?

745
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,950
And I went, oh yeah. Oh yeah. And they
go to BC, Martin Luther King's church.

746
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:38,680
It's like a box.
Do you think they had this one too?

747
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,740
And Martin Luther King chose to
preach in a box. I was like, oh,

748
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:43,060
I never even realized
that. They're like, yeah,

749
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,760
this was primarily filled with racist
white people. I don't want, Oh,

750
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:50,620
that makes us very different from me in
my heart. And so, um, that came out wrong.

751
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,390
And so, but uh, but Valentine's
and Diamond Dallas page comes in,

752
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,310
uh, and he was like, brace to 200. Let's
see, you can get to 201st. And I was like,

753
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,140
I'm never going to fucking catch you

754
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,710
to 200. So what? I mean, so
the guy that, how far from
you? I started off, by the way,

755
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,060
hold on, hold on. How far from 200 Reu,

756
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,040
right?
Like a solid 40,

757
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,340
50,
17.

758
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,710
I can tell you right now
on my winnings APP. Okay.

759
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,860
I wait in this morning on my wedding zap.
I don't look at it.

760
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:27,520
It just registers to my phone.
Oh. Oh, you don't look at it?

761
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,230
No cause I want to track it,
but I want to track it.

762
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,860
I want to see it when I'm skinny. I
don't want to see it now. So my app,

763
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:35,110
I can weigh on the scale goes right to
my phone and you don't have to take a

764
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:37,860
look. It doesn't have to fuck with
your day. Yeah. Yeah. I just go. Great.

765
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,830
Affect your behavior in
any other weddings. Apple.

766
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,900
My winning scale on my
bus and in my house. Okay.

767
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,680
Two 45.8 okay.
So,

768
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,640
but I was two 45.9 yesterday to 50.

769
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,370
Uh, February 14th. So,
so you're going down,

770
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,740
you're going down,
but what,

771
00:49:58,741 --> 00:50:03,100
so what are you doing lot
of diarrhea that helps.

772
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,790
I am no. Can I be honest with you? Push.
I have no fucking idea how to lose weight.

773
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,180
Yeah. Even when I, I've lost weight,
I just do it. And like this psychotic,

774
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:12,830
psychotic, manic kind of way.
I don't do it in like a health.

775
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:17,100
Yeah. And you don't have a method, but if
you, if you, okay, let's talk to Joe. No.

776
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,500
Can he make a method for you
and could you stick to it?

777
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,990
If someone wrote down here's what
you're going to do, this is what,

778
00:50:21,991 --> 00:50:24,780
this is the routine.
Could you have a routine and stick to it?

779
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,370
Yeah,
I can be.

780
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:30,740
I can be obsessive compulsive but the
problem is I'm not hyper obsessive. Yeah,

781
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:35,030
hyper obsessive. But the problem
is is when we lost all that weight,

782
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,870
I stayed in the two twenties for
a full calendar year. Full year.

783
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,760
Now we were both in the
two twenties for your,

784
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,730
I know you're probably still around what,
two 30 yeah,

785
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,000
but like we were in the two twenties for
a full fucking year cause when we did

786
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,280
sober October we did our weigh ins at
your house when we went to party at your

787
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:52,700
house afterwards and we were
almost exact same size. Wait. Yeah.

788
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,470
I don't know why.

789
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,160
I don't know what's going on and just
all of a sudden it just balloons up.

790
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,330
I get really, I don't think it's that
confusing actually. I get pretty,

791
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,100
I get pretty like I get off the rails
sometimes. Like I'm like deep dish pizza.

792
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:12,280
I think Baird, I think part of
it too is the fact that, look,

793
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,900
you're a celebratory guy.
Yeah. You're a fun guy.

794
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,600
You're killing it on the road. Yeah.
You deserve treats. There we go.

795
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,230
Now we're talking like my inner
dialogue here, away from your family.

796
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,710
Let's hear about a strip club at second.
So vixens Fort Lauderdale,

797
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,060
he just, and uh, um, you know, you're, uh,

798
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,550
you're the good time guy so you
don't have treats in your head.

799
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:39,350
Like when you get done a show,
you don't go,

800
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,120
I wonder what I get to treat myself with.
I mean sometimes yeah, but your treat,

801
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,160
um, we'll see. Here's
the thing. I have a way,

802
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:50,380
it's not even like a party
thing or aversion to it.

803
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,300
It's just like I've just, look, I'm just
not wired to be a big drinker. So you,

804
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,330
so you go,
now I get to be alone in a dark room.

805
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:04,040
I do like that. But I mean
most, here's, here's most of
my, the second show is over.

806
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,700
Okay. Yeah. So I go back in that
green room. So hold on, let's, let's,

807
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:11,030
let's walk through our for you. Do two
shows. So your first show, no booze,

808
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:15,890
I'm sure. Right? Definitely coffee.
Yeah. Okay. Me Too. A Cup of coffee.

809
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,460
We're going to stage no booze for
a show and might bring a bureau,

810
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,960
but I won't touch it. I can show I
bring a a cocktail, bring a coffee,

811
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,270
cocktail or beer out. Yeah, never.

812
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:26,690
And when I say what I say
when I was 22 years old,

813
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:28,340
I got involved the Russian mafia.
Here's how it happened.

814
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,110
They cheer and that's
when I start drinking.

815
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:33,240
That's my first drink of the night
because my eyes and I told her the machine

816
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:36,880
story every night. Then you have like
10 minutes, 14 minutes. And I get it.

817
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,380
I get it. I'll get a little
bit of a buzz. Oddly enough,

818
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:41,990
I know that people think that I wouldn't,
but even in that 14 minutes,

819
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,220
just having a few sips,
I catch a little bit of a buzz.

820
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,860
But you're also like you're doing the,
uh,

821
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:52,040
like almost like a performance of a play.
They know, you know, so I get that. I, um,

822
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,940
I never drink ever during shows before,
during I just in my head,

823
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,550
I can't drink before it makes me,
we did it in Vegas.

824
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,700
We tried to Mimosas and I'll do
it on like an overnight flight.

825
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,850
I'll drink that evening. But
I, I can't, I have to be sober.

826
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,180
I can't be having beers getting on stage.
I just give a shitty show.

827
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,590
I usually have, I'll have a drink
after shows once or twice a week.

828
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:16,850
Whoa.
And usually it's maybe one drink.

829
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,240
Sometimes it's too,
this is what he do after the shot.

830
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,190
So, but I mean, all right, so
because we're both on buses,
it's basically like this,

831
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,000
it's like if I'm, so the second show
will end, I'll go to the green room. Uh,

832
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,890
whoever's with me,
we'll be hanging out in their music.

833
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,550
I have like a speaker, so we'll put
music on, talk about the show is,

834
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:42,710
talk about jokes. And then if I feel
like having a drink, we have drink.

835
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,010
Sometimes we have post show meal,

836
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,330
so have a meal delivered as I'm
coming off stage. So we eat.

837
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,270
So it's like having dinner after
the show. And then it's like, what,

838
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,970
how important is the transportation?
If it's like we got to get going,

839
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,590
like we get on the bus and um, you know,
if like, like I said, if it's like,

840
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,200
if I feel like having a drink that night,
we have a drink sit around.

841
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:06,300
Some nights I don't, so sometimes
I'll hit a like a vape pen, uh,

842
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,950
you know, like a mile
edible. I like mild ones,

843
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:15,450
so I keep it like real buzz level,
you know, not fucked up. Oh,

844
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,400
mine's a little different. Yeah, go
ahead. Tell, tell us the truth. The truth,

845
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,590
truth,
that'd be 100% on smartly.

846
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:29,770
And I'm worried about how are you
worried about fucking everyone else. Oh,

847
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:32,520
they know. Everybody knows. It
always comes back to bite you.

848
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,300
A drink on stage for the
second show starts with, when
I tell the machine story,

849
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,750
I go backstage and then, uh,
backstage, I'll have another drink.

850
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,710
Like sitting back there, we do like a,
you know, like a 15 minute chill out.

851
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:49,400
People come backstage with her backstage
passes like friends or when you know,

852
00:54:49,401 --> 00:54:51,170
whatever and have a drink with them.

853
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,110
And then I'll take that drink out to the
meet and greet to the meet and greet.

854
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,480
Of course. Makes Sense.
Yeah. And then, uh,

855
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,450
and then what I've been
doing a lot lately is going,

856
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,900
is telling everyone in the show where
I'm going to go drink and then everyone

857
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:05,790
goes and meets me at a bar.
Yeah, it's different. Wow.

858
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,150
It sounds like my nightmare. Oh, so it's
not that bad if you can just connect,

859
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,470
right. If you're just, if you're one of
those people that that can get into you,

860
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,340
then it will get into a lot more.
If I had to do,

861
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,130
I actually don't drink that much cause
I can't drink. So I'm taking pictures.

862
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:24,800
I'll take maybe like, I would drink
a lot more if I had to take pictures.

863
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,320
I'll take like 500 pictures at
night. Like at a, like I'm white.

864
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,690
I'm inviting 1800 people to a bar,
you know,

865
00:55:32,691 --> 00:55:36,860
and going like both shows. I go,
I'll be drinking it. Dot Dot, dot.

866
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:40,190
Tonight if you want, meet me over
there and I'll see you over there.

867
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,850
How do you get, I don't get
that house. I won't do shots.

868
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:47,750
I won't do shots with anyone. People. I
won't let people buy me drinks gives me,

869
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,310
I go in, I'll tip the bartender is usually
a hundred bucks each and just say, hey,

870
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,310
thanks. I'm sorry. Then I fucking swamps
your bar tonight. And then I'll, and I'll,

871
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,940
and they usually take care of
me and just give me like in,

872
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,250
when we did it in Boston, we went
to the place right down the street.

873
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,060
I forget the name of it. And uh, I
did, they didn't have Tito's and soda,

874
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,870
so I just drink beer, but I don't really
go choose Tito's and soda though. Right.

875
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,630
It will say it's just a little healthier.
I think it's a little leaner.

876
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,460
And so that's what,
yeah,

877
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,710
but then we get on the bus and
got a nice handle with you here.

878
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:16,740
I brought you a little,
you know,

879
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,580
Tito's is always nice enough to
send me handles all the time.

880
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,040
I have maybe I have maybe 19 bottles
of at my, all my outdoor bus.

881
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:29,440
[inaudible] I have so much goddamn Tito's
all my tour bus and you have no idea.

882
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,920
And Atlanta live nation just gave me
a case of Tito's. They were like, oh,

883
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:35,950
just tell you have it and we have
so much Tito's. It's ridiculous,

884
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,770
but here's where it gets wacky for me.
It's like,

885
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,270
then we get on the bus and we got,

886
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,220
we don't charge traveling
with like six people.

887
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,740
So you get on the bus and everyone's like,
uh, let's, uh, let's do another round of,

888
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:49,330
Hey, let's throw on some Netflix.
Hey, we just bullshitting.

889
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,930
And nine you stay up and sometimes until
four in the morning and you're like,

890
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:55,990
and then sometimes I stay up late.

891
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,420
I do stay up late and I have trouble. I've
always had trouble. I got, I, you know,

892
00:57:00,421 --> 00:57:05,280
I have trouble falling asleep
here when I'm on the east
coast, I'm fucked. Yeah. I,

893
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,440
that's the one thing that
fucks me up the most is a,

894
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:12,070
I don't even want to be up that late
and I'm still like, fuck man, you know,

895
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,830
it's three 30 in the, but once you
get on the bus, it's healthier for me.

896
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,470
Like when we have to leave right
after a venue, it's very healthy.

897
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,930
When you go to a bar and then you
get back to the bus and you're like,

898
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,071
you're just like,
oh,

899
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:25,480
it's staying up talking but you're not
getting nap fucked up on the just sitting

900
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:26,890
on the bus.
Um,

901
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,340
I think my drinking oddly enough has
been more under control of my eating.

902
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,760
I was really good the first
run in minutes, just fuck.

903
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,410
I started to do this like when,
cause you know when you,

904
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,590
when you get to the theaters they'll
say like, you want food, you know,

905
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:41,640
do you want an order? Appreciate a meal.
Just have like an automated answers.

906
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:44,410
She'd be like, yeah, grilled
chicken and vet. Like just this way.

907
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:48,250
What gets delivered is good for you. I
was doing salads for awhile. That's good.

908
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,760
Yeah.
And then we had,

909
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,100
then we were in Indianapolis and
had this great pizza place crunch.

910
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,260
I was like four pizzas.
What?

911
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,310
We'll watch the NFC championship
and the port tour bus. Huh? What?

912
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,940
And it was just fucking the wheels
come off. Yeah. Is that Liam

913
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:08,620
look at it. What's going
on there? Oh my God,

914
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:14,200
that's a Bert. Oh my
God. Yeah, jerking off.

915
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,880
That's me jerking off in a window.
Yeah, look at him. Oh my God.

916
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,950
You've never seen this?
I had never seen it before.

917
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,560
That woman got almost got me fired.
Do you never heard this story?

918
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,720
The time you direct off? You've never
heard this story for real? No. Oh,

919
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:32,530
this is a good story. Tell me. So
for those of you who are listening,

920
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:35,010
you did not see anything. Okay,
that's true. But what you,

921
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,260
what was it from the shield and those
two acts? It's not real footage.

922
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,680
That's not real footage.
Now that's from the shield.

923
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:46,180
I thought it was from the tour. No,
no, no, no, no. Okay. So, uh, I,

924
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:50,080
the television show, the CI, the
shield. You were, I was a cook.

925
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,740
That was my role. It said the cock.
What was the booking like? Uh,

926
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,410
I did actually didn't even have to
read for it. They just booked me.

927
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:59,710
How great is that? Yeah. Tell him.
He just looked at me and they go,

928
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,680
he looks like a cock fucking cause.
The role was,

929
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:07,681
I was a guy who hired a black guy to
fuck my wife and I like to Jack off

930
00:59:08,231 --> 00:59:11,710
watching them fuck on the outside
dressed as a DWP outfits. Boy, a guy.

931
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,521
This is pretty cool.

932
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:15,480
I like this very specific and I didn't
even have to read for it. They went, yeah,

933
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,800
this checks off the black
guys fucking his wife.

934
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,280
So how turned out would you be if
that were a thing? Not at, not at all.

935
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,250
The idea of someone else fucking
Leanne is not turned me on. It

936
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,060
was that you're opening your
opener. No, no, that was,

937
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:37,730
I don't know what that was from.
And I'm offended by that kind of

938
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,713
big swig.

939
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,030
What would you want to happen with?
Nothing.

940
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:54,400
Just me and her fucking potatoes.

941
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,240
Girl scout troop leader mom. That
you'd be like, oh Leanne, we should

942
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,110
go to like you put her in the dog
or like missionary or uh, yeah,

943
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:09,860
we did. We did the 12 nights
of Kama Sutra and December.

944
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,890
We did the 12th of Christmas
with a group of friends.

945
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:16,640
So we had 12 parties in December.
And then on the first,

946
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:19,040
every one of those nights.
And then the first night I said,

947
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:22,160
why don't we as a group of friends
do the 12 nights Kama Sutra?

948
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,240
So every night we have a party,

949
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,930
we'll all send each other at New Kama
Sutra pose that we have to do and then

950
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:29,060
we'll send our notes back
in the morning as a couple.

951
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,190
And not everyone understood it properly.

952
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:36,490
The first couple gave their kids a
Nike or a Benadryl and then did all 12

953
01:00:37,731 --> 01:00:42,190
positions at night. It knocked their
kids out and fucked him. 12 new position.

954
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,250
That's not what you said. And
so yeah, there's not oldest,
but Leanne and I did it.

955
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,630
We did all of them and it
was fucking awesome. It was
this one position that, uh,

956
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,950
that she pulled up and it was so cool.
Imagine if,

957
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:57,860
imagine if you're sitting here,

958
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,910
she's sitting on my lap at her legs
are over to the side right now.

959
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:04,370
Take that position and
just fall back on the bed.

960
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:08,210
So her back's on the bed and you're on
your side and her legs are up over your

961
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:12,620
legs. Does that make
sense? It was awesome.

962
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,130
It was awesome. But yeah,
I'm more berry meat potatoes.

963
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:20,660
I just want to have regular sex.
Can See big anal guy or no,

964
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,640
never done it. Not with her once
in a camp. This guy did it to me.

965
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:32,630
Nice guy or no, no, no, I'd
never done anal. Yeah. Really?

966
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,570
I tried. It's the way you booked this
role. You said I booked this role.

967
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,913
Um,

968
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,510
and chiclets is I think Chiklis and this
other guy are directing this episode,

969
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,730
but chiclets is onset.
So I,

970
01:01:47,731 --> 01:01:51,980
I read the breakdown and I the scene and
it's me watching my wife fuck a black

971
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:55,460
dude, right. And the bike guy and
my wife, we're both in this house.

972
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,570
I see them in the house.

973
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:58,910
And so I just got into role and
I started playing with my Dick,

974
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,460
like legit playing with
my deck, right. And uh,

975
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,550
they pull up and she gets outraged.
This lady, this lady, that real person,

976
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,450
she calls cut, she goes, this is
ridiculous. He's touching himself.

977
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,480
And in my head I'm like, I
read this wrong. I was like,

978
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,850
I thought it said playing with
yourself. And I'm like, Oh my God,

979
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:19,470
I'm so fucking embarrassed.
I've never acted in before.

980
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:22,710
This is the first ever acted in. This is
when we were shooting hurt by the way.

981
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:27,270
So she goes, I'm not going to
work with him and show she moves.

982
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,530
They split us up. And uh, Michael
Chiklis and this other guy,

983
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:34,680
I forget the other guy's name, come
up to me and I go, hey man, I'm,

984
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:38,010
I'm really sorry. I think I
misread this. I can do it again.

985
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:40,170
I don't have to touch myself. And
he was like, no, great choice.

986
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:45,280
I want really got her fucker.
It's a great choice. Did,

987
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,680
that's definitely what we want.
As a matter of fact,

988
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:49,350
what we're going to do is we're going
to hold her in position a and then we're

989
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:50,970
going to close it on you.
We're gonna do some tights.

990
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,040
We're gonna move the camera around,
but I want you to just play with yourself.

991
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,670
I was like, really? He goes, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. Go at it. And then,

992
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,930
and then what am I doing when I
call her back the second time? Uh,

993
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:04,440
touch, no touch, no touch yourself and,
but we're going to use you touch here.

994
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,940
Should I go? Okay. She goes,
all right. All right, hold
on. First position. All right,

995
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:09,774
action.

996
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,110
So I'd walk up this whole shot that you
see and I'm fucking playing with my deck

997
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,610
or play with my deck.

998
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:17,400
And then my dick starts getting hard
and I'm playing with my deck and we're

999
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:18,840
calling off for like five minutes.
I'm like,

1000
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:21,390
are they even filming or do you
think they're just sitting back?

1001
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:24,090
They're going to watch this
guy, Jaguar xe becomes, yeah.

1002
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:28,080
And so then at finally he goes, all
right, cut. I ain't goes to let you go.

1003
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,000
And so then in a little more burden,
they pulled up, they pulled her up,

1004
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,700
and then the scene,
I did the scene without touching myself,

1005
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:40,590
but they use me touching myself and
just inner cut them. And then, uh, yeah.

1006
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:43,590
And then I walk around, they
arrest me, put me in cuffs,

1007
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:46,350
had a panic attack in handcuffs,
walked me to the front door,

1008
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,920
big black guy comes out and I was like,
honey,

1009
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:53,730
can you just tell them what's going on?
And he's like, yeah, dudes with her.

1010
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,340
And then you find out that I liked
to have black eyes. Fuck my wife. Oh

1011
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,990
yeah, yeah. Oh Wow.

1012
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:04,590

to do is enter cuts my voice.

1013
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:09,440
I'd like to have black guys. Fuck
my wife and I will use it. Yeah.

secret time. It's, uh, yeah,

1023
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:56,230
they're doing an international versus
release of it. They dump it everywhere.

1024
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:59,620
Good job man. I appreciate it
man. Yeah, thanks. I'll be killed.

1025
01:04:59,621 --> 01:05:00,700
Another one of these beers.

1026
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,390
Do you have it in your audience?

1027
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,760
Do they yell like Burdis fat when they
see you or they probably all Thomas Rhett.

1028
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:14,440
Tom Thomas, fat Thomas about the old
tour bus champ a lot. Yeah, the one,

1029
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,890
the one, I mean, I told you this,
I hate to even bring up because I,

1030
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,970
because obviously it's the,
some regret I never settled the Puck,

1031
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:23,963
but uh,

1032
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:29,250
the very first date I did after doing
this podcast when this in Oxnard and some

1033
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:33,790
guy clear as fucking day in
the middle of my set goes,

1034
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:39,400
tell your n word joke, like what
word? The n word he, but he's had,

1035
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:40,360
he's had the real word,

1036
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:45,340
he said the real word and it was in the
cleanest white version of that use of

1037
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:49,150
that word and it ruined the room.
It ruined the fucking room.

1038
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:54,100
And everyone was like, oh. And I was
like, listen, I don't, I apologize.

1039
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:59,750
I go, listen, I, I understand
that you're a fan, but, uh, I, I,

1040
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,440
I'm not gonna, I'm not
gonna do that. And I,

1041
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:05,980
and I just wish you hadn't done that
and it really reset the room and it,

1042
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:09,220
I had to like win them back and
it was like fucking nightmare.

1043
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,420
So I get done the show,

1044
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,630
I'm doing the meet and greet and this
black guy comes up to me and he goes,

1045
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,430
he never told it.
I said,

1046
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,440
it was a black I do on a white guy voice
and it fucking, and I was like, I go,

1047
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,200
why didn't you tell everyone
you were black? He goes,

1048
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:26,960
I don't care cause he's black.
He's like, oh, I'll give you shit.

1049
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:31,420
But it was fucking horrific.
That was the one that sucked the most.

1050
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,960
But mostly people y'all tour bus champ
burns fat and Mickey Mantle. Jean,

1051
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:42,020
is that the black guy?
But no, just a black guy.

1052
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,383
Different black guys.

1053
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,870
Dude. How about all this black
face showing up, huh? Yeah, yeah,

1054
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:05,370
yeah, there was, there was the fashion
stuff you're talking about. No, no, no.

1055
01:07:05,371 --> 01:07:08,690
I'm talking about all these fucking,
oh,

1056
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,880
like the Virginia governor.
How funny is,

1057
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:16,290
I mean how fucking comic goal is that
the governor gets caught in black face.

1058
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:20,310
The next guy raped some women and that
allegedly and then the next guy goes.

1059
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:25,130
Actually I've been in black
faced all in Virginia, Virginia.

1060
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:30,180
You did you ever see anyone a black face
in college and like Florida or in high

1061
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:33,180
school? No, no. Our,

1062
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:38,330
our high school cheerleading squad in
like 1980780980 eight came out to babies,

1063
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:44,460
got back in all black face
with wigs and gold chains.

1064
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,740
There was a picture of it online.

1065
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,410
There's a picture over the line and I
actually hit some of the chicks up and was

1066
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:52,410
like, hey, you guys work with kids. You
might want to get rid of that picture.

1067
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,080
One girl I be, it was a picture
online tagged yourself. She's like,

1068
01:07:55,081 --> 01:07:59,860
I love this thing. No, there's one girl
that works with disabled kids that had,

1069
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,960
there's a picture of me and
her in college. It was a,

1070
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:06,961
this party I threw and she is in straight
black face like like legit blackface

1071
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,670
and I ran into her in San
Diego. I was like, Hey,

1072
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,470
you may want to like scrub the
Internet of that, like just pull down.

1073
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,020
She had posted it herself
and tagged me in it.

1074
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,760
Just oblivious to the idea that that
you don't think I was even aware of what

1075
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:27,560
blackface thing?
I'm trying to think of like awareness.

1076
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,950
It wasn't like,
I don't think that people were,

1077
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,000
I mean I wasn't throwing around
definitely in high school, but I,

1078
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:37,220
if I had seen a probably,
you know what I mean?

1079
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,960
I wouldn't notice to my attention as
being as crazy as if you notice it now.

1080
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:46,970
I mean I don't, I never even thought of
it to be on, I mean I'd never done it,

1081
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:49,130
but it's only because I
don't like makeup on my face.

1082
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,170
Like I'm not saying that I
would have or I wouldn't,

1083
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,300
but I don't like makeup on my face.

1084
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:56,010
Like clowns freaked me out so I don't
never put makeup on my face. Yeah.

1085
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,020
That's how I know I've never done.

1086
01:08:57,021 --> 01:09:00,890
I know that I did the talent show in
fifth grade. I did young Mc a thing,

1087
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:05,440
but I wore a dress. I'm like,
wait, why did you wear a dress?

1088
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:09,990
A forget, I think I played the
girl that's in the story to move.

1089
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like I, I act
it out now. That's a hate crime.

1090
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:16,760
You were mocking train.
I know

1091
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,610
Kevin Cranston,
Bryan Cranston,

1092
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:26,450
because he played a disabled person with
a naval bombing. It just makes me crazy.

1093
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:28,550
It's insane where this is going.
I mean,

1094
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,540
Kevin Hart tried to fucking give a
shout out to Jessie, small lat and a,

1095
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:36,110
and it's talking about here's what we
would ask you. Well, what do you think?

1096
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:39,230
Like if you were orchestrating that hate
crime, what do you think he did wrong?

1097
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,650
Oh, I'll tell you what would you have
to, how should he have done it? Right?

1098
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,480
I can tell you all the things,

1099
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:48,080
all the signals that I picked up on
when I first read the story and I went,

1100
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:51,350
I'm not going to say this out loud, but
this is bullshit. Let's talk to an expert.

1101
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:51,801
You can't,

1102
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:55,910
you can't say this out loud because you
look like a person that is promoting

1103
01:09:55,911 --> 01:09:58,970
violence, but I go,
hold on one second too.

1104
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,090
Racist White guys
recognized you from empire.

1105
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:06,760
I at two in the morning.
I watch empire like,

1106
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,870
but I wouldn't recognize you.
I've watched empire,

1107
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:12,230
but I wouldn't recognize you and
two guys and Maggie has like, Hey,

1108
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:15,290
you're that gay guy from MPO.
That number's going to happen.

1109
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,740
No one that's Amaga guys wa is
watching empire. That's just doesn't,

1110
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,850
it's not there. What they enjoy watching.
It's a good point. I never thought of.

1111
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,620
The noose was on his neck for
45 minutes when the police,

1112
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:27,620
when the police talked to him,
who keeps a noose on their fucking neck,

1113
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:31,190
the cops came to his apartment
to interview him and he
was still had it around

1114
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:35,450
his neck and the bleach.
No one wants,

1115
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,740
they're not trying to get you
lighter. No one's like, hey,

1116
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:43,480
we want you to be like us. Come on
man. Let's let, let us help out the,

1117
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:47,990
what the fuck it was
as, as a white person,

1118
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:50,720
you wouldn't want him to be
white or he wouldn't be like,

1119
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:54,200
okay well if this bleach works then
old stop in the middle of this.

1120
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,350
I'm so sorry man. Right. There was a lot
of that that I just didn't, I called,

1121
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:00,050
I called bullshit in my head,
but then I'm also a cynic.

1122
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:04,010
I'm and I'm also a contrarion so like,
so like as soon as that happened, I,

1123
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:07,160
that's what I thought.
And then once I found out it was a lie,

1124
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:10,310
I then get empathetic for that kid.
And then I go like,

1125
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,400
you feel badly for her. I feel
badly for him. It said, cause I go,

1126
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:16,250
where's his brain at?
And,

1127
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:21,120
and I don't want that to be used as a
lightening Rod to light up true Maggie

1128
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:25,160
racists to go, this is why they're
that or this is like, cause I got,

1129
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,480
so like whenever,
whatever side is that,

1130
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,750
I'm always going to the opposite side
and trying to argue the other direction.

1131
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,180
Yeah. But yeah, I feel bad for that kid.

1132
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,800
I don't know what the fuck's
going on in his brain.

1133
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:38,070
They thought that would help him. It's
not good. It's not good for anyone.

1134
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:40,440
I thought the same thing.
It's just,

1135
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:44,160
it's nothing good's going to come
of that could be mental illness.

1136
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,900
I don't know. Breathe. You gotta breathe

1137
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,550
dude. That is a, that is a great,

1138
01:11:56,551 --> 01:12:00,580
your mom's house challenge
to put stuff in your budget.

1139
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,670
It's a viral challenge.

1140
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:07,530
There'll be put out on
Facebook my associate like
the ice bucket challenge and

1141
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:12,330
it's right, it's a tight
shot and it's like, hey guys,

1142
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:15,840
my name is Bert Kreischer. It's ready for
the, it's ready. I'm ready for the uh,

1143
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,570
the butt plug challenge right now.
You've got to try to guess.

1144
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,690
Am I putting a butt plug in or
am I not putting a blood put yet?

1145
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,310
And it's just a shot of my
eyes and it's being going

1146
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,240
and people have to guess if you
really did it or if you didn't do it.

1147
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,090
And then do you show them and then you
pull back and either pants on or your

1148
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,940
nick will you do about plug
video? I did a, I would know,

1149
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,040
but I tell you what,
I would do a suppository video.

1150
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,220
Have you ever put up a sub pository
in your ass? Won't have one put in,

1151
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:49,680
but it's been a long, this is my
impression of getting into some hot,

1152
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,220
this is my impression of a suppository
getting put in your asshole.

1153
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:58,200
This is me as the suppository
getting put in your asshole.
Okay. Ready? Yeah. No, no,

1154
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,740
no, no, no. I'll take it from here. Okay.

1155
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:07,600
So I've put a lot of depositories.
How often? A lot. Cause I,

1156
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:12,030
cause sometimes I fucking ship fire and
source depository is what cools it down.

1157
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,470
See how you do it. Like [inaudible]
I've done it very recently.

1158
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,070
Like if I eat a lot of spicy stuff
in my fucking assholes burning,

1159
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:23,730
I'll just show what Chabot preparation
h suppository up there. Wow.

1160
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:27,170
And that cools your ass off
immediately. It feels good. Oh,

1161
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,940
positive. Never. Never a toy
or a toy. What kind of toy?

1162
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:37,110
Like a little car or something.
Oh No, no. I take him sex toy.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1163
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:40,620
no. I never, I got the little
one. No, I've never had any.

1164
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:41,910
You never been pegged
or anything like that?

1165
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:45,150
Never been pegged to finger
up my ass, obviously. Okay,

1166
01:13:45,151 --> 01:13:46,450
so then we're getting somewhere.
Yeah.

1167
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,340
I mean who hasn't had a finger in
there as well? I mean how often? No.

1168
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,400
Like a college. That was the last
time. Uh, yeah. Leanne, we'll do it.

1169
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,240
This is how much you do it.

1170
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,300
This is my impression of me and
Leanne during oral sex. Ready?

1171
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:04,710
Put your finger in my ass. What?
Nothing. She would not do that.

1172
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:08,280
That's not the end. Because as soon
as I said that Leanne was just like,

1173
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:12,040
are you gay? That's where they embrace
down. I'm not putting fingers in your ass.

1174
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,370
I mean your wife, I would
input a guy, put a shit.

1175
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:18,820
No. Yeah. Well I don't know.

1176
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:23,710
I mean we're asked is a real dry.
Anytime I would ever offer that,

1177
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,880
it would be a Coleen doubt.
Okay.

1178
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,860
I don't have any shit hanging out in
my body that I'm not getting rid of

1179
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:34,390
immediately. Yeah. I don't know. But
you're asked. Seems real dicey to me.

1180
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,670
If you had to put your finger
on one of our assets. Who's who?

1181
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,210
Did Tom ask the question?
I mean

1182
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:45,970
nobody like looked on base. Let's
say. I'm not married to him,

1183
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:47,620
young guys,
just my friends.

1184
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,890
Just knowing what I know about
both of your personal hygiene.

1185
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,080
His is way better than
yours. No. You have very,

1186
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,920
a very lax slack idea of personal hygiene.

1187
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,740
It's about his personal life.

1188
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,140
I remember one time I picked something
out of my body or something and I smelled

1189
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,720
it and Tom goes, you would
smell that I grow. I'm sorry.

1190
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:14,680
If you find an object on your body,
your first thing isn't a smell it.

1191
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,250
That's a first thing I do. If I bought
it. It's like, where are you finding it?

1192
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:21,360
What better thing? Something between
your toes. First thing I do it well.

1193
01:15:21,361 --> 01:15:24,100
What's that? I don't smell
between my, no. Oh, Mike.

1194
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,820
I would investigate but I wouldn't
smell out. Look at it. I'm all.

1195
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:32,860
Then just start to smell that
bubbly. Okay. Say belly button. Lynn.

1196
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:36,130
I wouldn't have been here. You don't rub
your finger behind your and smelling? No.

1197
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,300
Why would you do it?
Try it.

1198
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:46,120
Do you use, does your smell your behind
my ears do right now. All this nasty.

1199
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,480
I'm wearing headsets. No, it's
because you're nasty though.

1200
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:54,220
It's not cause I'm nasty.
I'm 90% of the [inaudible] told us.

1201
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:58,540
Remember when you used to live on set
up sixth street downstream from us?

1202
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:02,800
I just treat whatever that you use to
clip your toenails and then you collect

1203
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:06,490
them on a piece of scotch tape and then
you tape it under a coffee tea coffee

1204
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:10,600
table, which is so nasty, nasty,
nasty. Why is that not nasty?

1205
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,110
It's so nasty.

1206
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:21,280
If you had to smell balls right now,
you think smell better. Minor Tom.

1207
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,850
Tom's a thousand times
hotter.

1208
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:31,270
Always bet your balls smell
her horrendous. And here's why.

1209
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:35,410
I'm going to tell you why you don't wear
underwear and your genes are not clean.

1210
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,480
You wear the same jeans
every time I see you.

1211
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,460
And on top of their cell phones
like you usually think of like, hey,

1212
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:45,970
this guy drinks like a 1590 bottles a day,

1213
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:49,150
like probably smells between his legs,
stinky.

1214
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,960
You really think you're to do your
balls smell good right now. Right now?

1215
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:55,870
Right now.
I'm good right now,

1216
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:59,740
but I don't think they're quite at that
sour state. You showered last night?

1217
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,960
I showered this morning. Yeah,
but guess what I'm saying?

1218
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:06,070
You're naturally stink here.
Well, my balls right now are ripe.

1219
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:09,470
I can tell because they're all in these
genes and these genes are a older,

1220
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,430
they're a little older.
They're three, three weeks old.

1221
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,550
That's how long you go between
washing your jeans. Yeah.

1222
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,810
I've actually had a pair of jeans.

1223
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,270
One time I was flying back from South
Africa and I was on the plane. I went,

1224
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,920
I think my jeans smell.

1225
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,790
I could smell my jeans and then
I washed them and I was like, oh,

1226
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:32,170
they're not that color for real.
How old are these? Yeah. Yeah.

1227
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:36,200
I think Leanne is just really accepting
of the fact that you're disgusting.

1228
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:41,190
My teeth, my teeth are good right now.
Brushed their good cause I know I don't.

1229
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,860
I floss, I floss like aggressively, but
more importantly, our waterpik every day.

1230
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:49,610
That's pretty good. That's good.
Let's see a smile. He brush. Why not?

1231
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:53,130
Cause cause I already know, I already
know one time you go, you were being,

1232
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:56,210
you were talking, you go,
hey, why don't you get your
teeth fixed? Why don't you go,

1233
01:17:56,211 --> 01:17:58,520
you got money, just get your teeth
wigs. You got to get them whitened.

1234
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:04,000
Wait one brown one the top though.
Now your teeth look good there.

1235
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,660
Okay. No till your teeth are good. But
I bet your beard smells like clean.

1236
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,790
It smells like balls often.

1237
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:13,100
Cause I played with my balls
and then I played with my beat.

1238
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,440
Leanne will be kissing me and go, have
you been playing with your Dick Today?

1239
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,850
And I'll go, why? And
she goes, you're a face,

1240
01:18:19,851 --> 01:18:23,250
smells like balls one
time you got you so gross

1243
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:37,220
And I go, what'd you touch? And you
were like, oh no. And then you're like,

1249
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:59,280
I don't play with my asshole
and here's what I do.

1250
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:06,310
I don't like, but stuff I'm not into,
but never had a finger in your butt.

1251
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,670
I've had a finger in my butt.
I don't like it. I'm not.

1252
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,330
It makes me feel like I have to Brown

1253
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,980
or Lewis and Clark.

1254
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,510
I haven't had one in mind in a long time.

1255
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:26,190
I'm afraid of getting shit on my fingers.
That's what happened.

1256
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,430
I don't bear scratch my
be whole with my hands.

1257
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:35,110
I don't bear scratch my arm
pits. I do it. I'll do it over,

1258
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:39,740
but then I'll just change my clothes.
I'll just take off the underwear.

1259

1274
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:52,130
It's cool. It's really
cool. They also have the,

1275
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,210
the overstock from the,
uh,

1276
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:58,860
the last tour that I did the tour bus
champ with a vert taking a shit in the

1277
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:00,900
corner that will also be in the store.

1278
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,040
So there's a poster that this
designer May, he uh, he's awesome.

1279
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:07,410
He listens to the show and he
was designed posters for me.

1280
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:11,880
He'll just come up with things and he
put this one tour bus champ was the theme

1281
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:14,940
and he puts the location and
all this, uh, you know me on it.

1282
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,570
And then right behind the bus you
were squatting, taking a shit. And,

1283
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:21,720
and that was like, the people
loved it. They were like, hey,

1284
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:22,680
there's partaking tickets chair.

1285
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:27,330
Oh, cool. Nice smell behind yours. Yeah.

1286
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:33,180
Is it moist?
I shower,

1287
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:38,770
I shower, I shower every day. I
know what you're talking about.

1288
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:42,270
Ross is the one that turned me onto that.
That's if you were heads, if you'd like,

1289
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:44,930
if you didn't shower and you, and
you would put on headsets. Yeah,

1290
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:49,270
that makes sense. You'd be sweating.
They're right. And maybe they don't make,

1291
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:51,900
you know what I mean?
They're not like sweaty

1292
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:57,900

The Netflix doc? No. Oh my God.

1295
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:12,460
This is, yes. Turn it up. Turn
it up. And this is pretty cool.

1296
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,103
Check this out.

1297
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:22,580
Was a sudden violent
crimes across America,

1298
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,140
several high profile violent crimes
have gripped the nation these past few

1299
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:30,530
months around the same
time unknown fattened,

1300
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:34,640
racist comedian went on to
work in a similar pattern.

1301
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:39,380
I just want to show you what a real tour
best champ does to hold down the title

1302
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,370
from the shooting deaths of two African
Americans that it can Tuckey supermarket

1303
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,820
to the killing of 11 worshipers
at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

1304
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:52,030
This documentary [inaudible] between
Bert Kreischer at these hate crimes from

1305
01:22:54,141 --> 01:22:54,920
Charlotte and Atlanta.

1306
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,760
Georgia is one of only five
states without a hate crime law.

1307
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,610
Right now I'm at the hard
rock live in Orlando.

1308
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:06,070
We're seeing is that the bulk of
these crimes are, are aimed at

1309
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,510
immigrants and Muslims.
A man is still in jail tonight,

1310
01:23:10,511 --> 01:23:12,250
charged with a hate crime after police.

1311
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:14,800
Say he threatened to kill a
woman in downtown Portland.

1312
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,540
Crushers stop heinous crimes.
Uh,

1313
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:26,550
netflix.in 2019 that's great work.

1314
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,930
That's got to be awesome to be so good

1315
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,080
active with them.
Yeah.

1316
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:38,350
You know what was going to be cold.
It's like it's going to become real news.

1317
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,840
Oh, this out of context is going to
fuck somebody up. Oh, out of context.

1318
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:46,030
They will believe it.
We're going to,

1319
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,070
we're going to drop these like
kind of everywhere. You know?

1320
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:50,140
I remember that there was a person,

1321
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:54,070
that's how I was responsible
for the synagogue shootings.
Someone said that, oh,

1322
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,300
I sent it to you. Really? A long story.
I'm not getting into into it. Yeah.

1323
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:01,720
Somebody tweeted you that. Not Don't
let it change the fucking subject.

1324
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:05,760
Someone genuinely wrote an article saying
I was responsible for those synagogues

1325
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:07,310
shooting. Okay, let's
change this second. Okay.

1326
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:12,850
But how often do you shower for Leanne?
Everyday. Everyday. Everyday? Yeah.

1327
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:16,540
So this is the type of guy you got it.
Oh cool. Yeah. I saw her every day.

1328
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:23,320
We're talking about these guys.
Right? Burger. Right. Here's the,

1329
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:26,590
so Bert is where bridge right there.
Right

1330
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,210
where? Just the way, way
in. Right? Why is this

1331
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:35,640
slow?
Right?

1332
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,440
So we can say that bird is in,

1333
01:24:40,441 --> 01:24:43,560
what place is he in first place?
Second place.

1334
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,540
He's in fourth quarter. Right births
and fourth place. First one second Sam.

1335
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,720
Right. So births and forth. Okay.

1336
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:54,520
This is crazy. Yes. I've
never seen this. Yeah.

1337
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:58,910
People are still learning about math and
stuff like that based on how fat burden,

1338
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:03,620
by the way, whoever who just
said that, I don't know.

1339
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:09,500
One of your fucking laugh
tracks back there. No.

1340
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:12,980
People sent that in a long time ago,
but apparently I've never seen this.

1341
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:16,790
They're still sending it out. This
one's new. Okay. Oh cool. Yeah,

1342
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,830
I was super excited to keep playing.
The rest of it.

1343
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,140
Turn up my volume of my head
says I'm not hearing it.

1344
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:25,360
Fair enough. Tell me again
who's first place jail. Jasper,

1345
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,380
Joe and then second. Hi, sorry. Second.

1346
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,630
Tom. Tom. Tom,

1347
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,323
who's in fourth?

1348
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:43,570
Kids laughing. I don't know.
I think they like your name.

1349
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,520
I bet kids like your name. Yeah.
It's a fun name of a great man.

1350
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:50,740
You don't hear it a lot either?
No. Like Burton earnings.

1351
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:53,500
What does that some teacher that's just
basically talking about the weight loss

1352
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:54,130
challenge.

1353
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:57,910
It's a teacher who's a is usually we
get like English as a second language

1354
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:01,060
teachers and like when they're just
trying to come up with sentences,

1355
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:03,730
they'll just, you know, they'll
throw in something like,

1356
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,580
and then what happens if you eat too much?
And then the kids go,

1357
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:11,030
you get like bird like that.
I don't know,

1358
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:15,140
they just send it in. I'm starting
to understand this fake news thing.

1359
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,110
It was becomes real.

1360
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,830
There's people that come out to me after
the shows that are massively overweight.

1361
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,320
They're like, Hey, are you fat? Fuck.
And you're like, and you're like,

1362
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:29,180
you're fatter than I am.
Like I get that when they're like,

1363
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:31,310
um,
when it actually,

1364
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:36,490
the only person who will say something
to you like to my face will be like a

1365
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:41,930
really fat guy. Oh yeah. Or the most
abusive fat comment. You're like,

1366
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:45,380
who's this guy will be like 380
and he's like, Hey, are you fat?

1367
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:49,070
Fuck or block someone today?
You did. Yeah. I don't mind.

1368
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,800
I get,
I can,

1369
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:55,340
I have the probably the thicker skin
out of most of the comics out there.

1370
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:58,160
I get I, I can take a joke and
I'm fine with it and I get,

1371
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,680
I can understand an attempt
at a joke to fall short.

1372
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:03,560
I understand that they're not pros at it.
I've fallen short,

1373
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,910
but sometimes you get guys who just say
mean shit and I'll take it if you like.

1374
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,530
I mean, I'll be like, you
know, if the guy follows me,

1375
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:12,080
I know he was trying to be funny. If you
don't follow me, I'm like, sorry man,

1376
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:14,930
that's not how it works. You got fucking
blocked. Yeah, you get to suck a dick.

1377
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:19,340
Or if like I blocked people because they
said way too much mean shit about you.

1378
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:21,110
And I'm like, oh no, he's my friend.

1379
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:23,720
I like him more than I like
you and now I'm blocking you.

1380
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:27,410
I would like to a lot of people
on Instagram for the comment, Oh,

1381
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:28,870
I've blocked a lot of people on Instagram.

1382
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,730
We just get all my thing and
start fights with people and just,

1383
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:34,640
but they're trying to do like an inside
joke, but they're legit starting fights.

1384
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:38,180
I just go, man, you can't play anymore.
You've got to understand the nuance of it.

1385
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:41,510
You've got to get out of a sense of
humor about it at least. Yeah, I agree.

1386
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,000
I don't like, I don't like
the super abusive stuff. Like,

1387
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,050
or if I post a picture of
my family and they go, ah,

1388
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:51,770
they say like really horrible shit
about like whatever. I'm just like,

1389
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,860
ah, you're not gonna play. Yeah,

1390
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,000
but I think that's the right we have
is to say, Hey, I'm not going to,

1391
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:58,840
cause I know,
I remember when,

1392
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,820
when we first did the fat shaming
at the very beginning, uh,

1393
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:03,010
there were people that did not,
would,

1394
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,630
you weren't in on the joke and they
weren't getting it at first and there were

1395
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:08,360
picking sides for real. Fuck
Bert. I fucking hate that guy.

1396
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,050
He'll have sued his own jokes.
He's a fucking,

1397
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,070
you don't even have a Netflix special.
Who the fuck is he anyway?

1398
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,890
He's just some guy from travel channel.
I remember you going like, Huh?

1399
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,080
He's blocked and go fuck
himself. Yeah. No, I don't,

1400
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:19,430
I don't like to really mean stuff.

1401
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,420
I thought there's like a circle of
people that we kind of like is not racist

1402
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,254
guys.

1403
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:29,420
Like this is a circle of
people that get the joke,

1404
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:33,230
but then there's people that just, Oh
yeah, we put them in World War II footage.

1405
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:38,150
It's a joke.
I didn't think I'd have to say it.

1406
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:41,930
That's not real.
Not a Nazi.

1407
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:54,170
Do you realize that that was an off the
cuff comment though. This started it.

1408
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:57,600
You were just sitting down.
We were promoting it was a perfect time.

1409
01:28:57,601 --> 01:29:01,320
It was a part number, like here's the
fattest and, and we just pause. Like,

1410
01:29:01,321 --> 01:29:02,190
what's another bad

1411
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,860
thing to say? Uh, super.

1412
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:08,180
Unapologetically Reddix the racist
guy and like, if that was it,

1413
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,250
we've got to get a new thing going.
What do you want to be?

1414
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,710
Oh,
the vessels in comedy and comedy.

1415
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:16,530
I drove with the biggest
dick smelly his balls.

1416
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:24,050
Um, grossest brighter,

1417
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,730
exciting
stage presence.

1418
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:33,570
Charged with rape, but never too late.

1419
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:34,410
Someone's already done that.

1420
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:39,850
Yeah. Some fucking guy used to be my
friend did that. What am I going to say?

1421
01:29:39,851 --> 01:29:43,640
His name. All right, let's go
tour by the way. You Maniac. Yeah.

1422
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,790
So your tour is a huge success.
Probably bigger than you ever thought.

1423
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:52,050
It would be way bigger than I ever thought
it would be. And everywhere you're,

1424
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:56,800
you're adding shows you fucking touring
every week like a psycho. Um, when,

1425
01:29:56,830 --> 01:30:00,250
so when are you, uh, what's,
what's the next stops where you,

1426
01:30:00,251 --> 01:30:03,520
that you want to people to come to?
Where are you, where are you going to be?

1427
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:05,800
I know you have everything,
but I think, no, I think, uh,

1428
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:10,080
everything's sold, but you know,
there's always like single tickets,

1429
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:12,180
there's always available
tickets. So like, uh, on,

1430
01:30:12,181 --> 01:30:14,640
on their second shows there's
always like, you know, like,

1431
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:19,080
like a two packets somewhere.
I'm in New Orleans this week,

1432
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:24,240
Austin, Dallas, and then, uh,
and then I do like jersey,

1433
01:30:24,241 --> 01:30:28,500
Philly, DC, and then that
run to the Middle East,
middle, middle of the country.

1434
01:30:28,501 --> 01:30:30,600
And then I'm,
and then I'm in Australia and Europe.

1435
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,810
Yeah. Yeah. I think
Europe's already sold out.

1436
01:30:32,811 --> 01:30:35,210
And then Australia has got open tickets,
I think,

1437
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:37,670
but that's like fucking three months,
four months away. That's great.

1438
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,790
Are you ever going to do Australia? And
we're talking right now for real. Yeah.

1439
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:44,600
The main thing is I didn't
want to announce it a way
ahead of time. I was like,

1440
01:30:44,601 --> 01:30:47,000
you can't put me in a
position where I get fucked.

1441
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:51,110
So we'd have to announce it closer to
the date. So we went a little B. Wow.

1442
01:30:51,111 --> 01:30:54,050
I mean it would,
I would announce it later in the year.

1443
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,670
And so it be later in the year

1444
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,193
ball.

1445
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,970
No more like winter. You got, you
know, you've got to do when they go,

1446
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:03,751
ladies and gentlemen,

1447
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:06,750
put your hands together for Tom Segura
and don't walk out on stage for 15

1448
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:07,584
minutes.

1449
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:11,620
You've done a story with Joe though,
right?

1450
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:15,010
And I did the Melbourne comedy festival.
Hey,

1451
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:17,630
what's going to be our sober October
challenges here? I don't know.

1452
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,271
Think about it now.

1453
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:21,910
So we're not thinking of it at the last
minute and we're not doing the surf

1454
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:25,570
thing. I don't, I mean, I don't know
how he would, yeah, I know it's October.

1455
01:31:25,571 --> 01:31:30,470
It's gonna be cold as
fuck. It's really cold. Uh,

1456
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,650
how about we each raise a wolf

1457
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,800
children?
That's a great idea.

1458
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,230
I'm trying to plan my touring around it
because I don't want to be touring to

1459
01:31:42,231 --> 01:31:45,640
aggressively in October. Yeah. You
did not do well if you did that. Yeah.

1460
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:46,873
Right now I'm out.

1461
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:50,000
They want me to go out every single
weekend in October and I'm like, I can't.

1462
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:53,720
I can't. I sober October. Too much
fun. I want to be present for it.

1463
01:31:53,721 --> 01:31:56,390
I want to be here. I want to do
something where we all do it together.

1464
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:58,530
Like we did hot yoga where
it's bringing together,

1465
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:00,310
we're going to say first one was better.

1466
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:04,390
The first one was better
than the competition got
intense and the only person,

1467
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:06,660
I mean I didn't, I didn't even talk
to Ari. I couldn't even talk to rex.

1468
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:10,680
He was so competitive about it this year,
this year's or whatever,

1469
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:14,080
and I didn't talk to Joe wants and we'd
all be in our taxed by the only person I

1470
01:32:14,081 --> 01:32:16,540
ever spoke to is you. Yeah.
Like I want to do something.

1471
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:20,710
His cohesive kidneys were shutting
down like he was doing stupid shit.

1472
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,260
We can't do that. We talked about
it last night and he was like,

1473
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:26,650
it's good to know. I still got that part
of my brain around where he's like, ah,

1474
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,770
oh, it's survival mode. Let's
fucking go. And I was like, yeah,

1475
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:31,120
that my brain didn't do that at all.

1476
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:36,940
What did, did it bother you? What?
When we did sober October. Yeah.

1477
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:40,610
It's stupid. I think it's horrible
and it ruins our family life.

1478
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,690
It puts a wrench in everything.
Wow.

1479
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:45,920
She sounds like Leanne hard
fucking core rolled out. Yeah,

1480
01:32:45,921 --> 01:32:49,340
because where are the other
half to sober? October. In fact,

1481
01:32:49,341 --> 01:32:53,120
I think she and I should do a podcast
when you guys are doing sober October so

1482
01:32:53,121 --> 01:32:55,940
we can let people know how
much it wreaks havoc on.

1483
01:32:55,941 --> 01:32:58,310
Everybody's glad our
wives to see which uh,

1484
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:02,680
which wife could milk the most
semen out of us. It be cool. Yeah.

1485
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:06,620
That's a good challenge. It's a
great town. I liked that. Hey,

1486
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:11,330
someone dropped the artwork. Sober October
milk. The men, the Milkman challenge.

1487
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:14,390
I like this one. Well Ari needs a milker.
He doesn't have want to feel fine.

1488
01:33:14,391 --> 01:33:18,190
If you find someone who's got some 25
year old hippie that makes put Julia in

1489
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,800
New York. Yeah. Who doesn't know it is.
She'll, she'll milk them through a table,

1490
01:33:21,801 --> 01:33:24,140
you know, that'd be fine. Let's see.

1491
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:28,160
What can you guys do that's inclusive
and fun and cause I think you're right.

1492
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:32,870
The solo nature of the last one wasn't
fun cause you guys have enjoyable. It was

1493
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:36,590
interesting. Yeah it was a good journey
but it wasn't, it wasn't, you know,

1494
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:39,950
what kind of stuff, here's the thing
about the hot yoga. It's, it kinda sucks.

1495
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,740
It is doable.
It's about going there.

1496
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:47,870
What if it was more like a like at spin
class kind of thing. Like that sucks.

1497
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,100
It's doable but you don't want to
go fucking 15 times in a month.

1498
01:33:52,101 --> 01:33:53,510
You know what if we paired up with,

1499
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:56,210
I mean I think all of us
are pretty anti corporate,

1500
01:33:56,390 --> 01:34:01,390
but what if we did pair up with a big
corporation to do something of theirs so

1501
01:34:01,731 --> 01:34:04,340
we could, I don't know. I mean we're
already gonna lose jokes. He's like,

1502
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:06,320
we're not going all financially
benefit off sober October.

1503
01:34:06,321 --> 01:34:09,950
I think part of the fun of it is
that it's organic, you know? Yeah.

1504
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:10,791
I mean going in like,

1505
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:14,480
I think going to the like making yourself
go to the class and knowing that you

1506
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:16,730
can miss a day, but man, you
better not miss too many.

1507
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:20,960
That made it interesting to me.
Yeah. I I liked, I mean, when Ari,

1508
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:24,500
like when we were in Arizona and art, he
was like, hey, we gotta go. We gotta go.

1509
01:34:24,501 --> 01:34:27,620
We have a hot yoga class at five and
then we're doing a show at eight.

1510
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,080
It was kind of fun to dip out,
go do hot yoga.

1511
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:33,020
Did you already do that
week with him then you guys,

1512
01:34:33,021 --> 01:34:36,680
weren't you asking to do Salt Lake, Utah?
He already did it. Yeah. How was it?

1513
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:41,540
It was great. Ari Is fucking
hilarious to watch ski. Really.

1514
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:45,970
He's the ugliest skier you've ever seen
in your life. He is, first of all, he's,

1515
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:50,510
he's taller and lankier than anyone out
there. He dresses like he's a child.

1516
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:55,520
He has like Stars and Stripes Pants,
a Dirk Novinski Jersey on.

1517
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:59,630
He covers his face, all black. So it looks
like he's like one of those Gi Joe Man.

1518
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:03,230
And then he skis, uh, like a pizza pie,

1519
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:07,100
whereas he just snow power the whole time.
But he goes 60 miles an hour.

1520
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:11,400
Snowplowing like it's disgusting.
Uh,

1521
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,510
yeah, but he, uh, there
was a phone we can, man.

1522
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:17,330
All we did was talk shit
about comedy. Really? Oh,

1523
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,990
that's your favorite thing to
do? 100%. That's yours too.

1524
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:25,980
Not as much as you, I enjoy watching you
gossip more than you had caught me. I,

1525
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:29,450
we like gossiping because at the
million, but we, I mean like,

1526
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:34,220
do you think you're like, you, uh, enhance
it for me? I get into it. I get into it.

1527
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:36,260
I like to punch up a good chaos.
It's fun to watch.

1528
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:39,380
You get excited about shad target.
Oh Dude. When we've, we've,

1529
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:42,530
we went down this blue run,
it's called boomer,

1530
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:46,400
and in the middle of boomer and Salt Lake
City, there's a bar and we went down.

1531
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,730
We'd been skiing like half the day we
like maybe five runs. We get to this bar,

1532
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:51,410
boom or, and we sit down
when again, won't appear.

1533
01:35:51,411 --> 01:35:54,590
We want a beer and then something pops
up on the Internet and I have someone's

1534
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:55,970
like, dude, have you seen this?

1535
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,840
And all of a sudden we're at boom
worth this bar for two hours.

1536
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,840
And then at one point were like, fuck it.
You just want to get out of the bottom,

1537
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:06,620
get drunk and finish this conversation.
Dude, it was the greatest.

1538
01:36:06,621 --> 01:36:08,720
Sounds like a lot of fun, dude. I have.

1539
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:13,040
I could talk about comedy for days.
I love it

1540
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,140
now just to keep it up and stuff. Don't
worry. What do you texting them for?

1541
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:22,040
Texting. Laugh track.
Oh, you mean laugh track?

1542
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:25,100
I hear them cackling in there.
They're laughing at moments.

1543
01:36:25,101 --> 01:36:27,020
They went to that and I don't,
do you think I'm instructing them?

1544
01:36:27,021 --> 01:36:29,270
And I thought it was, oh, it was
legit. Laugh track when I was outside.

1545
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:33,320
I was looking at their fucking cackle
it you're here to get, but that's,

1546
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:37,190
that's just him. Why is he had the
fucking mask on his face. He's, he's, oh,

1547
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:39,730
he's black. Got Aids. Oh. So
he didn't want me to know.

1548
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,980
I'm like, hey dude, I got friends
coming. You mind covering up?

1549
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:51,740
He's like, yeah, no problem.
You got a legit set here.

1550
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,880
Yeah. Do you like it? Well,

1551
01:36:55,881 --> 01:36:58,370
not when Mcdonald's was sponsoring,
because when they gave us,

1552
01:36:58,371 --> 01:37:00,560
they gave us two point $3
million and they were like,

1553
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:05,270
if you paint the set or a Mcdonald's
colors and when they pulled out

1554
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,540
and Morton's jumped on and then
they fired us like two weeks ago.

1555
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:10,673
Really?

1556
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:14,120
So what's it like? What's the ideal
a sponsor for you guys? I mean,

1557
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:15,800
we'd love to keep it in the steak house

1558
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:20,770
wheelhouse, but I dunno man.
I mean we have a couple of,

1559
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,400
there's this, a Korean steakhouses
looking to do something,

1560
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:26,030
but the only one to throw us a few hundred
bucks, you know, they got that. Cool.

1561
01:37:26,610 --> 01:37:29,970
I'd rather, I'd rather have one of
the big dogs do it. Really? Sure.

1562
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:34,040
Like a like,
oh yeah.

1563
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:38,130
Or Smiths. Oh yeah, that'd be
great. Oh, that would be me.

1564
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:42,500
They get crazy food to go all
green and white. It would be great.

1565
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:46,310
And have a guy with like a nice little
butler coat come out or view a stake in

1566
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:50,740
the middle of our Houston's
even I like Houston Lot.

1567
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:53,300
Baby back ribs are the best
ribs in the fucking world.

1568
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,010
Pregnant with the first kid.

1569
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,290
We would go there once a week
during even say his name.

1570
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:02,540
That's how private you
are. Oh God. I'm so glad.

1571
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:07,700
Well we gotta get you a travel
smoker, Tommy. So you're really,

1572
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:12,290
you're smoking, smoking meat during the
show, during the show, during the day.

1573
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:16,970
Who sets it up? Dave Williamson or myself.
We can mostly Dave Williams sentences.

1574
01:38:16,971 --> 01:38:20,150
Such an inherently bad idea.
Jude. We set up the travel smoker.

1575
01:38:20,151 --> 01:38:21,020
We put out some chairs,

1576
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:24,350
put the awning out and crack some beers
and sit on the sidewalk outside the

1577
01:38:24,351 --> 01:38:27,000
theater. People were walking by
going, hey, wait, is it, is that you?

1578
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:30,110
All of us didn't even know who I am. I
go, yeah, they go, hey, I got a picture.

1579
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:32,660
Don't even know who I am.
I'll make sure it's hilarious.

1580
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:35,930
And then your meat's ready by the end of
the night or what? Oh yeah, yeah. It was,

1581
01:38:35,931 --> 01:38:40,520
well, we did a brisket in Tampa. We
did. She sign a sore ribs in Orlando.

1582
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:44,510
We did a pulled pork in Atlanta.
We've done it every,

1583
01:38:44,511 --> 01:38:49,010
we did Vegan burgers in Fort Lauderdale.
You set this up every night.

1584
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:53,780
Set up every night. It's so much fucking
fun. Shout out to rec tech. Wow, dude.

1585
01:38:53,781 --> 01:38:57,710
They got great gear. Where did they
meet you to like to give it to you?

1586
01:38:57,711 --> 01:39:01,280
I don't know. You know they sent me a
grill a while ago. Just, I don't know,

1587
01:39:01,281 --> 01:39:05,520
it's just send it to me and I didn't open
it. I didn't even, I just was like, ah,

1588
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:10,250
I'm busy and I'm busy. Yeah. It was
just this big grill and I was like,

1589
01:39:10,251 --> 01:39:11,170
I don't have time to put it together.

1590
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:15,110
They send it to and they gave me like a
custom great where it says the machine

1591
01:39:15,111 --> 01:39:17,460
on it and then one day I'm with Leanne.

1592
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,740
We got to talk to some
time off and I'm like,

1593
01:39:18,741 --> 01:39:20,390
I'm going to put that smoke
together and I put it together.

1594
01:39:20,391 --> 01:39:22,490
It's a really nice smoker.
And then I was like, Hey,

1595
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:23,720
I'm going to smoke some stuff tonight.

1596
01:39:23,721 --> 01:39:27,800
So I smoked some pork ribs and the
girls loved him and I was like, it's,

1597
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,770
I enjoy, you know, I'm a,

1598
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:33,900
I am the quintessential American
like homer Simpson male. Yeah.

1599
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:37,500
I love setting up my grill,
grilling out, having a beer.

1600
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,940
I'll say this by the way. Yeah, 100%
true. I've always told people this.

1601
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,910
You're an excellent cook.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1602
01:39:44,911 --> 01:39:46,920
I mean it genuinely and sincerely.

1603
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:51,420
I think back on those early
days when I was coming over,

1604
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:56,160
we would go over to their apartment
and, uh, I was looking, I was,

1605
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:59,910
I would look at going to your
place almost like, you know,

1606
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:03,850
when you go home from college, I'm going
to have some good food. When I'm home.

1607
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,150
You would cook feasts. Oh, I would ban
it. Those days are the best. Those were,

1608
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:12,330
I missed those days so much.
And the Nakey time,

1609
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,940
Nikki time number that when
girls get naked running around.

1610
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,790
I remember I took a shit on the roof.

1611
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:24,500
If I got to get together one time
to squash it was running around.

1612
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:27,750
She just looked at me and was like,
oh, just pinched one off right there.

1613
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:32,610
I looked at that house on my parents pool
one time, just jumped out of the pool,

1614
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:36,510
put her bathing suit, offside shit in
the yard and then jump back in the pool.

1615
01:40:36,511 --> 01:40:37,620
I was like,
that's my kid,

1616
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:41,610
you know,

1617
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:46,410
the rooftop and we would all go out
there and watch the sunset and drink beer

1618
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,573
and

1619
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,660
eat McDonald's. Mcdonald's. Sorry.

1620
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:55,350
That's right.

1621
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:57,870
Good time. But those are the, that
was the beginning of everything.

1622
01:40:57,871 --> 01:41:01,470
I think Tommy and I were just becoming
feature acts and you were coming a

1623
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,230
headliner.
You just had to choose girl.

1624
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,830
I did see before I even
knew anything about

1625
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:09,530
bonuses.
You guys came over and I did Columbus.

1626
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,860
It's right when we started doing
Rogan's podcast a little bit.

1627
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:15,880
You guys came over and as
Stroup was like, Hey, uh,

1628
01:41:15,881 --> 01:41:18,980
you hit your bonus is how do you want
it in cash or in the check. I was like,

1629
01:41:18,981 --> 01:41:23,810
I'll give it a cash. And he gave me like
$6,000 in cash and I was like, what?

1630
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,530
You came over to my house at night
and I was making it rain on Ios.

1631
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,370
She was on the ground and I
was just making it rain on her.

1632
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:32,720
And I know it was like, look at my bonus.
I had $6,000 in cash. You were like,

1633
01:41:32,721 --> 01:41:36,560
Holy Shit. I was like, I know.
Can you believe this dude?

1634
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:40,070
I look back to those times so
fondly because it was like,

1635
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:42,350
even like little things like,
um,

1636
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:45,330
do you remember the time he
told me I burp a lot? Yeah.

1637
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,810
Like we were in the car and you're like,
yeah,

1638
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,900
this is such like something wrong with,
there's some, you like the, if you don't,

1639
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:52,400
if you only know Tom for this podcast,

1640
01:41:52,401 --> 01:41:55,520
there's a part of his personality
you don't get, first of all, he,

1641
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:58,930
me and him are very similar in
that we, we right. Think so. We'll,

1642
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,980
we'll be writing a joke like
this. Oh yeah, yeah. That phase.

1643
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,910
But then there's another part of him where
he like wool. Like, it's almost like,

1644
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,833
uh,

1645
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:12,100
like a child where he looks at you and
you can tell he's got a thought isn't it?

1646
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:16,030
You burp a lot. And I was
like, Huh? He was like, Yo,

1647
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:18,860
you've burped like a hundred times in
this car ride. I was like, no I don't.

1648
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:22,160
And you're like, no, no, you actually
do. And then I started going,

1649
01:42:22,161 --> 01:42:23,540
God damn and I do burp a lot.

1650
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:28,010
And then the next thing was I saw him like
a week later. He was like, guess what?

1651
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,420
I talked to my doctor and he said,
there's definitely something wrong.

1652
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,600
I was like, really?
Because he was, I told him,

1653
01:42:35,601 --> 01:42:39,270
you said it was burping a lot and then I
was thinking about it and talking about

1654
01:42:39,271 --> 01:42:42,890
it to them and I definitely have
like some acid reflux. I was burping.

1655
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:47,870
I didn't realize you still do. You
always go, well I do have, I'm drinking,

1656
01:42:47,871 --> 01:42:50,680
but I was, I wasn't even drinking.
We're just in the car. Yeah.

1657
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:55,190
And I was burping like a lot.
And you're going, oh yeah,

1658
01:42:55,191 --> 01:42:59,060
I remember that was it. Yeah. I
err, err too. That's my big thing.

1659
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:01,010
Like if I make some things
that someone to eat,

1660
01:43:01,011 --> 01:43:03,650
something to eat and I watched
them take a bite, I'll go.

1661
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:10,820
You also, by the way,
but aside from you. Yeah,

1662
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:15,320
like you have told me, everyone told
me my whole life, they're like, ah,

1663
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:17,310
you slow down.
Just going to say that.

1664
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,310
I'm like a word made me feel like the,
I was a slow eater.

1665
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:25,880
Like he'd eat a steak and four bites. I
was like, are you all right? He'd be like,

1666
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:26,714
whoa.

1667
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:30,660
Oh Dude. That should be the
sweat when I eat. Yeah, no, he's,

1668
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:33,750
you're a fast eater now.
I don't know if you can do quantity,

1669
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,500
but I know that you can do speed.
Can we incorporate this and sober October?

1670
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:41,570
Maybe you're staying sober, but can you
start eating faster? Why didn't like that?

1671
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:46,820
Eating faster and faster. Whatever.
Eating contest Rocktober I could eat.

1672
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:50,950
Can't get fucked up, but you can eat.
We're gonna lose Joel and eating contest.

1673
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,130
Yes.
Fatter on October.

1674
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:56,090
Yeah. He was to get the
fattest. That's not, we've got
to make it something that's,

1675
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:58,520
no. Yeah, he would definitely,

1676
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:01,480
although he would just take it to the
next level of gain a hundred pounds and

1677
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:06,080
he'd be like, I'm going to lose it
this week. I'll lose it on a jog.

1678
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:08,150
We need it to be,
uh,

1679
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:12,230
something that is folds in
easy to Joe and Ari's life,

1680
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:17,220
but makes it fun for our family. So it's,
we're not, you know what I mean? Yeah. Oh,

1681
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:21,050
there it is. Oh, those are not the
burbs I'm talking about. I know, I know.

1682
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:23,570
I did a different on purpose.
I was almost doing the regular ones.

1683
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:27,050
Have you always been a fast eater?
A very,

1684
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:28,660
my dad was a fast heater
and so I looked at it,

1685
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:32,480
it's like a rite of manhood and you eat
fast and that's whole man back then.

1686
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:36,900
I eat horrifically fast. How, how?

1687
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:40,420
He's really fast to my daddy's real fast.
Like,

1688
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:45,650
like I'm like a shark. Like
I, I literally, my eyes go
back in my head and I just,

1689
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:50,730
and I just can't stop. I can't, I, I,
I don't know how to do the thing. It's,

1690
01:44:50,731 --> 01:44:53,660
this is a super fat person
thing where you're like, well,

1691
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:57,470
like even it's really good,
but I'm totally full,

1692
01:44:57,471 --> 01:45:01,340
but like I can't not eat everything.
Right. And then you're like, oh,

1693
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:04,820
it's really hurts. And you still like
Keith deedee and you're like God.

1694
01:45:04,821 --> 01:45:08,600
And then sometimes it's somebody like a
sensible not fat person. They'll be like,

1695
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,940
you know, you don't have to keep
eating that. And you're like, oh yeah,

1696
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:14,130
I didn't think about that. If someone
makes me a meal, I'll let you know.

1697
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:17,900
I'm not going to leave one part, not
eaten all of it. I'll heed all of it.

1698
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:20,210
I find it disrespectful
to not eat everything.

1699
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,510
Last night I had fought a friend's
house and I didn't, I was not hungry,

1700
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:26,360
but they served me a big bowl of pho,
ate the whole thing. I didn't want it.

1701
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:27,440
I just ate it cause I was like,

1702
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:32,630
I was shitting at the comedy store last
night because of it. I was a store.

1703
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:37,610
I'm like that. It was great. It was, it
was great. It was really awesome. Um,

1704
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,920
I also,

1705
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:45,320
if I'm that way with booze you like,
I cannot leave.

1706
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:48,930
I cannot leave a d. Like if someone
gives me, opens a bottle of wine, I go,

1707
01:45:48,931 --> 01:45:51,680
we're going to drink the whole bottle
of wine, not gonna drink half of it.

1708
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,780
If someone gives me a beer,
I'm not going to leave.

1709
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:55,970
I'm going to drink the whole beer.
I'm not going to say,

1710
01:45:55,971 --> 01:46:00,110
you're not going to leave here unless
you finished six more beers and a bottle

1711
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:03,260
of Tito's I have to finish. Yeah, that
makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1712
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,850
You're fine.
One of the first times,

1713
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,840
one of the first times I started and drink
for like six months when I was dating

1714
01:46:08,841 --> 01:46:13,250
Leanne, because we, she dumped
me for early on for drinking. No,

1715
01:46:13,251 --> 01:46:14,510
it wasn't for drinking,
but I,

1716
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:18,860
but what we got into a fight was I was
drunk when that happened and I got,

1717
01:46:18,861 --> 01:46:21,770
I felt like alcohol betrayed me
for the first time. So I was like,

1718
01:46:21,771 --> 01:46:24,920
I'm putting alcohol in timeout. And then
I was like, and then I got to a place,

1719
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:27,170
I was like, maybe I'll never
drink again. I thought that.

1720
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,470
And then we went to Italy and it
was snowing. We were in Venice,

1721
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:33,380
it was snowing and we were,
and it was like during a vacation.

1722
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:36,080
So gnomes on this roads?
No, it was on the streets.

1723
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:39,950
And we went to a little restaurant
and it started snowing and she said,

1724
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:43,400
I say we just walk around all night. And
I was like, I gotta be honest with you.

1725
01:46:43,401 --> 01:46:47,030
I really want a glass of wine and I
hadn't drank or wanted to drink in six

1726
01:46:47,031 --> 01:46:50,430
months. She goes, do it. I
don't give a fuck. And I was
like, really? She goes, yeah.

1727
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:53,040
She goes, I don't think of a drinking
problem. I just think you drank a lot,

1728
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,490
but here's now, but this is
going from not drinking at all.

1729
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,430
So I have a couple of glasses of wine.
They bring the bottle out and I go,

1730
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:00,690
we're not going to leave
the fucking bottle.

1731
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:02,480
We're going to murder the goddamned
bottle. Like I'm not going to.

1732
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:06,210
And I hadn't drank at all and had
one glass. I felt really buzz. I go,

1733
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:09,420
we're killing the whole bottle now.
I'm burping a lot. And I notice it. Um,

1734
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,370
and then we killed the bottle
and we walked out in the snow.

1735
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:13,470
It was one of the most romantic
nights I ever had in my life. Oh,

1736
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:17,820
it's fucking great. And in
Venice? In Italy and just snow,

1737
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:20,310
it just started falling.
It was brand new.

1738
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:22,290
Snow covered streets
known had walked on it,

1739
01:47:22,291 --> 01:47:25,050
it was like midnight and it
was right after New Year's Eve.

1740
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:27,480
So everything was shut down.
Like your honeymoon or no,

1741
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:30,780
it's that she thought I was going to
propose to her. Yeah. And I didn't,

1742
01:47:30,781 --> 01:47:32,700
I did it in our bed and of later.

1743
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:36,270
So the way that you walked through and
she was like, here it is. I can't be like,

1744
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:41,370
oh, I gotta take a shit. Pretty
bad going on at the time I shoe.

1745
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:42,810
Huh? What, what are you crying for?

1746
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,780
Wait,
why did she dump you?

1747
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:52,170
We got into a fight with her
friend and I wouldn't let it go.

1748
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:56,700
Her friend picked a fight with me at a
dinner and I wouldn't let it go. And I,

1749
01:47:57,090 --> 01:48:01,200
I like, after three days I was still
upset with it and, and, and I hadn't said,

1750
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:05,910
I love you to her yet. She
had said, I love you to me.
And I hadn't said Olivia. Uh,

1751
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:11,400
four months. She's like, I
love you and you're like, cool.
I said, cool. And she goes,

1752
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:16,410
I said, no, actually. I said,
she goes, I love you. And I
said, you do? She said, yeah,

1753
01:48:16,411 --> 01:48:20,670
and you love me. And I said, I do.
She said, yeah. And I was like, cool.

1754
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:25,340
And I just wasn't, I wasn't,
I wasn't ready to settle
down. I didn't want to like,

1755
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:28,280
I didn't know.
I didn't want to put labels on it at

1756
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:33,240
the time. 28. God, you
guys are old now. Two

1757
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:39,090
kids are grown ass kids,
man. No Shit. Brow.

1758
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:44,280
We have babies in this for forever now.
He just fucking started.

1759
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:48,720
That's cozy. That's crazy.
Dude. I, I was 33 when you were,

1760
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:52,530
when I was when, but that's not that
different. You're like seven years older.

1761
01:48:52,531 --> 01:48:55,680
It's not that I'm not seven years
old or you're seven years older. No,

1762
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:59,550
you're seven years older than I was
when I had kids. Oh really? Yeah. Oh,

1763
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:04,530
so it's not that bad. Wait, how old
were you in Georgia was born 30 George.

1764
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,850
I'm 46 now.
She's 14 so 32 okay.

1765
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,070
No,
I was 30 when we got married.

1766
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:16,050
He was 28 I was 36 when you had the Ellis,

1767
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:18,240
the oldest. Say his name now. Yeah.

1768
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:22,440
Well I say the oldest for 36 that's
not too bad. No, it's not too bad,

1769
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:23,880
but it does make you old one.

1770
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:26,790
He's going to be a hundred when
his kids in kindergarten. Well,

1771
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:29,430
he's going to go to that high school
graduation and they'll be like your

1772
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:33,050
granddad. So Ollie mean
looking. Oh my gosh.

1773
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,520
And that she'll be like,
that's my dad. Come on. Hey,

1774
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:40,860
I'll be able to smoke pot with my kids.
Yeah,

1775
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:45,450
I'll be like 55 and George was in
college. That's pretty cool. Georgia,

1776
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:48,040
Georgia, me that dads or
when they ate, when they

1777
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,210
come home from the, they'll bring a friend
when they call and he'll be like, hey,

1778
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:55,870
you guys want to rage tonight?
God's going to get the cue fired up.

1779
01:49:57,230 --> 01:50:01,250
Who wants some smoke? Dinosaur
Barbecue ribs. Speedo on George.

1780
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,890
We've got a pool of 40 of her friends
are going to be like your tats.

1781
01:50:03,891 --> 01:50:06,540
So much fun. It should be. Yeah. Uh,

1782
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,620
George George's friends do not
think I'm pulling it all back.

1783
01:50:09,621 --> 01:50:12,890
No two fucks about me. Really? Yeah. I
lose friends who could give two shits.

1784
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:15,580
No one cares at all.
None of the friends.

1785
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:18,820
Right. I figured that some of
the friends, here's the thing,

1786
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:22,420
are any of the friends guys, boys?
No. Yeah. When they started having,

1787
01:50:22,421 --> 01:50:25,780
I don't even mean like, I mean a
boyfriend, but like a friend that's a boy.

1788
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:30,940
The friends are gonna go nuts for you.
When if I go, this is a, you know Kyle,

1789
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:34,220
I have classes him, he's going to go
fucking crazy. You're dad's a machine. Oh,

1790
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:35,063
he's going to love it.

1791
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:35,651
He's going to love it.

1792
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:38,940
And then we'll end up attracting just a
bunch of mouth breathing window liquors.

1793
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:42,350
Just, yeah. Oh Dude, I can
do keg stands. Yeah. Yeah.

1794
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:45,550
I shouldn't have a pizza box and want
to login to, I'm just like your dad.

1795
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:50,190
Oh yeah. That's when they start
dating. Yes, they're wiring.

1796
01:50:50,191 --> 01:50:52,110
You know that you've
wired them the like the,

1797
01:50:52,111 --> 01:50:55,140
it's like you date a guy like your dad.

1798
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:58,410
I did in the past before
Tom and I fucking hated it.

1799
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:01,560
It was such torture for me.
Nice running car washes.

1800
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:09,110
I thought it was big. So
we go to dinner tonight.

1801
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:12,500
You get in the car, you dress nice. Put
on the red lipstick. All right, let's go.

1802
01:51:13,130 --> 01:51:17,660
That's how I picture in my head.
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1803
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:22,130
It's not that far.
You've got the gold chain.

1804
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:27,570
No Way. Tommy is the opposite
of, of everything in my family,

1805
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,900
but that's why I was so attracted to
him cause he's like stable and sane and

1806
01:51:30,901 --> 01:51:34,800
kind and he does what he says he's
going to do and like he's just

1807
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:40,110
for him. Do you feel like, and I'll say
this, I know that you're successful,

1808
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,910
but none of us in this room are
as accessible as Tommy. Of course.

1809
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,350
You feel like you picked the right horse.
Oh my God.

1810
01:51:46,710 --> 01:51:49,530
All the time.
Whoever's on common.

1811
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:53,190
If you had said to me one of your friends
is going to be famous, I'd be like,

1812
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:54,243
whoa.

1813
01:51:56,860 --> 01:52:01,420
I say to him all the time, what do I tell
you, Tommy? What do I say to you? You him,

1814
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:05,830
you said, uh, she goes, he's a winner.
Yeah. I knew. I knew you were a winner.

1815
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:06,941
Here's the truth.

1816
01:52:06,941 --> 01:52:10,750
Burt shot is that I knew Tommy was a
goddamn winner from the moment that I met

1817
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:13,180
him. We know. Remember, we're all
fucking open. Miker is, will you're,

1818
01:52:13,181 --> 01:52:17,520
you're in a class ahead of us whenever,
but like Tommy was 23 and he was funnier.

1819
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:21,430
Everybody, like he's the kind that
started standing up and was amazing.

1820
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:26,350
It's Dan so far and I bombed in
front of Burt 10 times. Yeah,

1821
01:52:26,351 --> 01:52:29,320
but you also think fucking
you're thinking was straight.

1822
01:52:29,321 --> 01:52:30,540
I always knew that you would be,

1823
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:33,490
I'll tell you what I heads, I'll tell you
what I knew Tom. He was a winter. Yeah.

1824
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:38,200
Is, uh, we did a TV show
and they were like, hey,

1825
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:41,470
I was like, we need to bring in a writer.
Do you have any suggestions? I go,

1826
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:44,350
my buddy,
Tom Segura is a really great comic.

1827
01:52:44,351 --> 01:52:48,980
He could be writer and I was, I think I
was doing birth conquered at the time.

1828
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:53,240
And so I went to do birth conquer.
I came back a week later and Tom head,

1829
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:55,430
not only taking the head writers job,

1830
01:52:55,431 --> 01:52:57,500
but he was also executive
producing the show.

1831
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:02,480
The guy who was the executive
producer was now doing crowd control.

1832
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:07,540
Mary go buddy Tom James the
whole fucking show. He's like,

1833
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:09,410
so here's the breakdown,
I'll show you how it works.

1834
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:13,400
And he show ran the whole show.
And I was like, shut the fuck up.

1835
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:18,850
And that show was the funniest fucking
show that's ever called buzzed.

1836
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,713
Oh,
I remember

1837
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,710
fucking brainer like it was. And he
was, but that's why I picked exactly.

1838
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:30,470
If it makes sense.
And it was designed for Bert,

1839
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,400
like literally you
couldn't have anybody else.

1840
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:36,690
And the pilot was hilarious.
Hilarious.

1841
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:41,650
And they knocked that, they shut it
down immediately. Like it wasn't easy.

1842
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:44,060
Was involved. Yeah. And they were
like, the show's called buttons,

1843
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:48,120
but there's those dating shows where
they put boo boos and all those people.

1844
01:53:48,121 --> 01:53:52,020
The premise, the blind date show
is boozing. No, no, no. Remember

1845
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:57,740
they had a sober, for those of you
listening, we had a segment called, um,

1846
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,720
called, uh, was it, uh,
look at her, stick it, yeah.

1847
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:05,600
Where it was like we'd put up a slow
celebrity and you'd have to guess if she

1848
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:09,590
was straight or gay. Yeah.
And so hilarious. It was
hilarious. And it was like,

1849
01:54:09,591 --> 01:54:13,340
it was like Hilary Swank,
uh, uh, Jennifer Garner.

1850
01:54:13,490 --> 01:54:16,700
And then it was Jamie Lee Curtis
and this guy goes, stick it.

1851
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:20,780
My Dad fucked her and we're
like, what? And he goes, my
calf, Fuck Jamie Lee Curtis.

1852
01:54:20,781 --> 01:54:25,160
And I go, I always heard
she's a hermaphrodite. And
he goes, no, my dad fucker.

1853
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:28,040
But then again, what would my dad
say? He fucked a dude. Probably not.

1854
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:30,830
There's only one way to find out. I'm
going to call him. And we go, I go,

1855
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:32,240
if you call them,
you get an extra hundred dollars.

1856
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:35,270
That the Bose speaker phone
speaker mode. He goes, dad,

1857
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:39,560
did you fuck Jamie Lee Curtis and
his dad on the back goes affirmative

1858
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:44,900
duty. Do you remember the Mexicans
and headbutted each other? No. We,

1859
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:49,130
these two Mexican guys and Tom
had a segment called, uh, uh,

1860
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:53,610
Mexican or an automatic
scan. Maybe get one. Right?

1861
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,610
That was all Latino's. Jennifer
Lopez. Mexican. That's right.

1862
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,480
This was a guest they were basing it on.

1863
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:03,660
Whoever was the most successful was
Mexican, Mexican. And they're like,

1864
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:06,560
they're like, yeah. They're
like, she kills it. She's
Mexican. And we're like, Nah,

1865
01:55:06,561 --> 01:55:08,570
she's Puerto Rican.
This show is so great.

1866
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:11,810
We've got these girls in these hot three
girls and there was this thing that

1867
01:55:11,811 --> 01:55:14,390
we're going to have one girl put lipstick
on. Another girl with her toes. Yeah.

1868
01:55:14,391 --> 01:55:18,530
Like hold it and draw it and, and
do lipstick. Yeah. With their tall.

1869
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:23,630
And then she goes, can I do
it with my tits? No, no, no.
This is exactly where I go.

1870
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:27,090
So ladies, I don't know if
you noticed this, but none
of you are wearing lipstick.

1871
01:55:27,091 --> 01:55:29,480
And one of my favorite things in
the world as a woman would lipstick.

1872
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:32,600
So the challenges now, and she goes
to put it all on my tits and I went,

1873
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:38,210
yes it is. Yes. And she goes, what
have I put it on her with my tits?

1874
01:55:38,211 --> 01:55:41,450
I'm like, that'll work. Also,
there was no rhyme or reason.

1875
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:45,520
It was so fun. Facts as you guys
were drinking during the show, and I,

1876
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:50,070
they have a problem with that. Here's the,
he was not, I was not the guests could,

1877
01:55:50,071 --> 01:55:52,530
she could be on buzzed,
they were on buzz,

1878
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:56,880
but with what they blue was their
bank account. So if you boil,

1879
01:55:56,881 --> 01:55:58,740
it blew over 2.25,

1880
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:02,880
then we added a zero at the end
and you started the bank with $250.

1881
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,010
And on the ride home you
could win more money,

1882
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:06,060
but that's money you had to gamble.

1883
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:09,650
My favorite segment, what was that?
Was I would read a description,

1884
01:56:09,651 --> 01:56:14,600
you'd guess that this was a
television show or not. So
I'd be like, you know, like,

1885
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:16,340
uh,
um,

1886
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:20,600
a divorced mother or a
struggling family in the Midwest.

1887
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:24,950
Uh, the mother works at a plant and the
father does this and they have three

1888
01:56:24,951 --> 01:56:28,640
children, and then they would be like,
yeah, that's, yeah, that's a real show.

1889
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:33,170
But then we could come up with these
ridiculous descriptions of shows.

1890
01:56:33,171 --> 01:56:36,980
So it would be like, um, uh, a man, uh,

1891
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:40,100
lost his legs in a war,
but through the,

1892
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:45,200
through prayer he became a champion boxer
and they're like, that's a real show.

1893
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:48,190
But just try to miss like,

1894
01:56:48,191 --> 01:56:53,060
I miss guided with these
absurd descriptions and
they would get most of them

1895
01:56:53,061 --> 01:56:56,390
wrong. Like even ones that
were blatantly clearly made up.

1896
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:59,960
Oh Dude. Do you remember when the guy
was on his first date with this chick?

1897
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:03,680
And we're like, have you ever performed
oral sex on an animal? And he goes, uh,

1898
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:07,650
chipmunks once, and we're like, excuse
me? He goes, hold on, let me explain.

1899
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:11,660
I was like, ah. You're definitely
explained. He was, it fell out of a tree.

1900
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:20,450
Resuscitation did, who's the funniest
fucking show? But they canceled it.

1901
01:57:20,510 --> 01:57:24,260
They canceled it immediately and then
they're like, it has alcohol. We're like,

1902
01:57:24,330 --> 01:57:26,840
you paid for this show. It
was called buzzed. Yeah,

1903
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:30,950
they did a shot at comedy central
to celebrate it. They lay on their,

1904
01:57:30,951 --> 01:57:34,490
all the pilots. They did a shock. They
loved it. Turned the lights on there.

1905
01:57:34,491 --> 01:57:37,580
Like how many episodes did we picking up?
Guy raised his hands from ad sales.

1906
01:57:37,581 --> 01:57:39,980
He said zero. He goes,
I can't sell that show.

1907
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:44,210
It's really cool that before they ordered
the pilot. Well you would think so.

1908
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:45,103
You'd think so.

1909
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:49,450
Yeah. You got something there Jane?
No. Oh, you doodling. All right.

1910
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:54,670
Um, the body shots world
tour is a, is everywhere.

1911
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:59,890
Um, he's going to look, seems like there's
some tickets left in Australia. Maybe

1912
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:02,790
Australia has got some tickets left.
It's a little ways away.

1913
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:05,780
I think Europe's entirely sold out.
Um,

1914
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:11,730
I will be in DC, New Jersey, Philly,

1915
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:13,050
uh,

1916
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:18,050
wise guys who sold out paramount and
Denver on the 23rd and then ending it in

1917
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:24,480
Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Minnesota
at the end of March. Awesome.

1918
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:29,820
It's been the greatest. I'm, I'll be dead
honest with you, man. I, I've for those,

1919
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,290
those who the dewar don't know.

1920
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:35,100
Tommy and I are really good friends and
so we've talked a lot and to watch your

1921
01:58:35,101 --> 01:58:38,370
tours and to see you do all these
tours and to to look at him and go,

1922
01:58:38,371 --> 01:58:40,050
I wonder what that's like.
I wonder if it's overwhelming.

1923
01:58:40,051 --> 01:58:43,570
I wonder like just have all those thoughts
in your head and then to do it for

1924
01:58:43,571 --> 01:58:45,550
the first time. Dude, it's the favorite.

1925
01:58:45,610 --> 01:58:47,530
It's the favorite thing I've
ever done in this business ever.

1926
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,900
This tour is the greatest
thing I've ever done.

1927
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:53,800
I've never had more fun ever my
entire life and I fucking, I just,

1928
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:57,180
I honestly only wish that we
were doing it together. Now look,

1929
01:58:57,190 --> 01:59:01,090
it would be fun to be
on a tour bus together,

1930
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,350
have to tour and going into cities. It
would be so much fucking fun. I look at,

1931
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:10,390
I look at pass Torian going mid. Joe
would have loved this. Yeah. Joey,

1932
01:59:10,391 --> 01:59:14,890
Ari and red band back in the day. He
would have loved, it would have been,

1933
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:18,640
it would change his life. It would
have been. It's a game changer.

1934
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:23,530
That's my next goal is to get like do
a big tour with all of us and just tore

1935
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:27,280
Bust Caravan. Like fucking a band.
Yeah, just pulling into venues.

1936
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:32,780
Oh, there you could wrap all the
buses and each individual guys face.

1937
01:59:33,570 --> 01:59:35,040
Yeah.
This is Ari's buzz.

1938
01:59:35,041 --> 01:59:38,250
This one's toms by us and then we get
let the other people picked the wrappings

1939
01:59:38,251 --> 01:59:39,084
for the buses.

1940
01:59:40,190 --> 01:59:44,700
Oh Man. We got to do that for Ari. Oh,
you'd love this hall with your butthole.

1941
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:48,630
And then we put like what I wanted to do
during the sober October thing was get

1942
01:59:48,631 --> 01:59:52,340

like honk if you think I'm funny.

1943
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:56,960
Kind of quotes on there and just put
like, Hahaha. All around the bus.

1944
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:00,960
Do you like jokes? Knock on my
window. Yeah, let me know. Yeah.

02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:12,160
