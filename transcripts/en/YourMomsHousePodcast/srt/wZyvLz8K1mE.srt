56
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,300
You got the,
uh,

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,530
the cat lady here because
Joey is a cat man.

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,660
You know that he loves cats. I do know
that. How many do you have? Seven.

59
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,800
Seven. He's like, he's a cat whisperer.
Like he really connects with cats. Yeah.

60
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:05,070
I love my babies. Yeah. And this
lady right here loves cats too.

61
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:09,540
She's mad at this neighbor because she's
saying that the neighbor is not taking

62
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,550
care of the cat, you know? Yeah.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,580
I'm sorry.
The middle with you.

64
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,760
You're on my property bitching over
things that are not of your concern.

65
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,800
I get a fin because when
she comes by your house,

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,590
she obviously comes by your
house and pisses you off.

67
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,860
And I asked if that was the issue and it
is he issue because you say that to me.

68
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,800
Your goddamn kid.
It's you.

69
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,250
You're the one that said
people should be responsible

70
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,643
for your dog.

71
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,970
She's really upset. Yeah. She's saying
that he's not taking care of this cat.

72
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,780
This is how my mother used to yell at
people like over really mundane shit.

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,670
She be like, you'll fuck mother fuck
ass. You fucking bitch the fucking,

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,290
she hated cats. She would just come.
I'm other people like that all the time.

75
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,980
And she hated cats. There was one cat,
uh, we live in an apartment complex.

76
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,020
It used to piss on our,
our doormat.

77
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,260
And she waited for the cat
to come and she kicked it.

78
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,380
She would fucking open our door and she
kicked it down the stairs. Jesus. No,

79
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:10,010
it never came back, I guess. But then
she'd find the owner and be like, Yo,

80
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,640
mother Fucker, you're fucking cat
pcs or low one of my fucking door.

81
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,460
You fucking Cock sucker Gaga.
Gaga.

82
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,820
Oh my God. No plane. No gain.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,850
No plane.
No gain.

84
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,890
Yeah. Yeah. Well, what'd you
do, Joey? Does your cat wander
and other people's yards?

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,690
No, they'll let them out of the
house. Oh, they're strictly house.

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,940
I can't sleep at night knowing
my little Fox or outside. Yeah.

87
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,320
Getting attacked by a rack
cooling or something like that.

88
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,040
Was it a,

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,040
was it a like a thing for
your wife to get used to like,

90
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,630
or was she already in the cats too?

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,850
In other words, now we want to were
together. She had a kitten. That was it.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
That was when I first started
dating and she had a kid.

93
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,510
And did you have a cat already?
Thick. Oh, okay. Like cats.
I don't even know. Really?

94
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeah. I didn't know have any idea. And
then when, where we lived Hollywood,

95
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,240
there was a lot of cats and
they would die in the backyard.

96
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,470
So I would wake up in the morning,
it'd be three dead kittens.

97
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,540
So we started saving them and call them
different organizations and they'd pick

98
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,810
them up and feed them. Oh, I didn't
know how you got into it. Yeah,

99
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,850
the one by one I started bringing
them upstairs and they became middle.

100
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,300
Somebody would go, I'm moving in a
month I want, because it was Siamese.

101
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,020
There was gorgeous,
and they go on removing save me one.

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,280
Then they call me back and go, well,
my roommate has an elephant, so no,

103
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:32,740
I can't have a cat. So I get stuck
at the fucking cat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,240
So I let stuck with
[inaudible] loving them.

105
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:40,220
At one time I found homes for
four of them, five of them.

106
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,780
How would you find homes?
Different people, different
girls, guys, acting classes,

107
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,614
whatever.

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,870
And then I moved to the valley with six
and I moved to the valley and there was

109
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:55,820
one that started hanging around the
house just hanging out with me at night.

110
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,530
I would get home from the store and
whistle and it would fucking come to me.

111
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,890
If I would walk down the corner,
it would follow me. Yeah,

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,090
and the owner came through when,
then she goes, I can't control her,

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,690
but obviously you can.

114
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,700
She pays attention to you and she got
attacked by a possum and she couldn't

115
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,810
staff side no more. So just
said, just take her. Wow.

116
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
She's one of my best cat.

117
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,360
It's so funny to me like,
and I don't know why it's like this.

118
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,540
Maybe it's like this to other people.
Cats to me or just,

119
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,990
it's not that I have any issue with them.
They're like a foreign language to me.

120
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,740
You know what I mean? Like I,
I don't know how to gauge cats.

121
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,170
I don't know what to expect from
because I never grew up with them.

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,430
I've never spent time with cats, so like
to me like a dog feels familiar. Yeah.

123
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,280
I kind of, I kind of know what to expect
from a dog. I know how to approach a dog.

124
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,330
I know,
you know,

125
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,860
I know dog behavior pretty much like
having grown up with dogs with cats,

126
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:50,610
I'm always like,

127
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,820
I don't know what what I was supposed
to do because it's all their rules.

128
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,550
I feel like. Yeah, they got to tell you
it's that they tell you what's up, right.

129
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,610
You tell a dog what's up and cat world,
they have to choose you.

130
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:02,850
Like what joy was saying like
that cat shows Joey. Yeah.

131
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:05,220
And respect him and then they do,
they pick a person.

132
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,830
What's interesting is that
it came to him later in life.

133
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:10,920
Like I would have thought that he
was like growing up with cats. No,

134
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,600
but you just figured cats out
like way later a friend. Yeah.

135
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,770
Growing up had a cat. Yeah. That
was a fucking guy. He was a warrior.

136
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,460
He was missing and here he
was missing half his foot.

137
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,620
His name was frisky. And I still remember
one particular morning when, you know,

138
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,980
when you get fucked up at your friend's
house and you wake up the next day and

139
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,060
you were on the floor.
Yeah.

140
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,210
Like I woke up and the window was open
and we were freezing and he was in the

141
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:40,870
window watching a bird in the tree.
Like making that fucking noise. Yeah.

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,430
I never heard that noise.

143
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,930
I hadn't ever seen it where
the cat sees an animal vets,

144
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,900
he's about to attack.
He'll make weird,

145
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,980
hey, hell yeah. Don't

146
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,470
make little weird noises.
Yeah.

147
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
And an hour later we got the mother made
us all breakfast and gave us a lecture

148
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,110
on why not to drink and you know,
look what the would look,

149
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:11,280
what's going to happen with you guys and
if forget Christina opening the door.

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,010
That bird was in shambles.

151
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,050
Like he brought it to us as a gift.
Then the mother explained, she's like,

152
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:23,100
I don't know what he's going to bring.
He shows up with fucking dead cats,

153
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,740
birds, squirrels. Killer man. I liked him.

154
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,810
Yeah,
he wasn't mine.

155
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:34,010
But I liked him and that was
my only experience with cats.

156
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:36,930
And then 30 years later you go
to people's homes to have a cat.

157
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,980
The cat jumps on you, they show
you affection, so they call you,

158
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,060
you get scared and you push
them off. Yeah, that's,

159
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,760
that's part of the fear
that I had. Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,090
Then it's weird once you save the cat,

161
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,810
they remember that they, they,
they, they remember everything.

162
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,550
I used to have a friend that goes,

163
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:00,090
I'll fuck with cats because they're
going to go to bed and they write it down

164
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:04,670
and they get you later. They
write it down. It's really weird.

165
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,250
I was going through a weird time in my
life and these cats would come into the

166
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:13,210
house at the time. We both
needed each other like it
was the weirdest thing. Yeah.

167
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,430
And when I come home at night and
doing comedy, they're scattered.

168
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,660
But once I go to the office and I make
my notes about my sat and what I got to

169
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:25,080
do the next day,
once I go into the living room and unwind,

170
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
they come out one by one and I got to
give them all attention and talk to them

171
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,140
and ask them what's going
on with Dan World and seven,

172
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,590
some of them don't come out. Two of them.
You, you'll never see the two girls. Yeah.

173
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,200
Lou Levy.
Evie lives by the door.

174
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,060
So I touched her and touch her in the way
in and out. That's my good luck charm.

175
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,690
She lives by the door.
She watches that fucking door.

176
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,870
I wonder if I would just go
into fits of sneezing and like,

177
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,980
and weeping if I walked into your place
because I have like, no, I brushed him.

178
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,840
I really keep the gander, the
dander down. Yeah. You know,

179
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,250
I've been around cats where, um, I slept
at a place, uh, in a friend's place.

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,480
I crashed with her for like six weeks,
uh,

181
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,200
just out of college and he had two little
cats and like my eyes would just start

182
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:17,540
to, you know, water and
I would just, I dunno,

183
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,750
I mean I never,
like I said,

184
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,290
that was my first exposure and then they
would chase each other in the morning

185
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,100
and they would like run over
my face as they're chasing.

186
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,230
So I'd have like cat
scratches on my forehead.

187
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,490
Like right now you guys
have dogs and a child,

188
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,410
you have to have the things that
bring you the most love. You know,

189
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,540
you just went to Toledo,
Ohio,

190
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,280
it fucking snowed Saturday,
you were expected to sell out,

191
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,550
but then you get to the airport and the
flight was delayed and then Thompson

192
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,210
grow. His flight is delayed and he
was supposed to go to Burke crisis.

193
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,330
Birthday party. Yeah. You get home
and your, and your luggage is lost.

194
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,740
And now the Uber drive race showing
up and you walk in your door and,

195
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,410
and you gotta take a shit and
you have do all these things.

196
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,720
But that dog comes up to you that first
you really want to kick that dog. Yeah.

197
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,260
At first you want to go, you know what?
Do me a favor, get the fuck away from me.

198
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,150
What? He does not understand. No, he just
wants to give you this election. Yeah.

199
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,690
I tell you something when you
bend over and just pat them. Yeah.

200
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,470
All of those problems you had that
morning and you're a human being. Yeah.

201
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,400
They just disappear. That's
true. That's absolutely true.

202
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,120
Just go away for five minutes and you
pick them up and you pat them and they

203
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:35,460
look at you and the five minutes.
Yeah, Tom's delayed. Right.

204
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,410
We're not going to make birthday party,
but it all seems a lot better.

205
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,400
It's 100% true. It really even when
your child, sometimes you come home,

206
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,380
you didn't get the audition,

207
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,130
they gave it to somebody else and
you pick up your kid and you go,

208
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,210
who gives a fuck?

209
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,010
Of course I don't give a fuck of
Ralph's blows up right now. Yeah.

210
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,510
I don't give a fuck. I got my kid.
Yeah. It's 60 minutes is on. I know.

211
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,700
Yeah.

212
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,450
As well. We're both, we're both, uh,
three of us are all prefer to be home.

213
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,620
I think the three of us are like just get,

214
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,940
get home yet our animals and
play with our kids and watch TV.

215
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,070
My happiest time in life,

216
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,660
my happiest moment of the day is when we
put the baby down. He's had a great day.

217
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,520
He's in his crib.
He just fell asleep.

218
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:24,750
Tom and I are laying in bed with the
two dogs and we're watching some stupid

219
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:29,270
show. Yeah. That's my, that's
why I live. Yeah. Everything
else is like, man, I know.

220
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,550
It's almost like you live the
day to get to that model. No,

221
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,890
it's really like you can,
I feel like the,

222
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:39,891
I can feel that clock counting down to
that moment later in the day when it's 30

223
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:41,790
minutes away. I'm like, oh,

224
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:46,580
we're going to be in bed doing our
thing with dogs watching TV pretty soon.

225
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,050
Pretty excited. We have
three. We have to it too.

226
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,040
Yeah. It's funny how, uh, you know,

227
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,730
we all became as comics and when
you become a comic, you know,

228
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:59,060
like right now me and Tom lost a lot
of weight because when you become a

229
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:02,990
comedian you put all your focus
into becoming a comedian. Yeah.

230
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,250
I'll figure it onion rings at the bar
and you'll eat. Yeah. On your rings,

231
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:09,200
you go back to the hotel
room. Doritos. Yeah.

232
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,190
It's so weird how we've
evolved as Comedians,

233
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,330
but at the same time now you're like
family, like led Zeppelin was great,

234
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,320
awesome legs up with the fifth Albert,
he started spitting out kids. Yeah,

235
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,540
the toys got delayed. Yeah. And you know,
cause you said going, wait a second,

236
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,040
I got to go on the road and do what?

237
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,720
I'd much rather just play on the fucking
floor with this child. Of course.

238
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,060
Whatever the fuck it is.
It's a,

239
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,560
yeah, no man, I know it's a being home is,

240
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,300
it's like it's the goal now.

241
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,070
Like you just try to design your life
to be at home as much as you can because

242
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:52,190
the first fucking 10 years
you live on the road.

243
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,540
Yeah. It's horrible. I mean,
my goal is to just not,

244
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,530
first of all, to not wear decent pants.
Like I always want to be in sweatpants,

245
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,570
number one.
Like that's the whole dream.

246
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,540
And then to be home I like
to do as little as possible.

247
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,370
That's the whole goal for me. Like I want
to retire at 50 have a fucking dog. Oh,

248
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,250
he's had a really big respect
for you as a woman. Comics.

249
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,440
I didn't want to say woman comic is a
comic because when you were around me,

250
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,250
I didn't feel like I had to act
really differently, you know? Yeah.

251
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,400
So I was very concerned about you
when you had your child, you know,

252
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,130
I'm so glad you're bringing this up.

253
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,650
I was very concerned about
you and your career affect.

254
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,610
Tom And I had a conversation
on a plane that I said to him,

255
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:35,870
how's Christine handling this?

256
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,040
Because I have friends like Joe Rogan
that they'd give a fuck about the Mars and

257
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,090
if the world is flat and look at this
animal and I could give a fuck about that.

258
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,133
I love,

259
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,730
I love the mind and love psychology
and I love to see the change of people.

260
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,920
Nobody,
nobody,

261
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,840
nobody changed more than my redneck.
You know,

262
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:04,730
my wife present work. My wife was one of
those people. That job was eight to five.

263
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:09,110
That's on paper and her world,
it's seven to when the job gets done.

264
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,800
You know, my wife is one of those people
that, you know, you took a job. Yeah,

265
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,010
you took it for $10 an hour. You got to do
the work. Yeah, you don't like it. Quit.

266
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,810
But why are you making a commitment?

267
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:25,760
There are Americans that people that my
wife had no days off and 10 years as an

268
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:29,930
accountant, she never took a sick
day. Never took a personal day.

269
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,130
She took three hours one time when I
was doing coke because I got like an 18

270
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:38,240
grand trek and she wanted to make sure
the check made it to the bank and not

271
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,230
like coke dealers house.

272
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,490
It was one of the biggest checks I've
ever got ever for residual. She left.

273
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:44,330
You took a train,

274
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,700
you know when my wife had
the baby and my wife said,

275
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,510
I'll be there in five minutes to help
you cash that check and they'll put it in

276
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,260
the proper. That was the only
time in 10 years at the op,

277
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,920
at the Walt, the center,
she had the child,

278
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,230
she had all this sick time.
She had all this paternity time.

279
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,120
It was like five months and I could see
her going through paperwork at night,

280
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,860
Gung Ho about it,

281
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,480
and then she got to go back to
work and I tried to help her.

282
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,240
I tried to, you know, what do
I cook? Hamburger help. Yeah,

283
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,410
I know how to make hamburger helper,
but Joe, y'all are cocoa chicken.

284
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:29,411
All the cocoa chicken cutlets with lemon
and pepper and the jelly specialties.

285
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,920
I know three recipes.
I think everybody only knows three.

286
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,800
When I saw my wife go
from 40 hours a week,

287
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:41,720
this gun loving toadying American
who believes in a dollar a day,

288
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,840
you know a day's work for a day's pay.

289
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,650
I saw cut her hours to 30 then 20

290
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,710
then 20 and then she came home one day.
She goes,

291
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm just going to become a
consultant. And I go, no, you're not.

292
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,400
You're just not gonna work your 45 this
is never ever going to happen again

293
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,540
unless some miracle,

294
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,920
God gives me another squirt
of good nut juice you are in.

295
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,360
We were lucky we got this little squeezing
that juice out with all the marijuana.

296
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,400
I smoked and I saw her transformation.

297
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,910
So I was always real interested
in Christine's transformation.

298
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,280
I was very interested in
what she got pregnant and how
she was gonna react to it.

299
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:26,810
And you know,
do you have the child and I,

300
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,230
so now she doesn't work right wife.

301
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,910
I tell him what's to use. Yeah, what it,

302
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,911
she came home two weeks ago with some
story about a I AFI and a firewall for the

303
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:42,930
six figures and she'll put mercy
at the Catholic school over there.

304
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,890
And as we were driving one day
go take a look at the one on one.

305
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah.
Is that what you want at your app?

306
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,310
Is that what you wanted your
rights wrapped up at five
you got to pick up mercy

307
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,540
and then drive her home and then,
oh, guess who's cooking at six?

308
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,850
Chef Diaz,
chef boy dick.

309
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,200
Cause I know how to make steak comes
and or Ida French fries with American

310
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:08,480
cheese on white bread to stake comes shit.
Yeah,

311
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,020
we all did white trash.

312
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,000
Your transformation was,
and it's so weird how he's so funny.

313
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,660
I love women that are Gung Ho and
one day the uterus costs. Yeah,

314
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,860
once you lose, because that's it. That's
the biggest call a woman could get.

315
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,830
Everything goes out the window,
everything.

316
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,930
It's interesting because I thought about
that the last time I sat down with him

317
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:37,530
and I was pregnant with Ellis. I think
you said to me, don't ever become a woman,

318
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,160
Christine. Don't ever become
a woman. And I was like, wait,

319
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,500
what did you mean by that?

320
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,740
Because I've literally been thinking
about it for like two years.

321
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,370
When you're a comic, you're a
savage. Yeah. You're not a woman.

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,190
If you're on the road with me,
I'm not going to try to hit on you.

323
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:53,881
But the one in the room,

324
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm going to Fart and you're going to
inhale it and I'm going to take my shoes

325
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:01,230
off and you're going to slow my feet
and it just becomes a part of your life.

326
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,120
Until one day you become a woman and go,

327
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,020
why am I sitting next to this fat fuck?

328
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,480
Talking about eating pussy and giggling
at his dumb jokes and smelled his feet

329
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:16,230
and his breath because you
were a comic tolerated it.

330
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,650
But one day the uterus
takes over and you're like,

331
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,310
why am I sitting next to this criminal?
Well, why? Why? What? What is what?

332
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,370
What is my PR? It was a good
point. Now I'm thinking, no,

333
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,360
you're a woman now who's
a mom and a comedian.

334
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,590
Now you got three ads and now you
have to balance that. That's right.

335
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,250
Because if you do get a VAD ain't go on
the road 40 weeks a year to pursue your

336
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:43,350
thing.
You've got to pay for this in 10 years.

337
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,710
Pens or commercial member panels or you
could me now you can pay me later. Yeah,

338
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,440
so now you were in a tough bind.

339
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,590
Now he has to know mommy does comedy and
it all works out and if you squeeze out

340
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,640
10 weeks,
which you'll be,

341
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,990
you're going to walk to the
airport those 10 weeks like,

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,630
do you know what I'm saying?
You know how now like all right honey,

343
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,660
I guess I'll see you on Sunday.
Those weeks when you're leaving.

344
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Once he turns four it's like,
Tom, fuck you. Where's your ou?

345
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,920
But I'm running to the fucking airport.

346
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,570
Sunday.
I'm taking the late flight back.

347
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,800
You and Joe Diaz with that
6:00 AM flight. Yeah. Fuck you.

348
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm taking the four o'clock flight.
Well sleeping late. We talked to

349
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,510
about this the other yesterday that the
thing that's great about the road now

350
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,680
when you, when you're a parent, the
really the, the the moment of it,

351
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:41,970
like the thing you savor is that you have
no responsibility while you're there.

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm not on duty for eight hours.
You really feel like, yeah.

353
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,260
And what we're talking about is that the
best part is enjoying the hotel room.

354
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,080
It's like it's watching movies,
ordering room service, no row and like,

355
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,700
and like you know you,

356
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,260
you have all the freedom
to just do nothing.

357
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,220
Yeah. And Friday night cause
my favorite night on the road,

358
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,220
Thursday we've got to get up a radio.
Yeah.

359
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,320
Friday you're not
responsible for anything.

360
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,940
That's when I go back and I
cut my phone guy toenail. Yeah.

361
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,210
And I sniffed from my thrown behind the
beds and you rubbed by your feet with

362
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:20,800
the thing and you scratch deep.
He getting that sack. Yeah.

363
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,470
You try to figure out why you
have a lump next to eat balls.

364
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,970
That's the time I got a theory on that.

365
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,650
You go on like the Hotel Mirror.

366
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,340
Yeah as a spreadsheet and that sack
and you know that's Friday night.

367
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,920
I love that. I love it. I don't
have to get up Friday morning,

368
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:40,180
I get up Saturday morning, I get
the Hindu eggs, I get white bread,

369
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,260
I gets a quote. You know, cause there's
always said Indian people at the hotels.

370
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,440
So the Hindu eggs,
you wake up,

371
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,190
you go back upstairs and you sleep till
like one. That's great. You got up,

372
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:56,020
you go the Jeremy, a little lunch, little
college football you call Tom. How's,

373
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,190
how's the baby? Yeah. Great. Oh, you have
to see he walked through. That's great.

374
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,760
Great, good. Yeah, we'll
see you Sunday. I see.

375
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,860
Yeah. I mean, look, I have modified my
life so that I'm not out nearly as much.

376
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,020
It's like I'm out 48 hours and
then I'm fucking home dude. So,

377
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,420
you know what I mean?
Like I just don't do as much bullshit.

378
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,920
And you find that you don't need to do,

379
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,560
I don't fucking need to do
Wednesday through Sunday, Bro.

380
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,100
Like it's not even going
down. I don't even fucking do
Sundays. Uh, because of you

381
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,940
actually more than days.
That's what I'm saying.

382
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,950
I'm home bro. Like I'm fucking here
with my kid. All my husband, my dogs.

383
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,530
I think you inspired at all a whole

384
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,710
generation of people.
They should call it like the DA.

385
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,870
A lot of divorces. Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,980
I saw people disenfranchised
and really think about what,

387
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,130
get on a Sunday. I want you to really
think what you got on a Sunday.

388
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,950
What kind of piece of shit?
20 years ago.

389
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,040
We got people that have
the room on Sundays because
nobody would come to see us

390
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,870
on a Sunday.
We were opening for Joe.

391
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,190
Joe would leave on Saturday and that
would be the answer that stayed Sunday and

392
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:07,490
try to sell tickets by myself. And
then I asked myself why I was doing it,

393
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,180
even though I was single.
When I got off the coke,

394
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:15,320
I realized something that no matter, even
though it was a comic, I'm still a man.

395
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,300
And even though I was single and I had
a girlfriend and I had no responsibility

396
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:24,080
to it, there's nothing replaces
something they'd done it. I agree.

397
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,810
Replaces Sunday dinner. Nothing replaces
Christine pass the potatoes. Tom,

398
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,020
what's going on? Nothing.
Nothing. Your kid,

399
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,940
I don't give a fuck what
you do Sunday night.

400
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,650
I don't give a fuck of Sunday night.

401
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:39,860
You go to a strip club and stuck your
tongue up a strip his ass. All right.

402
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,780
But there's nothing like Sunday
dinner with your family. It's true.

403
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,110
Whether it's a girl that you date and
that's it. Cause it's not worth the paper.

404
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,420
That extra little paper
you're going to get,

405
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:54,680
you're going to lose that girl and 10
years from now, what are you going to do?

406
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,360
Sundays are so depressing
the spend on the road. It is.

407
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,380
It's absolutely as a feature act that
used to kill me to wait all day seven

408
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:10,310
o'clock show. Then you miss that red
eye. Yeah. You can't get 20 minutes.

409
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,680
You always met.
Like if you do Vegas,

410
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,990
Vegas and the show starts at nine
and you're like, I'm going at all.

411
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,970
There's no flights after eight 35 got
to leave Lake Phoenix, same thing.

412
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,270
You got like an early show in Phoenix.
Tried to leave early on a Sunday night.

413
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,440
You missed the flight by 20
fucking minutes as the worst.

414
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,200
Every fucking airline misses it
by 20 minutes. So you know what,

415
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:37,610
let's just stay home on Sunday. I love
getting home early Sunday, taking a nap.

416
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,070
By the time I wake up at two they are
alive and kicking. I got her all day.

417
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:46,070
You know,
we play no Sunday's the best

418
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,500
feeling,
especially coming off of work,

419
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,100
like coming off of shows to come
home Sunday, have a Sundae at home,

420
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,940
make Sunday dinner the
best we do Sunday trading.

421
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,080
Don't fuck up like agent. He's always
like, you know, like going on the road.

422
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:03,410
Do you hate it? I'm like, of course I
fucking hate it. I did it for a decade.

423
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:08,120
I've been done the road bro. Now he knows
like, but now my deals are better. Right?

424
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,490
Because I'm like, I'm fucking
doing it dude, until my deals are,

425
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:12,380
and that's also a lesson.

426
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,510
Before you were even moving tickets.
I remember like we were all,

427
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,350
you know,
like lucky to get work basically right?

428
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:24,470
Or your workforce and this is like six,
seven years ago and no,

429
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,100
none of us are moving tickets.
And then I'm talking to Dan,
I'm like, yeah, he goes,

430
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,220
are you doing Sunday shows? And I
was like, of course. He's like, yeah,

431
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:33,650
I don't do them. And I go
like, how do you not do them?

432
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,970
Because you just tell him no.
And I was operating from a place of fear.

433
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,830
Like how, what have you tell them
I won't do it. He's like, what are,

434
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,980
they'll give you the work.
It's like that you don't

435
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,160
do it. That's fine. But then he said it
no so much that. Then they'd be like,

436
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,180
all right, here's your Thursday
through Saturday. And I was like, yeah,

437
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,000
how can you get it?

438
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,490
That's all you have to do or
I'll do it the old fashioned way.

439
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,260
You want to fuck with me.

440
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,210
I'll books the sun that threatened
me with a Sunday and I'll take it.

441
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,890
But I guarantee I got do their
own movie that Monday. Oh right.

442
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,280
I have to leave on Sunday and
when then you fucked. Yeah.

443
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,940
Cause I'm not going to drop it on you
until Friday. Rob Schimmell style. Yeah.

444
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,000
You know, years ago,
nobody remembers this.

445
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,040
Rob Schimmell had Thursday through Sunday
at the Improv for like six months from

446
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,150
Rob Schimmell was hot 98 yeah.

447
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,550
But they created the show called like
how to marry a millionaire or something

448
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,050
and one guy was a comedian and he was
a comedian from the early nineties who

449
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:35,070
used to lie this pants on fire.
That was his opener opener.

450
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,030
Where do you go after that? And he would
go, is it hot in here? Is it me? Ain't no,

451
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:42,420
he was a funny comic and stuff,
but it revitalize his career.

452
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,940
So what at the Improv's
do they give loans?

453
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,800
They took everybody's Thursday away and
they gave it to him. So who would go,

454
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,640
okay. You know what time
Shim would cancel on Friday?

455
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,320
Like 6:00 PM two in the afternoon.
Oh,

456
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,910
you want to fuck up my Thursday?
Yeah, I'll fuck with you Friday.

457
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,000
So who canceled on him?
He did it three weeks in a row.

458
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:10,680
They never fucked with him again. He was
a bad motherfucker, man. He didn't know.

459
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:14,400
He was like that dog.
He canceled overnight with a fax.

460
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,720
Didn't wake up on eight o'clock. They
get the cotton for the Improv on Friday.

461
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:20,970
Soul dot.
Shimmel just canceled.

462
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,970
It looks like you're line lining
Joey. Oh yeah. That's the way it is.

463
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,360
And I've bumped into him at
an airport once and he goes,

464
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:33,920
sometimes you got to teach them a lesson
and who know who know who the fuck that

465
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,330
dealing with.
They want to sell you out for money.

466
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:41,250
They'll never saw y'all for money
again. He was a smart, savvy kind,

467
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:45,830
funny guy. Robert Schimmel and Hungarian.
And I'm Gary. Yeah. You know, we,

468
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,920
we live in the, uh, we've been, we
were robbed for 15 years. Right.

469
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,900
You ever go to check now
and you look at it, you go,

470
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,890
remember when we used to ask them for
$200 more and they told us they didn't

471
00:28:55,891 --> 00:29:00,570
have it and now they're giving
us this check, you know,
whatever we got Rod. Yeah.

472
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,040
So now you know, they, they
really would do that. Oh yeah,
they did. Yeah, they did.

473
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:09,370
They wouldn't do a towel rooms. So yeah,

474
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,860
he did a lot of Kinky shit.

475
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:15,861
So now even an old dog gets a warm spot
on the sidewalk at one time or another.

476
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,680
Yeah. So now you got to
fucking pay the freight bitch.

477
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,170
Pay The freight.

478
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,780
That's true. And they all complain. The
club owners are like, well, I mean, how,

479
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,690
how come they, these big acts, they turn
into Dick's. It's like, what happened?

480
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:35,140
And I go, well, what happened is you guys
treat us like dog shit on the way up.

481
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,470
Yeah.

482
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,040
Now there's no fucking love left bitch
because you've been kicking us for 10

483
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:39,820
years.
Yeah.

484
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,900
So when you're at the top of the chain
is time for you to get yours because you

485
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:46,540
treat us like shit for so many.
Learn how to be assholes

486
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,110
from you. From you buy a car. Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:53,580
When you go buy a car now they give
you two options. They give you what?

488
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:57,660
I sold you a car. Whenever I sold you
a car, I just didn't sell your car.

489
00:29:57,661 --> 00:30:01,510
I brought you back a purchase number
and I brought you back a lease number so

490
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:05,000
you could seat both options. Yeah.
We have the same option that yeah,

491
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,980
you can either take care of us at the
club will go to the theater across the

492
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:11,040
street. I won't make as much
money as that with Athena,

493
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,810
but I'll teach you a fucking lesson.
Yeah. Yeah. So you better keep you,

494
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:18,410
you saw a lot of cheeseburgers and
Joey's onstage Herbie's smoked reefer.

495
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,040
The Joey D's show. Yeah. So don't come to
me with this. No. Gee, this left, this d,

496
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:27,870
this lap. Yeah. And I want
it. Yeah. And if I don't get
it, I will sit at home. Yeah.

497
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,990
Then then, then, then that's it.
And that's just the way it is.

498
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,080
No, I know they, they
really do. Fuck you so hard.

499
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,530
And I don't want people at home to think
all these guys are whining. No, no.

500
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,030
I want you to think, listen, it
works also, when you're a mason,

501
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,440
if I could become a mason tomorrow
and I come to Christina, go,

502
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,270
cause she didn't want you to
teach me how to be a mason.

503
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,020
She's gonna teach me for 10 bucks an hour,
how to be a hod carrier.

504
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,480
Hod carrier is stocking the masons,

505
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,930
knowing how to put 16 bags of sand and
making cement and making sure they all

506
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:05,620
have some meth. They'll give
me a raise every six months to,

507
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:07,630
I love the $2 or whatever the fuck it is.

508
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,460
But then they're going to come a time when
they're going to go, I'm sick, jump in.

509
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,720
And now I'm laying brick
and I'm doing everything.

510
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,640
But they're still paying me the short
10 yeah, and they're charging 22 for me.

511
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,810
You're right. Do you follow me?
Yeah. Try and 22 on the bid.

512
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,650
So this happens in every occupation.
That's right. You know, not just comedy.

513
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't want it.

514
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,790
This happens in plumbing where for two
years you're getting fucked in the ass.

515
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,890
Yeah. They go on, Christine,
how are you doing?

516
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,660
A will leaving you here today and
you're like, yeah, wait. Yeah.

517
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,950
You were in charge of Tom and Joey today.

518
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Make sure the pipes are up
while the wiring is bold
and so for two years you get

519
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:52,780
fucked doing that too because he's out
golfing and you'll get, he's getting the,

520
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,141
that's true.

521
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:57,980
It's like any apprenticeship
mean apprentice even to
become like a doctor. Right.

522
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,340
You're broke for the first what
decade. Yeah. You're a student,

523
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:04,700
you're doing your rounds and then you
graduate and now you're a practicing

524
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:08,660
physician. I think in our
occupation, the graduation moment,

525
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,770
it's not as clear.

526
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:12,770
There's like a gray area where all of
a sudden you're moving tickets and now

527
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,920
it's like, and you have to fight
for your graduation is what it is.

528
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,920
You have to assert yourself. I
mean, what's that great story?

529
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,580
Who's the guy on the Sitcom? He's super
famous now. Gardendale Billy guard down.

530
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:26,630
I really got l. Yeah, he uh, he was
talking to somebody and this is like,

531
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:31,100
right when he became really successful.
He goes, yeah man, those $1,800 a weeks,

532
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:34,140
am I right? Like he was still
doing them right. Even as the,

533
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:35,480
he was doing television.
That's right.

534
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,130
So he didn't assert himself for the
raises and for the graduation, you know,

535
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,870
so, so, so crazy. 1800 and he's like a
big star. Yeah. But I mean, now he's,

536
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,470
he's making a way more of course.
Yeah. But I'm good for him.

537
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:51,710
He busted his ass for a while. Oh
yeah, absolutely. He's a funny guy.

538
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:56,390
He was always on like the side and he
was always put on a good show with his

539
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,180
shitty sidekick. Yeah. Who
would take down the show?

540
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:02,630
He had 20 chances he was unlucky.
Yeah. Guys don't remember.

541
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:06,880
He had the NBC show with a black kid that
was not funny. 20 million black people,

542
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,971
but a funny,

543
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:12,950
they gave him the other funny is black
guys a World War II is black guy.

544
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,570
Everybody,
everybody's funny is black.

545
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,890
I gave him the guy that couldn't be
funny if his life depended on it.

546
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,740
So true. There are so many funny
black people, Joey. That's very true.

547
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,300
Uh, so I'm fine. I'm fine.
I got my bed. Hmm. So, uh,

548
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,040
thanksgiving was, um, was a blast. We had,

549
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,890
we hosted at our house.
We had people over. Um,

550
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,300
we basically didn't do any work, but
it was totally worth it. It's great.

551
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,490
The outsourced all though to the
Hindus have them cook for us. And then,

552
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,530
um, I did the Wilbert or the Wilbur, the
Wiltern turn on, uh, on Saturday. Yeah,

553
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,840
it was amazing. Amazing. So Super Fun.

554
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:57,980
Thanks everybody here in La that
came out to the show. I'm also,

555
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,890
this is one thing that came in
a lot over the weekend was um,

556
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,920
are you going to 69 at 69 till we
get this thing up? My Dad turned 70,

557
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,900
uh,
earlier this year.

558
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,020
My favorite thing that we had a
big family reunion and my mom,

559
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,220
you know with Florida? Yeah.
That's when you went to Florida.

560
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,010
My mom is Peruvian and she doesn't, she's
not up on any of the lingo or anything.

561
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,720
So at this big dinner, I asked
my mom, I said, you know,
dad is turning 70 tomorrow.

562
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,470
Are you going to 69 him tonight? And she
was like, what? She didn't understand it.

563
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,260
So we would all laugh and make
and just joke about how, you know,

564
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,020
just just make fun of her
how naive she is. Right.

565
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,980
So we told people on our podcast
that you should do the same thing.

566
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,530
Ask your mom if she'll 69.

567
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:47,440
Your Dad when he turns 70 and they'd been
doing it and videotaping the reactions

568
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,860
to pass out. What a plan. I'm going
to play a few of them. If for example,

569
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,580
well, the, the milestone
[inaudible] 70th birthday, right?

570
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,850
When Tracy is about to turn 70,
um,

571
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,580
his last night of being 69 years old.
Um,

572
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,180
what'd you 69 him? Oh Shit. No.

573
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,610
Hell no, no, no.

574
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,510
Tracy York,
a little stone cold in the face there

575
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,040
on our about it. Mom. Mom.
Do you think when Dan,

576
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,350
he's about to turn 70 do you
think to celebrate as to like 69

577
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,730
why would you even ask

578
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,200
Zach? The first all was Austin from
Florida. Here's a Josh and Sarah.

579
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:49,034
I just had a question.

580
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,190
Are there, that's a prayer.
Thanksgiving for mom and dad.

581
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,900
Mom on the night before
pop's turns 70 years old.

582
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,440
Are you guys going to 69 yes,

583
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,670

584
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,560

that buck place still in play. That

585
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,400
hello?

586
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,260
She's mortified. Yeah. Mom doesn't
even know what the Hell Riley.

587
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,570
Hey Mom, dad, buddy.

588
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,550
When he turned 70 are you going to let

595
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,490

Yeah.

596
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,433
Oh yeah,

597
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,390
but it's a component that,
okay.

598
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,130
C d. All right. I'm going to see.

599
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,880
Yeah,
I'd say this is like another book deal.

600
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,210
The last name.

601
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,770
What did she say? What'd you say,
Joe Diaz? She said my pussy flip.

602
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,630
A pussy lips will be too long. They'll
be hanging down covering your eyes.

603
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,280
That's what you do with your bag after
50 you just take the pussy lips and put

604
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:11,070
them over your eyes like
you're flying on JetBlue.

605
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,930
You'll look that little buffalo.

606
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,960
Do you think

607
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,810
you two are going to be
together when he turned 70

608
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,593
wait,
what

609
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,050
are you guys are going to still
be together when he turned 70

610
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,003
yeah,

611
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,470
night before his 70th birthday.
You guys going to 69 last time?

612
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,540
Keep them high and tight.
Tight.

613
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,340
It's hilarious. That was
awesome. She goes, why does
it have to end at six tonight?

614
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:57,850
As I said,

615
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,310
that's all I have one last time that when
you see old people that still fuck all

616
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,580
you think about,
like when you see some old lady,

617
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,740
what if she was like the most prolific
Dick Soccer? Like, yeah. We were like,

618
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:15,550
you assume like, oh, she's an
old lady. She might've been like,

619
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,600
I used to blow the whole block. Yeah. Like
guys used to just drain. They're nuts.

620
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,920
Yeah. But you just assume because
she's old, but she doesn't have any,

621
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,910
you know, sexual history,
you know, but obviously,

622
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,620
or even my friends that are moms now do
I have this one friend in college that

623
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,000
was such a fucking whore,

624
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,720
like just everybody dumped clip
center and now she's super mom.

625
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:40,200
She's got two kids. She's
always on Facebook, like
posting the activities again,

626
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:41,910
like, dude, you were such a fucking whore.

627
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,580
Like when I think of all
the Jews inside of her.

628
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,160
Yeah. It's gotta be a lot. Ah, it's not
even the same person now. No, I know.

629
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,420
But that's the thing is that she's
gonna, you know, few years later, right.

630
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:55,070
10 years from now,
20 years from now.

631
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,240
And one day she'll be just like a nice
old lady and someone will be like, oh,

632
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,780
watch your mouth in front of her and
don't say right. And then you'll be,

633
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,520
you'll walk up and be like, Oh, I've
known this horse and she's 18. Every guy,

634
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,300
every guy on the fucking, uh, on the
block got a chance to ride it out. Yeah.

635
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,040
Yeah. Like when you think about your
grandma, like she sucked so many days.

636
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,220
She might have, you know, she
sucked your granddad's dig

637
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,360
for sure. Costume. Yeah. Well, it's
crazy how my friend's mom, my friend,

638
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:28,361
his dad died about two years ago and I
talked to him a lot and I will always

639
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:31,270
take growing up and I always ask
them, how's your mom? He goes,

640
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,260
my mom's a different woman.
He goes,

641
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:38,410
cause my dad was 15 years old and she was,

642
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,970
and she married him when she was 20.
So now he,

643
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:47,560
she wanted to an old folks home and he
knows his mom. They go out on dates,

644
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,980
you know,
the mamma like it's a complete goes out.

645
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,060
There's days I don't talk to him. Yeah.
She's go to Atlantic City, she goes,

646
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:57,630
you went to see Hamilton, you know, they,

647
00:40:57,631 --> 00:41:02,090
they have these lives and 70 where
they gotta be doing something. Sure.

648
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,860
We've Viagara and if you've got
a good heart, you still fucking,

649
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:09,580
I just can't imagine what
a pushy looks like at 70.

650
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,140
And when it would smell
like it smells dusty or

651
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,980
I saw a, when I've seen an old one, I
saw what at 84 I saw hunter. You what?

652
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:20,460
It looked like. It was pretty, it was
pretty gnarly. How did you see an 84 year?

653
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,820
I went and watched a surgery.
Uh,

654
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,190
I was doing this research
paper on surgery,

655
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,430
like just the history of surgery and
they let me go to the hospital and then

656
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:33,740
they're like, you're going to witness
all of these, um, uh, you know,

657
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,260
OBG surgeries today. And
I was like, oh, okay.

658
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,360
The very first one,
they were like,

659
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:46,250
we're going to remove a cyst from this
old lady's purse. And I'm like, okay.

660
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,540
And they're like, make sure you don't talk
about it because she's awake, you know?

661
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,620
And I was like, oh, okay.

662
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,700
And then they post you up right
underneath her spread legs.

663
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,340
They undrape it and they go in there
and there's like a softball size cyst

664
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,590
inside of her and they pop it and
it's shooting pass out and it,

665
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,680
and everybody's like,
Holy Shit.

666
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,820
And actually it was good thing that
they're reminded us not to say anything

667
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:14,740
because your natural instinct was
just to go like, what the fuck? No,

668
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,670
but we got everyone kind of can be awesome

669
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,770
thug compose these bug up.

670
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,223
But yeah,

671
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,290
gnarly man was, yeah, it was beat up.

672
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,810
Well, I've seen a hundred year old
lady when I was in high school,

673
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,830
I did Christian service hours and we had
to change this lady for her hundredth

674
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:36,831
birthday and I took off her dress and
I saw her lavia hanging out through her

675
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:37,530
underwear.

676
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,490
Like one of them was hanging out of
her panties and they get real hanging.

677
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:43,920
The lip scale like,
yeah,

678
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,240
well what a Dick and balls do when they
got a hundred they've got to really hang.

679
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,140
No, get 54 it's no fucking
beauty queen. Well,

680
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:55,110
that was 30 I had a nice looking
dick who was veiny. It was tight.

681
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,380
It's veiny the toe next.
All fucked up now.

682
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,380
Now the ball's got a real one of
your balls. Like, oh my balls.

683
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,590
Are they in the water? Are
they in toilet water? Ah,

684
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,790
well I've always had naturally
fucking big balls. Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,260
Now that just,

686
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:15,870
but the Dick looks like Frankenstein's
Floyd from not wearing underwear.

687
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,190
Yeah,
I quit my helmet on the Zipper,

688
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,890
so I've got a thousand of those cars.
I'm like,

689
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,820
I wouldn't have a show my dick to a
young girl, like if a 20 year old.

690
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:31,770
So I really want to suck your Dick. It
would be traumatizing for sure. Yeah,

691
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,390
it's bad enough. He goes,
nevermind the 54 year old deck.

692
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,530
Like what do you believe he was
sucked Harvey Weinstein's. Damn man.

693
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,760
They really going to burn and
Listerine take that dictates

694
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,620
your heroes.
God,

695
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,180
I can't wait till he comes out with all
the tapes and the women that did suck

696
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:55,290
his Dick Pussy. Ain't that stupid. He's
creepy. You think he's got tapes? Oh yeah.

697
00:43:55,470 --> 00:44:00,230
He's got like a young Angelina Jolie
drinking blood sucking Deca the same, Huh?

698
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,090
Slit her arm and stuck of his thing.

699
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,300
He's this crazy.

700
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,290
He really is Gollum. No, that guy's
a fucking nightmare. He really is.

701
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,270
But then again,
you know

702
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,050
it's in a movie kind of worth
it. So Dude, do you want,

703
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,850
do you remember a few weeks ago I played
you a one of our listeners calling into

704
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,120
like this nerdy fucking news show,
right?

705
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,610
The Dad boners and I go on like a Kiva
high and tight and the two fucking nerds

706
00:44:29,611 --> 00:44:30,760
were like keep it high and tight.

707
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,830
So like it's like a catch phrase from
our show and they're calling these two

708
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:39,600
guys and these guys keep reading it on
their news show like that or fucking

709
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,940
make-believe. Good Morning America
style show. It's like a local, yeah,

710
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,240
these Justin.
Hey guys,

711
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,660
this is my favorite part of the day
watching from work and really keep them

712
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:53,490
jeans high and tight. Funny. Every time.
Justin, why he gets you every time?

713
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,353
Yeah.

714
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,500
Okay. So wait, this is live at
13 ABC. Wham. Where's, well,

715
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,290
I think it's in Rochester.
And you'd have a guy that left.

716
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:03,620
You could tell he suck the Dick.

717
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,040
Well how do ya do you have to get the
shirts tailored to be that tight around

718
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:16,500
your biceps doing that on purpose for
sure. That's what a Ryan Gosling does too.

719
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,380
I noticed. But this guy, his
shirts normal. Yeah. When
he gets him tailored tight.

720
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,610
Right? Well the guy on the left wants
you to know what's up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

721
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,620
Uh,
Justin's checking in from work.

722
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:29,040
Hope you guys are having a
great an eventful day. Keep
them jeans high and tight.

723
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,600
So there you go.
The second,

724
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,540
second time. Right. Then
let's go back from it.

725
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,950
Uh, Michelle likes your genes.
Yeah. People were liking the jeans.

726
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:43,280
You're wearing jeans and they're a
little short. Uh, Justin. Hey guys,

727
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:44,900
I love your shirts.
Hope you guys have a great day.

728
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:46,880
Keep them jeans high and tight.
Justin,

729
00:45:46,881 --> 00:45:50,930
we are wearing jeans today and actually
his are a little high. That's my concern.

730
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:56,240
Be High your jeans? No, not on your
waist. Oh good. There are a little short

731
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,040
tilt down. Carmen, what's going on
there? A little. Yeah. He's got,

732
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,650
the dad sneaks onto that flood fucking
pants on. Yeah. When he sits down,

733
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:10,200
it looks like his Dick is
strangled to in these pants.

734
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:14,150
He's got the European
tighties on hungry buds. Yeah.

735
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,030
Yeah.

736
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:19,580
Hi Justin. Checking in. Pink. Pink
Day today. You guys have a good day.

737
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,360
If you know what the guy says.
Nice stuff.

738
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,430
So we're going to read you a little line
to compliment us.

739
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,150
We're going to save your life.
It will say your lines.

740
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,150
So then, okay. Doubling Fag.
They dance. They catch on.

741
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:40,340
Let's, oh they're catching
on. They catch on him. This
next one. And then they, they,

742
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,450
they take jabs at us.
Oh,

743
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,550
but they do it in like the
hackiest fucking lame way.

744
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,990
So like they don't say who we are, but
they do here. I'll just play it for you.

745
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:51,200
Okay.

746
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,520
Hey, Justin healer's back. He's our
guy. I say you should talk to Justin.

747
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,930
It's a white shirt. You
heard about Justin's efforts?
Yes. Both ties are on fleek.

748
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:03,620
Hope you're having a great day.
Keep them mommy's high and tight.

749
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,280
We know about your mommy. Can we do? We
know all about your boundaries, Justin,

750
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,490
not one. Mommy. You got two
mommies. You got two claws.

751
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:14,090
I entertaining people on a podcast
and Kelly, please sit in a basement.

752
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,780
And I emphasize, I found a little
humor from these comedians. See,

753
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,070
we can be unfunny. Yeah, but we
are not, we know how many gurus,

754
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:25,100
we don't claim to be funny. We don't
profess to be a float. All we just are.

755
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,200
We don't just, that's right.
Speak for yourself. But anyway,

756
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:34,120
the mommies do and uh, we appreciate them.
Ridiculous. We don't seem to be funny.

757
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,280
We don't profess to be a failure at all.
We just are.

758
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,390
We don't profess to have any
talent. That's right. Speak
for yourself. But anyway,

759
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:44,560
the mommies do. And um, we appreciate that
virtual asset. Yup. They're showing, hey,

760
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,394
it's fun.

761
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,030
Hey, it's fun. These guys are fun. Yeah.
Huh. Okay. Well, the bottom, you're like,

762
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,100
this is their, their style of humor is
like, make a branch and get over it.

763
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,290
That's their job. Their
base. This is our basement.

764
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,380
I think that this studio is
probably nicer than theirs. Yeah.

765
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,130
Like are you fucking shitty basement
that a guy that scored major films yet

766
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,830
built in our basement. All
right guys. Well you know
what, you are very funny. Um,

767
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,610
at Wham, they coordinate.
Do you think they talk,

768
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,760
they call each other in the morning
and they coordinate the outfits?

769
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,830
Probably shirt colors and the ties and
stuff. Yeah, I think they probably do. Um,

770
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,000
I know that the day of a, like you
said, they're just naturally funny guys.

771
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:31,450
And I feel like the nice thing would be
if they heard about how funny they are.

772
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:35,030
So what I would just say, hey guys,
this is my favorite part of the day.

773
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,900
You know what, why don't you hit
these guys up and, and tell them.

774
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:42,730
So this is Scott here.
Scott Asco.

775
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,140
Yeah. I mean I've at 13, wham, wham,

776
00:48:48,141 --> 00:48:51,440
wham, wham. He's uh, he's, Oh, here we go.

777
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:55,290
So he's at Scott Hasko. Okay. H E t t.

778
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,140
H. E. T. S. K. O. Tell
him, telling me like, dude,

779
00:49:00,141 --> 00:49:03,800
we were watching your,
your show with Matt.

780
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,150
You are so fucking funny.
You're the funniest guy we have.

781
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,680
I thought I knew comedy. Yeah.
Until I watched live at 13.

782
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:16,160
Wham. And now I know what
funny is. Now I laugh.

783
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,450
You and Matt are two true comedy pioneers.

784
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,460
You don't even have to claim to be funny.

785
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:25,760
We're watching your show and you guys
are just that naturally. Let them know.

786
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:28,730
Let's look the mommy's on them.
Let them know. Remind them. I mean,

787
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:29,960
tell them you guys are,

788
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,470
your studio looks great and
you're really fucking funny guys.

789
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,320
So make sure you tell them that
they, they're hilarious. Yeah.

790
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,560
Yeah. They're funny guys.
I almost feel kind of,

791
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,030
I almost feel bad for like, they're just,
they're such boners, you know? Yeah,

792
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:50,450
they are. They're pretty bad. Um, no,

793
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:54,710
but they're doing their Rochester
thing and you guys keep doing it, man.

794
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,270
We're proud of you. You're very funny
guy. Ganges. Speaking of boners um,

795
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,730
we see sometimes people get excited about
the shit that I don't think you should

796
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:07,790
get excited about and we kind of
call them, we call them dad boners.

797
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,630
Like this guy gets excited about,
you know,

798
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,330
the Trans Canada highway. Okay.
Just to give you some rough.

799
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,580
Oh, oh, oh,

800
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,163
ah,

801
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,200
no.
Says the Canada high

802
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:32,630
way baby,
like what do you think of that guy?

803
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,550
He's never fucked outside
this stationary position.

804
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,440
If he ever 60 90 to have a heart attack,
doesn't it drive you crazy?

805
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,850
But one man's chicken is
another man's fucking, yeah,

806
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,730
so you have to look at it from that.
You know,

807
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:53,330
it's like when you take
your kid to go see a,

808
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,070
your Bob look at their face. Their
face is fucking, this is God.

809
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,960
You know, he's some dude making eight
bucks an hour long for college degree.

810
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:07,700
But you know it's weird. It
is weird. What something,

811
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:10,370
it's like when people
come up to you and go,

812
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:14,030
I want to show you pictures from
my vacation. I don't give a fuck.

813
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,150
You know what the best and you
did this morning. Not often me.

814
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:19,870
A tour of your house. I don't want to tell
your fucking bedroom. All right. Yeah.

815
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,780
For Yourself. What's the
living room? Let's see the TV.

816
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,290
You invited me over for breakfast.
Where's those eggs you were talking about.

817
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,383
Know what I'm saying?

818
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,250
People want to show you shit that
you don't really want to fucking say.

819
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,650
That's totally true. I think
drives me crazy and that, yeah,

820
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,090
I can't see without my glasses.

821
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,040
So when you show me a picture of your
trip to the Grand Canyon and I can't see

822
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,620
it, but people have to lie to
people show you pictures. Oh yeah,

823
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:45,680
they drive me fucking crazy. You don't
remember when you didn't have kids?

824
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,780
Somebody sent me a Christmas
card with a picture of the rug.

825
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,620
We kid when the report on the year,

826
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,600
I breed them and now I put the picture
that get up on the wall because I hope

827
00:51:56,601 --> 00:52:00,750
they do the same to me. You know?
It's so weird how things change.

828
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,180
We were talking about change last night,
how,

829
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:06,320
who we were 15 years ago
and who we are today.

830
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,390
That's why I don't mind getting called
out on the other mistake I made. Right.

831
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:15,020
But you can't call me out on something
I did 15 years ago because we've all

832
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:17,860
changed in 15 fucking
years. Yeah. That, you know,

833
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,080
you want to call me out because when
we were shooting a student film,

834
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:25,340
Christine in 1998 I smack your ass.
Give me a break.

835
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,700
You're going to ruin my life
because I smacked your ass.

836
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,830
Even though you had hot pants on.

837
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,760
And we're talking about how
hot your friends say you asses.

838
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,770
How many times have you gone through his
set and people acting fucking totally,

839
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:45,320
totally fucking wrong. Even the women
are acting totally wrong, you know,

840
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:48,890
so that's what's pissing me off.
But what's going on lately?

841
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:53,030
We all fucking change 15 years ago.
Who the fuck knows what?

842
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:57,530
I have to take my dick out in front of
and whacked off. No, but with Christine,

843
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:59,870
wait to see if I've ejaculate it.
No.

844
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,460
Christine would have left who sits around
and waits for come to come all over

845
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:06,630
your stomach.
And for me to sit that

846
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,700
Christina wasn't the way it is,

847
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,480
Christina would've kicked me in the
stomach and ran out of that. Yeah,

848
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,350
I know this for a fact. Christina,
hold on. Let's discuss comedy.

849
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:24,420
I really like your podcast with Joe.

850
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,860
I want to show you a little
bug on the my Dick. No.

851
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,480
Yeah. Well you know how many guys I've
seen jerk off in public a lot? No.

852
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:36,020
Since I was 12 where I've
seen guys jerk off in church.

853
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,180
I've seen guys jerk off
under freeway underpasses,

854
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,620
losses in the South Bay, Redondo in front
of our house, in front of our house.

855
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,680
I parked his car, homeless guys in front
of banks. I'm telling, I've seen but,

856
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,980
but how many of them do I watch
and finished to completion?

857
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,710
Fucking 0.0 you know what I'm saying?

858
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:57,350
You can turn around and get the fuck
out of there. Yeah. Or call the cops.

859
00:53:57,351 --> 00:54:01,620
I called the cops on that guy. Yeah.
Uh, yeah. It's, it's everywhere. It's,

860
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:05,240

that can write code. We coke. Yeah.

862
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,490
I had nowhere to go at night.
You got to come down. Yeah.

863
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:15,840
But I think one time on an ex girlfriend
call me was telling me about harass,

864
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,130
hold all this shit and I got so hot in
the four oh five I'd take that big one

865
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:24,450
out and it'd be in the Hov Lane.
If cal is a third path,

866
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,700
if the cop pulls me over.

867
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,450
What is your second passenger
right here in between my legs.

868
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,490
Here he is alive and kicking

869
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,950

Do you think those guys 69 though
to one of them wants to 69 for sure.

872
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,520

873
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,950
Well let's do with that pink shirt.

874
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,370
He'll suck my ass hole like
a fucking chicken wing.

875
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:05,330
Oh Man. Oh God. How do you spell it?

876
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:09,590
Correct.

877
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:13,330
Double back down. This guy here,
it gets real excited about it.

878
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,870
Today we are celebrating
something very special.

879
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:21,170
My daughter's BFF is losing it too in
the most glorious and one of a kind ways.

880
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:24,180
It has never been done before. I've
done my internet research. Okay,

881
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:29,040
so this is the plan. Yes, of
course. This is non alcoholic.

882
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:33,300
Carbonated cider in a champagne bottle.
We are going to remove it to why?

883
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:36,750
Celebrating.
Okay.

884
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:41,070
What the fuck is he doing? He's going
to pop the cork to take the tooth out.

885
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,930
No, I don't like this at all.
It's all right. It's nothing

886
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:51,000
to, it's just going right. That's it.

887
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,660
Oh my gosh guys.
This nerve gets so excited.

888
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,870
Did you feel anything?
Who else feels that energy

889
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,030
at the park? One day you're
going to come in for a second.

890
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,860
I want to pop a bottle with my Dick.
Suck your Dick.

891
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:23,620
The four daughters embarrassed. She's
like, my dad's such a Dick sucker.

892
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,710
I mean you could just tell total
dick sucker. Yeah, he's damn it man.

893
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,940
He's done some,
a lot of questionable shit.

894
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:36,160
Yeah.

895
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,760
All the kids was like the fuck are you
talking about to say as a woman that does

896
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:42,270
make my pussy dry. Yeah. Like

897
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,110
this is the kind of guy that
finds those two news guys. Funny.

898
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,950
That's the demographics is does
he live in Rochester and Wham?

899
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,950
No. What? Justin,

900
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,830
do you want Jeff to recuse buffalo treaty?

901
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,990
This stuff about it. You know?
What do you like about it?

902
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:12,530
It's a with different, I've always been
a big fan of Buffalo, so about Buffalo.

903
00:57:12,531 --> 00:57:16,460
I liked the people I talked to guy on
the road this year from buffalo all year.

904
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,990
Yeah. Cool guy. The radio.
Yeah. Yeah. Josh Potter. Yeah.
You know, great guy. Great Guy.

905
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:25,380
Josh. Paula. That's right. Cause he's
worked with you too. I love Judge Pollack.

906
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,450
He's great. He's a, he looks like, so
he was like a young pee wee Herman.

907
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,660
You could jerk off in the movie theater,
but you wouldn't give a fuck.

908
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,120
Even peewee.
He jerked off in the movie theater.

909
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,880
It didn't bother anybody.
If it happened now,

910
00:57:37,881 --> 00:57:40,430
I wonder if his career would be as over.
You know what I mean?

911
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:44,000
I feel like that's nothing
compared to today's standards.

912
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,330
We got a six fingertips.
Hey Hitler's,

913
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:51,500
I'm just a black guy that got out of
jail and like to fuck. I had to stop.

914
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,770
I had to stop my come hug to write
this email about the question of the

915
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,790
advantages and disadvantages of being
born with six fingers as a glass then

916
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,890
moves to be made with six fingers.
On one hand,

917
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:02,540
I could answer this puzzling question.

918
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,050
We in the sixth fair community do
not acknowledge a middle finger.

919
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:11,060
Also from experience. It
is not an advantage in the
fingering men, women, Zim,

920
00:58:11,061 --> 00:58:14,450
Windsor's, but I believe it does add to
the experience when you rub, rub, rub.

921
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,600
Thanks.
Water champ and Christina machines within,

922

them in there. That's quite the answer.

924
00:58:25,851 --> 00:58:29,810

about to happen to them.

927
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,060
I know they're going to have some fun.

928
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:43,450
I guarantee we have way more listeners
than they do or you have no idea what

929
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:48,890
they just fucking did. I know they're
going to fuck with the wrong people,

930
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,730
the wrong people.
Then they're going to have to,

931
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,900
they're going to end up shutting
down their Twitter, bio,

932
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:00,530
terrain fury, uh, the wet butthole
research. Okay. And Mommy's,

933
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:03,940
I'm a regular shit to shower.
Participant. Great. Do you do that job?

934
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,240
Oh, this is shit in the
show, in the shower,

935
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,220
every once in a while pieces fall that
you're in there. You over committed,

936
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,830
but you take a shit

937
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,010
mean you're showering
and then pieces of shit.

938
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,380
Tom Did you take, sometimes you jump in
the shower, you wake up late, you're late,

939
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:23,870
you're not thinking and you're like,
fuck,

940
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,230
I'm supposed to take a ship
before the shower. Or you're like,

941
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:32,160
what am I going to do it dry off and
go out and start from scratch? No, no,

942
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,220
no.
You're not around that shit.

943
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,930
And then you take a stick and you
push it down the hall. Yes, I did.

944
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:40,490
I thought it would be three or four times.

945
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,640
My wife caught me and my wife called
me one time and throwing a piece.

946
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,800
She caught you throwing a terrible
one time. She caught me with my hand.

947
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:50,960
Throw it into the toilet.
Yes,

948
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:55,820
she did throw up and then she got upset.
She to live. We're done with that.

949
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,720
I've never just pop a squat.
Right.

950
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:03,830
Pop a squat but thing and in
hotels on the road. Yeah. If they,

951
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:06,560
oh I think a good shit in the shower.
I don't give a fuck.

952
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:12,010
And it has like those four things and
the beauty of it is the shower has,

953
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:16,670
the fourth thing is so it's like when
you were a kid and you had Plato and you

954
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:20,990
push the shot, the
shampoo. Baba. Yeah Bro.

955
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:25,991
I don't fuck around in Vegas at that big
shout when the presidential suite and

956
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:29,660
they got that big hole or my
God on a regular day though.

957
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:31,980
But I haven't done it about 10
years. I'm going to lie. Yeah,

958
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,730
it's been about if you
take a shit on the toilet,

959
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,870
do you wipe and then get in the shower
or do you just take it all right.

960
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,733
Here's the day.

961
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:44,710
Remember a couple of weeks ago when the
plane went down because the guy farted

962
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,200
and it was really bad couple
of weeks ago for flight,

963
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:52,040
had it go down because somebody
farted and it was really bad. Okay.

964
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,170
I had the whole explanation to that.
Okay. I'm a morning shit. Yeah.

965
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:00,050
But I can't wake up and shit. I
have to wake up, drink coffee,

966
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,150
do a piece of nicotine gum that
gets the interior going. Yeah.

967
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,400
Then smoked dope. Then you smoke. Right.

968
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:09,560
So I opened the back
door while I'm smoking,

969
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,290
the shit starts coming out of me, so
I'm smoking while I'm shitting. Okay.

970
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,880
So that's that first really, really
good shit in the fucking day. Yeah.

971
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,900
And then you go and then I take a shower.

972
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,640
My ass is tip top Magoo and
I have no other problems. If,

973
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,480
if I shit, it's maybe like
at six and before I go out,

974
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:32,600
I'll take a shower to go to the
comedy store. Okay. So that's,

975
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:36,630
that's that one thing. I'm a
morning shit. Who's a morning?

976
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:42,170
What happens if you don't like that
dude that got on the plane that day?

977
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:47,570
The plane had to be taken down a 10 I've
been there because you got up at five

978
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,510
you ate breakfast,
Uber came before you can take a shit.

979
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:55,220
You walk into the bathroom at lax,
it's a tornado of shit. Odors.

980
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:58,070
Have you ever walked through the
middle of the men's bathroom?

981
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:03,110
It's 10 guys shooting at once
and you're like,

982
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,330
I'm not going to take a shit on me.

983
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,700
Then you have the oatmeal and you're going
to have that fucking four hour flight

984
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,400
and you were asked after two hours.
Listen,

985
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:14,430
only in animal cause shit on the
flight has done it a few times.

986
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,740
I've done it for emergency shifts
and not like a casual show. If it's,

987
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,900
I will hold it till it's
coming out of my ear balls,

988
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,920
eyeballs before I share on a plane.
That's disgusting. It's gross.

989
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,400
It is not really disgusting,

990
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:32,160
but they do the best they can because
the structure goes up. Your farts smell,

991
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:37,110
you know they do the best they can.
They happen on that flight. He held it.

992
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:40,450
He held did. He held it and then
you get those pre farts. Yeah.

993
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,260
It's like when you're driving home,
you could drive home.

994
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:47,760
You don't need to take a shit once.
Your asshole processes the exit.

995
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:51,360
Yes. Okay. One Laurel Canyon,

996
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,140
but you hit violent as soon as you're
asking your eyes connect with Laurel

997
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:00,270
Canyon. Yeah, it's like two miles.
Now Watch your asshole hits the ramp.

998
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,160
There's a magnet on the off ramp.
That bull shit out of your ass, Nigga.

999
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:11,040
She goes, that first light. When you're
going off that over that you pray to God,

1000
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,040
you go,
Lord of there's a fucking God.

1001
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,480
Please don't let that be a red light
there and there's always a red light

1002
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:22,260
because that mag needle pulls that,
that last bump.

1003
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,780
Now you're at that light,
your foot's tapping.

1004
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:29,940
Think of that fart that comes out first,
that the appreciate Fart is horrific.

1005
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:34,560
You can't even tolerate it. You got
the windows open, you got the air on,

1006
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,860
it's thick, it's warm.
It's really a, once you go,

1007
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:41,160
when you feel it slipping out of your ass,
and that's tremendous.

1008
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:44,340
When you sit and that first 14 inches drop

1009
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,230
and you hear the water hit
your ass her and be like, Ooh.

1010
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:54,330
And then he'll like little pieces like
you have to go to a hot dog factory.

1011
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:59,450
You ever go to Sab Brighton hot
dog factory? When I was an old CIO,

1012
01:03:59,451 --> 01:04:03,660
he works study program that made us go
there. That's what my ass hoes life.

1013
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,970
When you go to the Sab bread factory,

1014
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:10,971
it's a hole in the floor like the six by
six foot circle and there's a bunch of

1015
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,540
Puerto Ricans with rules.
All right,

1016
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,130
and this dream Puerto Rican
with bags of 80 pound salt.

1017
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,170
I'm not making this up,

1018
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,510
I didn't want to insult you.
You know.

1019
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:31,500
So there's a duct duct,
Christine,

1020
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,840
it's all pieces of the cow
and the pig that are not used.

1021
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:41,460
The hearts, the eye balls. Did
you just see him coming down,

1022
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Blah Blah Blah and it smells horrible
and you see like three Puerto Ricans put

1023
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,470
the salt on down and 10 Puerto Rican.

1024
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,110
They sweep it into a hole and that's
where it gets processed and it becomes on.

1025
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,270
That's how the hot dog is.
Probably that's how your asshole is.

1026
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,150
That's how your asshole,
well I dunno,

1027
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:08,540
I lost whatever thought I had but didn't
you recently have a huge shit you were

1028
01:05:09,091 --> 01:05:11,970
saying last week when they came
from New York it was four days.

1029
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:14,790
Eat for some reason,
correct me,

1030
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,970
we take shits on the road but
they're not really good shit.

1031
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,240
I have to look at them and go, it's
like a nine inch. It's not a lot.

1032
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:24,970
This shit I take when you get home.

1033
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:29,970
When I walk in that door you put that
luggage down and I run for the back

1034
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:31,174
bathroom.

1035
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,500
The Shit I took was like
a cane when I flushed it.

1036
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:40,130
If you could hear the cane breaking like
they have like a bone in the middle.

1037
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:46,380
It was going to finally broke and it
flooded and I had the pleasure and I will,

1038
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,770
the next morning I come
back and I see my wife,

1039
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:55,740
she went and got a snake at Kmart cause
I'm always fucking that bathroom up.

1040
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,680
I fucked that bathroom so good.
You can't take a shower back there really?

1041
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,550
Because sometimes the shower over floods
from this shit. I taken that batch.

1042
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:10,180
Listen, when I picked that house, I
pick a house because of the bathroom.

1043
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:15,220
Everybody looks at living rooms and
family rooms. If the bathroom a proper,

1044
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,540
you're not going to live right.

1045
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,210
I want my bathroom and he just spread
my legs out. I want a window. Yeah.

1046
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:25,360
I want to CB radio. I want
to see be, I want a phone.

1047
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,430
I want my back. I don't know playboy. They
have my wife. No playboy and open house.

1048
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,370
Yeah. Books I want. I want,

1049
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,620
I like to day in there now,

1050
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,620
but they,
the tushy cushion,

1051
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,310
you put the hot water when the hot
water hit you and when you open up that

1052
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:50,200
thing, I mean it really, you'll,
it'll leave. You wouldn't know.

1053
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,430
You could eat off your ass.

1054
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:56,320
It's like it's beautiful and you take some
water and then I, I took a loofa. Yeah.

1055
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:59,920
You go to bed, bath and beyond and you've
got a big Lou for, you got a good one,

1056
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:03,430
but you cut it into little
asshole loofahs. Oh, that's
a good idea. I have an APP,

1057
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,640
looser loafer every night.
90 days I change it.

1058
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,160
You dispose of it.

1059
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:17,210
One use and gone like every two or
three weeks after the fucking know.

1060
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:21,370
But I don't understand.
Listen to me,

1061
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:26,360
you take the thing and you let the big
day, the tushy hit your ass, right? Yeah.

1062
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,730
And it takes all the chunks and
fingernails and all the, all the big shit.

1063
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,030
Then you take Roland
pay, uh, toilet paper.

1064
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:39,070
You wet it first and then you massage
it and this, it's clean. Yeah.

1065
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,690
Now to exfoliate the ass. Yeah,
because that's what nobody does.

1066
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,980
Everybody's washes and wipes,
but nobody is fully hcs hall,

1067
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,170
the Loofa and you take the other
one and you just, you know,

1068
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,810
exfoliate that little last home. Yeah. And
later on, later on when you're driving,

1069
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:01,450
you go for a little drive and when
nobody's watching you stick your finger in

1070
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,810
your ass and you scratch it
and it smells tremendous.

1071
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,750
It smells like that little
Lou for like that little clam.

1072
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:11,320
I bet you joy as a really nice ass.
Do you know why?

1073
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,450
Because I want somebody to look at,
nobody's ever looked at,

1074
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,690
but if they really illiquid,
I'm not saying

1075
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,530
no stop.
No decent woman.

1076
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,800
No woman that's going to bury your
children is going to fucking eat your ass.

1077
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:29,120
Your wife is eating your
ass on the rag. No, no,

1078
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:33,470
but she showed that she really should
date and she had to eat my ass one time.

1079
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,500
If not,
I can bury it.

1080
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:39,680
You got to suck the ball suck and just
pick up that canal and licked that

1081
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,830
asshole like this. Thank you. And
you have to be drunk to do it.

1082
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,140
Like you know you're not going to get a
single woman to lick your ass on unless

1083
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,400
he's a savage. Yeah, it was a drunk woman.

1084
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:54,350
I've gotten the girl coked up your ass
holes the first and that gets lit and

1085
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:59,110
they could smell like Newark that don't
give a fuck. Go read that ass. You know?

1086
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:03,530
Listen if I'm fucked up and you got good
pussy and I bend you over the 69 you'd

1087
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:06,170
eat your ass from bond.
It's got a Wang to it.

1088
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:09,400
You think I'm going to tap you and go
Christine, you got wagging your ass.

1089
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:15,100
I'm a soldier. I gotta either with
that way cause he's a real commitment.

1090
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:17,450
Pled rocky bunny

1091
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:22,160
because we had a debate on this
show that this guy was like,

1092
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:24,800
the only way I'm going to get a
girl's butt is if it's totally clean.

1093
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:29,510
It doesn't smell. He doesn't love it. No,

1094
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,880
no. I don't want to eat. You're
pushing me to come out of the shower.

1095
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,860
I want you to go to yoga.
Yeah.

1096
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,220
I want you to come back from yoga with
those little pubic hairs. All scores.

1097
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,240
Oh my God.

come back. When is that pussy smell?

1099

It's tremendous sweaty.
It smells like a gyro.

1100
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,990
Eg staple of the gyro right above

1101

01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:49,980
I love your podcast. You find this shit.
So this guy, wait, what do you think?

1110
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:53,060
What do you think of a song? Like
what do you feel? Think that's a song.

1111
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:57,820
It was 16 1600% hold on.

1112
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:02,840
I though he's telling him about
his testosterone levels. 16 to 16

1113
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:05,363
thanks guy.

1114
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,010
But you can

1115
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,130
see where it's the kernel of
like something good. Right?

1116
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,850
Like could be a good fall.
Yeah. Yeah. He's onto something.

1117
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:25,790
Just don't tell nobody I'm am I told
the kid once he picked me a score.

1118
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,260
Yeah, I think it, he's like,
what do you think? I go, listen,

1119
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,100
that's a high level script.
But don't tell nobody that.

1120
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,560
He's looking at me like why go?
Cause everybody will jump on it.

1121
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,640
Tell us solar but not a show. Keep
it. We're going to work on it.

1122
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,340
It was that bad. Yeah. It's weird when
you talk somebody down from a bad idea.

1123
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,820
But this, like you said, there's
definitely something here. Yeah.

1124
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:49,950
So this came in for a
machines with intake.

1125
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,413
This is great.

1126
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,990
This is good.
Very good.

1127
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,060
This is a fantastic

1128
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,670
John Powers from New Hampshire.
Wow.

1129
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:31,530
Joey likes it. Not Bad man.
This is it. The same song Joe.

1130
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:36,650
But see, we have towns, had listeners, the
other guy didn't have the studio. Yeah,

1131
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,270
that's right. No, he didn't have access
to the studio that day. That's right.

1132
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:45,780
Jason from Sacramento did an acoustic
version of machines within, yeah.

1133
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:50,383
I haven't heard it.
But

1134
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:59,270
we have some very talented listeners
musically inclined people who will take

1135
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,450
the, uh, the Corto.

1136
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:07,440
Got It.
Okay.

1137
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:16,270
In this Terminator Matrix
Free Three on many times,

1138
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:17,560
I'm going to say this,

1139
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:22,770
machines with machines
with loud at two 16,

1140
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:28,180
which means sound to make
beautiful and practice,

1141
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:31,940
some of which are fine.
Go long

1142
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:34,363
term.

1143
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:38,530
Very, very nice. I actually think that's,
that's beautiful. Yeah. So last week,

1144
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:42,910
the same, um, artists
submitted another song.

1145
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,980
This guy, my introduction, my song I
just made on Facebook. Crazy, isn't it?

1146
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,450
Well, who would I go? I'll
drop that birthday party.

1147
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:54,250
Crazy. Isn't it crazy, isn't it?

1148
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,890
That first drop that
first got the not crazy,

1149
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:04,720
isn't it? Got that knife crazy.
Isn't it crazy, isn't it?

1150
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,350
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1151
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:11,980
This was the same guy that was walking
down the street. The same guy. He

1152
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,490
must be a fan. Found the Telemundo.
He likes that fucking wrestling mats.

1153
01:14:16,491 --> 01:14:21,370
Tyler more gray. Loves wrestling
first. How crazy. Isn't it?

1154
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:26,030
Innocence. Innocence. Crazy.
Innocent. Is it? It's incidents.

1155
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,800
Innocence answer, isn't it? So he did.

1156
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,900
That's great.
Then

1157
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:37,490
people started sending in their version
of my song I just made on Facebook.

1158
01:14:37,491 --> 01:14:38,324
It's called crazy.

1159
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:49,830
The old Firebird diary ends all gallery.

1160
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,800
I think he's right it right.

1161
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,013
See,

1162
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,110
this is a produced by,
it's a dark too.

1163
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:04,010
I just made on Facebook. It's called
crazy, isn't it? Well who? I'd go out

1164
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,180
crazy. No, it's good.

1165
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:18,070
Z Z,

1166
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,880
Z is you get the vibe that first

1167
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:31,920
and then this is innocent. My, by Ricardo,
I mean on Facebook, it's called crazy,

1168
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:32,813
isn't it?

1169
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:36,810
Well, who are our goals? Please, please,

1170
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:41,670
please, please. Cool.

1171
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:46,000
In this place and this place.
Who, who, who in this place?

1172
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:49,210
Tennis played tennis
care.

1173
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:55,770
It's demonic. Right? And there's a
last one here. This is by Adrian trap.

1174
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:00,370
Really good [inaudible] on Facebook.
It's called crazy.

1175
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,380
Or I go out and talk to her
birthday party. Yes, yes,

1176
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,850
yes, yes, yes. To face. Hey,

1177
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,900
Batman first burst.
This one's my favorite.

1178
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:21,990
I think I'm a fan of trap
one.

1179
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,470
Yeah.
Some of these are good.

1180
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:29,350
I think your theory has always in right.

1181
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,180
He just needs to be paired
up with the right producer.

1182
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,310
And that's what these initial passes are.

1183
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:36,520
This is the first round of producers
that have stepped up. Yup. Next week,

1184
01:16:36,521 --> 01:16:40,030
the week after. We're going to hear it.
Different variations on the song. Um,

1185
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,540
just so people know. So
for this whole week, uh,

1186
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:47,110
you can get 15% off on my store.

1187
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:50,920
Go to a merchant method.com/tom Segura.

1188
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:55,060

1189
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,680
You get 15% off everything in the store,
just glass and bikes,

1190
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:04,630
um, machines within, uh,
the, the Santa wears jeans,

1191
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:09,190
hat, all that stuff. A
Co people ask me about,

1192
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,820
um, machines within guy, um, uh,

1193
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:16,780
about his shirt and he is getting
a, um, money for it. So He's,

1194
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,840
we've reached out. Don't
worry about it. He'll be good.

1195
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:24,350
He'll definitely have a check
coming to him. Um, but anyways,

1196
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,810
so go to the store.
The only thing not going to be on sales.

1197
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,990
Here's a charity sweater a,
it says San Jose,

1198
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,870
Santa Claus wears jeans and um,

1199
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,860
that all that money goes to a
children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

1200
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:41,050
So that's not on sale, but everything else
is vinyl. All that shit. Vinyls crazy,

1201
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:45,380
crazy, crazy vinyl. So, um,

1202
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,900
I think that's about
it. Gene. We have, uh,

1203
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,430
one other thing here and
then it's time to go.

1204
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,830
Um, first of all, thanks a lot of joy
for coming by. Thank you for having me.

1205
01:17:57,831 --> 01:18:01,880
I don't want to see the house and the
baby. Yeah, it was beautiful little boy.

1206
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:06,320
You guys did good. Thanks.
He's a good kid. Um,

1207
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,040
somebody wrote to us. Uh, I went
to the post office. As you know,

1208
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:13,570
post offices are fairly quiet for
the most part. As soon as I walk in,

1209
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:16,780
I hear an older lady blaring church
music through her phone. Hmm.

1210
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,400
While waiting to be called
with her number was called.

1211
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:23,270
She didn't turn off the music. You just
set her phone on the counter. Well,

1212
01:18:23,271 --> 01:18:24,500
getting helped by the employee.

1213
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:26,660
All of us there were stunned
and no one said anything.

1214
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:31,430
I should have said something or let it
pass. I really, I didn't really mind,

1215
01:18:31,431 --> 01:18:34,550
but it was weird and uncomfortable. Thanks
gs. Nicholas, I think you're insane.

1216
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,090
Yeah.

1217
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,690
If you're walking around playing music
and then put your phone down and play

1218
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:39,524
music through it.

1219
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:44,030
I even think people are crazy walking
around playing music when they're walking

1220
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:45,620
around and how loud for everybody,

1221
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:49,570
like we all have to hear your fucking
musical preferences. I think so.

1222
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:50,960
We should definitely say something.

1223
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:54,000
I did some great. I've been in righting
wrongs. Don't say anything to her.

1224
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:56,880
She's out of her fucking mind. Oh, well
you don't know what she's going to do to,

1225
01:18:56,881 --> 01:18:59,860
you know, let her do it and just get
on with your life. Those people have,

1226
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,130
are out of, she's done on
another fucking reality. Dude.

1227
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:05,840
My respect goes up 10 fold for people
that say something in those situations.

1228
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,800
I've been in a waiting room where
somebody was on a phone and there's one of

1229
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:11,390
those office waiting rooms where it says,

1230
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:15,020
don't use phone and somebody else
in the waiting room and said, hey,

1231
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,870
get off of your phone. And I was like,
ah. And the other person goes, excuse me.

1232
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:22,580
And she goes, don't you see the sign? It
says you can't be on the phone in here.

1233
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,240
And so the lady was like, Hey,
um, I think I got it. I loved it.

1234
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:30,830
I love all that shit. I get it sold.
Say nothing unless it really affects me,

1235
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:34,370
but yeah, yeah, yeah. When somebody steps
up like that, I think it's the best man.

1236
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:38,600
It really gets me excited.
Um, so go see Joey Diaz.

1237
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:43,250
He'll be at the Sacramento punchline.
You only have two shows left.

1238
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:47,930
You can get into December 7th, which
is Thursday. Yeah, Thursday and Friday.

1239
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:51,020
Like the arrows show.
The late show probably is one of them.

1240
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:56,120
So that'd be the eight
Sacramento punchline. A
checkout Diaz. Uh, Christina P,

1241
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:59,570
you can see a mother and fury on
Netflix if you have not yet seen it.

1242
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,230
It's streaming on Netflix.
She'll be in New York next few days.

1243
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,410
Yeah, I'm doing the stern
wrapup show on Thursday.

1244
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:08,020
So if you guys listened to that,
I'm

1245
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:12,860
so fucking excited. I'm such a huge
fan and I can't wait to nerd out.

1246
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,700
Um, and then she has her dates
available at Christina p online.

1247
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:22,530
That should come into, uh,
uh, Short Lake titties.

1248
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:28,050
Charlene say that Port Portland Horrigan
and Pasadena and then Calusa Colusa

1249
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,370
Casino, which I think, uh, I think
Diaz and I did that together. Oh, stop.

1250
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,420
My favorite thing about,
well,

1251
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:40,350
he had an edible with him before a
flight and I lost my mind and he was just

1252
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:41,880
talking to all kinds of crazy shit.

1253
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,820
I thought I was going to pass
out from laughing. Then we, we,

1254
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:49,320
we did a southwest flight together and
he goes, go sit by the window. And I go,

1255
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:51,120
okay, why? He goes also by the aisle.

1256
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,350
There's no way someone's going to want
to sit between. Fuck. There you go.

1257
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:57,560
All right.
We said that worked for all those flights.

1258
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,773
I remember that.

1259
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:05,620
I finally like started to come down
off of this edible and I was like,

1260
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:10,360
man, that was horrible. That was horrible.
And I come down and I go, I just,

1261
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,950
I'm amazed at his tolerance and I go,

1262
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,920
I just can't believe how
much you can tolerate.

1263
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:19,120
Like I was really like having
anxiety, I guess you don't. He's like,

1264
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:23,850
what are you talking about? I almost had
three panels and I go and I go, dude,

1265
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,100
you don't mind that. He's
like, what are you going to do?

1266
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,670
And then we walk outside and I'm like,
thank God I'm coming down. He goes,

1267
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:31,650
you want to smoke a joint?
I don't want to do anything.

1268
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:35,940
I don't want to do anything for a year.
Yeah, he was just right back at it.

1269
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:39,230
How do you deal with the panic attacks?
Cause that's why I can't take live,

1270
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:44,970
breathe, just breathe. Do you
talk to yourself like don't
feel it and you're like,

1271
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:48,900
I chill the worst panic attack as if I
eat an edible and I have to do something

1272
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:54,410
run upstairs or that's
when I get panic attacks.

1273
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,290
Like something active has to be done.
Oh yeah. Okay. But besides that,

1274
01:21:58,291 --> 01:22:02,140
I'm pretty good. Yeah, that's yours. Okay.

1275
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:06,240
Do you do an activity? Do you ever
like watch TV to calm yourself down?

1276
01:22:06,241 --> 01:22:11,190
Sometimes when you're too high
I just go to sleep really well.

1277
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:14,060
I'm too high. I just
passed the fuck out. Yeah,

1278
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,950
it gets to that level where you
just want a little too deep.

1279
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,580
Just take a little nap. I remember we
got to Calusa, I still remember this,

1280
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,160
we've got the CALUSA and they're like,
do you guys want to go to the buffet?

1281
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:28,350
We were like, sure. But I was still had
that like after high where you know,

1282
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,760
you know you're not as hungry as you
think you are because the weed is making

1283
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:33,720
you feel like you have much.

1284
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:39,440
So I go to the buffet line and I come
back with a salad because I'm trying to

1285
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:46,130
fight the feeling of just overindulging
so I know I'll eat myself sick is what I

1286
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:48,510
feel like.
So I,

1287
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:53,220
I show up at the table and then joy
shows up and he's got like four plates of

1288
01:22:53,221 --> 01:22:57,140
like all different treats. And he's
like, who the fuck are you? And I go,

1289
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,970
when he's like eating a salad. What are
you fucking Puerto Rican or something?

1290
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:04,560
Some shit like that. And I'm like, what? I
go, I don't want to eat crazy. He's like,

1291
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:09,070
go get yourself something
to eat. Come back. He would
real fucking food. Then I go,

1292
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:13,960
okay, so go back. Yeah,
we fucked up. Fuck.

1293
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:17,290
The weight watcher points with two
stones were stolen out of our minds.

1294
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:22,030
