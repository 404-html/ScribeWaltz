47
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,470

Don't bring anyone in loving to this.

50
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,860
Well,
go to your mom's house.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,950
You've really been on a ball
tear late. Well, I mean it
kind of makes sense, right?

52
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,950
Tis the season kind of makes sense.
It's kind of makes sense.

53
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:11,030
Why does it make sense?
Uh,

54
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,230
that was an old school one. That's a
super old school man. No, no. I'm here.

55
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,290
The man now dog.
Possibly the lamest,

56
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,120
lamest line ever in a movie.
Well, yeah, if that's the word.

57
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.
That is Sean Connery.

58
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,530
Tell him the black kid that he's
like mentoring or something.

59
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:33,531
It's got to be a writer and it's like
that the moment of triumph where all of

60
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,770
his lessons have come through, you
know? And it's like montage. Yeah.

61
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:40,440
And then he did it and he's like,
you're the man now dog.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,510
Can we stop making those movies where
white people turn around in the lives of

63
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,670
black kids? I would actually like to
see you ride. Really go for it. Now.

64
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,930
Like in today's world,

65
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,990
like really do one that's so on the nose
that we can all mock it and I need more

66
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:02,340
directly. There's a movie now on Netflix,
I'm itching to watch. It's on my list.

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,160
Is it that genre?
Well it's a reverse of that.

68
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:09,450
So it's the black girl teaching
the white girls how to be saucier.

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,040
Oh that's also such a blade out. So lame.
Yeah. So it's a step, you know that they,

70
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,870
it's like step stuff,
whatever.

71
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,410
And she's going to teach the
white girls how to step Ah,

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,230
was called like stepsister.
Oh,

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,180
is that kind of like a like what's
going on with the fuck? You don't know.

74
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,020
Stop stomping the yard. Yeah. It's a
stomp in the, uh, what they do in man,

75
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,000
she's just stomp on the gas stop
in the yard, but she's gonna,

76
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,150
she's gonna teach them how
to be more flavorful color.

77
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,540
And the best is that on those trailers,
they're like, stop in the yard.

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,090
They always have the
guy that can't say it.

79
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,810
Say why this person doing the voiceover?
So embarrassing.

80
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,540
It is so embarrassed.

81
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,840
They stopping the yard this spring.

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,520
Lace up your sneakers,
get ready to stomp a little harder.

83
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,520
Yeah. That's horrible. I've never seen a
step crew or whatever. Have you seen this?

84
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,190
But I'm confused. It's a real
thing though. Yeah. A step crew.

85
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,290
Oh, California. I'm just never,
have you seen a step approval for

86
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,330
an urban step crew?
MMM.

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,430
It's wondering if it's real
or cringeworthy stuff is like,

88
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:24,800
um, is that, is that like,

89
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,510
I'm going to teach you how to be from
the hood and you teach me how to hang out

90
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,170
with white people and like
member, that's like, first of all,

91
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:37,310
it's been done a lot already. Like
had like 10 of those movies. Right.

92
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,830
But then a few years ago,
Steve Martin,

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,100
who's pretty highly regarded
and respected in comedy,

94
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,930
like he's kind of for a lot of people
on the Mount Rushmore of, you know,

95
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,020
comedic minds. Yes. He did one of those
with Queen Latifa. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,030
I saw that one in the,
in the trailer.

97
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,870
He ends up in like a bboy pose
and he was like, what's up?

98
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,850
What's happening girl? And he's
like, and she doesn't think like now,

99
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,830
now you get it. Yeah, that's right.
And then he's like, Yo, Yo Yo,

100
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,820
I mean you go like

101
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,810
this fucking turd cracker who's like,

102
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,430
I can see blacks dance. I get it. Sure.

103
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,200
Cultural differences or
funny. Oh my God. I mean,

104
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,760
I mean in the 70s and the 80s that
was kind of a new thing, you know,

105
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:33,020
like Ed was it Eddie Murphy
doing a Beverly hills cop
and he then he had a white,

106
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,090
yeah, yeah, buddy cops that,

107
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,410
that was funny and I was a little less
on the tailpipe, that whole thing.

108
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,590
It was pretty funny to make fun of white
people is always funny. That's true.

109
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,220
But like, I dunno the way
that was done, like there's,

110
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,590
there's nuance to jokes,
you know what I mean?

111
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:52,300
Like that's the only thing you have
to make the characters people, right?

112
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,740
Not just staring, just
characters, you know.

113
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,100
So that's the thing is that
that was done really like,

114
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:03,101
you believe that white guy was that white
guy and Eddie Murphy was kinda being

115
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,380
himself and Eddie Murphy had
all the carts. He actually,

116
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,610
he had the power because he was the
funny guy. Yeah. Genuinely funny too.

117
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,940
They weren't like,
and then just smack these crackers around.

118
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,410
But I do love those step cruise man.
You know,

119
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,710
I watched bringing on every item that's
cheerlead. You know what you would love.

120
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,410
I love the clovers.
I can watch those clovers take a shit on.

121
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,450
Or you should even just youtube this
historically black university marching

122
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:34,250
bands. Oh, they are so amazing.

123
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,570
I'm talking like Grambling, you know, uh,

124
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,060
what does it McNeese state like I'm
talking to southern Hellman, uh,

125
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,370
Hellman. Isn't that where cast weekends
went? Oh, that's where different.

126
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,420
Where like Morehouse,

127
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:52,421
I'm telling you that historically black
universities that have marching bands

128
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,990
will blow your mind. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I, we got to go watch some,

129
00:08:55,991 --> 00:09:00,630
I'm saying the whole presentation from
the uniforms cause it's always like crisp,

130
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,381
clean.

131
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:06,330
I mean it's like a military style uniforms
and the coordination of the movements

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,440
and the music it and like it's,
well what about the blackness Tom?

133
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,390
It's super black. That's what I'm saying
now there they're already there. Yeah.

134
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,224
And then like sewing,

135
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,230
like usually every one of those
performances we'll begin with like a black

136
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,600
person go
and then you're like,

137
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,660
that means like pay attention
and then they'll like,

138
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,830
they'll do a snap and then
the show will start. Yeah,

139
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,840
it's called right. Be Some
clovers and the APP. Anyways,

140
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,460
I don't know how we got on sidetracked on
this. Um, are we talking about Oh yeah,

141
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,730
yeah, yeah. You, uh, well you've had
aids and you're getting out of that.

142
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,980
I, this is like the only
time you guys don't know.

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,620
But like I live with aids and have,

144
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,170
for years I've been fighting it.

145
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I take my meds and I always had a sinus
infection and cold the fucking flu.

146
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,910
And like for years I'm
sitting here living with you.

147
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,100
And I would go through these horrible
sicknesses that would last five, seven,

148
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,970
10 days. And you'd be like,
to me like, yeah, no, I don't
know, but I didn't get it.

149
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,060
And then the next year I get sick
four times. And you'd be like, yeah,

150
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:20,670
I didn't get sick this year.
And then the next year I get six,

151
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:25,590
six times and you'd be fine. You
know why? It's my Goddamn cockroach.

152
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,540
Cockroach. Cause my eastern
bloc genetics, I can,

153
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,050
I've survived the communism.

154
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:35,100
I've survived World War Two
because my genetics are superior.

155
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,000
My immune system is superior
to the average American.

156
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,590
I don't doubt it. Now the problem
is I'm pregnant and so I've got,

157
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,770
my immune system is lowered
from pregnancy. So it just
took me down. I'd never,

158
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,510
I have a laid in bed sick,
but a decade.

159
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,220
When's the last time you
ever see me laid out?

160
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,110
But the good news is I got into
this Korean soap opera and Netflix.

161
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,423
Uh,

162
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,600
I think it's a poor translation of
the title or just lazy translation.

163
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,750
They do that. They do that both
ways. Yeah. Why be so, like,

164
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:10,350
why not really try to think,
excuse me about the title.

165
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,910
I know there they'll do things like,
I dunno,

166
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,240
there'll be like a, what's a
big action movie here? You know,

167
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:22,580
it'd be like some like taken.
Yeah.

168
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,520
But like in, um, uh,

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,070
in Korea when they release it there,
they'll,

170
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,170
they'll call it like he's had enough,
you know, like they give it like these,

171
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,030
because words don't have the same impact.
What's this Korean show called? Well,

172
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,540
it's shittily translated to,
hello my twenties,

173
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,140
and I was looking for some light bullshit.

174
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,760
I'm so fascinated by Korean culture
because when I was in Seoul like 10 years

175
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,330
ago, I would watch their TV and I wish
I can understand what these people were

176
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:58,870
talking about because it's so
dramatic and they're so beautiful.

177
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,560
They're such beautiful people
and always frustrated me.

178
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:06,880
And I finally have access now
at subtitled and I'm hooked.

179
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm halfway through it
and it's a dark show.

180
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,540
It's actually very dark and
very complicated. And very cool.

181
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,590
God, I would give anything for this to
stop right now. Oh, he telling me, Oh,

182
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,250
it's the worst. I hate. It's annoying.
Yeah. People don't want to hear it.

183
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,020
Nobody wants to stop it. Thanks. Now
you are also into my Tele Novella.

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,620
My abuelita watches her tele
novella before bed. I got, I mean,

185
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,870
I blame Diaz and I'll
tell you, I, you know,

186
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,800
anything did Joey Diaz tells you you're
like, yeah, okay buddy. Like you know,

187
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,970
you're out of your mind, right.
He um, he was telling me when I,

188
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,290
when I saw him last,
he was like, you know,

189
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:52,390
we're talking about different shows and
how much I love narcos. And he was like,

190
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,070
Oh, you have to watch
the show hot, the hotter.

191
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,280
And so what is Ho to hoe to me,
Jj,

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,950
so the letters in Spanish. So I'm
like, what, what is he talking about?

193
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,600
So just out of curiosity,
a few weeks ago, I, uh,

194
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,520
I pull up this show. I see it, I think,

195
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,970
I don't know if it was like a new
release that time. It's called Soco.

196
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,930
UBN though Escobar alias with the hotel.
Which means surviving Escobar.

197
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,870
So I'm like, and I've been on
this Escobar, um, you know,

198
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,490
rabbit hole as have a lot because every,

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,450
every time I pull up Netflix there's
like a new show about them. So yeah.

200
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,650
Cause I pull up your profile and it's
like Escobar, Escobar, murder, murder,

201
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,550
drugs, murder. Yeah. It's the whole
thing. And they have a new series,

202
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:44,230
a new series just came out about,
uh, uh, drug, uh, you know,

203
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,190
cartels and more documentary style though.
So anyways,

204
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:51,790
I pulled up his show and it's a
Colombian show. It's a series.

205
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,400
I pull it up, I watched the first
episode, I get roped in and it's about,

206
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,640
um, Escobar's righthand
man has hit man Popeye.

207
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,850
That was the is the guy's nickname I
love on gangsters. Have cool names,

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,520
pop by baby name.
Kinda think papa.

209
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,410
He personally killed like 300 people.
That's it. So he's a mass murderer.

210
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,090
He's free now, by the way. He's of
course he did his time. So weird.

211
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,560
Like we get,

212
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:22,561
so in this country you associate your
experiences like certain crimes aligned

213
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,860
with certain punishment and then like
you start going around the world.

214
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,950
It's like sometimes in countries
like look, this guy murdered a guy,

215
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,900
he did his five years though
and like he's like all right,

216
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,750
the value of life is significantly
changes diminished is he?

217
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,510
Where is it Columbia, he's Colombian
and give a fuck about life there.

218
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,540
But the series is so good
because it basically picks
up at the end like the last

219
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,260
day or two that is alive and he and Pop
I part ways Escobar tells him he's his

220
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,270
right hand hit hitman. Like I know this
is coming to an end and they say no,

221
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,450
just the feds are close. Yeah,
yeah. The search bloc is, is, is,

222
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,000
is closing in and all his guys
are dying and it, it's just not,

223
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,470
he knows it's so he tells
Popeye like go ahead.

224
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,551
Like you're,

225
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:15,020
you've been invaluable to me and
basically go for it and cause Popeye's.

226
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,870
Like I'm going to turn myself
in. Like, I know that I'm either,

227
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm going to be killed,
they're going to keep searching for me,

228
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,460
so I'm just going to go,
go for it.

229
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,540
So he turns himself in and the series
starts with him basically arriving in

230
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,340
prison. God Damn, now I have
to watch this thing. Yeah,

231
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,440
but here's the mini episodes behind you
then becomes the most unbelievable story

232
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,670
of him turning himself into
a crime boss from prison.

233
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,390
Of course the dramas in this
prison of the different cause.

234
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,860
There's like the paramilitaries
and there's the gorillas
and there's the narcos

235
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,590
and they each are unsafe, separate
sides. And they each have, you know,

236
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,490
different storylines of
trying to get each other.

237
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,150
And then there's romance and there's
relationship anyways. You know,

238
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,130
sometimes when you start
a series on Netflix,

239
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:08,750
he started watching it and you're like
six, seven in and sometimes you're like,

240
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,560
Ooh, like how many do we have left? Like
we were watching Ozark. You're like,

241
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,670
how many are left because you want it to
be longer and you'll check and there's

242
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:21,000
nine let's say, or a 10 and then relief
washes over you. He's a relief. No,

243
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,780
there's enough. Yeah. Or
like, or you go like, Oh shit,

244
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:27,890
that sucks that this is about to end.
So I'm like, episode seven of this show.

245
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:31,160
I'm like, this is good. I
wonder how many are left?

246
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,620
I back out of more episodes.

247
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,790
60 what are you fucking talking about?
How many seasons today?

248
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,320
It's considered one season.

249
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,100
It's just the way that they have
have it uploaded on Netflix.

250
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:49,880
I th I think what happened is this is a,
an original,

251
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:53,090
like a Colombian series and that's
what I think. I didn't, I didn't,

252
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,070
so I think it aired there over
however long and then they bought it,

253
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:02,510
licensed it for whatever reason,
they just call it one season.

254
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,350
So it's 60 I'm,
I'm 32 episodes.

255
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm wondering how long have,
well,

256
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,800
Lisa is going to be watching her shows
because every night I sleep and I'm going

257
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:17,360
to get super depressed because I know
that if it's 60 that's the series,

258
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,760
you know, it's 60 episodes. It's
not like they're gonna be like,

259
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:24,210
next season we'll have 60 more episodes.
It's gotta be the, you're done. Yeah.

260
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,230
But I'm super into admin and I wake up
every now and then and I look and there's

261
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:33,590
the ugliest motherfuckers
on that show too. Shit.

262
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,550
This fucker's on TV. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Well,

263
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,990
it's exciting.
You know,

264
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,320
the problem with my Korean show is
these bitches are always eating this

265
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,140
delicious Korean food.
I cannot believe you on this.

266
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,830
She's watching this Korean show and
then every day it's Soondubu Bulgogi

267
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,380
eating all this shit for days. And I'm
like, are you serious? She was like, well,

268
00:17:55,381 --> 00:18:00,270
I was watching it. So because they have
good food, they have the real stuff.

269
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,340
Yeah. The Kimchi and the, the
noodle soup. Oh, I love it all.

270
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,700
Kalbi I see them eating and then
I want to eat the same shit.

271
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,000
Fuck. Speaking of Netflix,
uh, the reviews are in.

272
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,950
Yeah. Yeah. And disgraceful.
Yeah. Hundred percent.

273
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,300
Everybody loves it. You're
kidding. Well, congratulations.

274
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,670
That's really hard when
everybody's on board.

275
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,110
I've never had something
where it's only love.

276
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,810
Unanimous. It's unanimous fans.
Yeah. It's pretty exciting. Well,

277
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,530
I'm so glad to hear that. Yeah. I've never
had anything like it where everybody,

278
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,680
everybody likes it. Everybody.
There's not one person left out.

279
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,970
Well that's wonderful. That's kind
of the goal of a good comedy show,

280
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,580
I think it sure is. Well,
listen, if you're a comedian,

281
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:55,080
you gotta be able to entertain
everybody at all times.

282
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,010
You don't want to upset
people or a polarized or fed.

283
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,460
Let make anybody feel bad that
this guy's show. I mean, my show,

284
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,830
that's what I usually begin
my shows by going like,

285
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,760
I hope each and every one of you has a
great time and I hope each and every one

286
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:15,150
of you leaves here feeling
good about everything. Yeah.

287
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,120
That's kind of how I do it.
You know? I was thinking today,

288
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,980
are there any topics that
nobody can take offense to?

289
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,590
Like even think so,
but let's say

290
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,300
going into our five o'clock hour,
it's going to be a lively conversation.

291
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,920
I expect we are going to
be talking about Tom Seger.

292
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,780
Huh? That's a radio show. Yeah,

293
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,970
he is a standup comedian and
on a recent Netflix a show,

294
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,740
he did some jokes and he did some stand
up about specifically here in Lafayette,

295
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,840
Louisiana as a whole, any Cajuns.
And so it's pretty Bulger.

296
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,400
He has some vulgarity in there, but you
don't stand up comedy. It's vulgar. Uh,

297
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,000
and there's been a lot of
people watching this video.

298
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,020
A lot of comments about it.
A lot of people very angry,

299
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,990
very offended, very upset because
he really goes after Cajun.

300
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,020
I never thought this would be a thing
really like of all the topics you cover,

301
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,490
isn't it surprising the
ones that kind of catch

302
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,260
dude, I'm beat. I did. By the
way. I heard somebody talk about,

303
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,970
um,
I think it was on the show.

304
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:33,200
I got sent the link that like this
guy was on there being like, oh yeah.

305
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,570
Um,
I know,

306
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:40,460
I know that he's talking about a specific
guy he met in Louisiana. I'm like,

307
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:44,150
what? Like I met a guy in Louisiana. No,

308
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:49,151
I met a guy from Louisiana
in Kansas City in the first,

309
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,130
like during the first
week of 2017 last year.

310
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:58,720
If you were in Kansas City and you
came to one of those shows? I did. I'm,

311
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,560
there was a guy in the meet and greet.
No. Okay. And that's what I say. I mean,

312
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,970
I don't say Kansas City in a special,

313
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,920
but I say like I was on my first week
of this tour is where I met this guy.

314
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,240
Yeah. I just thought it was weird that
some, somebody like he met a guy here.

315
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,180
I'm like, that wasn't even,
why would that even register?

316
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,710
I'd be there anyways. Um,
uh, I think it's funny,

317
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:25,711
like the backlash of like people
from Louisiana being like,

318
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,150
I mean, first of all, I have to say,

319
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,210
I've never gotten so much fan mail in my
life ever for anything like a half for

320
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,540
this special. Like I've been
bombarded with this, you know,

321
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,780
just amazing fandom and,

322
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,930
and support and people telling me that
they love the special, which I tell you,

323
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,950
it never gets old. Like I totally, I,

324
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:52,440
I can't tell you how much it's
crazy how much it has come in. Um,

325
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,760
and I've gotten a lot
of it from Louisiana,

326
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,260
so I don't want to make this sound like
only people from Louisiana are upset

327
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,950
because a lot of them are like, I live
in Louisiana. I love the bit, you know,

328
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,670
like they, they've been very
supportive of it, but people,

329
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,170
the ones who don't get it or
who don't like it, it's like,

330
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,000
you know, this is a joke,
right? No, it's not a Joe.

331
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,260
I feel like there's so many people
out there that are, I dunno,

332
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,850
they,
I think they're taking,

333
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,860
it's like they're holding people on like
what they're saying on stage as equal

334
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:33,730
to what you would say offstage. But
you know, that's the same thing, right?

335
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,560
Well, I think there's a thing
called context, right? Yeah.

336
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,870
So if you're going to a comedy show
and you're all agreeing in this social

337
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:43,080
contract, then what we're going
to have in the room is called fun.

338
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,470
And it's not meant to be taken
literally or seriously in context.

339
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,750
It's called a joke, I believe, unless
you were giving a lecture on, you know,

340
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,840
geography or one of my
favorite parts of it.

341
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,740
This is, these guys are going to
discuss this thing for like a while.

342
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,540
But then this is one of
the comments I have to say,

343
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,190
uh,

344
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,870
when I heard it the first
time I was a little oh wow.

345
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,810
Man, that's pretty, that's pretty
rough. Yeah. But it is funny.

346
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,920
It is funny.
It is funny material.

347
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,970
It's just that we are the,
the target of that.com.

348
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,630
Oh, okay. So a lot of
people don't like that.

349
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,300
Yeah. I mean that's,
that's how jokes work out.

350
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,540
Well,
you know,

351
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:33,220
every joke has a victim and I feel
like you can get upset. You know,

352
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:36,390
you tell jokes about cats in
the cat. People get mad. Yeah.

353
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,170
Told you about the dog dog.
People get mad.

354
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,020
Just so you know, a couple things
I'd like to point out a, um,

355
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,580
the joke, did I tell that it's, you know,

356
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,320
has Cajuns in it basically ends with
my saying that we should build a wall.

357
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,510
Uh, if it's around the state
of Louisiana, um, and, uh,

358
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,970
we have a build a wall shirt.
It's build a wall shirt and um,

359
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,580
the wall is in the shape of Louisiana.
Very nice.

360
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,160
That is item number one. You can
go to the store. I'm offended.

361
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,940
Um, they're using bricks
then that wall. Yeah,

362
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,290
my cousin was a brick.

363
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,220
And here is the other piece of news
that I'm super excited to announce.

364
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:27,230
I didn't say it at the beginning of
the show, but I'd like to say it now.

365
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,240
[inaudible]

366
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,880
to show you how much love I
have for the state of Louisiana.

367
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,650
I took the very first available date

368
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,620
going to the civic theatre
in New Orleans Saturday,

369
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,760
September 29th. Oh, uh, the,

370
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,440
the tickets are on presale today,
the 24th of,

371
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,230
um,
of January,

372
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,120
beginning at 10:00 AM is
when the presale starts. Um,

373
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,240
so you can get tickets to that.
There is a code word if you're,

374
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,230
if you're participating in the
presale and the code word is Cajun.

375
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,440
See a j u n perfect
Cajun is the code word.

376
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,250
If you want to get tickets. Again,
I'm coming to New Orleans Saturday,

377
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,320
September 29th.

378
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,130
It was the first available Saturday
at the civic theater this year for us.

379
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,100
So it should be very interesting show.
I'm very excited to be going.

380
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,690
I just wanted to let you guys
know that. Um, and again,

381
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:40,140
I can't thank you guys enough for watching
this special. I really appreciate it.

382
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,970
And I know that, um, you know, it's,

383
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,960
I've been getting a lot of back and
forth how it's always, how this works.

384
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,520
These things trigger other things.

385
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,280
People watched the special and then
they have watching your special,

386
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,360
cause I keep getting messages
about your special really.

387
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,330
I've been getting so many complimentary
texts from our friends and family and

388
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:02,260
Twitter messages about how fantastic yours
is. So I'm, I'm really happy and, uh, I,

389
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,990
I just, I wish you would just tell
jokes it didn't hurt people's feelings.

390
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,190
I know. Can we make a list of approved
subject matter? Well, yeah. I mean,

391
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:15,250
can we do a consensus of, of
what's a okay. O'Hare talking
about it's a bull here.

392
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,770
I don't want to hurt feelings
anymore. Um, grapes. Grapes.

393
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,100
That's good. Remember yesterday
we had, there was grapes in that,

394
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,790
like the lunch for a Lj.
Yeah. Who would say, oh no,

395
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:30,500
no one will take offense to that. I don't
think so. Right. Yeah. Fruits. Let's see.

396
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,690
What about wine makers?
Uh,

397
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,110
there are probably going to get upset
about cause you stopped grapes. Yeah.

398
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,061
Oh that's true.

399
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:41,490
That's hurtful to the grapes were not
taking grapes feelings into consideration.

400
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,460
That's true.
Whether that doesn't seem to agitate

401
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,270
people. Hm. What if you live in a
bad weather area? Then you're like,

402
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,900
why are you boasting about how good your
weather is as what I always hear from

403
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,580
people that live in shitty places.

404
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:55,440
When I tell them I live in
California and they're like,

405
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,370
I fucking hate Los Angeles. And
I'm like, but the weather's great.

406
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,450
And they're like, so I live in this
shitty place and we have shitty weather,

407
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,790
but I like it more. You know
what I mean? Like it kind of,

408
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,880
I feel like it gets people in a
bad mood. Now I'm going to, I,

409
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,490
you know what I'm gonna
do for your next special,

410
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:14,100
I'm just to help you here is I'm going
to start making a list of preapproved

411
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,350
topics that everybody
can get onboard with.

412
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,000
I liked that a lot and that
way people don't ever get
mad. Yeah. All right. I know.

413
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,500
I know from experience
that cyclists get very mad,

414
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,810
I think. I think you're right. I remember
that was one of the first times, um,

415
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,830
you'd ever received hatred.
Significant amounts is,

416
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,740
it's so funny cause you really can't
predict what will set people off. No,

417
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,640
you really don't because let's be honest,

418
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:45,690
we both have said pretty inflammatory
shit about lots of other people and both

419
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:48,000
of our specials and yeah,
it's always surprising.

420
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,930
It's always surprising when you're like,
you know there's a comedy show, right?

421
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,581
I Dunno actually.

422
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:57,330
I feel like most people do understand
that most to what happens is the people

423
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:01,770
that are upset are very vocal.
So yeah, they're so angry.

424
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:06,060
They're so emotional that they like the
person that loves your show usually will

425
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,000
message you. I love the
show. They don't then, right.

426
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,640
Like eight more messages to better,
you know.

427
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,900
Well and I also think that people
have always been offended and upset,

428
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,360
but now because of social media,

429
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,550
they are given a platform to kind
of Bob together mentality. Yeah.

430
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,880
And it's just, it takes on a bit of a
life more so than it could 10 years ago,

431
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:28,920
20 years.
When you have a mob,

432
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:33,330
they'll also like not actually,
uh,

433
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,380
watch the thing or they're not reacting,
reacting to a,

434
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,850
like a story that they heard about.
I heard that you talked about, yeah.

435
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:43,440
You're like,
you're not even paying it.

436
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,800
You're not even going to give it
its due diligence. Yeah, no. Yeah.

437
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,630
They just feel it. I've heard enough.
I got, I got messages like, you know,

438
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,780
I don't need a watch it, I've
heard enough about it. Okay.

439
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,610
People got mental problems. He
got it. You got to get your life.

440
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,580
Get your ass in a therapy. Let's talk
about something. Don't worry about it.

441
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,213
Oh yeah.

442
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,350
What do you think of that? Well,
that's kind of a good message.

443
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:23,340
It's kind of what the self
help movement is all about.

444
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,200
If you're going to give a blow job
and you're not cool with yourself,

445
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,960
you'd feel probably really depressed.
As you're doing that.

446
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:34,050
How are you going to love that come
if you can't love your own comp lit.

447
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,000
That's way more than I was
thinking. What's up? What's,

448
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:40,190
what's even the ball's lately. You
seem to be on a ball thing. I mean,

449
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:43,840
I just opened the folder here.
Oh, it's blue bands on a ball.

450
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,450
The ball's right.
Send it to him.

451
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,280
He's to get in his balls attached and
licked and stuff. Yeah, maybe he is.

452
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,740
Yeah.
Bird balls.

453
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,940
That's true.
Yeah.

454
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,760
I don't know how people
have indiscriminate sex or
licking indiscriminate Coxson

455
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,630
balls.
Like a lot of people do that.

456
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,980
Like a lot of girls will opt
to give a blow job. Oh, you
have to be like, I don't,

457
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,870
I don't give it up on the first day.
That's a good one.

458
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,730
That's one of my parents is like,
Hey,

459
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:51,390
I'm not easy and you're just
going to get in my pants.

460
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,960
I was sucking on your balls though

461
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,520
because to me that's way more intimate.
I know intercourse. Like I've heard this,

462
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,390
what are you doing?

463
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,280
I've heard this from you and other people
that graduated college that, uh, that,

464
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,830
that's a pretty intimate thing to do.
So yeah,

465
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,930
put your mouse on someone's genitals
is, is, I mean, that's their everything,

466
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:13,764
you know.

467
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,613
Thanks.
You

468
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,420
give us a demonstration. Who
she fucking 12. We know this.

469
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,030
Here's the thing. Who's saying bite my
ball? Nobody. Here's the thing. You know,

470
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,480
bite fucking balls, man. Sniff, sniff.

471
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,040
Let me put it right.
Bat your eyelashes and no one buys.

472
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:45,540
No one says bite my balls. But this is so
fucking seventh grade. Of course it is.

473
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,170
We covered this shit in junior high
brow. Like, you know what I'm saying?

474
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:51,150
Like welcome to this podcast.
Are you talking about,

475
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,910
I'm saying that girls have been talking
to each other about this shit since like

476
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:59,640
seventh or eighth grade.
So like bitch,

477
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:02,430
you're too old to be
like making these videos.

478
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:04,200
You can fucking cover
this and junior high,

479
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,400
the finger banging and you know,
maybe she's,

480
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,450
maybe she's just like really good
at this and people keep their jam.

481
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,360
Like maybe like how about every
guy she hooks up with is like,

482
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,650
you gotta make a youtube tutorial
because he's so good. I need,

483
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,890
I need other girls to find out about
how good you are at this. Again,

484
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,620
she can just be like, remember the
grapefruit lady? Uh Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

485
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:31,920
yeah. Got It. Great for
your man. Stupid show Dick.

486
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:36,390
Between your legs out Dick,
between your legs and stomp the yard.

487
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,913
Want to take

488
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,630
them shot here.
I'm just focused on for today.

489
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,210
Oh, ah. It's actually an
ad for her to get laid.

490
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:56,950
Yeah. She's welcoming
customers. Her inbox when,

491
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,910
when this, you know what I mean? Like if
you're, if you're putting that out there,

492
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,170
this is what,

493
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:07,170
this is one thing that I'm annoyed by
as somebody that is not participating in

494
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,270
the back and forth of a meeting,
people online.

495
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,300
This is somebody who will put out a
video like this and then their next post

496
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:16,324
will be like,

497
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,750
do I have to say that I don't want your
sexually suggestive messages in my inbox

498
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,761
and you're like,

499
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:29,260
you put out a ball so I can post a video
of me sucking on some borrowed like

500
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,550
cherries, like balls and how to be
about me. It's my form of expression.

501
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,510
Look like you want to suck dude's balls.
They're soliciting Balsa.

502
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,020
They want to get their balls sucked.

503
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,370
You're putting in by now

504
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,240
too many jewelries,
too many bracelets and shit.

505
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,620
You know it's not too weird.
I mean

506
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,190
that's the everybody is,
this is what I mean,

507
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,690
but I feel like everybody
knows how to do that.

508
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:00,840
Like isn't that kind of intuitive?
She's not really giving me any new skills.

509
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,250
Not Everybody knows how to do that.

510
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,570
There's people out there that
are definitely washing like,

511
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,950
but if you were to suck balls,
isn't that fairly?

512
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,850
I think she's introducing of
that to people. In other words,

513
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,700
there's ladies out there
who are watching that like,

514
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,750
I don't really fuck with
bowels, you know? No,

515
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,830
I mean going around the world and
that really kind of, you know,

516
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,310
yeah. You know, there's not, there's
not everyone's a triple d slot wife.

517
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,490
Hey, we've, how about fun?
Is it to call slots, slots?

518
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,990
Man,
we've been doing this for a long,

519
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,340
this is a fun way and you
got to do it by the way,

520
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,060
don't be like the fun is to do
it with your, with your friend.

521
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,340
Don't be a jerk and do it loud.

522
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:48,720
But it's for now it's in the car
windows up. It's just the two of you.

523
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,820
And like a girl walks across the street,

524
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,860
maybe a jogger or just like a normal
girl in jeans and assured the more normal

525
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,820
or like the more professional,
the less uh,

526
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,990
promiscuous or sexual her
attire and look is the better.

527
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,790
So when you see a like a pant suit,

528
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,250
just executive woman with a
briefcase crossing the street,

529
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,880
you just go in your car,
you go as a slot right here.

530
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,130
Total Lily Slutsky sluts
walking into work right now.

531
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,740
I also like to do it, um, to
like, like young teenage girls.

532
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,130
I only say that because I can kind
of get away with it. They're not,

533
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,870
they're not slides by any stretch,

534
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,170
but it's funny to be like look of
sluts over there walking sluts.

535
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,760
I Dunno why it makes me laugh when we
do it all the time. We laugh too. Yeah.

536
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,800
Get some inappropriate or if they're like,
if they are dressed super slutty,

537
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,150
then it's funny too if it's on the line
or if it's just like a nice looking,

538
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,450
but it's like when they're like,

539
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,080
if also if it's like two 80 year old
women and their slots Taylor sluts,

540
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,910
that makes me laugh for me
when they're like older,

541
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,360
but like when we're in a restaurant
and like couple like girls walk in and

542
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:12,120
you're like, oh, it's a couple slots
are going to go have dinner right now.

543
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,990
That makes me laugh. Well you like it when
I say it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's more,

544
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,090
it's funnier when a woman says it.

545
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,600
It's one of those things
where it's like the origin,

546
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,900
the source of the line makes it
funnier. Yeah. Contacts. Tom,

547
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,970
you know, one of those things, I'm
just learning about this like context.

548
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,403
Um,

549
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:36,330
I'm learning about like how reading the
words isn't the same as like hearing and

550
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:39,690
seeing somebody say, oh yeah, it's all
these lessons. It's so fun. I mean,

551
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,930
I didn't know that like a
certain expression can be
said satirically ironically

552
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,770
sarcastically.

553
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,420
And that then changes sort of the intent
and the meaning all of this stuff is,

554
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm going to comedy camp right now
and I'm learning so much. So yes,

555
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,720
I do.
I do appreciate that.

556
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,160
I like to do a Mac when
we are in the brown stuff.

557
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,680
You'd done it in awhile. Whenever we see
a pregnant lady, you know, it'd be like,

558
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,630
what's wrong with her belly? She so fat.
That always made me laugh too. Oh yeah.

559
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,630
One time I posted the uh,

560
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,680
a lady on TV who was like seven
months pregnant and I wrote like, hey,

561
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:24,270
how come maybe next time don't have like
four beers in 1870 [inaudible] before

562
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:27,600
you did television. And all these
people were like, she's pregnant,

563
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,960
she's so pregnant. You
know, she had a small frame.

564
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:37,530
It was so clear that she's pregnant.
One of my favorites,

565
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,760
another one of my favorite games to
play in the car is there's your dad.

566
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,460
What's your dad doing? What's your
dad doing? Is another good one.

567
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,020
Any guy eating out of like a trashcan
and he guy with like, you know,

568
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,850
six shopping cars, shit fallen
off of it. He's barefoot,

569
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,020
he's white, but his skin is turned
black from walking on the pavement.

570
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,840
Black soils.
Tell me Your Dad was here

571
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:08,060
once your dad doing here is my dad is a
super mean joke because I mean he can't

572
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:13,620
hear it and neither can anybody else,
but it's not cool. It's not okay.

573
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,783
It's not funny.

574
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,450
That's not funny cause someone's
feelings could get hurt theoretically.

575
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,600
Like if he was in the car with us that
we were like, Hey, are you my dad?

576
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,370
And he was like, what? Why does milk
and ham not taste good together?

577
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:30,840
And we're like, what? Get out
of here right near radically.

578
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,980
We were having a conversation with, um,
a mother yesterday who were acquaintances

579
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,480
with over the phone and uh,
and she was talking about a nanny.

580
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:44,200
She had with our son and and something.
She says something like,

581
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,670
you know, I don't teach my children
to point and laugh at strangers

582
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,320
and both of us, Tom and I looked at each
other. We're like, yeah, no, no. Wait,

583
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:58,140
what are you talking about? Yeah.
How many? One on one people.

584
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,570
That's what you're supposed to do and
it's how you get a sense of humor.

585
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,820
Definitely. She was like, you know,

586
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:07,821
we don't teach them to look and laugh
at somebody for their appearance

587
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,740
called funny. I don't understand. What
do you teach them? Yeah, isn't it?

588
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,650
Like, what do you say when you see
someone if you don't point and laugh.

589
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,550
All right, what's the point of life
now? Our kid yesterday, not like,

590
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,190
I don't like,

591
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,190
you know somebody like pointing out like
at the thrill of seeing a Porsche and I

592
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:35,490
was like, Oh really? Yeah, one of those,

593
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,700
aren't they awesome? I thought they
were. I liked stuff. Hello stuff.

594
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,390
The problem with being a comedian and
a mom is that I laugh at a lot of this

595
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:50,300
shit that our kids doing right now
and I should be disciplining him.

596
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,120
Yesterday we caught him,
he got into my red lipstick,

597
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:57,530
like my stage lipstick,

598
00:39:57,531 --> 00:40:02,240
like the shit that I wear for 10 hours
state like it's really saturated color.

599
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,710
Yeah, just dark as red, red
fuck all over his hands.

600
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,830
And of course ware on our white ass wall.

601
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,700
Some for like 30 seconds cause
he's at the age now where like,

602
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,280
you know you could be in this room and
you hear him dragging like an Amazon box

603
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,230
through the halls and you're like, all
right, that's what he's doing his thing.

604
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,920
And then it was quiet for like 10 seconds

605
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,720
and then you're like kid over here and
I'm like, come on, you have to see this.

606
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,060
He was smacking the wall and he was like,

607
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,700
do you want me to get the
other wall now? And I'm like,
Oh yeah, smack, smack, smack.

608
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:44,190
Just so happy.

609
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,960
And of course we start, I start laughing
and then he's laughing like, Oh God,

610
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:49,920
this is cool.
I guess I'll keep doing the other walls.

611
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,530
So then he starts to take
off to go the other way.

612
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,470
I scrubbed the shit out of that though.
We got it out.

613
00:40:56,471 --> 00:41:00,070
But that's a good woman balls.
We got an email.

614
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,750
Always eat the scrum. Hold
on. Mommy's just an Fyi.

615
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,940
You can't spell
scrumptious without strong,

616
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,480
therefore the scrumptious scrumptious and
there was no reason to be afraid of it.

617
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:14,890
Just think of it as a delicacy.
Slow cooked in the cock pot all day long.

618
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,460
I marinated in all the feral pheromones.
Pheromones.

619
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:23,050
You fell in love with Alexandra. Wow.
That's a lady who I think is probably

620
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,570
Tom. Don't slut shame her. I
know, I know. It's a lot. Oh,

621
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:32,200
there was like women marching this week
and they know it's a lot of slides.

622
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:35,630
Marching, right name. It
was like a slippery. Yeah.

623
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,740
Um, I don't know. Hey
Hitler on a recent podcast,

624
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,170
Christine mentioned meeting,
I forgot my different,

625
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:46,880
so for every part of the body I have
one bottle of shampoo that I use for

626
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:51,530
everything. Why can't I wash my
balls with shampoo and beat me?

627
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,760
Kind regards Johnny, because
somebody beat me. Uh,

628
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,170
first of all, Johnny, I'm
100% on board with you.

629
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,370
That shampoo is soap and you don't need,

630
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,110
so if you have shampoo,

631
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,860
you can watch every part
of your body with shampoo.

632
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,220
All you need is suds. Uh,
it's not different. Nasty.

633
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,540
I've survived for years before I
met you with just a shampoo bottle,

634
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:23,780
shampoo suds up. Do you do your hair?
Do your beard, you do your underarms,

635
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,400
you do your, your butthole, you do your
crotch. I mean, it does it all. I mean,

636
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:32,070
I bet technically you're right because
the detergent is a detergent or soap is a

637
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:36,530
self. However, I think it's
more of a text textual thing.

638
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:39,800
Is that the word I'm looking
for? Texture, all text, texture.

639
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,293
You know what I'm saying?

640
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,800
It doesn't feel good and I don't think
you should put soap and I mean a shampoo

641
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,570
in your vagina because women,
we have to,

642
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,480
we have to wash,
not up inside of our Vaginas,

643
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:56,750
but you got to get in there and
I'm thinking that it might burn.

644
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,690
It might hurt my badge.
So that's kind of like a utility thing,

645
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,280
you know? That's true. Um,

646
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,380
like a mint shampoo probably wouldn't
be good down there. Uh, another,

647
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,520
are you still doing that by the way?
Shampooing was not. We have soap,

648
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,940
so I'll split it up.
Yeah.

649
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,470
As long as the thing with you
is you'll adapt to whatever,

650
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,000
whatever's there anyway.
I swear if I,

651
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:26,060
if it was fucking 409, I
would claim myself with that.
It's just whatever's there.

652
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,350
So adaptable. Yeah. Uh,
an email. Hi, Mommy's,

653
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,890
I've been thinking about this theory since
I was the brown master of my house in

654
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:34,724
middle school.

655
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,420
It seems more and more clear to me that
my body gets certainly a weekly brown

656
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,540
cycle here. Me Out. So I'm
currently a college student.

657
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,240
In the past semester I decided
to try out my theory every day.

658
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,870
I would pick up precise time
varying each day of the week,

659
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,740
whether I felt I needed to or not
to make some chocolate soft serve.

660
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,080
Sometimes it would be
difficult to hold it in,

661
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,560
in some shits for a few hours
after taking 10 to 12 Benadryl.

662
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,150
But after one or two weeks,

663
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,290
my body seemed to have regulated
to what I now call the fecal cycle.

664
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,940
I have now been able to find tune this
weekly cycle to a time that fits my needs.

665
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:12,700
So is he saying he can dictate the
Times that he, that he wants to go.

666
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,030
You can train, you can
train your, your asshole.

667
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,170
It's absolutely tribe done it with when
I used to work a nine to five so he's as

668
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:24,470
good as anybody to do that. Congrats
on little jeans. Two Point Oh yeah,

669
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,060
try it out. Piss on me. It'd be nice. Um,

670
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,790
yeah, I mean I feel, I guess I know
that, I don't know that I dictate it,

671
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,590
but I do feel like it happens,

672
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,690
it happens at a regular time and then
would always fucks me up is you know,

673
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,150
travel or schedule,

674
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,230
but he's saying you can retrain your
duties so that you're like for instance,

675
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:49,410
let's say you start a new job and you
want to take a dump before you go to the

676
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:52,080
office, but you're, you've
been unemployed for a month,

677
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:56,400
so now you're taking your dumps at like
10:00 AM you can retrain your bowels

678
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,060
such that you're shitting at 7:00
AM versus 10:00 AM. But I mean the,

679
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:03,870
the training involves but also
just intense training. Well,

680
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,150
the training involves also changing your
probably your sleep cycle because if

681
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,320
you're getting up, if you're shitting
at 10:00 AM every day and you're like,

682
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:14,130
I want to be shooting at 8:00 AM,
you can't get up at 8:00 AM and do that,

683
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,130
you know, you're going to have
to like six or something. I mean,

684
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,490
you have to make some change.
You got to wake up. I, you know,

685
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,580
if anyone out there listening is
having and struggling with this issue,

686
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,750
we both Brown,

687
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,610
I would say you brown quicker and
earlier than I do every morning.

688
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,730
You're like up and you're like,
I got to shit. Well, yeah,

689
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,080
I mean we go downstairs but within 30
minutes you're 45 you're definitely like,

690
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:41,760
as my body is trained, even just the
smell of coffee can induce. That's true.

691
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,450
I happens to Brown, but I, I usually
shit about an hour after you,

692
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,780
I'm telling people I'm trying to get
valuable life tomorrow. Tell him,

693
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,900
tell him if you want to train your dumps,

694
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,220
I recommend you wake up two hours earlier,
drink your coffee.

695
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,300
Like for those of you who aren't
drinking a high powered coffee and then

696
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,150
complaining that you can't,
shit, we'll get your life, man.

697
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,460
You gotta drink high octane
coffee. I mean, daddy jeans here. I

698
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,540
greatly appreciate my French press that
you got me. Yeah. Tell me a review.

699
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,490
How do you feel about it? I
love it. I love it. I love it.

700
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:21,660
I was intimidated by French Press. Can
I tell you how fucking not smart. I am.

701
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:22,710
Well,

702
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,710
I didn't know and didn't think to
research making my first pot of the French

703
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:35,250
Press. Yeah, he went on intuition. Yeah.
I looked at it like, oh, this is obvious.

704
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:35,970
Yeah.

705
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,970
So I put all the grinds at the top on
top of the press part and then like press

706
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:46,770
out there and I was like,
that makes sense. Or like, no,
it was like between the, uh,

707
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:50,490
you know, there's like a screen
and a and a Ma, whatever.

708
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,070
I put it in the wrong place.
The first day I made it,

709
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,800
I still drank the cup and I was like,
was pretty good. Then I was like,

710
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,460
I should probably just, it's amazing
with Youtube, you just type anything in.

711
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,500
I type in the actual brand
that you got me and make it.

712
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:09,210
And then like in two minutes I'm like,
oh, I was doing it completely wrong.

713
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,810
Yeah.

714
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,730
But now I make this brown
lightning and I drink, uh,

715
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,480
like basically one of those crafts.
I got a moderate sized one.

716
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:22,140
It's not like a crazy size,
but it's uh, it's delicious.

717
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,550
And I love the process.

718
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:28,200
I love the ritual of getting those
beans out in the morning, grinding them,

719
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,880
uh, finding out, you know,

720
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:36,280
what size grind you're supposed to go
to for a French press and you know,

721
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,460
even the ritual of you're supposed to
stir with a plastic spoon because a metal

722
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,570
spoon can crack and scratch the glass. I
did not, I mean, all these little things,

723
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:49,050
I'm like, I feel like I'm a
Barista when I'm doing it. Yeah.

724
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,960
That's the whole point. And then,
you know, you're waiting for that,

725
00:47:51,961 --> 00:47:53,950
the coffee to steep and I don't know,

726
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,480
I love trying these different
coffee be like what I missed.

727
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,450
We were doing the pods, you
know, they're very convenient,

728
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,810
but I missed that ritual and I miss the
smell of the beans and grinding it up.

729
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:11,620
So now I'm buying coffee beans
again and I love it. I love it.

730
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,330
Originally I was so opposed
to the Nespresso machine.
But you're hooked on it.

731
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,150
Well, because that's what
I'm saying. But I loved,

732
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:24,151
I missed the PORTA filter and locking it
in and putting the grinds in there nice

733
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:27,460
and fresh. You know, I miss
that stuff too. Cause that's,

734
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:31,690
that's a real cup of coffee. Oh
yeah. Whatever's, you know. No,

735
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:35,060
I don't have to fucking time for
it. I got a kid crying. Yeah.

736
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,940
Cooking another one in my belly.

737
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,120
And no time to fuck around making
coffee gets your life, man.

738
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,480
I know it's time for that shit.
Do you know what I'm saying?

739
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,610
I know there's, um,
let's see, there's email,

740
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:50,190
there's looking at the different
emails that came in, uh,

741
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,570
the infinity wipe no. Solved. Yeah.

742
00:48:54,571 --> 00:48:58,980
Tell me how mommies, I've struggled
with the infinity wipe all my life.

743
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,560
Every once in a while life eaten.
Some Moose suit might be whole.

744
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:06,300
Behaves like a dirty bitch.
Heres the high and tight solution.

745
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,680
Once you've identified that the
cleanup is likely to go into infinity,

746
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:16,010
simply flex your pooper as if you
were trying to squeeze out a little

747
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:18,960
dingleberry and proceed
to wipe when you're,

748
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,990
how you say asshole is in the slightly
flexed position at hand with toilet

749
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:29,040
paper, toilet paper can reach
the hidden Brown and Hitler's,

750
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,190
your life will be changed forever.
Try it out.

751
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,320
Nick from Boston,

752
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,630
he's saying if you push push out,

753
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:41,800
basically you're pushing and
you wipe that you will get the,

754
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,790
the remnants that are

755
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:47,890
causing the anesthetic and he's saying
flex that whole push push and then when

756
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:52,340
it's fully flexed, reach
back there. Yeah, oof.

757
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,670
I don't know the problem with my be whole,

758
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,620
it's still got it's tender or from
like hemorrhoids from pregnancies.

759
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,880
You know what I mean? Like I don't like
to get in there. I don't like that.

760
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:07,720
I like the water of the day.
You do. That's what helps. Yeah.

761
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,930
Or the shower. If you
don't have a day. Sure.

762
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,590
You can get a fucking Badass on
Amazon for like 50 bucks though.

763
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:19,510
Guys are 40 bucks a tushy so great.
You got to get one dude's.

764
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,500
It's really great. You know,
I know everyone loves a
squatty potty. I tried it.

765
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:26,650
It's okay. I personally,
I think a day is way more.

766
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:34,070
Get one, try it out banner. It's
really, it really is the whole,

767
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:38,360
the best thing ever. Um,
it's like a fire hose.

768
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:42,830
The tissue one is 60 bucks or
something. Yeah, maybe that's right.

769
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,000
I mean cheaper ones and you just hook
it up to your toilets. Super simple.

770
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,420
And then now your whole life
is transformed. You're not,

771
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,690
I think it's so gross now to mash
toilet paper against shit on your skin.

772
00:50:56,211 --> 00:51:00,580
It's so fucking gnarly. I
know. I go, I got a minute. I,

773
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,560
I finished browning now and
I just let water run courts.

774
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,210
Oh my God. I've been telling
everybody about this shit.

775
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:13,130
Do you ever have a poop where you sit
down and you're like, that was it.

776
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,850
And you're like, there's not going
to be anything to talk about.

777
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,520
Like I'm going to just go be,
I'd be disappointed.

778
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,430
And then I looked in the bowl and you
think it's going to be a rabbit pellets or

779
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:27,080
something that was so fast?
Like nothing came out of me though.

780
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,740
That happened to me their day I sat down
and after Korean soup and I was like

781
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:34,250
whatever. And I looked down and
it was the most gigantic brown.

782
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,660
I pro like a one top 10 of my life.

783
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,550
And why does that happen?

784
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:45,260
Like sometimes you think it's not going
to be brown and then the real big one.

785
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,220
Well why did I come out so fast?
Like it was so big.

786
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,160
Love how you asked like
a little kid would ask

787
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,870
you asked exactly the way it
kindergarten or when I was like,

788
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,430
how come I didn't think it
was kind of be anything.

789
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:04,580
There was a lot of chocolate in there.
But you what? I'm, but you have that too.

790
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,860
Of course we are like,
it doesn't feel like much.

791
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:11,360
But then I looked in the
bowls are amazing, but what
is that? The mystery poops.

792
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,250
Those are mysteries. Yeah.
Then there's the ghost.

793
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:18,530
Shit totally disappears.
No, I consider it go shit.

794
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:23,720
When you shit and you wipe and nothing's
on the, how is that even possible?

795
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,290
And you look, you're like there's a big
shit in there and you're like, wait,

796
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,170
is there shit somewhere else on my body?
Like you reach around, you're like, no,

797
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,240
she's on the cheeks. There's no how
is there no shit. It feels like you,

798
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,310
like you won a lottery. It doesn't
it feel special or the best day.

799
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,520
I think part of that too,
I think you can prompt that a little bit.

800
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,020
Somebody told me he's was,
if you spread your cheeks before you sit,

801
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:50,480
so everything really goes apart.
But I still,

802
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,850
I think God could fall on, you know,
that's counterintuitive honestly.

803
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,390
Because if the hole is bigger,
you're not pinching it off.

804
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,380
So that to me would
create an infinity wipe.

805
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,340
A scenario actually. Yeah, I disagree.

806
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,890
You want it pinched? Well, interesting.
So many different theories, you know?

807
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,800
Um, let's see. The world is a
mysterious place on a United flight.

808
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:21,260
They just suggested the seatbelt be low.
And tight.

809
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,250
This goes against all my beliefs.
Should we start a campaign to educate?

810
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,720
I'll love no hate. F all the haters,
Nick. No, I'm offended. Yeah.

811
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:35,300
I want to be high inside is the
only way to live your life. I mean,

812
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:40,130
low and tight. So terrible.
Now. It doesn't feel good.
No, it feels a little tight.

813
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:45,300
God, air travel is the worst
in this country. Yeah. It's
so demeaning. It really is.

814
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,290
It really is the worst experience.
I was watching this show.

815
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,530
No, the new one I'm watching, I
forget the fucking, this is us. Yeah.

816
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:58,960
There's a surprisingly good show.
So good for a network show. And um,

817
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,850
there's a character on there who's
battling with her weight and she's,

818
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,560
I don't know like what she weighs,

819
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:07,360
but she's really large and she gets on
an airplane and the woman next to her

820
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,000
totally eyeballing her and she's
like, don't worry. I bought two seats.

821
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,720
And then the, you know, the flight
attendant comes by and he's like,

822
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,650
I got your seatbelt extender. Like totally
loud. She's like, thanks. I got it.

823
00:54:18,651 --> 00:54:22,430
Like I'm already fucking embarrassed
enough. Yeah. And then she's like,

824
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:25,820
I know how to do it. You know, like, and
I just felt so if you feel so bad for her,

825
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,950
cause you're like, ah, like
you did the right thing,

826
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:32,090
you bought two seats that you're
not like ruining anyone else's day.

827
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:35,060
But it just seems,
I just feel so badly for those people.

828
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,350
The seatbelt extend nerves and everything.
Yeah. I mean terrible being fat.

829
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,620
I imagine it's hard cause
that's your addiction, you know.

830
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:45,140
But everyone gets to see
what your addiction is.

831
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,290
I know it was so hard on
a flight actually with um,

832
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,620
Bert.
Yeah.

833
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,450
And the flight attendant to
like a discreet seatbelt extent.

834
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:00,880
Like they to him, to him, they gave
it to him. Yeah. And he was like, hey.

835
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:06,200
And then she came back, she was
like, you did anything? He was like,

836
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,660
fuck of sort of like, Gosh. Yeah.
But it was the thing I've seen them,

837
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,860
I've seen it done discreetly,
which is nice to do it that way.

838
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,910
Like they do it kind of like, like walking
by like the dropping something off,

839
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,880
you know, like not make a scene
of it. Yeah. Don't be a dick.

840
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,450
Okay. I mean, they're embarrassed
enough, I'm sure. Yeah.

841
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,200
It's terrible to have to buy two
seats on a plane. She's, yeah. What?

842
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,510
Bernd does it all the time. Yeah, he
does. Or he just flies first class.

843
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:36,310
Isn't that why?
Because the seats are beggar.

844
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,380
[inaudible] do I does it?
Yeah. A little bit of room.

845
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,680
He barely wedges into
those seats. I know. Hmm.

846
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:49,320
Drank in the whole time. I Super
Fat. So another email here.

847
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,100
Um, this is one for you.
What do you think of this?

848
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:58,170
Why don't you read that out loud? I
can't. Okay. Hi, Mommy's congrats jeans.

849
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,500
My aunt and I have gotten into heated
discussions about what pre prenatal

850
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,360
prenatal vitamins due
to your nose picking.

851
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,670
She thinks that because the vitamins
make your nails grow so long hinders your

852
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:12,510
ability to pick.

853
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,790
I completely disagree and used my claws
as shovels to grab that shit up from,

854
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:22,440
from up in my brain. My
question is obviously for
Christina, queen of personality,

855
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,010
do use your prego

856
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,260
clause to your advantage
or do you cut them?

857
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,310
These are the thoughts I have after my
husband has left for work and I'm picking

858
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:34,720
my nose waiting for my coffee.
Thanks. Mommy's love you Sarah.

859
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,680
Well, Sarah, I have to tell you, you're
right that your nails. Do you know that

860
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,070
like those crazy people that
we play videos. So you have to,

861
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:49,780
I like them short. I think it's disgusting
personally to have long nails. Well,

862
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:53,530
think about how somebody with long
nails feels hearing that right now.

863
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,990
I mean, seriously even see I
prefer long or short nails.

864
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:03,850
You say those people are
disgusting. I mean, it's disgusting.

865
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:08,620
Not The people. It doesn't matter. Do
you think that they, I mean I got to,

866
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:10,870
you got to think about everybody's
feelings all the time. No,

867
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:15,850
I find it unhygienic cause I personally
get a lot of people with poor hygiene

868
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:18,790
feel when I make fun of it. Yeah, man,

869
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:21,260
that's not okay because somebody beat me.

870
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:29,020
Oh, the trauma. Oh, so sad. So,

871
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:34,240
uh, anyways, to answer your question,

872
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,300
I keep them shorter because actually I
found that nose picking is enhanced with

873
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,200
a shorter nail.

874
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,320
You're going to do more damage with a
longer nail and you're also going to

875
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:49,000
introduce more bacteria in your
nose, which is how you get sick. Now,

876
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,270
apropos our discussion earlier,
how I avoid sickness.

877
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,490
I'm a compulsive hand washer. I washed
the backs of my hands like a surgeon.

878
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,800
I sing happy birthday. Happy Birthday Song
three times as I wash. That's the rule.

879
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,440
I do not pick my nose if I know there's
sickness in the house. This is truth.

880
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,730
I will use a Kleenex instead
because that's how you get cold.

881
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,320
This you pick your nose, you,
you rub your eyes, he put it,

882
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,870
you put your fingers in your
mouth. True Story. All right?

883
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,630
Don't touch your fucking face.
That's how you're not,

884
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,720
that's how you avoid sickness can,
you're not a nose picker like me.

885
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:30,260
You're a thumb picker. I've seen
you. You do this. You do this. Yeah.

886
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,240
You pull out a scrawny honor roll
and then you flick off the bat,

887
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,910
but sometimes I dig with the
index finger to I'm seldom seen.

888
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,280
I've seen you do with a pancake.
Thank you. I'll do it too.

889
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:47,440
He used to roll your boogers in my car
and I flipped the on the floor. Yeah.

890
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,910
Thanks for doing that.
It's really cool. Click,

891
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:56,080
click was so nasty, man. I'm
into picking my son's nose.

892
00:58:56,081 --> 00:59:00,060
It's a fun game, kind of the
best thing. And he's like, he'll,

893
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,460
he'll raise it. Hey, let's you, and
then he doesn't know what you're doing.

894
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,920
So whenever you're doing man,
whatever,

895
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,580
it's just as gratifying to pick your
son's nose as it is to pick your own.

896
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,280
I had no idea.
It's one of the joys of parenthood now.

897
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:16,590
I don't like picking your nose
though. I think it's disgusting. Yeah.

898
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,470
Um, but our son, I love
it. You remember last week,

899
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:21,980
I think it

900
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,570
was last week,
there was a,

901
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:28,571
there's this big news story
that dear leader Trump,

902
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:29,800
um,

903
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,800
so supposedly in a meeting referred
to African countries and Haiti as shit

904
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,250
countries said like,

905
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:45,251
why are we getting all these people from
these shithole countries when we could

906
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:49,580
be at one? I prefer to get people
from Norway. I mean, oh boy.

907
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:54,530
You tell me if there's any subtext.
But, um, yeah, so obviously,

908
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,590
and then, you know, he came
out, said, I never said that.

909
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:00,860
And then people confirm that
he said that. And then, uh,

910
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:04,820
I think Republicans that were in the
meeting said they couldn't recall what he

911
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:08,180
said. Either way. Uh, there was a,

912
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:13,570
this came in that some big words were
said on CNN by somebody who was trying to

913
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:17,660
make a point about Oh,
offended.

914
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,290
He was by hearing the president say,

915
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,970
or the alleged comment that he said that
there's people from Chicago never takes

916
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:29,070
responsibility. Nothing ever
happened. Never his fault.

917
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,250
Well, Mommy, get the,

918
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:34,130
your reaction to what the president said
about these brands to want to come to

919
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,890
the United States from
countries like Haiti and Africa,

920
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,290
because I'm going to give you a reaction
if it's personal. I'm a proud shit hole.

921
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,510
My family was called Watson macro leaders.

922
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,170
We came from the Italians and Irish who
were regarded as people from shithole

923
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,480
countries. Oh, a century ago.
We call people slamming eyes,

924
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:57,140
Chinese immigrants that were now ashamed
of speaking about it in those terms

925
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,770
because they came from a shit hole country
and now they're our backbone of this

926
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:01,604
country.

927
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,780
In the 1940s we call people traders
because they came from a shingle country.

928
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:07,520
We call Japan and we're ashamed.

929
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,590
We call people who fled from conflict
and set full America spics and what backs

930
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:13,820
and we're ashamed

931
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:20,480
growing this country on the backbone of
bigotry that comes from when I saw my

932
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:25,010
family called Styx waps and macro leaders.

933
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,720
We should be ashamed, man. We've learned
too many lessons and history will.

934
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,580
Okay. What's a macro eater? Macro eaters.

935
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,760
Is he talking about
like macaroni macaroni,

936
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,030
Saudi saying Matt girl like the fish.
I Dunno,

937
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,280
I've never heard that one before.

938
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:47,080
You learn something new on this show
every week. Just like macro you dog can't.

939
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,310
Yeah,
Mackerel.

940
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:53,440
It was a oh a macro what?
Linked off the fish, right?

941
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:58,150
It wasn't a sectarian slur
for Roman Catholics. Oh right.

942
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:02,890
Cause they eat fish on Fridays or,
oh, that's funny. That's hilarious.

943
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,900
What about Hungary? I'm fine. I'm a shit
hole country. Yeah. About Eastern Europe.

944
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,680
I know what other slurs, but
Slovakia or, or you know,

945
01:02:11,681 --> 01:02:13,930
whenever Ukraine,

946
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:19,110
Russia or we all shit hole my
anti anti sing Hungarian sediment.

947
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,550
Oh, let's see. Uh, it's
called Hungaria Phobia.

948
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:28,020
Anti Hungarian ism is
dislike, distrust, racism,

949
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:30,300
xenophobia directed
against the Hungarians.

950
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:34,260
It sounds like it could involve
hatred, grievance, distrust,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

951
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:38,200
blah. Do to Hungarian background.
I'm trying to see if there's any, uh,

952
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,920
yeah, no. Um,

953
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:48,050
Hongos I don't see any like list of
slurries and patriots in English.

954
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,750
Oh, a Bolo, honk, honk.

955
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,680
And he's a combination of
Bohemian and Hungarian. Cool.

956
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,690
And hunky derived from both hunk.
It's in the movie 16 candles.

957
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,310
It is long duck Dong says oily,
honk.

958
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:10,640
The Dad calls her fiance about
hunk. Hmm. Let me see if there's a,

959
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:16,480
yeah, so it was hunk here. Yeah. No. So
He's hung out. No, but I'm saying that's,

960
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,120
that's one of the, it's like the
slur. Oh, cool. You are a SPEC,

961
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:24,540
right? Pretty much through
and through. I mean, you're a,

962
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:29,310
you're a Christine, the bow hunk.
I think that's pretty accurate.

963
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,970
Yeah. I got called Polak a lot
growing up. Did you that makes sense.

964
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:36,660
So it's more common. Uh, yeah.

965
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,190
This here spic as defined here is
just a person of Hispanic descent.

966
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,353
Um,

967
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,030
theories include no speak English and
that's where SPEC comes from. Oh No,

968
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:49,260
SPEC speak English.

969
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,330
But as it believes that it's the
abbreviation of Hispanic and other ones.

970
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,840
Interesting. So, all right,
let's speak English. I no spic.

971
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,600
I no speak English.

972
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:05,430
Everybody says like that though every a
Taco head cause a Mexican person never

973
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:08,940
heard Taco this as that's from born on
the 4th of July. And that's where it was.

974
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,010
It's not real.
It's kind of a made up one.

975
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,510
Spics pretty good pics.
Pics big or spaghetti.

976
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,010
It sounds so mean though. SPEC
SPEC sounds harsh. Greaser,

977
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:24,090
isn't that a Greaser
greaser full metal jacket.

978
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:27,270
The see grease ball. But that's
an, that's an Italian, right?

979
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:31,380
I guess you could also have
Italian grease ball usually.

980
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:35,730
So what they say right? Tele in Greece.
Are you fucking me? Guinea grease ball.

981
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,170
Yeah. Yeah. Then that guy goes on, uh,

982
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,600
uh, Don Lemon, same guy. And he,

983
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:50,400
he puts these conversations that
this is economics. So let's be clear.

984
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:55,800
Phillip mud from Norway can come here,
but a black dude from Haiti can't.

985
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,900
What does that tell you in an America
that one in one generation called you a

986
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:05,790
nigger. What does that tell you?
Dot. Whoa. Big words. Very big words,

987
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,580
but he's just throwing,
throwing all of them out there.

988
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,780
I didn't know you were going to
go straight to that. Holy Shit.

989
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,310
I've got to kind of big words.
It's very fired

990
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,610
up this to tell you that. What?
That tells a honky like me,

991
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,480
we're no different than we were a
generation ago and we're learning the same

992
01:05:25,481 --> 01:05:29,020
lessons that we learned when we
call the Chinese man a slanted I,

993
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:34,350
when we called the man from Guatemala
spic and a wetback call a black man in the

994
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:39,580
Sam Hill. I think he likes to run through
his knowledge of that. Yeah. He's like,

995
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,700
I got good one guys.
Gimme a gimme a country gimme a gimme one.

996
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,770
That is kind of a real gift he's got,
that's what it tells me.

997
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,970
We got a ways to learn,

998
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:53,890
but we can step back and say we're proud
because I spoke this on CNN 30 to one

999
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:55,840
the emails I got were saying,

1000
01:05:55,930 --> 01:06:00,310
you speak for us and we are not from
Africa and we're not from Norway were from

1001
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:04,540
Italy, were from Ireland. Okay.
Wow. Well, are any Haitian,

1002
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:08,410
speaking of all the Chinese man
a slammed I, oh my God. God.

1003
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,060
When we call the man from Guatemala
spic and a wetback. Holy Cow.

1004
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:16,930
I got Ya. That's such a
beautiful region of the world.

1005
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,550
I don't think Trumpers has been
to a t I t Dominican Republic.

1006
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:25,300
That is a beautiful region. Conan.

check this out. Check it out,
check it out. Try it out.

1026
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:44,560
So there's a new wrapper
on the scene. Oh, okay.

1027
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,780
I'm from Australia.
I love Australia.

1028
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,590
And here's the thing,
is it a shit hole country that is not,

1029
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:56,740
it's definitely not a shit
hole country. Um, no, and,

1030
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:01,150
and our president will be glad to
accept them as Australians. Why is that?

1031
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:05,350
I don't know. It's weird.
Um, anyways, this rapper

1032
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:11,770
might have a cease and
desist headed his way. Oh,

1033
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:17,250
because guess what he's
using as his m c name,

1034
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:22,070
his artistic name? No, he is going by

1035
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,140
top dog.
No,

1036
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:32,730
stop stopping. I won't stop.
I make it pop. I'm make it
drop by. Hey, make it stuff.

1037
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,030
This is top dog.
He,

1038
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,370
he listen what you're bad to
hear cause I'm back for good.

1039
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,110
And you might even Hollywood,

1040
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:45,580
he needs a fan of the show. Must be
no. Must Be. It's not impossible.

1041
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,400
I mean, you heard those was presales or
good for Australia. That's interesting.

1042
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:54,790
This guy just out there
using the top dog's name.

1043
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:59,320
I like his rap some flows though. So far
the words of rhymed. Yeah. That's not bad.

1044
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:04,120
Cilla black to Umaine.
That's six feet tall.

1045
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:06,230
I'm at wall.
Yeah.

1046
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:10,360
Am and I don't care what
anyone says cause top dog is,

1047
01:09:10,361 --> 01:09:13,690
he said bring it cause suck.

1048
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,420
Can you guess what I'm fixated on?

1049
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,920
Just knowing me for 12 years
to married to a technique,

1050
01:09:21,921 --> 01:09:26,840
the way that he goes from the duck is
cadence kind of set himself up for the

1051
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:30,740
next line. No, no. Uh, facial hair.

1052
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,890
Um, just knowing me,
wait, let me, hold on,

1053
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:41,480
let me watch a little more
and I'll see if I can come

1054
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:46,970
really hard to watch. Not a snitch, man.

1055
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:50,230
Joe Beach. But baby, you know what I mean?

1056
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:53,670
I'm the craziest man you'll ever see.

1057
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:58,010
Yeah. Wow. That's um,
yeah, it's pretty good.

1058
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,800
It's pretty good. It's hard to,
it's in case you haven't guessed it.

1059
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,960
The teeth, you're rich. It's hard for us.

1060
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,810
I think you're a snitch
man. Joe Beach. But baby,

1061
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,640
you're not crazy

1062
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,250
walking down the street, walking down the
street, walking down the streets. Yeah.

1063
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,830
See I think our machines where they
guy just has a little more passion.

1064
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,860
I Dunno, this guy seems pretty
passionate. I just, I'm,

1065
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:33,890
this guy's got more technical ability but
our guys like I just feel it more for,

1066
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:38,940
I think again, you know what he's missing
is just a great producer as always.

1067
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:43,230
Can we get Jimmy Ivan [inaudible]
as I wasn't even on the phone. Yeah.

1068
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,570
Oh let's go get, let's go
down to Malibu. Find Him.

1069
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,090
Could be and get him to produce this guy.

1070
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,270
Cause I am

1071
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:55,840
fucking one day.
Definitely one day.

1072
01:10:56,230 --> 01:11:01,180
Slay the AK. Yeah, this
is my day. Get those days.

1073
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:06,490
Well, he definitely, I mean, he definitely
wrapped a lot. He raps. I mean, it's good.

1074
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,800
Again, it's so distracting the mouth.
I can't, I can't get past the team.

1075
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,223
There we go.

1076
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,160
Rocking shoes was

1077
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,280
walking down the street,
walking down the street.

1078
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:20,520
She had the worst day.

1079
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,140
Yeah. Yeah. That's good. So that
top, what were you fixated on?

1080
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:29,980
I got it. Teeth? Yeah. Oh,
I didn't think about that.

1081
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:32,920
They're really bad. Uh, I mean, yeah,

1082
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,190
but that could be part of the
hook of the like, you know,

1083
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:40,600
just be called Dj bad
mouth. Right. Dj Dad Mail.

1084
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:45,010
That was great.
That's really good.

1085
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,720
We should suggest that. Yeah.
I mean, that was terrible.

1086
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:54,470
Let's see. Here's the thing,
if you embrace it, it's
like you embrace, so yeah.

1087
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,890
What's The lady? She has kind of
crooked teeth. Which one? Uh, she's the,

1088
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,733
you know,

1089
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:08,350
talking about jewel. Jewel.
Oh yeah. Snaggletooth yeah.

1090
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:13,060
So there was a time years ago when
she was going to fix her teeth.

1091
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:17,050
Oh yeah, no, no. And her fan
base flipped out. No Way.

1092
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,260
Like Barbara Streisand's knows. Everyone
told her get a nose job. She was like,

1093
01:12:20,261 --> 01:12:24,690
no fucking way. And that people love it.
Just like me with my quadruple d tits,

1094
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:29,650
super slut, 15 d tits. Yeah. I
really, the more pregnant I become,

1095
01:12:29,651 --> 01:12:33,220
I've, the more I feel like dog, the
bounty hunters wife. It's not a good luck.

1096
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:37,210
I just feel like I look great. You look
great. But you know what I mean? The,

1097
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,050
the bigger they get, the bigger I
get. Yeah. You got a big Ole knockers,

1098
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:45,220
you're going to feed a whole bunch of
babies with those titties. Yeah. Yeah.

1099
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:49,710
You got, there you go. Oh my
God. We were watching dark. Aw,

1100
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,340
Jesus. Cry. I can't watch missing kids.
Do you? Okay. So if you haven't seen dark,

1101
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,640
it's on Netflix, Dork,
Dork. It's Dork sided,

1102
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:02,230
but it became, it's kind of been this
international, you know, sensation.

1103
01:13:02,231 --> 01:13:06,010
But I've heard a lot of people talking
about it. One thing I'm fascinated by,

1104
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,960
I've never seen this on Netflix or
really you don't see it that often. Uh,

1105
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:15,990
if you are watching programming at all
in the United States when a foreign show

1106
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,610
has dubbed as opposed to subtitles.
It's rare,

1107
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,550
but I have a theory on this.
My theory is this, well,

1108
01:13:24,551 --> 01:13:27,760
because they have a lot of
subtitled stuff. Yeah, like Netflix.

1109
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:29,950
It's not uncommon to see subtitles.

1110
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:33,160
I think my guests and I,
I wanna,

1111
01:13:33,161 --> 01:13:37,420
I wanna research and find out if this
is true that they dubbed as opposed to

1112
01:13:37,421 --> 01:13:42,421
subtitle because through
their own research found
that Americans didn't want to

1113
01:13:43,931 --> 01:13:46,480
listen to German.
It's a beautiful English.

1114
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:49,150
I think that's what I really didn't dairy,
I'm offended.

1115
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,780
I studied German and college is a
beautiful other because why would they?

1116
01:13:52,781 --> 01:13:56,380
Because there's a bunch of
shows with house in high school.

1117
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,790
Like why would they do that
if that's not the case?

1118
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:05,410
Why is narcos all in
Spanish and subtitled?

1119
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:11,110
I don't know. I mean, my guess
is narcos a biggest show as Dork.

1120
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:14,860
You want those? Is it
bigger than Dork? Oh yeah.

1121
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,170
I don't know, Dude. I mean it's
fucking great. I don't like it.

1122
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:24,970
It always reminds me of those KCLA morning
movies where they used to play Pippi

1123
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:28,600
Longstocking and then they dug her shit
over and I don't like going to lips not

1124
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:30,730
moving.
I don't like watching things not match up.

1125
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:35,590
I admit that or follow you
ended up being lost. I mean,

1126
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:40,240
but there's so many Latin, I mean so
many Latin people in the u s yeah,

1127
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,800
maybe we're just more used
to hearing set on the same.

1128
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,640
And I feel like Americans for
the most part are like what?

1129
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:51,040
Or maybe they found that people were
clicking off the show because it was

1130
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:53,950
subtitled and they're like,
no, this is such a good show.

1131
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:55,390
We need people to be watching.

1132
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:59,650
Actually the first time we tried watching
Dork at the subtitle feature wasn't

1133
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,320
working. Really? Yeah.

1134
01:15:01,321 --> 01:15:05,230
We tried watching it twice and they
just weren't coming up like it wasn't

1135
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:09,710
working at all. And it was all in
Houston. It was all inspections. The yeah.

1136
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:14,010
Yeah.
He should be nine Belinda shots.

1137
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:19,540
Shites well it's a bond.
You know, he really bad.

1138
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:24,520
Why don't we just wrap it up? Oh yeah,
try it out. Try it out. Piss on me,

1139

1147

Twitter and I've heard it before night,

1148
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:06,520
apparently looked like the girlfriend
in super girl and that felt out.

1149
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,740
It really does. I was like, oh my God.

1150
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:13,080
Did something for her mouth and her eyes.
Yeah.

1151
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,360
She's this expression similar face.
Plenty,

1152
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:19,270
but she's missing something else.
No tits.

1153
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,320
I do love that Gal Godot. Yeah, she's
sweet. You got to see wonder woman.

1154
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:25,510
It's so good. Yeah.
This girl's got hungry.

1155
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,240
Agreed to feed them.

1156
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,350
Take a spoon.

1157
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:48,290
All right. We gotta get going.
