1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,070
Well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,970
Christina Vincent.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,360
All right, here we are
here we farm. Here we go.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
Here's the thing.
You left that the other way

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,893
anymore

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,980
any more and just do it like we
always do. It wasn't so much to ask.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,550
Okay.

8
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,430
Anything else? Can you eat
your sandwich or something? No,

9
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,090
you can just do the minimum. Oh
my God, I did everything else.

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,420
I put in all of the things
I did the lighting. Okay.

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,250
Don't act like I don't do it all
good. I don't do it all. I do lots.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,620
You want to do it all?
Hello?

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,050
Do you have anything you want to point
out to our listeners? Know why? What?

14
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,710
What's the big deal? Well, you
said you, what's happening?

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,580
There's nothing going on.
You said you guys and messages.

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,820
I said that I read the comments on our
youtube channel and some people are

17
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:24,770
saying that I look pregnant and
you know, that's very rude. Um,

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,420
especially cause those
mother fuckers are right.

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,210
Number two.
Number two,

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,190
thug is incubating right now
as you call him. It's a boy.

21
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,330
It's a boy. It's a boy.
Number two. So yeah,

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,810
we're in second trimester and I had to
hide it this whole time and now you can

23
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:51,080
just let it out like, oh my
God. And there is so big,

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,080
my milkers are so big and
everything is so big right now.

25
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,030
You're trying to cover them up.
Pointless. I got lucky though because our

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,840
cars are,
um,

27
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,980
the holidays as when I had my first
trimester. I got pregnant in October,

28
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,370
so I got to be kind of sick and on the
downlow outside of all the cameras,

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,060
which was nice.
But then I couldn't hide it.

30
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:17,240
The last two weeks I've been wearing
sweatshirts. You have seen the comments.

31
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:21,740
I've seen him too. That's
up. Look pregnant. I know.
And with your second child,

32
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,000
apparently you show way quicker and I
was showing like at five weeks I felt fat

33
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,750
as shit already. So. Well,
it's exciting. Very exciting.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,470
Number over to [inaudible] number two,
two thugs in the house.

35
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:36,080
Now what are we going to name this
one? When are you thinking? Well,

36
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:40,340
we fucked up on the last one because we
were going to go with a Ruth's Chris.

37
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:44,630
Tom's Ruth's Chris.
Tom's Ruth's Chris and then called junior.

38
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,810
Well because I ate so much
of it. Yeah. With Ellis,

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,390
we should've named him Carl's junior.

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,390
Now this one I know was also
a fan of daily time daily.

41
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,050
I think that's a really good name
for it. The Sun. That's a good one.

42
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,010
But this baby I've really been craving.
So

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,980
I was thinking Domino's, Domino's
or domino. We're about thin crust.

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,100
Oh cause that's what I'm,
my jam right now is thing.

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,090
Crest domino. Thank crest extra
cheese and pepper. Tony's on there.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,050
The domino sounds kinda like a cool name.
Like it was no sub domino.

47
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,560
Our blanket. I like blanket
blanket blanket like Mike. Yeah,

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,120
nobody's named domino. That'd
be really original. Great Name.

49
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,480
But yeah,

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,260
Carl's Jr we're going to go and have his
name legally changed to Carl's Jr and

51
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,260
then this one we're going to do
dominant. I leg it. Well, uh,

52
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,730
there's a lot to cover.
Um,

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,230
we'll talk about all this stuff and
the naming of our second thug and more.

54
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,520
Let's get the show started and
let's keep it a fun, you know,

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,930
mean people's main concern. Obviously
when, when we had a kid last time,

56
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,010
they're like,
oh,

57
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,080
he's having a kid going to make you
squares or make you know, more fun.

58
00:03:56,081 --> 00:04:00,720
And Joey Diaz was very
worried that I might become a
woman. Don't become a woman,

59
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,380
become a woman. He said. So I hope
that never happened. That was my wife.

60
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:08,480
I hope you stay and not a woman.
Yeah.

61
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm gonna cut my hair off with this
one though. Here we go. Jane started.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,300
Let's get the party started.

63
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,803
Okay.

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,300
And I just wanted to share with all
of you why I felt the need to share me

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,040
placing menstrual blood all over my face
and what power it holds for us as women

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,620
earn these products that we've
been shaming for so many lifetimes,

67
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,100
period.

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Blood on the face to add a pretty raw,

69
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,550
pretty nasty people,
by the way. Thank you.

70
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:01,930
A lot of people have messaged me that
they watched my new special disgraceful on

71
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,000
Netflix over the weekend.
I've got,

72
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:09,001
I really received a between comments and
emails and the thousands of messages.

73
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,810
So I thank you all for them. Uh,
much love, no hate f all the haters,

74
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,450
but uh, it's been, well,
I still have no, hey,

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,220
overwhelming people telling me that
I'm nasty as hell. I'm the next champ.

76
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,410
Yeah, no, that's, there's no way.
You're the nasty champ. Yeah.

77
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,620
Oh
No,

78
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,880
no, no, no, no. Everybody was
telling me, they're like, it's funny.

79
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:37,320
You're nasty as hell. You still
grossed you nasty. Yes. Listen,

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,800
I've been nasty supreme of this household.
No Way.

81
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,280
You've even attacked me for
being so nasty. You're like,

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,510
you're telling me how nasty I am
with my farts and like how I'm just,

83
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:52,880
I talk and think. Just
disturbed to crave things. Yeah.

84
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,270
But that's at our home life. But on
stage I would say the, I'm the Nastier

85
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,770
and I'm way Nastier than,
but you're a woman, you know?

86
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,770
But that's why it makes more of an impact.

87
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm even nastier register as an impact,
but I'm definitely aware of the crowd.

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,390
You're the nasty champ. That's some
bull shit right there. True. No,

89
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,120
I am the nasty champ. Everybody asks you
in bed last night. Oh, you were like,

90
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,200
have you ever heard of this?

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,630
The scrum Gob Gobbler the chumps smuggler?
No.

92
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:28,580
What I asked you was, do you know,
do you know what a ball hog is? Yeah.

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,660
Okay. So it's a sports term. In sports,

94
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:37,661
if you play basketball or soccer and
somebody won't pass the ball there,

95
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,830
a ball hog, like they're hogging the
ball right there. They're not sharing,

96
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,530
they're not passing it around.
They're keeping it all to themselves.

97
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:50,531
So they're called a ball hog and I
found that term being exploited by a

98
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,654
different industry.

99
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,850
Hi.
And I'm Blah

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,300
[inaudible]

101
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,130
stupid.
How come that wasn't the opening class?

102
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,060
How'd you pass out or menstrual blood
lady? I wanted to save it for you.

103
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,870
She nasty, nasty champ, not us.

104
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,080
I love that they took, I love when
they take an innocent sport's term,

105
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,620
like your Bhag, share the ball.
They turned it into a vile,

106
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,430
perverted slang.

107
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,820
It's just such a, another silly porno
Yang, like there's no woman on the plant.

108
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:54,610
And really maybe there's like two fucking
freak shows out there and they're like,

109
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,610
I love balls. I got to have
them. I'm out. I'm a ball.

110
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,260
If this is such a fucking dumb fantasy,
it's such a not why. It's hilarious.

111
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,970
No,
and really does nobody know.

112
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,210
I love sucking on Fox

113
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,270
and they have a whole series.
Oh yeah.

114
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,520
Hi,
I'm Payton Lafferty Lafferty.

115
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,230
That sounds like a Peyton Manning,

116
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,520
so you have to like hate and last
day they have to say their name.

117
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:32,000
They have to say that they're a ball hog
and then they have to just suck balls

118
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,480
for like these whole things.
Dude, it is easy money.

119
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,710
There's a lot of funny ball talk,
you know?

120
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,050
Oh fuck.

121
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,900
Lot of vocal fry balls are funny though.
They're funny. The problem with balls,

122
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,170
there's a, there's a smell sometimes
if they're not clean enough,

123
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:52,720
but other than that balls
are pretty low maintenance.

124
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,890
Sniff, sniff. Okay. Now let me
put it right up against your eye.

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,993
Bat your eyelashes.

126
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,880
There's like five people on the planet
that really had this. They were like,

127
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:20,620
put your eyelashes against my balls.
Yeah, it's not a lot. Are you into that?

128
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,210
No, not really. I should
try it out. You know,

129
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,390
we got to put this one aside for
doctor drew the ball worship,

130
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,100
make it make a drew list. True. Um, me.

131
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,620
Oh, the trial. So my show,

132
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,960
I watch your show and I just get,

133
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,480
that's what drew basically told us.
This is the sad ever

134
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,960
piss on me. Beat me black guys.
Do you think you could ever be

135
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,163
girl

136
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,450
on the com? Yeah, he's got to rub his
balls on the, come down and give a shit.

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Here's the thing,
man.

138
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,180
Anything that doesn't involve
come on my face or getting an STD.

139
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,490
Nothing can happen from
putting big deal man. I mean,

140
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,310
what's the going rate for something
like, I mean not, not as, not as me now.

141
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,310
Oh as like a comedian and mother
of almost two children. Oh,

142
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,120
I've millions, millions but
light. It's going to ruin my life.

143
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,520
It's not possible.

144
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,280
You're short on that and I don't care
if my life is in the toilet for the rest

145
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:47,350
of it. The rest of it. Yeah. Like I
pushed the ball scene out of that.

146
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,820
Let's just say, yeah, like
20 years ago. I'm just, who
cares? I'm gonna ruin my life.

147
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah, let's just have one of
those girls. Like it's just,

148
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,400
it's never gonna happen for me.
Yeah.

149
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,720
I do a ball scene for like $1,500
that's not, that's not bad.

150
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,540
I think you're asking you for a little
much. I think they would probably be like,

151
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,580
get out of here.
That's you're not,

152
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,050
you're not doing it ruining my life for
1500 care about that part. They're like,

153
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,230
this is a ball scene. Just balls.
But here's what I would do.

154
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,390
Being the entrepreneur that I am,
I would,

155
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,770
I would open up my own website
and I would be the ball girl.

156
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,690
Oh, you know what I mean? I would,

157
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,980
I would make it and I do the eyelash on
the balls and I had to put my feet on

158
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:31,880
the balls. Like I'd be the ball
queen is how I would do it. You know,

159
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,710
I'd make a business out of it.
That's pretty good.

160
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:37,260
And I charge guys to come over and then
I'd smashed their balls or whatever.

161
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,390
Making House calls. That's extra money
though cause I've already ruined my life.

162
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:45,230
I'm the ball 80 for the rest of it. So
I really gotta yeah, I gotta try it out.

163
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,500
What would you do? Well now that
I want to be the entrepreneur,

164
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,010
I think like go back 20 years and I go uh,
if I could go back

165
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,000
in time and be like I don't want the
life that I have now I want to go down to

166
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:02,050
the CD path. Then I would start
my own site called a Gargle,

167
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:06,640
my balls.com and like you're thinking and
then I would be like into camera like,

168
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,690
hey it's me.

169
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,870
You know which one are you dumb hookers
out there with sucking my balls. So many.

170
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,450
And then some girl would
walk in and be like,

171
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,110
I would like sniff my balls.
Get your nose in there.

172
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,850
Yeah,
that's a different life

173
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,710
path. Right. As I was saying, if you
really want to throw it in the toilet,

174
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,410
but you got to think in terms
of branding and long term,

175
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,280
I think it's a good brand to get into.
I think so. It's a niche market. Yeah.

176
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,450
I think there's a lot
of people would be like,

177
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:42,780
it was pretty interesting lane here and
maybe there's some awards. I don't know.

178
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,450
It's not that bad. But the farting,
that's not bad either. The fart videos.

179
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:51,380
Easy money. Really. If all the genres, um,

180
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,030
the FARC videos the easiest.
Yeah. There's got to eat food.

181
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,840
Fucking dude fart all day.
Every day. That's right.

182
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,700
You didn't imagine being pregnant.
I do. The pregnant lady stuff.

183
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,660
Even better money.
That's when I really jack up the prices.

184
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,470
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of fun. Nope.

185
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,240
Seems like we have a fun new
lane to explore with the balls.

186
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,490
It's not bad. It's not
bad at all. Try it out.

187
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,270
Try it out. Try it out. Go have fun.

188
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:26,920
You'll trust first fun stuff out. So
back to period, blood on your face.

189
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,400
Um, what about this video?
Would you ever make that video?

190
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,530
Which video would you make? Um, which
one is more harmful to you? You think?

191
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,600
Oh fuck.
I mean it's you

192
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,880
20 cause it menstrual blood on it cause
I think that one would tell people it's

193
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:47,220
different signals you're sending.
One of them is like,

194
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I mean we haven't even seen this yet,
but she says I smear period of my, um,

195
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,000
I think that would tell people you're
mentally ill and then the ball one might

196
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,910
just be like, oh she's, she needed
money. She's desperate. She's sad.

197
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,620
Well it's the, would she rather,
it's the word you placed a shame.

198
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,790
It's the original.
What'd you rather,

199
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,570
would you rather masturbate in
front of your family or you,

200
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,220
am I going to assume responsibility
and be mentally ill or

201
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,100
I can't believe I'm thinking this,

202
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,940
but I think I'd rather there's a
ball video of you exist then period.

203
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,780
Blood because period blood on your face.
Yeah.

204
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,170
You can't really explain that one.
Explain it. There's no going back.

205
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,340
Let's hear her.
Explain it.

206
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,050
Three reclaiming the blood and through
reclaiming our menstrual cycle. Yeah,

207
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,720
fully allowed me to embody like everything
that I was fully allowed me to have

208
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:41,770
the freedom to be able to express
who I was in every way. This,

209
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,160
you know this thing about,
Oh hey, oh, Gilmartin's here.

210
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:50,060
This is not how this is supposed
to go. All right, let's stop.

211
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,003
All right,

212
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,720
so, uh, we re settled, um,

213
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,070
and you want to introduce our
guests with us? Is that fantastic?

214
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,020
Paul Gil Martin from the, uh, mental
illness. Happy Hour, Clara for Paul.

215
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,190
I mean, that's the how we do this. Well,
how do you do just awkward silence?

216
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,950
That's usually it is.
And then, and then, uh,

217
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,250
you guys have done each other's podcasts.
He's been a guest on that deep, Bro.

218
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,050
I've been a guest on
his show and I thought,

219
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,320
why not have them on your mom's house?
This is a perfect fit. It don't, you know,

220
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,180
I invited myself. No, no, not
true. Yes. I said, you know,
if you, if you ever need gas,

221
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,070
I'd love to do your podcast.
So No, I'm happy you're here.

222
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,390
I learned my lesson spending
last year alone on Christmas Eve,

223
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,650
Christmas and my birthday. You know,
want to be stubborn. BEACOPP yeah.

224
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,850
When you have needs speak up.

225
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,060
I think I've been stubborn about that
shit more times than I'd like to admit in

226
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,490
my life about like, nope,
I'll just stay here and,

227
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,260
and I'll just show everybody by staying
here. It's not saying what I want.

228
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,970
Right. Yeah. And I can't be
rejected. Yeah. And I get
to know my video game. Yeah,

229
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:02,750
exactly. Maybe I'll find a
new porn clip there. Hey,

230
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll get an APP and we have a,

231
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,770
we were just playing this porn clip called
ball hogs. Um, it's a familiar with it.

232
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,250
Um, well there's a, a line of, uh, I mean,

233
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:16,840
you're familiar with the term
ball hog in terms of sports. Yes.

234
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,710
Somebody who won't pass the ball.
Right.

235
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,280
So there's a series adult
series called ball hogs.

236
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,950
It sounds like this.
All right.

237
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,300
Hi,
I'm Sierra and I'm Bala.

238
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,790
Well, they just really like balls. Um,

239
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,970
here's something that you will
never hear about pornography.

240
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:44,720
Somebody watching it.
I wish the sound was more graphic.

241
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,990
Yeah. Yeah. More detailed, more
s, more smacking and drooling,

242
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,990
a lot shows up, pillows, balls.

243
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,270
We were talking about the ball clip and
then we switched to this woman who is,

244
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,740
um,
she was explaining how she's trying to,

245
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,620
what does it like recapture her family.
There's this whole thing about shame, uh,

246
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,990
in a, uh, when it comes to
women's menstrual cycles.

247
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,260
And so some women like to reclaim their
menstrual cycle and that's what she's

248
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,034
doing.
Yeah,

249
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,580
yeah.
Do it.

250
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,190
Reclaiming the blood through a private
link reclaiming our menstrual cycle.

251
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,260
It fully allowed me to embody
like everything that I was,

252
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:31,950
it fully allowed me to have the freedom
to be able to express who I was in every

253
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:32,540
way.

254
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,170
I gotta say one of the things I'm
happy about what she did and what she's

255
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,390
talking about is fucking gross, but it's
nice that she's attractive. It helps.

256
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,360
If it was like somebody gross doing
it, I'd be like, this is really nice.

257
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,090
That's a really shallow thing to say,
but it's actually really true. Yeah.

258
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,070
If she weren't hot,
we would

259
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,790
all be more like not watch all the clips.

260
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,650
We would stop and be like,
she's really gross. I,

261
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,920
I've only seen five
seconds with this cliff.

262
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:03,240
But the first thing that comes to my
mind is she's desperate for auditions.

263
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,480
I think she's one to go in.

264
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,680
Do you think supposed to be a
ball hog or like a real active?

265
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,260
All the boobs don't look natural.
No, no. Extremely made up for it.

266
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,630
So it's like if you're going to do
the whole menstrual blood thing,

267
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,210
why not not wear makeup?

268
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,180
You know why not be completely
stripped down completely as you,

269
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,170
I'm not saying be naked,

270
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:27,171
but be as you are completely right like
your vagina and match naturally for the

271
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,540
full,
the full effect.

272
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,990
That is a very interesting point
that she's doing like this.

273
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,420
I'm connected to who I am.

274
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,620
I couldn't be more done up and it looks
like fake boobs. I could be wrong.

275
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,210
I mean, Hey, wait a minute.

276
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,690
Isn't that why she needs to
reclaim her natural essence?

277
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,630
Maybe she is so disconnected because
of the fake blueberry and all this. No,

278
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,980
this is like a whole other level. I didn't
think we were going to get to, come on,

279
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,400
come on.
By putting these up on social media,

280
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:01,401
I really found it just kind of gave an
invitation to people to be able to know

281
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:05,620
that it's okay to share
this part of yourself. No,

282
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,270
that's not the message at all.

283
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,510
There are some things you
shouldn't share with social media.

284
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,990
One of them would be willing to face,
you know,

285
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,110
I'm a little ashamed of the
noises I make when I Shit,

286
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
but I dunno if I want to try to
ease the public into accepting that.

287
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,193
Well maybe,

288
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,300
but maybe what she's talking about here
is you taking that leap and knowing that

289
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,520
you know what you should be.
Okay.

290
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,240
And how about you posting one of those
videos of you taking a Grunty Shit? Yeah.

291
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,130
And, and, and kind of knowing that
it's okay. Paul, you're a person.

292
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,070
I love the word guarantee.
Why?

293
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,490
Why this insistence that everybody be
comfortable with everything publicly.

294
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,520
Now I don't show a little
bit of shame in your game.

295
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,770
Just a little a is fine.

296
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,870
I don't think a lot of us feel invisible
in our lives. Like something's missing.

297
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,760
Like there's something special about us
that isn't being recognized and we just

298
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,780
need to find what that is. And then
the emptiness will be filled. Yeah.

299
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,110
So her specialness is, or period
is what you're saying. Yeah,

300
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,740
and probably because nobody else
has done that. So it's like, oh,

301
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,490
like the episode I was listening to
where you guys were talking about possum

302
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,230
possum guy in purple lady
and Michael's arts and crafts.

303
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:29,700
Like the people that find their
identity through, yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:34,701
There's a lady at the coffee shop I go
to who is hat lady and her hats like,

305
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,680
like if it was this, it was the set
of a James Cameron movie, her hat,

306
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,450
you would go by, they put a little
too much effort into it. It's,

307
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,100
it's the most ornate crazy,

308
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,720
it's a nativity scene on,

309
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,310
on a person's head and each one's
different and God bless her, you know,

310
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:59,200
if that makes her happy to do that.
But I think it has the opposite effect.

311
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:03,660
When people look at it, they
go, oh, she's, yeah, yeah,

312
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,440
yeah. That's exactly it. Am I going to,

313
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,530
I guess we were having the discussion if,

314
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:12,870
if she had to choose between being
one of the ball hog girls, right.

315
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,100
Or the menstrual blood lady,
who would you rather be?

316
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,570
And I think it's like,

317
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,630
it's do you want to own being like crazy
kind of crazy or if you're the ball you

318
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,750
can be like, well they kind of did
it to me. You know what I mean?

319
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:30,060
Like I've been to,
and it was a money thing.

320
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:32,220
Maybe I did this for a living when I was,

321
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:34,800
cause I actually think that like
the ball Hogwan you'd be like,

322
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:35,850
you kind of have some empathy,

323
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:39,580
like she's probably in a bad place
and she needed some money. I'm like,

324
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,960
but I think it's almost better to be a
ball hog than crazy hat lady, you know,

325
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,990
is at least someone's jerking off to it,
jerking off their hat,

326
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:52,850
laying low and not a one guy in
Germany are always. Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,760
You know,

328
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,760
it's been really hard to face off with
all of the negative comments on me.

329
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,750
You know they were coming. They were
not asking anyone else to do this.

330
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm just saying this has
been my experience and it's
been really empowering and

331
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,870
it felt really good to
connect with that part of it.

332
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,760
Your you and your sister hood has really,

333
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,180
really challenges the definition
of empowering. Yep. Well,

334
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:21,480
I've always thought that the
yes, that Ha. First of all,

335
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:24,960
pornography is empowering.
Being a stripper is empowering,

336
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,580
rubbing menstrual blood on our face. Is
this empowering? You know what though?

337
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,460
What it boils down to is the
same strokes where everybody,

338
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,630
everybody likes the same thing.
That's all different.

339
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:40,320
Different strokes for for her it's
empowering. For me, I'm indifferent.

340
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,730
I don't have any negativity
towards menstrual blood. I
don't have any preference.

341
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:47,870
Do you think 20 years from now she's
going to look at this clip and roll,

342
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,690
roll her eyes or be like, yeah,
I'm glad I did that. I mean,

343
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:55,110
any healthy person rolls their eyes and
what they did 20 years ago. I hope so.

344
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,300
Anybody who's making progress 20 years is,
yeah,

345
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,760
that's a lifetime. That's a
long time. Let's see it. Are
we going to see her face,

346
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:03,594
right?

347
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,580
Oh yeah.

348
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,350
Hmm. Wow. There you go. You know,
Paul, now you said the actress thing.

349
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,540
I feel like this was kind of an actory.
I don't think there's any doubt. Yeah.

350
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,730
I don't think there's any doubt. Do you
think there's any frustrated actress?

351
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,460
Yeah, you're right. You
think there's any right?

352
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,270
That's like fucking James Cameron
will see this. Yes. Oh yeah.

353
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,340
That's like, you get like lost in the
delusion of, Oh, I, I, I experienced that.

354
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,980
I want it on an audition. One time
it was for a Steven Soderbergh movie.

355
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,100
Jerked off all over the road.

356
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,100
I had the decency to do

357
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,240
it in the parking garage, go to the
roof parking where nobody is. And uh,

358
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,620
I went on and I never get auditions.
And it's like,

359
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,220
all of a sudden it's just Steven
Soderbergh movie I'm auditioning for.

360
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,360
So I'm super excited and,
uh,

361
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,260
I do this a republican character,
uh, sometimes for, for comedy.

362
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,070
And I thought, oh, this guy's
perfect for this audition, this,

363
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,970
this part is perfect for
this, this guy. And I'm like,

364
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,580
there's nobody more perfect for this part.

365
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,060
I'm going to get this and
it's Steven Soderbergh.

366
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,980
It's probably going to be an award
winning movie. That part's going to be,

367
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,050
I'm probably going to get an award
for this and then I'm tripping.

368
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,340
Imagining my,
not only me giving an award speech,

369
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,790
but me arguing with people the next
day who I forgot to include in my speed

370
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,280
while I'm waiting to go in on the
fucking audition and I go in and I'm a

371
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:47,170
horrible, horrible, I didn't
even get a call back back.

372
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,560
I feel so good.

373
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,910
I know that I'm not alone because I've
had like I've had those same fantasies

374
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:59,800
and like have thought about like what
I wear a Tux or would I wear a suit

375
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,700
and like take myself through the
whole thing. Absolutely. And then you,

376
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,630
then you get the call.
Like the actually they,

377
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,710
they didn't even say
anything about your audition.

378
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,420
They didn't even acknowledge
that you auditioned.

379
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,220
We tried to find out and they don't
remember who you are and I'm like, oh no.

380
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,220
That moment you had,

381
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,820
for those of you I've never heard of Paul
Gil Martin or the mental illness happy

382
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:22,250
hour.
That's basically like what your show is,

383
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:25,940
is having these moments of
being painfully honest and, yes.

384
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,570
And I should have mentioned,
sorry earlier. Uh, you're
also stand up comedian.

385
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,410
You been on television a million things.
That is it dinner and a movie.

386
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,090
That was the thing that probably most
people know me from a new comedy central

387
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:42,950
half hour and stuff like that, but I don't
do and Chris stand up anymore. Um, yes.

388
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:45,770
When I'm not doing anything,

389
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:49,460
I'm at the Christian science
reading room and I laid off,

390
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,230
I read through a monocle.
Wow.

391
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:57,260
I want to clash it up.
Yeah. Yeah. The old school,

392
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,690
I liked what you don't do
stand up anymore. I don't,

393
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,050
I just do this a satirical
republican character sometimes,

394
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,830
but as far as going to clubs and doing
that now I bought five years ago,

395
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,880
I just kind of hit a wall and when I
have an agreement with the entertainment

396
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,200
industry,
uh,

397
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,450
they won't show an interest in me
and I won't show an interest in that.

398
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,470
We both kept our under the bark.
Uh,

399
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,040
do you get to perform the character,
the Republican character?

400
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:26,780
I'm like on live stages
and yeah, go on. Uh,

401
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,070
Carolla's podcast. Oh by,
uh, do it on Jimmy Doors. Uh,

402
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,000
Jimmy Dore Does live shows.
Um, so I do with there,

403
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,450
there's some youtube clips. I put a fake
campaign ad out about, I don't know,

404
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,160
10 years ago as a guy, but it's really
fun to do because it's kind of like my,

405
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,110
my picket sign of when I get
pissed off about shit. Oh yeah,

406
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,851
there are a hypocrite.

407
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:52,900
So I just pour it all into this kind
of clueless character. That's fine.

408
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,570
Who is a hypocrite. Yes. It must be.

409
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,660
You must be really like searching
for material these days.

410
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,120
Not really allowed to talk about, oh my
God, it's, it's, it can be overwhelming.

411
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,790
I guess. It's funny because when
I started doing the character,

412
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:10,480
it was almost cartoony and now
it reality has caught up to it.

413
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,910
Yeah. So it's really just rearranging
the reality into a punchline, right?

414
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,610
Cause I guess you could see the character
down and be like, yeah, I believe that.

415
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,970
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where's
he representative? Actually,

416
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:25,560
a lot of times when I do it, people
don't know. It's not a real character.

417
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:29,220
Do you get people to get angry at you?
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Cause his,

418
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:33,140
his views are like, you know, one
of the things he says is, is uh,

419
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,780
Mexicans make two things, tortillas in
trouble. No, that's fantastic. Yeah. It's,

420
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:42,170
it's, it's, yeah. Know my favorite thing
about like those guys in real life is,

421
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,210
and that's why that line works so well
is like a fifth grade level vocabulary,

422
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,330
which they did this thing during like the,
the uh,

423
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,780
the campaigns like leading
up to the election and they
actually found that like,

424
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:54,970
uh,

425
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,580
they studied all these interviews and
speeches that Trump did and found that he

426
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:00,060
had like,

427
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,800
he stayed in like a third to fifth
grade level vocabulary easily.

428
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,060
And that actually, that, that had
a huge impact. He's one of us,

429
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:13,260
he would say things like, things
are bad things or sad, awful.

430
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,370
This is just terrible.

431
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,450
And it never would leave that range
of kind of simplistic language.

432
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,960
I thought it was really fascinating
language study. Even though he said,

433
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,740
I have the best words, I have the
best words. And I'm like really smart.

434
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,240
Really smart. Really smart. I'm
like genius, right? Pretty much. Um,

435
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,430
you were asking me last week how,
um,

436
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,370
how people in Star Wars Yeah.
Communicate with like the monsters,

437
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:45,410
you know, like the bookies
and watch the star wars films.

438
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,790
You'll notice that Chewbacca and
uh, our R Two d two, it's always,

439
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,020
and then the actors like what's that
are too? You want dinner? He's like,

440
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,530
well you want a hot dog? Apparently
this guy has like a, like Kentucky,

441
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,583
oh Jesus.

442
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,600
Many people have asked me to do my
Chewbacca or am I walking impersonation?

443
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,430
And by that I mean my mother language
and found out it's actually three

444
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:16,330
languages. It's not, it's not
just a bunch of sounds and

445
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,060
whatever.
And I went back to Wikipedia,

446
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:26,540
found the language does, I'm going
to use, which is called true to work.

447
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,700
It's a, the called the common
language of the Wiki people.

448
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,290
It's actually for trade and travel.

449
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,030
It's the one that most non wookey's
would have used in the stories.

450
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,890
This is one of the most disturbing
levels of fandom is when they going like,

451
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,130
this

452
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,040
is real. You know how these people
in this world and you're like,

453
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,650
that's a made up world bro. But like not
like, he's like, well I'm more than the,

454
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,420
some of the natives prefer to address it
this way. You're like, it's all made up,

455
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,810
man. We talking about PDS. How Wikipedia,

456
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,450
without further ado,

457
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,270
hello, how are you? Goodbye.

458
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,460
I will. Thank you. Was

459
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,700
not just making Sam a friend.
So I don't know.

460
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,450
I love that somebody
gets so into something.

461
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,020
It's just so hard to take it
seriously when it's so niche.

462
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,500
Cause I think all of us,
maybe I should just include myself,

463
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,510
find something I like and get,

464
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,030
we were kind of talking about this
before we start recording and get

465
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:36,860
ridiculously into it. Like
when I discovered we get
obsessed, oh, when I, when I,

466
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,090
uh, discovered good wine
for the first time. I mean,

467
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:44,240
I'd been a drinker all along. I'm sober
now, but I've been a drinker all along.

468
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:47,210
But I had always thought, oh wine, you
know, that's for pussies. You know,

469
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,690
what's the big deal? And I was
buying a, a friend of mine,

470
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:54,110
a bottle of wine because he loved
wine. And I said to the, to the clerk,

471
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:59,170
you know what if I give you 50 bucks
for a bottle of wine that you think is

472
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,220
awesome, uh, I'd, I'd like to try that.

473
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,520
And so I took it home and it
blew my fucking mind really.

474
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,740
And within three months,

475
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,680
I had 24 cases,

476
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,740
a vintage wine in a rented
humidity controlled storage
locker and was searching

477
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,400
for wine every day on the Internet.
You've got obsessed, dude.

478
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,260
I thought you were about to say I was
25 grand in debt. That too. That too.

479
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,270
Hey, sorry to interrupt,
but can I move this?

480
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:37,250
Cause I can tell that it's blocking
my face. What was that? Oh,

481
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,440
now can you be, is he
cool? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

482
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,980
Just for editing because
I can see you perfect it.

483
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,350
And it's that way with everything that,
that I get into this,

484
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:52,130
I run the wheels off it.
When I got into photography,

485
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,460
taking pictures of dogs,
photography,

486
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,440
especially if it's pictures of
dogs is photography within the,

487
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,630
within the first year of having that
camera, I took so many pictures,

488
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,560
the counter rolled over,
which means over 10,000 pictures.

489
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,420
So I you have a real obsessive,
totally, totally obsessive. Yeah.

490
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,840
I've never,
I've never done anything in moderation.

491
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,650
Is that alcoholism? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

492
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,060
It presents itself in many
forms and junkies. Oh,

493
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:29,540
you mean alcoholics? Like it's
the similar, yeah, it's all,

494
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:31,330
it doesn't really matter
what the substance is.

495
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,870
It's the trying to distract yourself from
the discomfort of being in your skin.

496
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,010
So how long, wait, how long have
you been sober? For? 14 years.

497
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,250
So that's a long time.
Congratulations. Um, is there,

498
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,020
was there something that you
took to immediately after
like your sobriety began?

499
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:51,440
In other words, like some people, as
soon as they go sober, they're like,

500
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,810
I really got to get into this working.

501
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Within six months I had a
full on cabinet shop and my,

502
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,090
now that paid dividends because I know
how to make furniture fucking really?

503
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,030
Oh yeah. I could show you pictures.
I make mid century modern. Yeah.

504
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,310
And I still do that,
but I'm not obsessive about it.

505
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,820
But it was to the point where I
would be at dinner with my wife now,

506
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:21,821
my ex wife and she would be
saying something to me and
I would be half listening

507
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,170
and the other half of me would be saying,
oh,

508
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,710
what kind of joints should
I do it dovetail joint on
that thing or what kind of

509
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:28,550
wood should I use?

510
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:32,840
And I know now looking back cause I'm
not as obsessive about things that it was

511
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:37,370
a way of me distracting myself from
shit I'd buried as a, as a kid,

512
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,520
but it everything do you have that weren't
day kind of upset or many upsets are

513
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:47,150
really not really, which is
nice. Yeah. It's nice. Myself,

514
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,450
I guess that's my current day obsession.
That's good.

515
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,330
Or will be till the day I die.
Yeah.

516
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,360
I mean I think what a lot of people
at least hear about or some of us know

517
00:33:56,361 --> 00:34:01,361
people that go sober and some of them
get really into fitness and exercise or

518
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:07,450
food. Yeah. Uh, which is
the opposite first. Uh,

519
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,890
the first probably three
months of my sobriety,

520
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:14,690
I was doing a nine shots of espresso
a day. Oh my God, man. You know,

521
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,780
uh,
one guy who does he,

522
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:22,580
I think he does double
that a day over ice.

523
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,910
Um, no, I do, I do a lot.

524
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:30,230
But now this dude does just straight up
espresso on ice when he pitches just,

525
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,460
just the bean come out and like he,
he ended those,

526
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:38,030
the hardcore workouts and
he does a lots of candy.

527
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,660
Candy, sugar, sugar rushes. Yeah.

528
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,130
I'm just coming off a one
year Ben and Jerry's bender.

529
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:51,260
What was your flavor? A American
dream. What's in that? It's so perfect.

530
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,650
It's vanilla ice cream, but like
really, really good vanilla ice cream.

531
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,390
And then fudge covered,
uh,

532
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,790
chunks of waffle cone fuck
and caramel swirled in,

533
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,550
in every once in a while you'll hit a,

534
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,940
a caramel deposit that it seems like the
Ben and Jerry worker had nodded off at

535
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:17,810
the Carmel Lever, you know,
and it's just like, oh my God,

536
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,320
I can't go to bed now. I got to
see where this fucking thing ends.

537
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,740
So real danger for me is ice cream.
Really dangerous.

538
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,450
I've got some over the holidays where it,

539
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:30,110
cause we don't normally have it and
like what do you like? I'm pretty,

540
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm pretty much a purist,

541
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:35,660
pretty simple with I like vanilla ice
cream with chocolate chip and not mint

542
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:38,160
chocolate chip, just regular
truck, mint flavored.

543
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,500
Anything like one of those where you can
taste like vanilla bean really tight.

544
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,770
And then like the offset with
like that crunchy chocolate.

545
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,130
It's all about the texture
man. And then I also, uh,

546
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,350
I love that there's
multiple versions of this,

547
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:57,351
but all the different cookies and cream
ones I can like I can get a pint of that

548
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,970
and within minutes being like,
oh,

549
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:04,830
I can see the bottom of the pipe right
now cause I get zoned out and be like, um,

550
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,310
I'm like,
I feel sick to my stomach and that stop.

551
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,150
And then the ice cream
farts two hours later.

552
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,860
Those are a whole lever, uh, level of,

553
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,520
of sulfur that like the other, it's,
they're hot, they come out almost hot.

554
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,390
But my stomach will start hurting
and I'll get gas under my ribs.

555
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,240
And I found that I'm lactose intolerant
and you know what, then that's ancient.

556
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,090
By the way. You don't get gas,
you don't know it's party get gas,

557
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,260
but it goes under my ribs hurt. That's
the fucking worst pain. I feel like the,

558
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,780
the bullshit though is because I tried
for a while when I was buying it more is

559
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:44,310
like s like,
you know soy ice cream garbage man.

560
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,770
What's the point? All, all the knock off.

561
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:50,960
Like this isn't real ice cream is dog
shit. Yeah. You gotta have realized,

562
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,440
how do you feel about frozen younger guys?
I mean I'll fucking eat it, you know,

563
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,360
but I always feel like I wish I
had ice cream right now. You know,

564
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,240
kind of like it cause I liked the
shittiness of it. I liked, you know what?

565
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,370
I like Mcdonald's Sundays,
they're fucking great.

566
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,750
There are hot fudge Sundaes are
fucking great. Tastes like ice cream.

567
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,810
Mcflurries remember we know a guy
who was so such that he would get two

568
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:21,411
different McFlurries because he doesn't
want to mix the tastes of who hurt him.

569
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,290
His monitor his daddy.
He was hurt by his daddy.

570
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:29,820
I think he had a really weird
relationship with his mommy finding out.

571
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:32,940
A lot of people did. Yeah,
he went to podcast. Yep.

572
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,860
Fucking depressed when, when? When I
weapons spoken to him in a long time.

573
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:42,240
But man, when he went down this,
this kind of depression cycle,

574
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,270
he went down the food and I remember
there was drinking a fucking two leader,

575
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,730
like was sitting with
sugar, uh, a Pepsi Max,

576
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,470
which is like they're, they're amped
up Pepsi, Pepsi Max. He was doing,

577
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,690
he would get a six pack of Cinnabons.
Yes. How was he not a diabetic?

578
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,230
He became a diabetic. Yeah. Through it.
Well, he reached his goal. He would eat.

579
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,840
So of the six he would
eat one, two, three,

580
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,900
four and the inside of five and then
so he would have one and a half left to

581
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,750
tell himself that he has control
thing.

582
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,790
It was fucking nuts man. Wow.
And as you still learn it? No,

583
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,380
he's out of it now. It was, but
he was, I've been in that vortex.

584
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,450
It's, yeah, it was bad.

585
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:35,451
Your brain is saying one thing and
your body is just going fuck off off.

586
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,210
To see someone

587
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,940
in that and not know what's going on is
like really alarming because I think all

588
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:45,250
of us were like, what the fuck are
you doing? Right? Yeah. You know

589
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,300
that's bad.
That's real deep though.

590
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:52,330
What's the longest time you've
ever spent looking for a porn clip?

591
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,850
Not a specific one,

592
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:59,240
but you know that when you're looking
at porn and you're not just like,

593
00:38:59,241 --> 00:38:59,541
all right,

594
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,390
I'm just going to look at this and I'm
going to jerk off and get the anxiety out

595
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:06,320
or whatever,
but you're like the hunt for the clip.

596
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,210
The Jam you're getting,

597
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,110
you're getting high off than just the
anticipation of this is going to get real

598
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:17,060
dark real quick for me.
Not Long, long time.

599
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,350
Five, six hours probably for me. I've
done that five or six hours you guys.

600
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,410
Oh yeah. I've gone without
eating. I lost weight one time.

601
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:26,820
I want it on such a porn porn vantage.

602
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,430
It was shortly after I
got out of my marriage.

603
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,870
Just didn't want to feel.
This is so embarrassing.

604
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,670
But I moved when I had lived alone.

605
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,770
It was like a year after I moved out
here and I would go down those like long

606
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:43,070
rabbit hole foreign searches
and I remember one time I
got a phone call from one

607
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:48,621
of my aunts and I stayed on the phone
with her as I look through clothes for

608
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,070
shoes but not masturbating,
just like perusing,

609
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,650
realizing that I was so in the zone,

610
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,940
like zoned out that I
was like, yeah, no, yeah,

611
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,080
we would be good to see you.

612
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:05,520
And then I would keep clicking through
stuff and seeing and they're like, no, no.

613
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,140
Did you have the decency to switch
to incest porn? No. No. I wanted to,

614
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,330
I wanted to stay true to
what I was into at the time,

615
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:16,060
but it was fucking how half assed or
those answers when you're oh yeah,

616
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,990
that's the thing is what, just like
a roll out of it. That was that.

617
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,400
I could tell her voice like the way
she was answering me, it was like,

618
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,240
what are you doing? Right? Like what you
what? I mean, she was like, uh Huh. Like,

619
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,920
okay.
Like

620
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,960
she could tell that I
wasn't paying attention.

621
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,970
You can tell when someone is not paying
and that's when I was laying attention.

622
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,931
I was like, no, I know.

623
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:38,110
It was times on the road when I call
you when you were like, ah, yeah, no,

624
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,180
you're doing your porn sir.

625
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,110
No, it's usually sports.
What are your sports?

626
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,230
I'm just a big football fan. I like
you used to play right? No, no.

627
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,930
I mean I played high
school football but okay.

628
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,780
But I mean I like college football and
I'll watch highlights and I'd be like, oh,

629
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:55,160
that's crazy. And, but I don't know.
I get, I get sucked into that but not,

630
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,660
I don't get like zoned out by that.
Really.

631
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,150
I use map my TV I liked, I like
my TV yell, mom likes her shows.

632
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:05,030
I go down rabbit holes
of shows like benchings.

633
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,370
There's like two categories.

634
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:11,520
There's the one that that released
the drugs in your brain. Yeah.

635
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,910
And then there's the ones that are just
kind of interesting to you. Like, yeah,

636
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,290
that's when I tried to like um,
like vintage hockey fights.

637
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,030
I like those but I don't like get
high. Right, right, right, right.

638
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,980
But like porn, I will just feel like
dopamine they ended is just like,

639
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,240
yes, let's keep going. Yeah.
Your reptilian brain food.

640
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,890
That's true foods.
Avast

641
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,310
I got to slow it down cause I'm
preggers right now I'm going went down.

642
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,040
We'll know because I've already gained
too much weight for the pregnancy.

643
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:44,550
Like I got, I got a talking to
from the doctor already so. Wow.

644
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,441
Well cause I was eating,

645
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:48,800
I was doing Domino's pizza for like
the first trimester because your son,

646
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,540
you're nauseous so you
don't really want to eat.

647
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,140
So when you do want to eat it's going
to be crap just because like your body

648
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,700
wants carbs. The baby ones, carbs.

649
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,090
So I was like waffles a cheeseburger
is at midnight and then yeah,

650
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,220
just,
it's already packed.

651
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,860
It's what I feel like I've got to
reign it in kind of a shameful speech.

652
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:12,410
She was like, so we're not going to
do that again, are we? I was like,

653
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,770
Oh shit, I better go eat some
vegetables as her husband.

654
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,200
Where do you do on the sidelines if you
see her starting to go over the edge

655
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:22,580
because there's a fine line there.

656
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:26,300
It looks like you don't
want to be controlling or
insulting or feel like you're

657
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:30,790
objectifying. Not, that
is fine. I think that's,

658
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,430
I think most, I mean, unless I saw her
something doing like destructively eating,

659
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:38,160
I was, yeah, I'm just like, whatever you
want and just totally cool with me. Well,

660
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,720
I think I ran it into,
and I know you're not out of control.

661
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,870
That's what I'm saying. But like,
yeah, I mean when, I don't know,

662
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:48,200
anytime I've been around any pregnant
woman who's like, I got to eat.

663
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:52,940
I'm just like, all right. Yeah,
that's the, that's the go flag.

664
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:56,240
That's the green flag or whatever.
They do. No real argument against that.

665
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,500
But I gained a lot of weight.

666
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,240
I gained weight too much because I
was eating Carl's Jr twice a week.

667
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:06,950
The best was his, his um, his
sheep or like how you should eat,

668
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,810
how he eats because he
was like a very like thin,

669
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,760
you know you could tell like type it in
control guy and it was like have four

670
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,480
almonds have this thing
literally for Asparagus,

671
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,190
fuck to medium size. I read it.
I was like this is what he eats.

672
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,790
This dude eats this and he's just
like this is what you should eat.

673
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,650
And then once a week he sees a
dominatrix to let go of all this.

674
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,960
Yes. Those are the guys that
go to the dominate tricks.

675
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,260
Oh and he goes at the bottom of the sheet,

676
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,890
it's like once a week you can splurge
and have two ounces of ice cream.

677
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,350
What is two ounces?
The two licks I do,

678
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:49,400
I look at somebody like that and they
might as well be from another planet.

679
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,990
Like I used to look at people that would
only finish half a beer and I would

680
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:57,260
just think what is that like?
Yeah. It's like how do you do,

681
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:58,520
what is your native language?

682
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,733
Wow

683
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,920
Sake. I think Meyer has been
pulled out of the socket.

684
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,833
No.

685
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,630
Why did you pick out someone?
One fourth year size.

686
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,160
So this guy would be the kind of guy
that is from another planet and I think

687
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:20,220
here he actually shifts
to another language.

688
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,950
Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr
Rawr Rawr Rawr Rawr.

689
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,540
Approximately. He says he's a Jedi Knight
now for those who didn't follow it,

690
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:31,800
I'll do it in motion now.

691
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,520
I can't take it man.
Can't take it either.

692
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,970
But that dude really thinks
he's teaching Tom Stand.

693
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,930
How much money for you to learn Chewbacca
language? And I mean learn it fluently.

694
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,110
Like I know you're doing
Rosetta stone for Italian.

695
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,970
You're doing Rosetta stone for wookie.
It,

696
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:52,750
it would seriously be a lot more than I
got from Netflix to do a special and a

697
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,640
lot more. And you have a test every
week and you have to be fluent.

698
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,260
It's several million dollars.
Why? Why Italian? Why?

699
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,800
Well, I speak Spanish and um, you know,

700
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,230
I had an interest in
learning French and what I,

701
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:11,280
what I discovered was Italian is so much
easier for me because it gets close to

702
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:15,490
Spanish. Like all the pronunciations
are pretty similar. Yeah. Um,

703
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,010
and so far like I'm flying through it,
whereas when I did the French,

704
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:24,120
when I was like, fuck, I kept like,
I just kept hitting walls and like,

705
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,660
so I'm doing it because I want to do
something to stimulate that part of my

706
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:32,220
brain, but I don't want to too big
of a challenge. So, and with Italian,

707
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,800
the one thing that sucks, I feel
like there's more utility in French.

708
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,530
There's definitely more places you
can use it. And definitely more pussy,

709
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,820
more and more posts. Number one,
Paul De. Yeah. I mean I have like,

710
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:43,230
what are we going to do
another couple of years,

711
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:47,610
so I know I'm going to have
some fun soon. Um, but yeah,

712
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,680
I'm still, I'm doing the Italian just
because the very least the AU pair. Yeah.

713
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,400
You know, if you, if you don't have enough
frequent flyer miles to go to Paris,

714
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,420
just get a free childcare. Do you work
on your fuck with other languages?

715
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,870
Do you ever like, uh, we taped when
I was doing dinner and a movie,

716
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:08,871
we tape 10 days in Italy and so I did
like a crash course and so I learned,

717
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:14,250
you know, just a spoon. The Bolt Tailgate,
they act mineraly parrot, fab order.

718
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,660
There you go. Pull native apps,
things like that. Like five,

719
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,970
like five sentences.
But people soap,

720
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:25,971
appreciate it when an American takes
the time to learn their language because

721
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:30,660
most Americans just come in there with a
sense of entitlement and are just dicks.

722
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,970
And so it's like, oh, okay. They
recognize that we are fucking country.

723
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,821
Yeah,

724
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:40,170
just learn like people learn a couple
of basics I think anywhere you go it's

725
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,770
like, just learn how to say like,
excuse me, thank you, please.

726
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,950
For even for like a basic trip.
It's like, it goes a long way.

727
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:52,250
Or like I'll never forget being in
Paris and I'm having lunch and a nice

728
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:57,870
restaurant with some other students.
We were, we were actually in Madrid,

729
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:01,590
but we went over to Paris for a couple
days and we're sitting in this restaurant

730
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,680
and the server comes up and one of
the girls who's American turns them,

731
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,260
she goes English, right.
And I was like, you.

732
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,380
And then everybody at the table was
like head down and the guy was like,

733
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,850
yes I do.
I just speak English.

734
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,750
But he even saw from our looks how
embarrassed we were. I was like,

735
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:23,250
why don't you just say I can't you learn
to say, excuse me. Do you speak English?

736
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:28,050
Or like I don't, I don't speak French,
but no, she had to go English. Right.

737
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,830
Um, he was like, yeah.

738
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:35,140
And also like I've dealt with your type.
Oh yes. Yeah. When I go to Hungary,

739
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,980
I'm not very good Hungarian unless I'm
there for like a month and then all kind

740
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,750
of maybe pick up a little
whatever. Uh, but own thing. Yes.

741
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,400
But, um, they're so rude
over there. That Hungarian,

742
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,263
Oh my God.

743
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,550
That's why I barely try because like I
remember last time I went there like in

744
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:58,390
[inaudible] 99 or something
or on a 2004 or whatever.

745
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,540
I was like trying to order and he kept
correcting my pronunciation and grammar,

746
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:08,480
but like in a cock sucker where
I, um, I should find via, I,

747
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:13,030
I should find these Ganache I guy. So he
would try to wow. And I was like, Bro,

748
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:16,900
I'm trying like, you know what I'm
fucking saying liquor. Like, you know,

749
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:22,120
you're so upset about it. I'm so upset.
Did you call Him Dracula? I wasn't.

750
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:27,490
Not Romanian maybe. Oh, okay.
Yeah, but neighbor, same thing.

751
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,740
Same Shit. Different
toilet. The cousins, um,

752
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,910
got a store email here when men poop.

753
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,750
Do they holder Harry Dick
and balls in their hand push.

754
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,410
They're soggy dig down into the
toilet and Cayston pee comes out.

755
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,750
What of the Dick is so
long and touches the water?

756
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:47,650
I learned this from my husband. He
goes all in. Love you mommy. Tina.

757
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:49,690
Thank you Jean for choosing
my husband and the audience.

758
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:53,420
Friday to say his body was dog shit.
Oh, this must have been at your show.

759
00:48:53,421 --> 00:48:57,130
I remember him. I remember them.
Delightful couple. Very enthusiastic.

760
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,420
If we hold our dick and balls
in our hands when we shit, no,

761
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:05,530
we push it down obviously in this,
push it down.

762
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,380
Push it down in between your legs.
Here's the seat rim.

763
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:13,210
You Push it against their pee
down. Yeah. I never knew that.

764
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:15,940
Otherwise you get pee on the toilet seat.

765
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,770
You think it would hang out the outside
of the toilet or just maybe just dangled

766
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,330
wherever it wanted.
I didn't fight him,

767
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,190
but think it either has to be in
the bowl or outside the bowl. Okay,

768
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,970
but here's my thing.
If you push it in the bowl,

769
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,570
what if it rubs against the inner rim
and touch his Poo and pee? No. No.

770
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:34,240
There's no poo up there in
the front. It took. It's fun.

771
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:38,590
Our toilet there is in the front. Someone
takes explosive dumps in that twilight,

772
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:42,910
but it does do touch the porcelain.
It's kind of gross when you're in public.

773
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,180
That's what I was going to restaurants.

774
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,570
I'll lay a tissue down just for my own
peace of mind because you're touching the

775
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:53,410
porcelain. Yeah, but I mean, yeah,
it's just how it is. It's gross.

776
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,770
But then your painter gets other
people's pee and stuff on it.

777
00:49:56,771 --> 00:50:01,530
Probably Mike doesn't hang low enough.
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I've,

778
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,060
I liked that. She was like, what
if it touches the water? It's like,

779
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,060
do you know what kind of hang you're
talking about right now? That water,

780
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,050
it's not like, right. They asked for it.

781
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,770
I would gladly be able to
have that problem. You know,

782
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,060
male comics are always joking
about when they get older,

783
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:19,300
their ball sack and they can
touch the water. Does that happen?

784
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,560
I've looked some guys.
Yeah.

785
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,150
And you sit on enough toilets
where there's also weird,
um, mechanisms for toilet.

786
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,380
Sometimes you'll sit on a toilet,

787
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,570
you hit flush and it has like water
comes up and then goes down. So you'll,

788
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,420
you'll jump cause the water
will raise it up to your balls.

789
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,870
But like for the most part your balls are,
unless you're a ball hog,

790
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,810
in which case, you know, uh, then,
then you get your, your balls.

791
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,800
Let me put it right up against her.
I

792
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,090
get so aggressive,

793
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:55,540
I think about 15 years ago because
it didn't used to be that way.

794
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,370
And I don't want to sound like
an old person, but, uh, no.

795
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,400
I remember porn when somebody
wasn't getting punched.

796
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,290
We've had the discussion that
when we are introduced to it,

797
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,850
we're basically too young,
your kid.

798
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:12,650
But we were watching pretty much eighties
porn where the thrill was just that

799
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:14,820
you're having sex with some,
like that was, yeah, that was,

800
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:18,620
we were seeing a vagina and then
in the scene they were like,

801
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,120
this is so great that I get to have
sex with you. Like that was, yeah,

802
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,760
that was the interaction that I'm so
glad I missed delivered a pizza. Yeah.

803
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,770
And then, you know, it was big hair

804
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,050
and it was just naked people
doing it. Yeah. And then it,

805
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,950
I think it's because, I don't
know, there was maybe the,

806
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,850
as the exposure of it grew,
people became more desensitized.

807
00:51:38,851 --> 00:51:42,930
I think so then it heightened. Yeah. Well
the, I don't know. But then again, okay,

808
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,810
what are the most popular
searches for porn?

809
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,760
It's MILF porn is one of like
top category. It's not the, um,

810
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:55,620
that's true ball licking the fist,
double fist. Anal. Fucking, it's not,

811
00:51:55,621 --> 00:51:57,210
it's not the most popular for sure.

812
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:01,470
And everyone is kind of in the
middle of what their tastes are.

813
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:04,890
I think it's just marketing and like,
Whoa, I'm going to, it's like Click Bait,

814
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:09,300
right? Five Dick's and one bought
whole Wagga to see how that works out.

815
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:14,220
That's going to break bad. How's this
going to break open? Right, right.

816
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,670
Cause I don't know,
I'm trying to

817
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,840
pull up the, uh, it says that
there's the most popular. Yeah.

818
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:26,050
What are the big searches right
now? Pop most popular porn, Sir

819
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,120
Gay.
I read the,

820
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:31,230
I heard some podcasts where straight
guys are searching for gay stuff.

821
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,440
Meaning there's a lot more
gay men out there then are,

822
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,810
are copping to basically
they're saying they're gay.

823
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,380
I'm sure MILF has big

824
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,320
looks like a Hentai. That's the uh, yeah.

825
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:50,610
Uh, cock cock holding
was big. Lesbian. Wow.

826
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:54,640
That whole crazy term. Uh, gay, big.

827
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,680
These are the biggest search
is a 2017 accord. Yeah.

828
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,390
Oh, crazy things chain. It
sounds pretty basic though.

829
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,860
Dick big deck that lesbians, it's like
same shit. Different toilet ma'am.

830
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,670
Yeah. Um, and the most
viewed categories for women.

831
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,163
Uh,

832
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:17,530
like in the u s the biggest term for a
search term for women was lesbian as same

833
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,680
as South America. In Africa,
you'll never believe it.

834
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,890
The biggest search term was
ebony. Um, Russia. It's anal.

835
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:31,350
Wow. Um, yeah. And it looks
like, yeah, those are kind of it.

836
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,010
And then mature and teen teen is
a popular term as well. Oh yeah,

837
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,040
I've heard that's a big one. Yeah,
it's the bed. They seem, you're right.

838
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:42,150
It's not like airtight six
Dick's or it's not like that.

839
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,810
That's the curiosity
click, I think. I mean,

840
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,010
what about Trans Trans Sexual?
I thought that was very popular.

841
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:52,590
It wasn't the top 10 list,
but I'm sure it's a very popular term.

842
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,320
A lot of that chicks with dicks.
Yup. Um, what is, uh, let's see here.

843
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,990
Why do infinity wipers happen? Oh,
exactly what you're talking about.

844
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:07,340
Like a bath of 90% of the time,
I'm a solid one to Weber.

845
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,930
Occasionally get stuck wiping
for at least 10 minutes.

846
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,050
Really destroys a good
roll of toilet paper.

847
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,340
And your help is it keep it
nonbinary Zack, if I may,

848
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,980
because I'm kind of like
the queen of Infinity Wipes.

849
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:24,300
This is why I invented shit.
The shower for me,

850
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:28,330
the only way to stop the wiping is to
take a shower and I don't know why,

851
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,860
why that is, but the minute you
take soap and water to your Heinie,

852
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,840
you're going to stop the wipes. Oh
Wow. You have that ever infinity?

853
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,920
I christened the house I live in now.

854
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:46,110
It was empty. I had just taken ownership
of it and I had to take a shit.

855
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,550
So I go in there,

856
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,880
I take my first shit in the house and it's
one of those shifts where you're like,

857
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,220
ah, there's not enough
toilet paper in the world.

858
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,460
So I get in the shower and there's not
even a shower curtain and there's like no

859
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,180
soap like day one it was,

860
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:07,110
and I just remember thinking really
this is my first memory, this is,

861
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,380
this is how I Chris and this is the worst
bottle of champagne to crack against a

862
00:55:11,381 --> 00:55:15,960
shed test. That first shit in the house
you wrecked your remember you really do.

863
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,760
I think shaving your asshole and wiping
from front to back has been the biggest

864
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:25,380
key for me. Oh. Which
minimizes the multiple wives.

865
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:28,590
My Dad has multiple series on it.
It's wiped direction,

866
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,870
white portion diet that sometimes he goes,
you've got to let things settle.

867
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,880
So what he, cause I've asked him, he goes,

868
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:40,290
we need to do buddy is you stand up kind
of thing. We'll realign inside of you.

869
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,010
Because sometimes it's just the way that
you're sitting in the way your insides

870
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:46,710
because he goes stand up,
kind of let things go back together.

871
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,590
And then sit back down.
I've tried it actually has worked before.

872
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,410
Like he, I mean he says it like really
like a researcher would say but he,

873
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:57,650
yeah he insists on it and I've,
I've, I've, I've thought about it.

874
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,570
I think it does make sense.
The next time you have an infinity wiper,

875
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,610
just try standing up for a second.

876
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,480
You know I'm going to have everything
go back to calibrate. Yeah. Yeah.

877
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,010
But it's too late at that point.

878
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,440
I mean it's like after you get in a car
accident, drive better. Yeah, I know.

879
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,890
I know. Because here's the thing, if
there was already brown all over you,

880
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:20,600
you're already in. It's already
messy. It's not all over
you. You're just having a,

881
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,130
a whole, it's like leaking basically. So

882
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:30,570
Diet I think is the biggest thing is one
of life's really most sublime pleasures

883
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,490
is the shit where you wipe and you go,
I didn't even need toilet.

884
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,990
So true. Go Shit. It's the best.

885
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,160
That is the best thing.
You double checked it.

886
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,630
There's something in the bowl
you're like, yeah it did. I miss,

887
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,960
is there a piece stuck to my leg?
Cause this is too good to be true.

888
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,130
[inaudible] shit coming. Um,
we've been talking about,

889
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,870
my dad says things incorrect,
like mispronounces so many words.

890
00:56:59,400 --> 00:56:59,711
Um,

891
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:03,560
so we're getting a lot of emails about
it along the lines of our parents saying

892
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:06,130
things wrong. When I was a child,
we had a cat for the longest time.

893
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,470
I thought that his name was Charlie.

894
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,070
It wasn't until I was laying
in bed one night when I was 23,

895
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,480
but I realized the cat's name was Charlie
and that his name was being said with

896
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:21,310
an extremely thick Boston accent.
Grateful to Albert.

897
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:25,420
We're washing it. I looked some scrum.
You run like a lady Mike from Albany.

898
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,780
I don't know what that part means. Scrum.
Do you say that on the, on the spectral?

899
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,980
No, no. He says you run like a
lady. I don't know. Um, but yeah,

900
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,070
well my dad is proceed.
Like that's an accent that you're hearing.

901
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:40,300
My Dad had a foggy brain old guy,
but he's been doing it for like,

902
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,430
like we were talking about when he was
here for the holidays. Uh, like, I dunno,

903
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:49,330
Casino was on and my dad was like, that's
a Joe Pesci. Right? And we're like, yeah,

904
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:52,030
but haven't you heard his
name like 10,000 times?

905
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,320
Like why would you call them Pesky?
And he says like all types of words,

906
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:59,110
like a few degrees. Yes. My Dad,

907
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:03,220
my dad used to do that to a who
would like a Heineken's. Yeah,

908
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,590
that's a paralyzing. That's the
Goto. At one time my dad, uh,

909
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,200
said, um, uh,

910
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:18,790
I was listening to a Simon
and Garfunkel. No. And I went,

911
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:23,560
no, Dad, it's, it's Garfunkel.
He goes, Oh yeah, Garfinkel,

912
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:27,200
that's the cat, Garfield, Garfield,

913
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,050
native English speaker. What? We were
discussing all our theories on it. Like,

914
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,990
could it be brain damage?
I think it's for like my dad,

915
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,260
it is actually a lack of paying attention.
In other words,

916
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:41,590
it's kind of like being half into the
conversation we were watching. He goes,

917
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:43,930
you know, you don't hear a lot
about in the news these days,

918
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:48,550
is that Gerald Koocher? And
I go, Jared. And he's like,
and he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,420
So in other words it's like, you know
what I'm saying? I'm like, but dude,

920
00:58:51,421 --> 00:58:55,390
you've heard his name and you've read
it in newspapers like a million times.

921
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:58,930
So your dad's half listening.
I think he's looking at some more clips.

922
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:00,820
He might be looking at porn,

923
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,390
he might be watching ball hogs
instead of actually talking to me,

924
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,610
but everything he says is kind of like,
you know what I'm trying to say?

925
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:11,740
So I'm like, I think you're just kind
of half checked out of everything. Yeah.

926
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,990
So then you have saying things wrong.
You know what?

927
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:17,620
I think that starts to happen and I
don't want to scare you guys. Children,

928
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:22,220
children, deprivation. I know.
Absolutely. My best friend, once

929
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,020
he had four kids, like there was a
part of his brain that never came.

930
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:30,000
Absolutely. Especially as the mom. Yeah.

931
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,630
There's a thing called mom
brain and it starts for me,

932
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:33,820
it started in the third trimester,

933
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,560
my last pregnancy and in for the
first year you remember that.

934
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:41,120
I would just forget because you're so
sleep deprived and you also so much,

935
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,280
your brain is mush.
Part of it is aging,

936
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:47,930
but I think that having
the kid exacerbates this
is your separation from pop

937
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:51,770
culture [inaudible] you're so into this,
you know,

938
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:56,190
taking care of this being and all your
home life that things kind of pass you by.

939
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,150
It happens more when you have a kid I
think where you're like somebody will

940
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:00,260
bring up, you're like,
who's that? And be like,

941
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,930
who's the number one artist in the
country right now? And you're like,

942
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,870
I don't know who that is now.
Just kind of passes you by.

943
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,990
Last night I was saying to Tommy,
I'm like, I'm, I'm 41 years old.

944
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:14,020
I think I'm finally the official age
where I don't know shit about pop culture.

945
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:19,460
Like I, I know about Cardi B and I'm
like fascinated by her and that's it.

946
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:24,010
Right, right. It's a singer. She's a
says. I honestly, I've never heard of.

947
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,470
He's a rapper, he's a rapper and she's got
like a couple of big hits. Huge. She's,

948
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,760
she's very successful right now. And
um, that's all I know. Maybe the voice,

949
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,500
I know Blake Shelton was on there,

950
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,580
but I'm officially that that turning point
where your, your lane? Well we made a,

951
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:42,610
I mean it wasn't on purpose but such a
shift I feel like within the last four

952
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:46,310
years or so where things on television,

953
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,510
if it's on TV it doesn't mean anything.
First of all,

954
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:55,160
like my wind down of like I want to
watch something involves Netflix,

955
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,960
iTunes, like what's the, you know,
renting things or watching a movie. Um,

956
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,760
maybe Amazon prime and like if
there's a show like that on NBC Fox,

957
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,790
I'm like there's 0% chance and less
like a friends on it and they're like,

958
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:11,770
I'm on this show. Even then it's like I
don't watch it but that's good for you.

959
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,390
I know the name of the
show, but I mean, yeah,

960
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,580
so like those things just go past me now.
That's,

961
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:22,370
that's the only thing I watch broadcast
TV. Exactly. What's your sport?

962
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:25,850
What do you like? Hockey? Yeah, but
you're in northeastern guy or in Chicago.

963
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,700
Chicago guy want it. Makes Sense.
Yeah. It's a great sports town.

964
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:33,030
It is also a bears fan and a
bulls. I was until, you know,

965
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,210
after they won in [inaudible] 85, 86, uh,

966
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,980
and they just took the team
apart from money. I was like,

967
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:44,981
why am I frustrating the
fuck out of myself getting
behind a team with more care

968
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,270
about winning than the fucking owners.
They're the only

969
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,390
professional sports team where it
is the sole business of the owners.

970
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,420
So I understand that they treat it more
of a business then as a hobby like Jerry

971
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,700
Jones where it's all
about his ego and winning.

972
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:09,500
But the bears could use some more of that.
Yeah. I mean I feel like your fandom,

973
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,450
if you have like ownership issues,

974
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:15,950
like I was born in Cincinnati
and we left when I was a kid,

975
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:20,220
but we left the year they
went to the Superbowl and 88
with boomer. Yeah. And like

976
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,530
I was a Yankee shuffle. Yeah.
And I was such a die hard. Yeah.

977
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,920
I was such a die hard fan.
Um,

978
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,040
but then what I discovered is like after
time kind of living in that with the

979
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:36,550
reality that they're like probably one
of the worst ownership groups or teams in

980
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,190
the NFL. It, it makes your
fandom like die. It's hard man.

981
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,790
It really tests there or they're
a perennial dog. Yeah. Yeah.

982
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,850
And you realize too that you're like,
that's so it's,

983
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:51,130
it's a real thing that a team can suck for

984
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,330
decades, decades. The saints in the 70s,

985
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,600
I don't think they ever had a season where
they won more than five games. It was,

986
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:03,110
they never made the playoffs. I know they
were dog shit. Awful. Awful. And it, and,

987
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,200
and, and uh, what's his name? Uh,
Archie manning was a fucking great

988
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,490
quarterback. Yeah, there's
bad. And then, then you can,

989
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:13,090
and then the flip side you see like, like
let's say like the Steelers ownership.

990
01:03:13,091 --> 01:03:17,200
You're like, that's like a family
that they love the team, the city,

991
01:03:17,201 --> 01:03:19,510
they want to win the, do things
the right way. And it's like,

992
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,120
and they have six fucking rings.
Do you think it's,

993
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:26,710
they know when to give up control and
not micromanage? I think so. I think,

994
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:29,710
I do think, I mean it sounds
kind of Cliche, sports be speak,

995
01:03:29,711 --> 01:03:34,110
but it's like they develop a
system and like, oh, here's the,

996
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,240
it's like a culture, like in a company,
here's the way we do things here.

997
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:41,040
And when you get people to really buy
into like, this is how we work here and,

998
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,400
and you have integrity and you have good
values for like how they probably treat

999
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:48,520
employees all the way on
down. I think that, that,

1000
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,950
that becomes something that
people really buy into. I mean,

1001
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,610
for all the shit people talk
about the Patriots and all
that, it's like, you know,

1002
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:59,150
I think they have a real culture going
in that organization. Absolutely.

1003
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:04,140
Black Hawks are probably one of the
greatest examples of that. The, uh,

1004
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:04,740
uh,

1005
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,740
Bill Wirtz was the owner for years and
he was despised by the fans because he

1006
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:12,510
pinched pennies. He, he was a dick.

1007
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:16,560
He treated Bobby Hall and all those other
stand Makita treated those guys like

1008
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:21,360
shit. Money was the only
thing that mattered to him.
And when he died, his son,

1009
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:24,030
rocky Wirtz took over and,
and uh,

1010
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:29,310
attendance was in a 30,000 or whatever,
a seat stadium.

1011
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,910
Um,
there was maybe 12,000 people.

1012
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,190
Rocky Wirtz took over.

1013
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:39,480
He started bringing back the
hall of Famers, honoring them.

1014
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,710
He got good gms, they started
drafting wisely. They got cane,

1015
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:48,711
they got Taiz and it is one of the
most profitable sports franchises ever.

1016
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,240
And when change their philosophy,
then change your philosophy.

1017
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:56,160
And when they won a Stanley Cup,
all the employees got ring. Yeah.

1018
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,070
That's cool. It's nice. Yeah.
One of the things that people,

1019
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:01,950
I mean people will say like,
we'll say they know it,

1020
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,830
but they don't act on it is if
you're a fan of anything, it doesn't,

1021
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,580
I mean it could be sports,
it could be if you go,

1022
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,620
I'm not going to support
that thing anymore.

1023
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,380
That's really the only way you'll
see change. In other words, right.

1024
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:14,250
Like in Cincinnati,

1025
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,500
they'll still sell that fucking stadium
out no matter what they're doing.

1026
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:21,820
People will still buy tickets to the game.
And so that lets the owners go like,

1027
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:24,590
well you don't have to fucking
do anything like and money. Yeah.

1028
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,510
Like roll the dice when you want to
hurt them. Like stop going to the Games,

1029
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:32,440
stop buying tickets to games and
you'll see something will change.

1030
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,040
Go in the parking lot and set
off car bombs or whatever.

1031
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,290
I encourage the cottages.
I um,

1032
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,280
this is a question we get questions
about all types of things,

1033
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:43,780
but here's the question
about little people.

1034
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,710
I was in the bathroom cutting my solid
brown and half with my powerful urine

1035
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:51,440
stream. I had a thought. And you know
how when adults refer to their childhood,

1036
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,530
they start off by saying,
when I was little, yeah.

1037
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,860
Do adult little people refer to
their childhood by saying this also,

1038
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:00,580
do they say when I was a little smaller,
I can't get this off my mind.

1039
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,660
I need some answers here.

1040
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:06,460
That is kind of an interesting question
because you do say when I was little and

1041
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:09,430
if you're a little person, you might
be like, when I was really little,

1042
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,260
I don't know. I mean it's kind of silly
when I was young or when he was younger.

1043
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,300
Younger. I wonder if they
ever, I mean if the leg, yeah,

1044
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:20,110
cause all day they're like refer to
themselves as little. So, so true.

1045
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,180
Maybe when it was tiny.
Yeah.

1046
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:26,450
When I was half to half of you,
uh,

1047
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:28,660
my girlfriend can't tell the
difference between left and right.

1048
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:32,500
She has to hold her hands in front
of her and make an l with each hand.

1049
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:36,700
The correct orientation of the left.
Let her knees left. This is my life.

1050
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,970
I have accepted her handicap
and to support her through life.

1051
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,230
What we want to have a child,

1052
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:45,880
well she passed on her retardation or is
there still hope for our little jeans?

1053
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:50,800
We have a dog and he was real dumb.
Not sure yet. If that's her love. Brad,

1054
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:55,630
I love this. One of the funniest emails
I've ever, ever, ever. So she literally,

1055
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:58,730
he goes make a left and she has to go.
Which way is yeah.

1056
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,760
And the dog is dumb and he's not sure if
that's her fault. I tell you this much.

1057
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,500
She's gotta be hot.
She's a smoke show for eight Brad,

1058
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,600
send photos next week because we're
pretty sure she's lightening men.

1059
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:19,030
My God. What do you think? It could
be a, you know, brain thing. Yeah,

1060
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,510
definitely. I probably is. It's a form
of dyslexia or some kind of directional.

1061
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,980
People have terrible, terrible, I
mean, I've never heard left. Right,

1062
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,640
but I know north south,
a lot of people are fucked up by that.

1063
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:34,390
I don't know that all the time.
I have to do the never eat soggy Wheaties.

1064
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,450
You know? What I find is that when
you live in a certain neighborhood,

1065
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:40,570
especially in Los Angeles,
you get your orientation,

1066
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:44,110
but when you leave that neighborhood
and you go to another just neighborhood.

1067
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:48,520
Now that for me, I, I lose
the sense of all direction.

1068
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:52,930
I don't know why, but yeah, like it's
like I'm standing in a Hollywood,

1069
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:57,100
I'll know north, south, east, west, but if
I go to Burbank, I'll start. I'd be like,

1070
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:59,710
yeah, it's south of this, and you're like,
that's north. I'm like, no, that's not.

1071
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,970
Yeah, it just throws me off. I don't
know why I leave neighborhoods and I,

1072
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:06,270
I can't orientate myself.
The only way that I,

1073
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,600
I've always had kind of an obsessive
need to know what direction I'm facing.

1074
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,650
And it was one of the reasons I don't
like flying into cities is because then I,

1075
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,070
I

1076
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,610
don't have a bearing to start with. Like
right now, I know I'm facing northeast.

1077
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:24,840
Right. Um, it's just like this,
you know, you're facing northeast,

1078
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:29,120
right. Didn't know that. I, I wouldn't
that, hold on, Huh? Yeah. You are.

1079
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,550
You are fighting facing northeast.
It's just this weird,

1080
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:34,820
I think it was a fear of being lost
maybe when I was a little person mean.

1081
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:39,710
Did you know that? Just like, you
just know how you count. It's just,

1082
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:44,390
uh, it's just as a sense
of, of, uh, I dunno,

1083
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:45,680
I dunno how to explain it.
I don't,

1084
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,630
I don't have to think about it cause
I'm always thinking of things as a grid

1085
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,800
kind of when I get into
curvy shit, then I, I lose,

1086
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,480
like when you get into subdivisions
where it's all curves. Yeah. Hmm. Um,

1087
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:03,520
super orgasm, asthma. Do you
know what that is? Uh, our blue,

1088
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,460
our producer just through this ignore
folder. I have no idea what that is.

1089
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,873
I don't know

1090
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,010
the most that I've had.

1091
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:14,420
I think trevally be upwards
of 60 throughout an evening.

1092
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:18,710
It's great. Especially the ones
that keep on going forever.

1093
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:23,360
And then there comes a time after
a long time that I just say no,

1094
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:27,340
we have got stopped because uh,
I mean you can't go up and a hallway.

1095
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,570
I feel like Europeans have so much more
fun than us. I feel like that though.

1096
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,870
No one American will be in this uh,

1097
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:35,750
video clip super orgasm.

1098
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:42,480
Actually last year I was really confused
and to me it felt like a contraction

1099
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,250
but nice. Hmm. Do you want
to go to this seminar?

1100
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,550
I was like during like a
little group circle. I don't,

1101
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:56,720
I'm not a fan of group
orgasm therapies or, yeah,

1102
01:09:56,830 --> 01:10:00,010
no, it's a super orgasm
though, right? I know.

1103
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,840
I don't, I don't, I think
one is fine. Like I'm not,

1104
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,310
I'm not chasing the dragon
here, you know what I mean? See,

1105
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:11,240
in an evening I think one is sufficient.

1106
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:16,270
I would bet the next day they're depressed
because you're too high bleeding all

1107
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:21,080
of that. That's like when
you take ecstasy, uh, you're
depressed the next day,

1108
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:26,000
Paul, that you're withdrawing all that
dopamine or whatever the, yeah, I'm not,

1109
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:30,830
I'm not an extreme type of person. I
think I'm happy with what, like anatomy,

1110
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,550
you know? Yeah. Provides
52 year old mother of two.

1111
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,510
Beverly is super orgasmic, I believe. So

1112
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,390
practicing tantric sex is what leads to
super orgasm and a priestess of love and

1113
01:10:42,391 --> 01:10:43,650
sacred sexuality.

1114
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:48,680
Do you think it's very natural for me if
I'm making love with a partner to have

1115
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:52,830
many, many orgasms where my whole
body is flowing with sexual energy.

1116
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:57,510
Do you think she's as full of shit as
the guys who got the comm? Hugs? Yeah.

1117
01:10:57,511 --> 01:11:01,110
Bugs and that they're there.
That is like a boat.

1118
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:05,820
K of cliches that I search for you.

1119
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:10,790
The word sacred. Um, the,
the uh, you know, the India,

1120
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,160
the music, Sitar or whatever, the dancing.

1121
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,580
It's all Robin. You know the word mother
earth is just around the corner? Yeah.

1122
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,790
Do you know Julie and there?

1123
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,620
I don't think we need
what come hugging is. No,

1124
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:30,420
that's so come hugging. There's a,
I'm trying to pull this up for you.

1125
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,130
There is a, um, boy,

1126
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,300
there's these two people who say that,
uh,

1127
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:41,500
you can come just by hugging and come

1128
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,153
seminar.

1129
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:55,030
It's, it feels like some bullshit though.
It really does. Yeah. Rarely done.

1130
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,140
Have you ever spood so hard that
you hit your own face? Yeah.

1131
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,950
Yeah. Yeah. I hung one on my
glasses one time in college.

1132
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,060
I had to laugh.
I was like,

1133
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:13,780
it made me laugh because it made me
laugh. Just, yeah. Drench yourself. Um,

1134
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,960
I can't even imagine that
you guys clean up at clean.

1135
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,990
It's got to be terrible for
men. It's pretty bad. Yeah.

1136
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,480
And especially because you're,
if you,

1137
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,790
that adolescent phase where
it's like nonstop and Ugh,

1138
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,690
it's just gotta be disgusting for your
mother is cleaning up your [inaudible].

1139
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,350
I was always, yeah. What's the,

1140
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:37,820
what's the most inappropriate or gross
thing you've ever cleaned your ges with?

1141
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:43,400
Oh, man, that's a good question. Yeah,
I get it. That's a really good question.

1142
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,340
I mean, it was definitely
in that, in those terms.

1143
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,330
I think of like this is an emergency.
Yes.

1144
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,600
It was probably something that's not mine,
you know?

1145
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:54,440
So like it's probably like
somebody like a parent's clothing.

1146
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:58,590
I go,
you go like you think you're alone.

1147
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:01,640
Then like you hear the door open like
Oh fuck. And I dunno where I'm at.

1148
01:13:01,641 --> 01:13:05,300
And then I just clean up. I think. I
can't think of like a specific though.

1149
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:07,670
What about you?
Hands down.

1150
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,490
It was sex with a girl and a car.

1151
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,130
She was a single mom and,

1152
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,970
and she presented it to me
to clean myself off with

1153
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:22,700
a baby sock. I go, really? She goes,

1154
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:26,450
that's the only thing I have.
I have not even a lot of surface area.

1155
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,380
And I was like,

1156
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:32,360
this is going to be lasered into
my brain for the rest of my life.

1157
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,510
These are the come huggers by the way.
I was trying to show you.

1158
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:38,970
Hi Melanie. I'm Scotty with
ecstatic hearts. Tantra.

1159
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,420
I was just want to share that
there are many ways to orgasm.

1160
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,500
You don't actually have to be having sex.

1161
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,010
You can orgasm just from hugging.

1162
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,630
So there,

1163
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,300
ah,

1164
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:56,323
it's,
it's,

1165
01:13:56,450 --> 01:14:01,450
it's amazing how many people in the
world exist that make us uncomfortable.

1166
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,530
Yeah. Try it out. Yeah. They're, they're,

1167
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,410
they're so uncomfortable because I,
yeah,

1168
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,390
I've seen that clip now like 40
times and I'm still like, man,

1169
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,250
well cause I struggle in my head

1170
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,360
I'm like, oh, I'm uncomfortable.
But as it, because I'm like a prude,

1171
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:19,600
am I being close minded here am I,

1172
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,270
I think we both kind of like,

1173
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:24,900
when people are like that I
get uncomfortable with there.

1174
01:14:24,901 --> 01:14:28,470
It's almost like their level of sharing.
Like I could make like come on, I'm like,

1175
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:32,940
just fucking don't need to know
about it. You know? I'm not a prude,

1176
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:35,910
but I'm just like, I don't have
any, no, I don't want to know.

1177
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,980
I don't need to know
how much you can come.

1178
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,560
Yeah. I'm all for freedom. Freedom
and no shame. But it's, it's,

1179
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,820
it's less the concept of it then.
It is the presentation of it.

1180
01:14:48,821 --> 01:14:53,821
The presentation of it is always kind
of precious and new agey and just,

1181
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,660
I don't know, there's, there's
almost kind of a smug theater crowd.

1182
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:04,090
The theater crowds laugh at something
that's not funny at all. We know.

1183
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,380
We understand that the
Butler would never do that.

1184
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:12,670
Right? Yeah. It got a
little of that. Yeah. Um,

1185
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,950
like I would never see Hamilton.
I think I'm so,

1186
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:19,570
I'm the lamest in terms of that. You
wouldn't see it. I heard of so good.

1187
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,110
I just hate theater. I don't know. I feel
like it's too, it's too corny for me.

1188
01:15:24,111 --> 01:15:28,760
I'd be like, I don't like
opera. I hate musicals. I hate,

1189
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:31,280
I hate music eight. Yes. Even like,

1190
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:35,750
what was that was such les
Miserables movie. Sit through it.

1191
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:36,881
Get your ally.

1192
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:39,710
I turned off la La land when they
started singing in the first scene.

1193
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:43,370
I fast forwarded through the songs. I just
like Ryan Gosling and what's her shit?

1194
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,330
Yeah. I don't want to fucking hear.
I started on a plane. I was like, Oh,

1195
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:51,470
this movie is like winning everything.
And then I clicked that first scene,

1196
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,480
the camera settles. She was
like, wait her. And I was
like, Nope, I'm not doing it.

1197
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:58,880
I'm not going to watch this.
Don't want to see it.

1198
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,700
I've been doing this since I was a kid,
like with Disney movies and shit.

1199
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,000
I used to listen to records and
I would skip over the songs.

1200
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,550
I like the store, so 69 at 70,
so submissions to wrap things up.

1201
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:14,840
So we've been doing this thing where when
I, uh, just to give you context for it,

1202
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,670
my dad turned 70,
uh,

1203
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:20,970
back in August we had a big family get
together and my mom, who's Peruvian,

1204
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,020
it doesn't get a lot of references.
Uh,

1205
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,780
one of the dinners on the first night of
the, of the get together, I said, Hey,

1206
01:16:26,781 --> 01:16:30,080
dad is turning 70 tomorrow. Do you
think you guys are going to 69 tonight?

1207
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:35,120
So afraid it like a child. And she
was like, what? And everybody laughed.

1208
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:38,380
And then we kept teasing her
about it all weekend. Yeah.

1209
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:43,070
So we told our listeners about it and
we asked them to ask their parents if

1210
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:46,780
they're going to 69 at 70 and get it
on camera and they'd been selling all.

1211
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,280
He goes, yeah, you get a
wide range of reactions.

1212
01:16:49,281 --> 01:16:53,690
Sometimes the parent is a playful,
sometimes they're stunned,

1213
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,810
sometimes they get really
upset, which is my favorite. Um,

1214
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,590
but so I don't know what these, these
are our new ones that came in. Oh my God.

1215
01:17:00,591 --> 01:17:02,950
Do I love that? Was the moms
that are up to, yeah, the moms.

1216
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:08,170
Would you ask me something like that?
Sharon? Like really, really upset my fate.

1217
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,160
I mean, those are good.
I like when they're like,

1218
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,380
you guys are, this is so juvenile.
I like the, I like those two,

1219
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,330
nine times out of 10.
The Dad's on board. Yeah,

1220
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,770
Dad. That's always what sounds good to
me. But yeah, mom's like uptight. I know.

1221
01:17:19,771 --> 01:17:22,260
Dad's 62 wait, hold on.
Let's put bets on it.

1222
01:17:22,261 --> 01:17:26,290
What do you think her reaction to haul
the last night that he's 60 you guys

1223
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,640
going to 69 one last time.
Oh my God.

1224
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:35,723
Have you ever

1225
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,600
or are you going to 69 one last
time? Like the last time. He's 69

1226
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:50,670
well, he's hammer hammer. It's hilarious.

1227
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,430
First question is, have you ever
play Joe here right now? Sorry.

1228
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,980
I love it. That was
great. That's from Mr Sr.

1229
01:17:59,981 --> 01:18:02,800
I couldn't find the pause cause I was
gonna say we should take a look at the

1230
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:06,250
mom's next time and then bet on how
you think she's going to read it.

1231
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:08,410
I thought she was going to react angrily.
I did too.

1232
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,260
That glare was like the fuck
are you asking me? Yeah.

1233
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,360
But then she did kind of smile. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. She's had a few enter. Yeah,

1234
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,790
you're right. Yeah. The
Alcohol House since uh,

1235
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:22,720
no humor. I'm going to go
no humor on this lady. Yeah,

1236
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:26,120
I could go with you on that. I think it
might not work out. Yeah, I think she's,

1237
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:30,670
I think that he spends most
of the marriage sitting
there with that look on his

1238
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:34,090
face. Yes. And her reaction
with that look on her face.

1239
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:38,860
And so that reaction is
going to be probably remind
her that he doesn't fuck her

1240
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:42,580
anymore. This is a, okay, this
is from crystal. So here we go.

1241
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:47,480
Michelle is going to be 50 yeah,
that was kind of, that's a milestone.

1242
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,340
I love the setups.
So Michelle's 50

1243
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:57,710
turn 70. Yeah, yeah. Years ago. Yeah.

1244
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:03,240
So because you turned the night
before it would have been,

1245
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,890
if you turn 70 you would have been 69

1246
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,480
so one gram per turn.
70 did you,

1247
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:15,690
did you guys 69 before he turned
seven days as a send off your dad?

1248
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:22,570
I love it. She loved it. She
loved it. Yeah. Did you tell her,

1249
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:30,680
did you tell her? Did you tell her that
that was a surprise? Completely surprised.

1250
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:34,550
Yeah. That's the best one. You can't when
you don't nail it because you're like,

1251
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,890
oh, this one's not gonna like
it. And sometimes he's like,

1252
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:39,650
she seems fun and then yeah, the hell
did you just ask me? Right. Yeah.

1253
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:44,080
Well those two were both fun. He was
fun and she was fine, so that was a win.

1254
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,590
Well, Ralph, I was wondering though,

1255
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,610
when you turn 69

1256
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:57,690
before you turn 70 than I have before
[inaudible] 70 or [inaudible] 69

1257
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:06,830
is significant. All right. Excellent.

1258
01:20:06,831 --> 01:20:07,664
Very.

1259
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:14,540
Oh really? You brought each
other's teeth with your ass holes?

1260
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,020
They're, yeah. Yeah.

1261
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,800
I've got a couple more here so
I'm going to say now square.

1262
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,350
I love they're doing it in front of it.

1263
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:34,170
James 70 when he was 69 wake on
the last day of his 69th birthday.

1264
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:40,970
Do you think you guys would have 69
no.

1265
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:45,490
Quiet twice. Oh, fun.

1266
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,040
His girlfriend. That's like
disgusting. Like you're the weirdest.

1267
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:57,080
You're totally judging. But this
lady was actually fun. Yeah.

1268
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:00,880
Awesome.
No quiet toys.

1269
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:05,050
Weirdest hoof on hot.

1270
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,790
God.

1271
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:12,970
My Ex's mom used to love when we would
swear because she was raised really

1272
01:21:14,901 --> 01:21:18,680
Catholic and really so your ex in
mother-in-law ex mother and look at it.

1273
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:23,830
And when my ex moved into my house this
or you know we are apartments that are

1274
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:29,540
25 years ago a friend was helping
us move along with the mom.

1275
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:30,530
And so my friend,

1276
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:35,570
my mother in law and I are carrying
this futon down the stairs and my friend

1277
01:21:35,571 --> 01:21:38,540
doesn't know that she likes swearing.

1278
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,170
And so as the three of us are
carrying this down the stairs,

1279
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,500
I turned to my mother in law and I go,

1280
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:50,770
I can't wait to blow some loads on
this baby and my friend and she starts

1281
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:55,970
laughing and she would laugh. She would,
and my friend just looked at me like,

1282
01:21:56,150 --> 01:22:01,010
what the fuck? I say to your mother in
Law who? Your mother in law? Hilarious.

1283
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:02,540
Hilarious.
This is the last one.

1284
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:08,610
She's going to be good. Yeah. The last,

1285
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:15,380
the last side of him,
he 69 are you guys going to

1286
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:21,803
say

1287
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:30,250
nobody?
A little devil.

1288
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:34,890
They're fun. I loved it. All
of the moms were cool. Yeah.

1289
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:38,550
It's funny that the the daughters or the
daughter in laws or whoever the sisters

1290
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:40,890
were the ones that had the
problem with that was Matt G.

1291
01:22:40,891 --> 01:22:42,600
Thank you for sending that in.
Yeah.

1292
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:45,060
It's like everybody's been
a good time so far. Right?

1293
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:51,780
I was trying to find the one.
There was one was this it? Oof.

1294
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,490
His jeans are tight. I know. I wanted to
find that really disapproving mom. Oh,

1295
01:22:56,491 --> 01:23:00,270
I love those. I don't remember
which episode it was in though.

1296
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:05,271
But there was one lady who got
so like controlled anger at,

1297
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,250
she's like,

1298
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,300
what are you doing right now?

1299
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,470
What would you disrespect
me with a question like that
is so fucking fantastic.

1300
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:15,490
Oh man, why would you ask me that?
Yeah. How would you say that?

1301
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:20,680
It's really terrible. You would talk
to me like that. Um, okay. What else?

1302
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:24,160
So uh, the mental illness,
happy hour, happy hour.

1303
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,270
Have you been doing that for a while?
Six years. Six years is a long, long run.

1304
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:31,150
So there's hundreds of episodes. I don't
know when it's going to get canceled,

1305
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,033
but yeah.

1306
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:36,150
Can I tell you that your show is
such a huge public service to people,

1307
01:23:36,151 --> 01:23:40,980
to humanity and I advise
everybody listening to this
show to check out Paul show

1308
01:23:40,981 --> 01:23:43,120
if you don't already know about it.
Um,

1309
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,090
cause you explore every facet of human
existence and like there's no other

1310
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:49,560
person doing it.
There's no,

1311
01:23:49,561 --> 01:23:54,561
there's nowhere else where people are
being interviewed about being bipolar or

1312
01:23:55,860 --> 01:24:00,860
being a Hasidic Jew and being molested
as a child or whatever the scenario and

1313
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:04,020
what I really love on your website,

1314
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:09,320
which has mental pod.com he has these
surveys up that people take anonymously

1315
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:14,370
and so you can see what people are
really have had happened to them in their

1316
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:15,540
lives.
You know,

1317
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:19,080
things that you wouldn't want to admit
in public and interest and you can read

1318
01:24:19,081 --> 01:24:23,330
what things that turn them
on. Yeah, yeah. Oh, it's just,

1319
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:26,950
it's amazing. It's such a
great show. I want to check
