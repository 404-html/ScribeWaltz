You didn't expect that from me.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,210
It's offensive.
It's just offensive.

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,720
You haven't even asked me
what my pronoun is today.

54
00:03:56,721 --> 00:04:00,350
How can you say that I'm being offensive
when you don't even ask me what my

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,060
pronoun,
it's changed already today.

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,810

Actually, I prefer to be called Juror
Majesty to Your Majesty's. Great.

59
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,430
What's Your Pronoun?

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,930
So immature. Wait, what's Your
Pronoun Rob? Rob. Rob. My,

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,573
fear.

63
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,850
I feel like the Pronoun is taking the
place of which bracks and you feel like,

64

oh yeah, it is. What is your

I don't, I absolutely love him.

67
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,560
What do you love most about him?
It's just so authentic.

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,550
It's the dedication to it. He's
100% dedicated. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:03,930
He's not making that up. He's just that
disgusting. Yeah. It's just, it's perfect.

70
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,310
Rob. Rob, I go retarded.

71
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,780
Um,

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,320
I'd go retarded is also my favorite
new drop. That's what you got.

73
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,510
Oh, well I'm doing the comedy
store most Saturdays, most likely.

74
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,270
And this is not 100%.
I usually do the early show in the,

75
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:28,200
or I liked doing that seven 30.
Oh our show. I just love it.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,340
It's where all the civilized people go
out. Like, you know what I'm saying?

77
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:37,341
Like you got shit to do and you don't
get no lunatics and midnight hour

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,790
respectable people.
I just occurred to me.

79
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,960
And please remember when you're in
mom's Trillia to pick me up some ketchup

80
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:50,000
flavored Doritos. When I was asked
me this last time, my favorite,

81
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,570
but I remember I couldn't
find that they were,

82
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:54,660
they weren't there anymore last time.
Serious when I went in 2011 yeah.

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,470
It's like a,
it must've just been a one time only.

84
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,790
I think it's just outdated though.

85
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,110
I mean I've been thinking about that shit
for 20 years. I know. Please catch up.

86
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:06,380
[inaudible] all right.
And what about Cadbury?

87
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,150
Will you bring me back some Cadbury stuff?

88
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,880
I do love what that seven seeds coffee.
That's what I want to get.

89
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:15,530
That was really good stuff. Yeah, that's
really, yeah. Yeah. Will you bring home?

90
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,440
Well they let you, I mean with um,
customs and all that shit. I don't know.

91
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,630
I wonder, you know how strict they are
with bringing any kind of food items.

92
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,930
We'll have to find out. Fuckers.
Let's get this show started

93
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,590
and when I woke up

94
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,010
she had both of my legs over his shoulders
and I'm sure it was numb sucking my

95
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,530
asshole like there no tomorrow.

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,690
Don't bring it in one loving.
Well No,

97
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,950

Go to your mom's house,

98
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,223
Christina.

99
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,753
Yeah,

100
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,740
turn the air on because it's
hot in here. One, two, three,

101
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,930
four. Heat generating light showbiz.
It's w so they put the air on.

102
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,170
I'm already, I'm so cold.
I'm wearing a jacket already.

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,150
And then now your turn it down.

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,370
[inaudible] the best part about sleeping
downstairs on the pullout couch bed.

105
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,990
Yeah.
And Not Saatva mattress.

106
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:02,490
The only highlight is that
there's no ac vent in that room.

107
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,500
I know, and I, it's so warm and
delightful and I don't have to,

108
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,530
do you know that I sleep with a down
comforter every night fully up around my

109
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:17,110
neck because it's cool that you can
call my nose is cold. All that claim,

110
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,290
you have problems, you have
body problems. Serious.

111
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,180
Well, how cold is it when I,
when I'm saying this, what
do you think in the room?

112
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,530
72 that's freezing and what's not?
I hate it.

113
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,160
And you wake up and you tell me
I saw you on top of the sheets.

114
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,780
Yeah, because it's not
cold. I want it freezes.

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,760
I do that as a courtesy. You know
what? The only time I enjoyed,

116
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,500
we enjoyed the same temperature was
when I was pregnant with Ellis. Yeah.

117
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,750
That was like you were hot too.
Cause it was hot all the time.

118
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:53,940
It's the only time in my life. Well
misery, if you haven't yet figured it out.

119
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,210
We've, we have found, uh,
the male equivalent to,

120
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
to Danny.

121
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,070
I hadn't figured that out yet,
actually.

122
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,380
I don't know what's going on with
this guy, but he's got a lot,

123
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,310
not to say it doesn't blink my name.

124
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,990
You do copious amounts
of cocaine with her.

125
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,390
So the point I thought my
heart was going to stop,

126
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,540
she told me to calm down,
gave me a drink.

127
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,100
Okay.

128
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,260
And I don't know it was in the drink,
but I blacked out. And when I woke up,

129
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,050
she had both of my legs over
her shoulders. She was numb,

130
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:35,200
sucking my asshole.
There was no tomorrow.

131
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,340
What's numb? Psyching, making
it now. Really going at it.

132
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,840
I tried to find it. I tried to
get away, but I was restrained.

133
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,240
She told me that I liked it.

134
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,400
She told me not to worry because she
used the good jelly. The schmuck goes,

135
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,260
okay.

136
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,690
I like schmuck.
Nobody's paid me to confess this now.

137
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,320
And I've kept it under wraps for all
these years because I knew that no one

138
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:07,170
would believe me. No, no one really
believe that Hillary Clinton eight.

139
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,140
My asshole.

140
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,590
Wow. Shocking him. Shocking revelation.
I mean, I'm surprised Hillary hasn't. Uh,

141
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,370
Hillary responded eight
Ryan sticklers asshole.

142
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:19,950
It does.

143
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,950
Except Ryan hasn't go to believe
that Hillary Clinton name my asshole.

144
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,270
A crab feast suite at Ryan sickler.

145
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,970
Did Hillary Clinton
really eat your asshole?

146
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,850
Fuck the crab feast.
Now here's how you know someone's crazy.

147
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,030
We put his image back up.

148
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,860
Well,
nobody's paid me to confess test.

149
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,860
Oh my God.

150
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,060
You can always tell crazy by the darkness
of the beard proportionate to one's

151
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:53,900
age. Oh yeah. He definitely nice and
easy. That one. I think so. Yeah.

152
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,810
It's not really in focus though.
It might be a little grayer than we think.

153
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,350
Remember they got in our old neighborhood
that used to take a permanent,

154
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,620
like a sharpie and Showbie
his we are not real crazy.

155
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,810
That's in the Rampart division.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,050
I drove through there years later
and I saw him look good for him.

157
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,710
What's he up to? Just keep holding
the block down and doing what he does.

158
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,980
He used to be on the corner where the
Carl's Jr was any of that bench and he was

159
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:22,400
just sitting there all the time.

160
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:26,730
It'd be south of six right
often be south of six.

161
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,760
Yeah. Wherever that Carlos is.
Mm. That was a really good,
Carl's junior by the way.

162
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,310
Yeah, I'm really good. Um,

163
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,350
wow. I don't worry Clinton, my asshole.

164
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm surprised she hasn't
responded. Really. That's a
huge alligator for a minute.

165
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,260
I mean, she's still getting
over this election, you know,

166
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,510
she's still figuring it out.

167
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,080
Yeah. Both of my legs
over her shoulders. Huh?

168
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,070
I wish I could.

169
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,610
I hope I can testify to the same
thing one day with hills with you.

170
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,630
Oh,
well we all know that's going to happen.

171
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,080
She had both of my legs over
her shoulders. Yana, yeah.

172
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,620
What would you, would you have Hillary
do this to you? Let's say I can't, okay.

173
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:09,580
I give you permission. Can Hillary
do this to you? Yeah, of course.

174
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,680
You wouldn't mind. Why would I mind?
She's a little bossy. That's fine. Yeah.

175
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,950
Yeah. I'm sure it wouldn't be that fun,
but I mean I would still do it. Yeah.

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,190
I think I would just do it for the story.
I think hills would be fine with it.

177
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,160
For you and are any idea
what kind of story that is?

178
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,170
I can't believe it happened.
I know.

179
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,990
I mean this guy's telling him through
his youtube channel, but yeah,

180
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,110
it must have happened before
she was married to bill.

181
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,770
I don't think that's what he's saying.
Oh, you think this is like recent?

182
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,970
Of course. Wow. Recent as in
at least during their marriage.

183
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,600
I don't think it was a 40 year old story.
Wow.

184
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,060
How many youtube videos will
be coming out about what you,

185
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,090
you've been doing on the road,
your road beef stories, road vive.

186
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,150
As the name of my new book
I'm pitching right now.

187
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,780
Road B road beef of life on the road.
You never got road beef.

188
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,310
Now he gives you and I got
together kind of, Hey, what,

189
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,960
what? No, I didn't, we didn't get rid
of beef. I've never gotten road baby.

190
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,970
The closest I came to Rhode beef I guess
is technically road vive was before we

191
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,270
were together.
I did a spot in uh,

192
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,300
orange county. Yeah. Like a bar show.

193
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,301
So it wasn't even a club show
and some girl at the show,

194
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,670
I was like, I dunno, I, I was
not how I normally come on.

195
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,960
I did a fake confidence thing. I was like,
come in here and watch this, you know?

196
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,020
Yeah, yeah. And then we kind
of made out afterwards. Yeah.

197
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,730
This is the first I've heard of it.
Yeah.

198
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:46,600
And then she got a hotel room and
here's the thing, I was like, oh,

199
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:51,400
like I'm gonna, you know, I'm going
to shove it in. And then she was like,

200
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,881
oh no,

201
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:56,881
my friends come and now and then
her friend showed up and uh,

202
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,120
her friend was like looking at me like,
what is going on?

203
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:04,480
Like it was the nerd friend who
was like, oh, she wasn't like a,

204
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,950
like they weren't going to double team.

205
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:10,210
You know who's the nerd
friend who was like, Samantha,

206
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,740
who is this guy? Cause he's a comedian.
It was so funny the way she said it too.

207
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,790
Like she said it like he's a fireman.
That's just, you know, it was saving me.

208
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,180
That's why he's here. He's a community.
It was like, uh Huh. Nice to meet you.

209
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:25,750
And I was like, well nothing happened.
That's it. Yeah. That's good.

210
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,060
I came to root cause we started
dating when I was super young.

211
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,130
You could have like bang,
both of those checks.

212
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,600
No one of them possible if,

213
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,670
if nerd alert hadn't showed up this
shitty friend too bad one time I got

214
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,610
preposition to get in a hot tub.

215
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,240
There is a small club in a small town in
Florida and the owner and his wife had

216
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,930
huge fakers. Yeah. And,
uh, they, they were like,

217
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,320
after the show, they were like,
to me the headliner there.

218
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,400
We know we have a hot tub back at
our place. And uh, and I was like,

219
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,490
oh, really? That sounds terrible. I'm not,
I don't do that. Like I don't want to rob,

220
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,340
Rob, rob. That's when you and
I were engaged. You didn't,

221
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:14,420
you didn't go to the hot tub?
I'd rather kill myself.

222
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,380
No. Why? I'm just not that
perse. I'm not fun like that.

223
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,980
I have a good personality,
but I'm not the sexuality champ.

224
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,760
That's like the slut champ. Yeah,
that'd be a good story. You'd be like,

225
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,820
so where to find a double team? This
owner and his wife, they're not cute.

226
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,990
Not Cute. I don't know. I'm not
that free. I'm really not that open.

227
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,360
Some nervous. I'd be so weirded out. Like
I guess some people can do that stuff,

228
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,380
obviously. I'm just not that
free. I'm, I'm real closed off.

229
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,620
I'd be so nervous when it you to what?
To do that?

230
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,510
Like I get a hot tub with like a married
couple and then it depends on the

231
00:15:56,511 --> 00:16:00,230
setting. I don't know. Strangers
go. It depends on like the,

232
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,780
in other words I guess if they're
like come over to my house. Yeah,

233
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,580
I'd be nervous if you're staying at a
hotel and there was people around and it's

234
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,130
like, oh yeah, the hot
tub. Okay. Oh right.

235
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:13,810
Cause then you could just go to your room
and you have a way out. Yeah. It's like,

236
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,120
but like if someone's like, come over,
it was good in the hot tub. Yeah.

237
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,840
I would be nervous. But I think
roofie you and put stuff in your,

238
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,700
but only they want to do that.
But if they did,

239
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,560
do you think your bark will
be less tonight? That I can
sleep in our marital bed.

240
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,060
I think we may have a chance tonight.
Maybe

241
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,300
truth be told, I kind of like
my little ventless. Yeah,

242
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,220
cause you like he, it's hot
here right now. Now it's not.

243
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,770
I want to make it cooler again.
I like the freedom.

244
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,830
I don't have to hear dogs scratching
and you snoring or working.

245
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,380
And it's kind of like my own
little private Idaho. Well,

246
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:00,500
I'll give a shout out to old wheeler
who, uh, came through last week.

247
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,050
That was great.
That was great.

248
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:06,170
Except that my camera wasn't
working and that's a problem.

249
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,890
But that was my fault I think. Yeah.
It wasn't in any of the videos,

250
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,350
so that's probably why you liked it
so much. That episode. That's true.

251
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,970
That's true. It really is warm in here.
Stop Yourself. It's true. It's not.

252
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,410
It's 74. It's freezing. It's
warm. There's lights on. It's hot.

253
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,030
Maybe it's cause you're wearing a long
sleeve tee. It's fine. It's light.

254
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,090
It's just an undershirt.
No. How can men do that?

255
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:33,770
I was watching that movie last night.
They were like a white tank under a white.

256
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:38,450
See through. That doesn't look good,
right? Oh my God, I was a a war machine.

257
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,830
Well that doesn't look, but then
all you see is the tank through the,

258
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,820
the white shirt. That doesn't
look good. It looks weird.

259
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:49,190
But I guess what are your options,
I guess as a man?

260
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,930
Are you done now ruining my life?
I hate when you do this.

261
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:59,370
It's so cold. When will you
be happy? It feels normal.

262
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,090
You know, we had our closet remodeled,
we didn't even talk about this.

263
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:08,140
We didn't have a closet for
like three weeks. So hard.

264
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,260
It was hard actually not having
anywhere to put your stuff.

265
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,210
And what we realized is that Tom and
I have nothing. We have no clothes,

266
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,130
we can't even fill it.

267
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,260
And I realized that I only
own lounge pants. Like I have,

268
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:28,261
like I'm becoming loungy pants and a 40
year old woman mom and all I own is like

269
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,200
comfortable shit.
And then the most comfortable stuff,

270
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,010
we only wear like two or three
things. Yeah, it's fine with me.

271
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,490
I don't mind that either. I dedicated
an entire drawer to just black tops.

272
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,520
I love it.
Just black.

273
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,580
Yeah. I have a lot of the same
tee shirts over and over for,

274
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,430
it's what I like that there's no need
or thought I had more. I have nothing.

275
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,430
I like it that way. No, I don't
want to get overwhelmed with,

276
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,620
cause I'm always trying to
get rid of stuff anyways.

277
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,950
Yeah. We're always decluttering
in this house, sell there. Uh,

278
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,010
so we invited, we've been sick this
week. Of course. The minute. Yeah, we,

279
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,160
I got home from Seattle and the kid
is sick and then we got the cold.

280
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,620
Everybody's sick.
Um,

281
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,410
but you invited cousin Bri Bri over on
Sunday and they have a little one as

282
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,050
well.
And you kind of,

283
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,450
I mean we're on the line of not
contagious anymore, honestly.

284
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,360
But as a, as a parent
courtesy, you kind of take,

285
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,840
you err on the side of
caution and you go like, ah,

286
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,290
maybe we shouldn't let that baby around
our baby who's still got a snotty nose.

287
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,730
But you are like,
screw it and invite him over.

288
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,870
Well, here's the thing. This is our
second time making plans with them.

289
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,840
Yeah. And the, the last time
that we made plans with them,

290
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,970
I canceled like two hours before when
I had that stomach thing going on.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,430
Diarrhea. But that's because
I was taking, I was sick.

292
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,080
I was taking an antibiotic
that gave me diarrhea. Yeah.

293
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,970
And my parents were in town. It
was terrible. So now it's like,

294
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,660
it's the end of a cold.
The boy is much better.

295
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm feeling better now.
I was a little Shitty,

296
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:13,140
but I knew I was on the way out so it
was like I could call him and give him a

297
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:13,531
warning,

298
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:17,640
but I know how cautious he is and the
warning he would take too seriously.

299
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,781
So I was like,

300
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:22,230
I just won't give them a warning and then
maybe when he gets here he'll be like,

301
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,350
oh I get nervous and you like that.
And I thought that'd be funny. Yeah,

302
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,740
to watch them sweat a little bit.
But he didn't at all. He did great.

303
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,300
Yeah, he really was a little excited about
it. I was like, oh maybe he'll be, yeah,

304
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,800
maybe he'll be like extra cautious,
but I think is funny. Yeah, I like,

305
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:43,020
I like that too when people get
freaked out cause I get freaked out.

306
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,390
I'm like this,
it's like this kind of thing.

307
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:47,310
Do you think this is
horrible or hilarious?

308
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,710
It's a guy's driving a golf cart
and they went up like over a small,

309
00:21:03,711 --> 00:21:07,280
like a dirt hill. I guess it was
probably a, maybe an eight foot,

310
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,880
10 foot hill and then their
cart flip them off of the front.

311
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,710
I like golf carts and,
and silliness and golf carts.

312
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,250
So I'm going to go for funny.
Yeah. Because they knew
what they were getting into.

313
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,680
They could have gotten really hurt
right there. They could have what?

314
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:25,790
They've made a choice and they did it
and yeah. They don't look, I don't know.

315
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,280
Yeah. Golf carts. Shit's hilarious to me.
It's so much fun. Golkar really held up.

316
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,050
I thought it would flip or
something. It's just, yeah,

317
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,970
I kind of held up really well this is
like, um, that true TV show I used to do.

318
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,370
Yeah. Where it was, it was
like wild is TV, right? Yeah.

319
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,990
This is all the videos we cover and then
I have to be like the next time the guy

320
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:46,120
says that you gotta do that.

321
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,520
Like you'd have your dark jokes
from race to write like tons,

322
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,920
tons of jokes for these kinds of
clips. Yeah. Very. The, the, um,

323
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,200
when you watch those
shows in mind numbing,

324
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,490
you could tell which jokes were written
by the producers and which jokes written

325
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,260
by the world's dumbest.

326
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:03,390
That was the name of the show because
the producers jokes were like pretty sure

327
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,060
the worse, yeah, yeah, yeah. It would feed
to feed us, try to feed us jokes on, um,

328
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,600
the, the other true TV show.
How do we have to be a grown
up? And we'd be like, no,

329
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,080
we never did. I don't want to
say that. You want to say that?

330
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:18,860
Can you say a version of
that? No, I know I sell that.

331
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:23,420
They used to give me a sheet of jokes and
there was a couple of writers I really

332
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:26,750
like their shit and I could tell who
wrote and I'd be like, oh, I like that.

333
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:30,530
I'll say that, but literally just 20
that I'd be like, pass, pass, pass.

334
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,550
We had a really funny producer once and
we had a really unfunded producer on

335
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:38,150
that. But yeah, they
would, they would be like,

336
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,790
can you say it without cursing? And I'd be
like, okay, I guess I fucking can. Yeah,

337
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,620
sure. Fuck face and be like, all right.

338
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,650
I remember the guy that
was a bad director for us.

339
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:52,450
Like he would come in just stone faced,
which you can't do to colleagues.

340
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,410
You can't just be like totally anatomy
did I know? So it doesn't play.

341
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,920
No. So weird. Um,

342
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,230
another observation did I have,
oh, well I'm very observant.

343
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,220
I am the, um, observation
champ. So, uh, as you know,

344
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,510
4th of July. Is that tomorrow? Yeah.

345
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,090
And you and I were just talking about
how we could give zero fucks about 4th of

346
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,250
July and seeing fireworks. No
care. No, I don't care. I can't,

347
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,650
I can't remember the last time
I do photos of them. Right.

348
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,000
I think the photos of the
fireworks are the dumbest July 5th,

349
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:35,570
when every asshole post pictures of
fireworks. I mean, there's nothing worse.

350
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,030
Like a frame uninspiring of the
before the flare out please.

351
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:44,240
You like, you just see like five dots.
Right. You know, you're like, oh, in a,

352
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:48,770
in a moment. This a, a big thing.
His, here's the moment before that.

353
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,240
But it just doesn't translate.

354
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,170
And the glory of live fireworks versus
your tiny little shitty camera picked.

355
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,500
It's like taking a picture of
the moon. Yeah. Look at the moon.

356
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,480
I like it doesn't translate right.
Here's these clouds,

357
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,950
but that doesn't translate.
Clouds are clouds or even
down in the fireworks. Yeah,

358
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,340
I'm seeing fireworks,
but I can't think of a of a thing worse.

359
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,440
Like you have to park,
you go to the,

360
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,220
the local community college or
wherever they're showing the fireworks.

361
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,150
You just sit around with a bunch
of assholes. It's, it's terrible.

362
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,610
I hate when it's a big crowd. I don't
like big crowds. There's nowhere to pee.

363
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,980
Yeah, we're, can I say? Yeah. And then the
other thing is like on a day like that,

364
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,180
you find a place to pee and then it's a,
it's a beverage consumption day. Yeah.

365
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,030
So right away you go back to where
your group is, you're drinking again.

366
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:42,470
You're like, shit, I gotta go back.
Yeah. That always happens to me.

367
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,790
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's like, that's why
I hate being at places like that.

368
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,030
So do I just cause I want a comfortable
place to pee or Porta potties.

369
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,700
Disgusting.
So then,

370
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,060
and then you need a bracelet to get back
into the thing or wherever. Like ah boy,

371
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,900
get your life. I'm not even doing it.
Concerts. That's way concerts piss me.

372
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:04,280
Hey concerts too. Even a
sporting event, you know, you
go, it's like drinking beers.

373
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:08,480
I gotta pee. Where is it? Well you got
to walk up these six flights of stairs,

374
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,880
right? And then you're
what? Oh, you're on. Okay.

375
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:15,881
So on Terminal One you go left down
and go to l l O it's only a women's.

376
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,130
Oh, sorry. So you go back through,

377
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,840
go to the k gate and there's a restroom
there and you're like Jesus Christ and

378
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:27,500
do all that. You get your other beverage
and you're like, I gotta pee again.

379
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,730
A nightmare. That sucks. And then
your food options are limited.

380
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,080
It's like a hot dog and a hot dog, which
I love hot dogs, but I can't, you know,

381
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,780
I can't do that. It make me
feel sick now to eat them. Yeah.

382
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,250
Can't do it at 40 it's like
over fuck a firework. Showman.

383
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,340
And whether the neat part is in La,
I'm sure everywhere.

384
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:51,200
But you get to hear people shooting
guns and shooting Stata guns go off.

385
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. You get to hear it.

386
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:57,080
Two days before 4th of July or a week
before and then a week after Jesus.

387
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,460
What are you doing?
Why are you shooting guns in the sky?

388
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,590
Morons do want to hear this song.
That DJ boy butter set in. Yeah.

389
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,450
It's called be retarded. He
took the, would you rather
be with my parents? I mean,

390
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:12,210
he's done some amazing songs already,
but this is his latest one.

391
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,073
That's really great.

392
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,500
Would you rather be retarded or
you have to drive on the freeway.

393
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,410
Okay. Okay. To retired
then pass. That's fine.

394
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,040
Would you rather have four
penises on your forehead?

395
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,980
I dog
penis in my foods type or pills.

396
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,420
I can probably handle them
up with Nancy balls. Okay.

397
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,880
She's got a nice set of lungs. Okay.
She's had some work done. All right. Okay.

398
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,490
You'll get upset with it.
Okay.

399
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,220
Okay. Oh Shit. Yeah.

400
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,470
Would you rather only eat
Asian food? No, I go retarded.

401
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,373
Okay.

402
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,420
I'm not going to eat dog. Okay. Oh Shit.

403
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,240
Amazing. That's so funny. I like that.
Your Dad, you're going to be retired.

404
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,470
That's fine. Okay. Okay.

405
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:39,050
I'd rather go retarded. Does he say
Gallery Darden? I'd go retired. Yeah.

406
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,770
Uh, I love your dad's hatred
of Asian food, which you know,

407
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,130
I think that's one of my favorites.
Is Asian girl retarded? Yeah,

408
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,380
they created the noodle. Oh my God. I
mean Asian suppressed. I think if they,

409
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,130
they gave this scenario
to everyone on earth,

410
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,870
there'd be one retarded
guy walking around.

411
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,620
It'd be my dad and everybody else
would be like, this food is delicious.

412
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,360
Asian foods the best for so many
different kinds. Too many options. Yeah.

413
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:10,020
You could do something that I'm going
to use dog. Alright. He's serious.

414
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,700
That shows you how underexposed
to this cuisine he is.

415
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,320
He just telling him the stereotypical
worst thing that exists now.

416
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:25,060
You can dog. I love my
dogs. They no need. Yeah,

417
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,420
yeah, yeah. I mean, look,
when I was in Korea,

418
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:31,780
they did warn us not to eat the
street meat cause there was,

419
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,310
there were reports of dog meat being
sold. Yeah. That's those in Seoul.

420
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,300
I don't know, but that's my outcome on,
yeah. He don't eat dog all the time.

421
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,110
You just said that like, like him though.
He said yeah, come on. Come on, come on.

422
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,200
Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright. Alright.

423
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,590
Today he goes, we were, we were
face timing cause LJ was playing.

424
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,490
It'd being adorable. Yeah, it does
put Christina get over here. Yeah.

425
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,630
Didn't you see that today? I was like,
Oh shit. He got his power suit on today.

426
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,500
You were in a suit. He got a suit
on. I know you were saying that,

427
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:08,020
that he always dressed that
way when you were a kid.

428
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,930
You saw it everyday at work every day.
And then the khaki this,

429
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:12,940
that's how that came.
That's dressed down.

430
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:15,470
That's why that stuff down because for
him and technically is dressed down,

431
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:19,720
it sure is. Yeah. He looks
handsome in his suit. Sure.

432
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,210
So it looks great on most guys. Yeah.
If you look like shit a suit, yeah.

433
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,800
It really cleans up your whole act.

434
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:30,820
And the one thing that we talk about
it a lot, he and I do. Um, I can,

435
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:32,680
I all right is

436
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,390
if you wear this one thing that's
fun is to watch how people treat you

437
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:40,120
differently because they do it. Yeah.
You're gonna like the way you look,

438
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,050
they treat you weigh guarantee to just
make assumptions about you in a good way

439
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,770
usually. Yeah. Dressing
up is a, is a huge factor.

440
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:51,610
People assume that you're richer,
smarter, everything. Yeah.

441
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:55,330
They assume that you, that you have
your shit together more. I mean,

442
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:59,110
cause you and I are, you've gone car
shopping and you said that people will be,

443
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,450
oh my God mean to you.
Belittling to you.

444
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,380
They have basically walked
me out of dealerships cause
you look like a homeless.

445
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,640
Uh, it's weird derelicts. It's La La is a,

446
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,550
a well known dressed down place.
Yeah. People dress down here.

447
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,530
Oh you'd be a billionaire
and you look like a scumbag.

448
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,920
And I've walked in and they're like,
are you like taking pictures of cars?

449
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,690
Was going to shopping for one and
they're like, uh Huh. Um, yeah.

450
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:27,740
And then there'll be like, this is,
you know, this is not a free car.

451
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,740
Was that a contest? I'll be like,
I know man. Yeah. And they like,

452
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,320
just keep looking at you.
And they're like,

453
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,840
are you sure you don't
want to see the other?

454
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,280
Like they'll talk me like you want
to see the cheaper one? I'm like,

455
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:40,930
what is it going on? And I feel
like I have to be like, no, I, I,

456
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,450
I really am here to actually buy a car.
Do you think it's the beard?

457
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,420
I guess that's a whole look.
I guess Camilo says, um,

458
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,810
I'm going to steal something I guess.

459
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,130
Yeah. Interesting.
Speaking of Asian cuisines,

460
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:57,460
I had a thought I like to ask
you about this. What is that?

461
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,630
Which cuisine gives you
the worst farts personally?

462
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,500
What do you think gives
you the smelliest farts?

463
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,790
It's a tie between high vegetable content.

464
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,430
Oh,
and a high seafood content

465
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,020
for you. What about like spice and
heat cook curry or a, but I mean,

466
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,390
I don't think it's,
it's the worst

467
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,170
of all. No. So I think

468
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,240
can we give a nationality of
the food or hard to say, I mean,

469
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,260
I feel like it's an ingredient.
I don't know if you're,

470
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,390
if you're going by cuisine.
See the thing is,

471
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:36,620
I went to a Sushi place last week that
was amazing, but it was really authentic.

472
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,820
I mean, the guy is, you
know, fresh off the boat,

473
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,590
there's no roles. He was like
ordering us not to use soy sauce.

474
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,990
And I had no digestive issues whatsoever.
Really freshest fish,

475
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,260
the best stuff I've ever had. But
do you go to like a boar, you know,

476
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,840
neighborhoody joint and you're getting
roles and all that stuff and I blow it up

477
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:00,674
my ass.

478
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,760
I think it's the fried
component to those roles.

479
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,960
Maybe we get that hot night role
and it's got shrimp Tempura in it.

480
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:11,080
And I swear that makes you shit.
Or the spicy.

481
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:15,880
Manet's but I'm talking about farts.
I'm not talking about browns. Yeah.

482
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:17,770
Hmm.

483
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,770
I think Vietnamese might give me the
worst farts I could co sign on that idea

484
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,910
for you.
Uh,

485
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,170
I used to get far from this
place in silver lake that we,

486
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,000
we lived when we lived there and I swear
those farts, we're just rancid. Yeah.

487
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,110
Rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten.

488
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,410
I feel like you have a few
places that do bad things to you.

489
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,370
Ty is like, oh, that's an instant fart
maker. They may as well just call it far.

490
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,720
Makings Fart. Make
Curry Fart car rate. Oh,

491
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,490
when I was in San man friend disco,

492
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:53,580
that's what did me in Penang Curry
before my show and that they,

493
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,560
they texted me like, are you telling,
Jeez, I had to finish my shit.

494
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,730
Wow. That's amazing. Jean,

495
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,700
do you know we got an
email that said hygiene?

496
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,010
We all know Bert is fat. Yeah. Right.

497
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:13,030
That's something that
we all know. Yeah. Um,

498
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,120
well we all,
everyone in the world knows that now.

499
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:19,923
So

500
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,630
I love the internationally bird is
known to be fat as where are you fat?

501
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,690
But did you know that burnt Chrysler
Sr is on team Tommy. Wow. Wow.

502
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:35,691
Glass in through an old 1997 rolling
stone article about Bart's partying.

503
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:40,230
Stan Ama.
I came across this amazing blurb.

504
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,770
Burt's father hated Burt's goatee.

505
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,040
He wants offered Burt
$500 to get rid of it.

506
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,120
The only reason Burt had grown it
out was to cover his double chin,

507
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,650
but for the bucks he shaved it off,
seeing it gone.

508
00:33:55,651 --> 00:34:00,330
The first thing his father
had said was fat boy. Wow.

509
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,430
Oh boy. Listen to those big tits. Fart.

510
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,350
Love Umami Ryan from
Schlong Guyland Jude Dork.

511
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,300
Wow. Wow. We have to bring that up to
Barton person. I had no idea about that.

512
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:14,720
Um,

513
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,890
you've been taking a lot of shifts
every day. I feel like too many.

514
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:24,350
I think we can ask our audience,
how many shifts a day do you take?

515
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:28,320
I don't take a ridiculous amount at all.
Downloaded a counter app just like it.

516
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:32,660
Keep track for it to go from one to two.
Well or three.

517
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,040
You say you had three in a day and that's
normal. That was not, it was normal.

518
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,810
I'll look on our next door APP. Somebody
writes wanting to set up a compost pile.

519
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,433
Oh,

520
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,350
I love,
I think of nothing worse

521
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,900
here. Gene, read this. You know, I'm
thinking this is your wheel house. Gosh,

522
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,053
out loud.

523
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,861
Hey,
hey guys.

524
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:59,820
I was listening to the podcast the other
day and you were talking about people

525
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:03,780
talking loudly on the phone or watching
videos that are ridiculous volume.

526
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,760
This is my ultimate pet peeve.

527
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,570
I'm a fireman and I work in a
lower income neighborhood. Well,

528
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:13,470
the other day the crew was walking into
the grocery store and there was a guy

529
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:16,110
standing out front listening to music

530
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,260
on a Fucking Dre Beats
Bluetooth speakers on fucking 11

531
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,173
at that instant,

532
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,770
I completely forgot that I was in my
uniform and went into a rage in my head.

533
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,010
The only thing I could do,
mind you,

534
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,910
this isn't a predominantly
black neighborhood. I'm
about as white as they come.

535
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,490
The funniest part is to do,
just looked at me,

536
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,850
turned down his speaker
and went feel you and word.

537
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,170
So I guess your theory is right.
If you're a black voice is on point,

538
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,630
it will elicit a response. Fireman, Mike,

539
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,610
I guess if you're black voices,
I'm going, why did you, uh,

540
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,850
I'm not going to say the n word anymore.

541
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,370
I am not going to say we're reading
an email. It's a guy, not a girl.

542
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,940
But why don't you always feel like I'm
reading something and I'm repeating.

543
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:11,610
Something will change.
I just,

544
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:15,370
I can't take the abuse because I don't
want the songs to come in and the remixes,

545
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,830
all. Anyone wants it. All right,

546
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:23,700
I'll give it to you. He turned down
a speaker. I went feel you Nigga.

547
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,330
Why would you say that? So I guess
your theory is right for black boys.

548
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:31,980
Don't point it will elicit a
response. I yelled, headphones.

549
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,970
I can't believe you actually
said it. I know. I just, yeah,

550
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,700
I don't think I read that part. The only
thing, I didn't read that part, I'm sorry.

551
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:41,760
The only thing I could do, what was
take a page from Tom's book. Sorry,

552
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:42,780
I skipped a line.

553
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:48,110
So basically this guy yelled headphones
and the best black guy voice I can do.

554
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,080
So he yelled it's headphones.
Headphones, like you do bikes.

555
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,110
I skipped a line. Yeah.
Oh, that's so funny.

556
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,880
And then he was like, all
right, man. That's so funny.

557
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,820
That's so funny.
Can I read an email?

558
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,930
Very important to and of course high
Hitler's a couple of times in the last two

559
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:10,710
weeks I've noticed something interesting
when I go to the bathroom at work.

560
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,750
We all know about the age
old brown cleanup preferences
like standing or sitting

561
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,350
folding or scrunching and front
to back versus back to front.

562
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,500
But this observation
at work had me baffled.

563
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,250
How many times do you swipe across your
brown maker with a single serving of

564
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:33,960
toilet paper? Personally, for the
last 27 years I've been wiping myself.

565
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,990
I've only ever done one pass and it's
onto a new clean bunch of toilet paper.

566
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,080
This guy I heard was going back and
forth upwards of 25 times with the same

567
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:49,440
handful of TP.
I don't care how clean I think I am.

568
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,970
I am not risking the chance of smearing
brown all over my, I'm curious,

569
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,810
curious, so foul, a common cleanup
strategy and what your thoughts on my God,

570
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,070
you guys are so disgusting
person had one thing I told him,

571
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,790
ah, like sandpaper. Well it's all
about how many passes you take. Now,

572
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,760
he doesn't say I,

573
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,270
I'm assuming he means once and then
like a fold over and then you go back.

574
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,530
But he says the same paper,

575
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,910
so it's literally one pass
and then again on the same.

576
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,150
No, you can't do that. I don't do that.

577
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,580
I fold over and then I go and then
of course, yeah, no, you have a,

578
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,660
you have a thing. Okay. Not do
the pass again. So if you have,

579
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:41,680
if you have, if you have
this, you would wipe. Yeah,

580
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,910
you would fold it. Maybe if it was
like Super Chunky, you'd be like,

581
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:48,980
I'm dropping that. Yeah. But if
you were trying to conserve you,

582
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:53,920
we folded a second time and then you
drop it, drop it. Yeah. Like van go,

583
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:58,060
I'm gonna fold that. And then when I
followed that, no, no, but is he saying,

584
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,110
come here, give me that piece of
paper. I thought what he was saying,

585
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,700
is it somebody he's asking
something different.

586
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:07,430
He's saying that somebody
went like sh yeah,

587
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,040
like same piece of paper all in the same
way. I think he's asking if it's pass,

588
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,640
pass, pass. That's nasty. That's
not even worth discussing.

589
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,430
Disgusting beyond belief, but I didn't
know people were capable of that.

590
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,760
I didn't even know that was a,
anything you can't do that.

591
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,840
You can't go back on the same paper.
That is nasty,

592
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,860
real nasty.
Uh,

593
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,350
let's bring it chest and balance is
critical to ensuring that your store is

594
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:40,820
built with the h vac system
you've specified so that
it operates as efficiently

595
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:42,230
and comfortably as possible.

596
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,760
The chest and balance from should be
independent and what direction to ensure

597
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,470
your best interests are represented.

598
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,230
The firm should also be certified by a
National Organization such as in ebb a, B,

599
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:55,910
c or t a,
B B,

600
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,930
to ensure basic quality standards are
met and industry exempted procedures are

601
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:03,080
used. Cool. Didn't get enough though.

602
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,020
Upon arrival to the job site,

603
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,500
the technician meets the general
contractor's superintendent

604
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,350
you meeting. That's my
favorite one. The uh,

605
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,630
the guy meets the other guy and then they
showed them like, hi, nice to meet you.

606
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,720
Well, he didn't understand that someone
when it looks like when people meet. Fuck.

607
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,590
Amen. HBB You want to see
a mom boner HPP? Yeah,

608
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,480
it's Kinda weird. It's a mom boner, but
she's like friendly. She's like excited.

609
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,990
Yeah. Sounds almost
angry. But it's actually

610
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,360
also like inviting. It's,
it's really bizarre. Okay.

611
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,410
She's watching like a
speedboat raced in the,

612
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:44,610
I think in West Virginia or something. Uh,
where? West Virginia. Virginia. Virginia.

613
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,600
Yes.

614
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,260
I think this is Charlie honey.

615
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:53,920
Yeah,

616
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,840
that's Charlie. Oh my
God. Get your passenger

617
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,710
son of a bitch.

618
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,933
Dammit.

619
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,210
Dirty Bitch.
Think she smokes.

620
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,470
That's one thing I've learned from
these clips more than anything is how

621
00:41:16,471 --> 00:41:19,620
horrible you sound when you've been
a smoker your whole life. This lady,

622
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,980
I feel like we never get to see her and
I feel like I could draw a picture of

623
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,790
her. Yeah. Me See what I had pictured
or what's your picture? Well, it's um,

624
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:32,040
it's dirty blonde. Like she used to
bleach, bleach it and now kind of messier.

625
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,010
She's tail stringed out.
She's got big hoop earrings.

626
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,480
She's got a low cut,

627
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,960
a sleeveless shirt with like too much
like jewelry that doesn't really match up.

628
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,740
But there's a lot of it.
It's kind of tacky,

629
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,600
like maybe three or four necklaces
and maybe there's a ring on,

630
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,440
you know, eight out of 10 fingers.
Right. And some bracelets,

631
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,600
a big sloppy hangers.
Kimber wine, big old slop.

632
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:03,350
No Bra for sure. Um, she
goes through, I dunno,

633
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,340
maybe two packs a day and um,
she drinks,

634
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,140
she has a road cools or no, Virginia
slims or something, you know,

635
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:16,940
something long Capris or something.
Yeah, she has a lot of roadies. You know,

636
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:21,800
when she goes on, when she gets in the
car, it's got a big like tub thing.

637
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:27,710
Some people drink ice tea out of it,
but it's like a 32 ounce and she,

638
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,580
she has her, her road drink. You
know. Interesting. I went dark hair.

639
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,410
I'm going to go, uh, big and
pretty bad. I don't think so.

640
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,950
I think smell can keep,
it's supposed to keep you a little trick.

641
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,760
I don't think she's five bills, but I
think she's like, she's abroad to 20.

642
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,560
I'm going to go. Ah, I'm
curly. Shoulder length,

643
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:52,640
brown hair and kind of a
melody caught not a mullet,

644
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:57,440
but melody where it's shorter
on the sides. Sexual passes.
Terrifying to go over.

645
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,350
She's a real, she's a swamp
person. Like she's a pig. Um,

646
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,100
I'm going to go for a t shirt
with a silly slogan on it.

647
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:07,840
Like what the kind of her
neck large or like an,

648
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,510
I'm an aggressive fluent in sarcasm.

649
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,390
Yeah. Stuff like that. Fuck. Are
you looking at whatever? Yeah.

650
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,530
They don't call me bitch for
nothing. Whatever. Damn slogan. Uh,

651
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,860
faded blue jeans
and flip flops.

652
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:30,230
She bought sh the cheap
one from like Safeway,

653
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,490
Kroger and we don't have that on the
west coast, but she goes to Kroger.

654
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,610
She gets the flip flops from Kroger.
Go ahead.

655
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,970
Well,
you guys are doing well.

656
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,473
Why?

657
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,680
Yeah. After I got booths,
soup and everything,

658
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,210
you guys are doing good.
Hey,

659
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:14,130
I got you on video.
He's going to get hit.

660
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,970
That bolt's going to come back, smack
them right on that. Can I tell you that?

661
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,140
Of all the scenarios of human existence,

662
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,950
hers would be like,
I would rather,

663
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,060
I would probably rather be
a sex worker in Bangladesh.

664
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,480
Have that life than be her.
I don't think so.

665
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,840
Repeat what you said to yourself
out loud a couple times.

666
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,440
Visualize sex worker life in
Bangladesh. Right? And Making Mousse.

667
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,930
It sounds better than this and this
woman's life. I don't think so.

668
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,990
I mean the fact that you are born in
America, I'm assuming she's American,

669
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:58,140
she has all these opportunities
afforded, Eh, you know,

670
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:03,141
and you've pissed your life into being
a river person who screams at people you

671
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:06,390
know, you failed, you
failed. I think it's good.

672
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,850
I don't think you want to be
a sex worker in Bangladesh.

673
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,700
Potato Patato you know what I mean?
She's made a lot of bad choices.

674
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,440
Grs that. I got that on video. She says,

675
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,260
can I,
can I say what really annoys me too?

676
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:40,510
I hate that personality where somebody
messes up. Like Raymond made a mistake.

677
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:40,991
Clearly.

678
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,860
I don't know if he did this intentionally
to his friend in a race and then the

679
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:49,840
person has to chastise I j Ray man.
Yeah. You went in, you did that wrong.

680
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,823
Fucked up.

681
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Like they love to pre no
harp on the person that did
made an innocent mistake or

682
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:00,160
something like that.
That makes me crazy.

683
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,730
It's like they thrive on making
you feel like shit for something.

684
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:08,710
You did hate it.
Who Soup?

685
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,583
Oh,

686
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,500
this is what I feel like a real highlight
for her. I think she really enjoys it.

687
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,340
Yelling at people. No, I mean like
the watching the little boat race.

688
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,250
That's why she lives on the river there.
O m g

689
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,700
and then the laugh

690
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,850
dirty. Yeah. What if I would
turning into that gross?

691
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:46,360
Would you divorce me? Oh, a hundred
percent seriously. Later. Yeah.

692
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,500
It would take you a while to turn
into that. You can't be that tomorrow.

693
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,720
20 years of smoking. Right,
but then I would, yeah,

694
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,230
I would take off God damn sleeve.
You're making your move soup everyday.

695
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,900
That's how you'd get your next guy. He'd
be like, Yo, I was single for a while,

696
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,950
but then I learned this moose soup
recipe and the guys just started coming

697
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:10,510
around.
I heard you getting married.

698
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,780
Yeah. And we're serving
moves soup at the assumption

699
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,690
is that the crop stuck
in my craw. Hey, okay.

700
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,700
Would you rather be married to that lady
moose soup lady or the girl that does

701
00:47:24,971 --> 00:47:29,050
all those fart videos and the shed the
shed videos. Cause remember you were like,

702
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,810
I want it to be the fart mistress you did.
And you go, I don't want to be married.

703
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,460
The fart mistress and we've,
we have the URL reserved.

704
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:40,870
So yeah, I'm, I'm not going
to let you hold me back. Yeah.

705
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,073
Hmm.

706
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:50,040
Yeah,
yeah.

707
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,800
Oh good.

708
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,490
Yes. It's like a monster. So
not her though. This shed lady.

709
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,020
I'm the shed lady and I do Fort Mister
Star Com and that's my job. Right.

710
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,900
And anybody that does a
Google search can find that.

711
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,390
And I'm your wife or your the moose
and the Moose Soup Lady. Yeah,

712
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:18,030
I dad get it here. I got more bad
5% foreign ministers was attractive.

713
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,970
If I didn't know she was making farts
in that shed, I would be like, yeah,

714
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:22,260
she's a good enough looking lady.

715
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,800
But you dropped our son off at school
and everybody knows you're married to

716
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:28,770
Fargo stories. Yeah, I mean I
would get over the shame quickly.

717
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:32,820
I think I'd be much more ashamed
to be married to moose soup lady.

718
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:38,210
I find I find her voice
repulsive. Yeah. Damn.

719
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,910
Let me suck your cat cam on.
Please let me lick your ass.

720
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,130
Would you let her know she's so gross.
She sounds disgusting.

721
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,800
I don't want any part of it.
How would you go down on me? Ah,

722
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:56,060
no guys. Oh my dad's actually,
you know that God might did stop.

723
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,370
It's, I think it's just the approach to
sex that we need to work on it with her.

724
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,500
She'd say it out right?
There's a way to get in.

725
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,431
Hi,

726
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:08,431
I'm Roxanne de Palma and I want to know
who out there is curious about eco sex.

727
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,740
And you're like, what the
fuck is eco sex, right?

728
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:13,983
Yeah.

729
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,470
Well, um, I hate everybody.
I hate the world.

730
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,450
Oh, the wind in your hair can
be stimulating into the lading,

731
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,690
the texture of tree bark.
I mean,

732
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:36,500
that's exciting in itself to really let
your fingertips run across the tree.

733
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:39,250
Bark and feel it erotic.
Goodness.

734
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,610
You want to fuck a tree?

735
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,403
Yeah,

736
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,410
I hate these people. Do you want, um,

737
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,150
would you have lesbian eco
sex with the Moose Hoop Lady?

738
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,700
Uh,
what or,

739
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:00,150
or you have to live in the fart shed
and I'd smell her all that lady's farm.

740
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,860
Well, here's the thing. Most
soup lady never goes outside,

741
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,850
has no idea what outside in that video.
Yeah,

742
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:12,020
but she's not going to tie
yourself to a tree. This is,

743
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,360
this is the proposal and live in the
Fart Shetty and I'd be left alone.

744
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,100
This is terrible.

745
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:24,710
I want you to know that I will be tying
up a real live human for your viewing

746
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:28,640
pleasure.
We're going to a tutorial

747
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:29,690
and a scene,

748
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,900
so you'll get to see me and my
girlfriends summer on an upcoming video.

749
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,830
Summer, summer. Got Bands, have ECOSOC

750
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,420
close up on that.

751
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,420
It looks like a big hooded clit upside
down and the entrance to the vagina is

752
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:53,220
right in here. It's pretty sexy,
I think. Yeah. Yep. Oh my God.

753
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,780
Over people.
Jen found gentle.

754
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,530
If you ever go straight for
the clit and be so gentle,

755
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:02,780
like barely touch it,

756
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,180
I'm going to don't spit after
me. You stupid bitch. Wow.

757
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,910
You got really upset with, well,
I just think it's another racket.

758
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:14,690
It's another one of these Weirdos is
trying to make a buck off of innocent

759
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:16,880
people and like,
I don't feel like it's genuine.

760
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:20,330
That's the only thing I wish this
lady really love fucking trees.

761
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:23,210
That's what I'm saying.
If you really are in a tree fucking,

762
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:27,050
you're not making videos,
you're just doing it and
you're, you know, nobody knows.

763
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,400
Yeah. Keep it a secret. Hillary
Clinton, my asshole. Okay.

764
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:34,250
Seckler sick.
So we're that.

765
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:37,780
Ryan would come out with that and never,
I would write,

766
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,550
I would say that he never told us.
G

767
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,840
O N J O g Jab Kubo via

768
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,400
dad paid you by their paws
like Uyg page by Deb both.

769
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:58,380
She's so grody that

770
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,140
this is pretty good. Somebody said, uh,

771
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,800
I once worked for at best
buy for a total of two hours.

772
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,850
First hour was doing orientation and I
should have know things were not going

773
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:10,480
well.

774
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,280
What everyone always had the fakest of
smiles boy and I'm being polite to the

775
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:17,830
point of being nauseous.
She votes work,

776
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:23,310
opening shift and nightmare of non robot
humans cheer squad and volleyball game.

777
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:25,990
Before the opening of the store,

778
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:31,260
I did not participate in the game and
when the time came to open should be a

779
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:33,520
roll call.
I did not say my name,

780
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:38,610
nor did I clap along to the chance
of best buy is the best by Gosh,

781
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,050
quickly singled out as non complying.

782
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,990
The manager's stared at me and
gestured for me to play along.

783
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:48,370
Immediately shaking my head and
defiance. Yeah, feeling he had no power.

784
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,860
Pulled me aside and told
me this is what they do.

785
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,280
I need to be a team player or
else I won't succeed there.

786
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:59,320
I think he understood what my position
was right when I told him to fuck off and

787
00:52:59,321 --> 00:53:00,520
walk out of the store.

788
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,450
The manager followed me outside and kept
asking why I didn't want to participate

789
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:05,284
in the warmup.

790
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,430
You felt like a winner when I said nothing
and drove off with my middle finger

791
00:53:09,431 --> 00:53:14,010
up. Keep it glassy. Chris P s
please fuck my triple. Yeah.

792
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,920
Slow way. Good for you. Good for you.

793
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,980
I feel such a connection to Chris
said a lie. I could not do that.

794
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,630
Could not be a part of that at all.
It's not worth it.

795
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,030
Can I read an email I got okay.

796
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,460
Hey,
are we are Walmart?

797
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,410
We are,
we are Walmart.

798
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,780
Oh my God. Go ahead. Alright, so we've
had many questions about blind people.

799
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,730
Uh, how do they wipe? Yeah,
I love that you're like,

800
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:52,190
this is real serious. We've
got another one. Uh, hi.

801
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:56,010
Hey Hitler's. I was just making it
brown and wiping the correct way,

802
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:01,290
but I'm wondering if blind people
can be racist. I think they can,

803
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,800
but I want to know my main
non-binary mommy's thoughts. Also,

804
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:09,080
could retarded people be racist as well?
Well, of course. Yes or no question.

805
00:54:09,081 --> 00:54:13,710
I'm on. That's a stupid
question. Nate. Ps bikes.

806
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,160
Well, I mean, obviously retarded
people, yes, they can be racist,

807
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,320
but Ken Blind people be
racist. I'm, I mean, I mean,

808
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:26,760
I look, racism is what based on the color
of your skin, that's what people say.

809
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:30,490
Yeah. But I think it's
also based on cultural, um,

810
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:35,970
stereotypes. Correct. Yeah.
I mean other things too.

811
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:41,700
I mean, a blind person is going
to pick up on, uh, somebody,

812
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,863
I dunno,

813
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:47,490
some common behavior or a perceived,

814
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,680
you know, attitude of, of somebody
that they're around and they're also,

815
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,240
there's other stimuli,
right?

816
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:59,241
So it's like they met somebody and then
somebody around them is going to say

817
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:02,820
something like, I use medic. That was
Jewish guy. You know what I mean? Like,

818
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,260
and then they're going to maybe
repeat things to them like, oh, Yep,

819
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,030
that's what it,
that's what the Jews always do.

820
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,510
And then that block is that the blind
person just is going to, oh, I can't see,

821
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:15,540
therefore I can't have a perceived,

822
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,080
I'm sure it cuts down on
racism because, yeah, I mean,

823
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:22,440
they're definitely not because you're
not making that snap judgment as quickly.

824
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:23,850
You might go,
oh,

825
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:28,851
that guy's real greedy and he's
acting Jewy and therefore he's Jesus.

826
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,520
But you'll be,
you'll be more,

827
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,540
you'll be more tentative about
your racism is what I'm saying.

828
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,880
It won't be as quick.
You'll have a real,

829
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,750
I think actually being blind makes you
more of a pure racist. I loved that.

830
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:44,970
This was the episode. You're
like, I'm not gonna say anything.

831
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:46,440
They're not going to get me anymore.

832
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:52,860
And then you just walk into it. Fuck,
it's fine. Yeah, it's fine. Look,

833
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:55,170
I don't have hate in my heart,
but I was saying that I think we,

834
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:59,400
you could really breed a more pure
racist culture with blind people.

835
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:04,350
I think the best racists actually
just more clear in their racism.

836
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,540
Pure hate because they don't see it.
Yeah. Like they're feeling like, oh,

837
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:13,300
that's a, Oh, that's this
group. I hate them the most.

838
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:18,040
Saying that that was a
Cambodian guy. Yeah, I know why.

839
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,660
I thought he was an asshole. All right.
I got you. All right. Yeah. Interesting.

840
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,130
That's so funny that there's
somebody right now that's

841
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,960
like those fucking Cambodians of course.
Definitely hate,

842
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:32,300
hate them the most. The most, the
most, the most, you know, when you,

843
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:36,540
they're more like obscure,
totally obscured,

844
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,350
but the more obscure the um, the race
of people, that's what it highlights.

845
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,400
How absurd it is.

846
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,350
Mainly more the smaller the group and
someone being like they're the worst,

847
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,320
the more you go, then that sounds
pretty crazy. Damn Lithuanians. Yeah.

848
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,350
What did they do again? Oh,
he's cooking fish outside

849
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,440
as a group. Yeah, they're
all bad. Yeah, sure.

850
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

That's a bad accent by the way.

852
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,510
Whoever did that.
Who did that?

853
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,040
Josh,
I knew it.

854
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,733

855
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,771
Thank you Josh.

856
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:37,771

862
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,340
The first batch comes

00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:18,310
Spearings and spearing with septic septic
tanks that you could basically, Huh?

881
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,990
Wow.
Yeah.

882
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,550
Firstly,
personally escorts.

883
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,010
What is Scott's

884
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,170
and modern Scotland?
Sports is a name for the bay leads.

885
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,190
Gather up together other names
a doric and scorch for the bay.

886
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,300
Derek Scott and by,
and they're probably in by,

887
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:41,130
so there's other names where the Scots
there, Derek and they're poly and thereby,

888
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,320
okay.
So far it's easy

889
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:48,870
scopes is couldn't to brain to the
Germanic family leads and as like Tang Soo

00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:56,380
Can you imagine based old dangles and
it's doctor escorts has been spoken and

892
00:59:56,381 --> 01:00:00,530
Suitland an Easter Scotland the
loans because the seventh century.

893
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:05,310
Do you know what this video ties for?
Is the most boring video? Too Boring.

894
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:10,140
What was difficult accent?
Look at this guys. No, you
better brush up their skills.

895
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,760
I go to Australia.
Gene.

896
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:15,900
This guy looks just like
this with this same stair.

897
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,000
When he tells you to suck it,
right?

898
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,580
Is it good in your mo?

899
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,980
Oh miss beer rub rub
his mouth looks so dry.

900
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,390
Do you understand what this one
was talking about? The different,

901
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:34,920
the language of where Scott and Scott
Scott's are from these old time goals and

902
01:00:34,921 --> 01:00:35,810
it's Dr stuff.

903
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:40,950
Forethought before the bangles and the
doctor and the bangles and the doctors

904
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,370
has been spoken and sooth.

905
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:47,371
Lynn and Easter Scotland and Southland
Easter Scotland on Easter and Scott.

906
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,280
Oh,
for the seventh century Ed.

907
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,600
That's easy.
Seventh century a d

908
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,930
don't mention to this lead
to be fun for instance.

909
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:04,990
And the runic carbons on the rebel
cross free Shire get and the Accenture

910
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:06,630
century Ed Baguette

911
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,760
like a Scott was that bag,
those delicious breads? No,

912
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:13,920
the Lord of the ring is Bilbo Baggins,
Bilbo Baggins.

913
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,320
So he's talking about him though.

914
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:21,310
This thing belongs to Bilbo Baggins
Scott's case done and often the and

915
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:25,210
Shetland.
The Shetland ponies.

916
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,640
Yeah. I'm going to be the miss spoken
tongue and the outs and the [inaudible]

917
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:35,500
an active saint. There it is. The
buy leads who sculpts till old stuff.

918
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,930
I'm so boring
today.

919
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:43,130
This is too boring.
Was first clearly set on a cat.

920
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,910
All right. Yeah, I know.
He really did Trump,

921
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:53,520
his accident was was trumped
by his boredom when I
studied in England and we had

922
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:58,410
to learn about like this kind of thing,
like fourth century stone carving,

923
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,800
like I don't think there's anything more
boring than looking at fourth century

924
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,920
stone carvings. I know you're
like, God, why are you,

925
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,610
and you know what the other thing is
about those things is some parts of you

926
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:10,290
sometimes like when you're a kid you go,

927
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,870
well later on in life
this will be valuable.

928
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,500
And then sometimes you look at things
you were taught and you go 20 years later

929
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,250
you're like,
that was,

930
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,310
that was as boring as I thought
it was and that was as useless

931
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,940
as I thought it was.
Like when you had the lesson here,

932
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:28,550
that shit dates historical dates
and more things happen. I'm like,

933
01:02:28,551 --> 01:02:32,910
man, I mean I'm glad I know these
things, but I don't know. Yeah,

934
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,720
I don't care. Not like humans don't
care. No, the average person isn't there.

935
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,220
That's what people care about. So
we can lose soup. Yeah. Boat Rides.

936
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,490
Getting your Dick sucked fucking trees.
There you go.

937
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:49,470
Fuck this tree with me so hot. Oh my
God, I'm gonna fuck this tree later.

938
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,880
It's truly looks like, uh, I hate that
kind of stuff. It's, it is so fake.

939
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:58,830
She's so fake. Come on. I love that. That
guy quit mid, like first day of work.

940
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:05,820
Uh, well you can't fake it. Oh
Wow. Okay. I'm another email. Okay.

941
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,840
Okay. Read it. Hi Hitler. I sincerely
love both of you in the podcast.

942
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,680
Uh, okay. That being said,

943
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:18,630
I seriously cannot stand hearing Christina
say that coffee dehydrates you even

944
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:20,490
one more time.
It angers me.

945
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,700
I know people have thought that
since like the 18 hundreds,

946
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,740
but if you do a tiny bit of research,

947
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:30,060
you will learn that the
dehydration qualities versus
the amount of water are far

948
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:34,770
more hydrating than dehydration.
Coffee actually do you hide? Sorry.

949
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,970
Coffee actually hydrates while
making you brown and more alert.

950
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:44,490
Wow. And he writes, Tom, you are
forever my water champ. Love Hitler.

951
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:48,450
Privacy's Rup now I don't agree with you.
I think that,

952
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,430
show me the research. Uh, rob simple
Google search. Well, I look, I'll,

953
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:57,120
all I've learned when I've ever been on
a diet is they consider like caffeinated

954
01:03:57,121 --> 01:04:01,620
tea and coffee to be quote negative
waters. Meaning that they are dehydrating.

955
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,980
Yeah. And you must replenish them.
Then. How come after I drink coffee,

956
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:08,670
I'm fucking thirsty.
Thirsty Shit. Interesting.

957
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:12,150
You don't fucking saying I know what
you're fucking so it's a diuretic.

958
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:17,040
It makes you piss alcohol. Same thing.
I will. Do you agree with this guy?

959
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:17,791
Well I dunno.

960
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:22,791
I mean I think what he's saying is the
amount that you're being dehydrated from,

961
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:28,011
maybe the caffeine is outweighed by
the amount of water that is in a coffee

962
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:30,870
because coffee is mostly
water, right? That's right.

963
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,850
But maybe it's negated because it makes
you pee so much and you lose more water.

964
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:39,570
The body loses water. I assumed I
would like to see more uh, data.

965
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:43,390
So,
so what I rob God,

966
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,580
you want to see the light champ?
You know we have the what,

967
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:50,310
you know what I'm saying? Ship. Yeah. They
said this is the leg champ. I might be me

968
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:54,650
mean like it's like there's like,
like we do like communication,

969
01:04:54,651 --> 01:04:59,651
like more like everyone but like certain
guys like are like good at some kind of

970
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,510
certain thing. I for example, like
someone is good at calling Nash,

971
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,540
someone is good at like DP engaged,

972
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:10,060
someone is good at like everyone like
give their opinion and then if everyone's

973
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,970
just talk each other and they
would just choose what like every,

974
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,800
everyone thinks that is
the best, you know? Oof.

975
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,330
I guys nonbinary for sure. Right? Well

976
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,990
yeah I'm also like champ. Oh my God. And
I say like, so I'm like so do I. But,

977
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,880
but he really did an astounding amount.
Right?

978
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:28,340
There was a lot like a like
for like, like, like, like,
like, like, like, like, like

979
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,460
a lot of likes in his defense.
I think English is a second language.

980
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:35,800
So maybe searching for same for you.

981
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,020
Well I guess that's your defense dad.
Get your mail.

982
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:46,420
So O m g DAB.

983
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,833
This

984
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,620
makes me really happy because
he looks like an ash tray. Yes.

985
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:57,610
Gray in color lists and I
don't think it gets real ready.

986
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,070
I think you can put a
lot of stuff on there.

987
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:05,020
You can keep on licking and she's
still like your shit. You're like,

988
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:09,890
it's pretty dry. Like, yeah, stays
like that, you know, like, um,

989
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,280
stays like that.
When I smoked cigarettes,

990
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:22,120
my pallor was always gray.
Like it does, it like sucks.

991
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:26,170
The very nutrition, the oxygen
out of you. You look gray,

992
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:28,850
everything is gray. It's
gross. Really bad for you.

993
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,930
That's what she says
right before she comes.

994
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,510
She's like, keep going, keep
them. And then her, her eyes
rolled back and she goes,

995
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,300
so Naz, she, Nancy, Nancy's. How well

996
01:06:55,990 --> 01:07:00,580
this is exciting.
I'm excited.

997
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:05,110
[inaudible] amaze. Amaze,
amaze. Where'd it go?

998
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,990
See fireworks the greatest

999
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:13,360
of all time. The greatest actor
of all time has a new movie.

1000
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,430
And we have the trailer. Oh my
God. Yes. Oh my gosh. I'm so,

1001
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,060
is it on Netflix or I don't know if it's
going to be on Netflix, so maybe it is.

1002
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,800
Maybe just straight to youtube.
Here it is.

1003
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,570
Can we read the rotten tomatoes
reviews on his films? Yeah. I mean,

1004
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:39,910
here's the movie synopsis. Action
legends, Steven Seagal headlines.

1005
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:44,911
This explosive thriller that pits US
forces against Eastern European drug

1006
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,680
cartel. Oh, great.

1007
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:51,780
When crime boss Salazar turns informant
US Marshal Jensen and his team must

1008
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,840
guard their luxury hotel safe house.

1009
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:01,410
But as cartel underboss Sinclair
who's played by UFC superstar,

1010
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:07,060
George Saint Pierre and his hit
squads to send a murderer Salazar,

1011
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:12,010
this situation explodes in raging
agent Harrison played bicycle,

1012
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:15,980
who will stop at nothing to root
out the mole that compromise

1013
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,120
the operation.
That sounds like a one long set.

1014
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:23,480
This sounds like the other, every
other movie. It's always the drug guy.

1015
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:26,960
And then he's got to train
the girl to do martial arts,

1016
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:29,210
to go get the guy in the suitcase.

1017
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:34,280
So we always lied about who they said
they were. I knew that this was my party.

1018
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,210
This is going to be like do it anymore.
And then there's a girl,

1019
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,720
there's always a young girl that he
asked the rescue from the boss teacher,

1020
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:45,120
I'd have sex and
how to have sex.

1021
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,590
They have a sex for 50 years

1022
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,640
and I am the king of in province for,
for you.

1023
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:58,220
It's so gross. Yeah. So here it is.

1024
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:02,720
I'll scout cartels. Alright, here's the
trailer. This time in eastern Europe,

1025
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:03,554
he never does

1026
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:08,290
my gym.
Confirm Beard.

1027
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,880
Very dark, very dark. It's nice and easy.

1028
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,530
He's like 60 years.
It's just jet black.

1029
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:22,700
Tim Confirm location themselves.
Salazar as the boss,

1030
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,940
a little most quiet and
cartels and eastern Europe.

1031
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:30,310
Salazar is not an eastern European name.
Ps, that's Latin, isn't it? Yeah. Salazar.

1032
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,900
That's like every drug lord name and
every movie. Right? Does it sound angel?

1033
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:37,670
It's a Latin, yeah, and they're giving
it to an eastern European guy. No Way.

1034
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,950
No Way. There's no wise or disease or
cs or Jay's and he's nine eastern block.

1035
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:44,600
We do not kill.

1036
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:53,270
Again, it's mixed. Weird, but the,
the mute, the sound is mixed. Weird.

1037
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:54,860
Again,
this is the guy to the guy.

1038
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,700
This guy I'm sure learned his lines
and then every day on set he's tall.

1039
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,050
He's like, why is he saying that? He's
like, he just improvise. ECM prompting,

1040
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:07,600
but do you hear that the voiceover is
mixed lower? Yeah. Then the background,

1041
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:08,470
you could even do that,
right?

1042
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,480
Can't even hear the voiceover
because I don't know why.

1043
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:14,420
That doesn't matter to somebody on this,
you know what I mean?

1044
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,080
Someone invested their money in making
this term. You would think they'd be like,

1045
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:19,950
can you fucking audio mixes right.

1046
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,220
It's so enormous.
Yup.

1047
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,900
I was going to say he looks good
cause they put them in a Kevlar vest.

1048
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,410
I had this shirt. Yeah, that's,
that's a bad guy's friend. Believe me.

1049
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,220
Oh you start putting on layers of things
and you kind of look like everybody

1050
01:10:36,221 --> 01:10:37,480
else.
Yeah.

1051
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,410
I good. Blended body in a
bag is a one Joseph Salizar.

1052
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,560
He'll bring it on [inaudible] side.
What are you waiting for? Soldiers go,

1053
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,780
here's a girl I used to see me alive.

1054
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,420
So there's Salazar with the east.
He's Salazar. Please talking.

1055
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,980
Everyone needs to Bryce to see me alive.
Why are you talking like that?

1056
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:06,140
Salazar?
No weirdo.

1057
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,370
Like government be like [inaudible]
or something. Yeah. Yeah.

1058
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:14,260
The government has him. Dea faked
his death. So as people would know,

1059
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:18,210
we flipped it. Salazar is going to be
a star witness for the next 10 years.

1060
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,740
The cartel once here,

1061
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,460
we have to sit in for 24 hours for
cartels going to be out to exterminate his

1062
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:25,670
entire bloodline.
How on him bad.

1063
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,340
That's George Saint Pierre.
The fighter. The fire.

1064
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,720
But can you tell already that
that has a bad acting? No,

1065
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,100
you can't look,

1066
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,520
I want him dead in the eyes. Don't
know expression. Yeah. You would say,

1067
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:46,630
here's how I do it. I want him
dead. But at least that, right.

1068
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:50,920
They're barely trying to do it.
Looked like a guy would want him dead.

1069
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:55,220
That's how you do it. There's some
expression. Right. But this like, look at,

1070
01:11:55,221 --> 01:12:00,050
look this blank stare. I
looked him dead. They're like,

1071
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,040
they're like, do it more
angry. I want him dead.

1072
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,200
W NBC. Oh wait, where's that? No,

1073
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:12,130
that was the shahs of sunset where she
was like, oh, singing. She's like, yeah,

1074
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:12,964
yeah,

1075
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:22,660
yeah. Uh, me and my friends are
on the, uh, I forget it was,

1076
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:26,970
she was like in La, can you say it
with more enthusiasm? And she was like,

1077
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:30,730
I'm singing. No. He's like, no, the
sing it. She was like, I'm going to,

1078
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,500
he's like, you don't think much. She's
like, it's all I do. And he's like, oh,

1079
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,160
it's terrible. So I'll be, can
I tell you though, honestly,

1080
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,930
I'm kind of liking the storyline.

1081
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,940
So they fake the drug lords death so
that he can be flipped for America.

1082
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:46,541
Right.

1083
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:51,541
And now the cartels after his
whole family whole bloodline.

1084
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:56,650
So I kind of like, the premise is a
solid premise. I liked those masks.

1085
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:01,270
It could be interesting or terrifying,
but why do we want to save the drug lords,

1086
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:05,110
family and everything? Why? Why do we
care is now he's on the good people,

1087
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:09,070
so we have to maintain his good faith.
Okay. Okay. All right. I'm on board.

1088
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,040
I got minute.
I want him dead Alaina and day

1089
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,060
Germany's tar bloodline.

1090
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:17,923
Sitting ducks.

1091
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,460
It's funny how all of these
movies always have a female,

1092
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:30,430
either a DEA, FBI, US marshals,

1093
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:35,050
some agent who's like unusually
attractive. That line of work.

1094
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,400
I've seen some federal officers that
are females. They don't look like that.

1095
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:44,210
Or doctors too. You'll like Katherine
Heigl is the doctor. You're like, no,

1096
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:49,250
that's not what my doctors have ever,
ever looked like a doctorate. No,

1097
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:53,430
never to that woman. She didn't need to
go to medical school, so she didn't go.

1098
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,210
We're the only one,
man.

1099
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,630
Wait a minute.

1100
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,100
You call me,
you're

1101
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,110
going to live or you're Gunna die,

1102
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:18,070
I guess on why call him because you want
the answer to, but you're going to live.

1103
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,933
Right.

1104
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,350
But that's also kind of a philosophically
you can make that statement about

1105
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:25,600
everyone. Whoever you ever call, right.

1106
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:28,670
Or whoever talks to is going to protect
you. You're, you're talking to him either.

1107
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,700
Whatever. You got to die. Yeah, that makes
sense. Right? But they're calling him.

1108
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,040
He's like,
I'm the guy you should have called first.

1109
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:40,290
Clean this mess up when you call me,
you're going to live or you're gonna die.

1110
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,660
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.
Shit. I want to live.

1111
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:48,420
Can you rephrase it by the way they're
doing them favors with these shots. Yes.

1112
01:14:48,421 --> 01:14:52,400
Is you're leaving out the hoochie.
Oh boy. See? Oh, and also layer.

1113
01:14:52,401 --> 01:14:57,130
See Leather, a thick leather
jacket. A fat guy friend. Yeah.

1114
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:02,320
Collared Shirt like I know.
And the yellow glasses.

1115
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:05,290
We're back on the yellow sunglasses.
There's them onscreen and off.

1116
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,750
It's not flattering. It's not.
It's not a good luck here.

1117
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,190
Chet Chet black, dark,
dark, dark hair. He looks,

1118
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,100
he looks like the crazy guy at
the top of the show. Yeah. The uh,

1119
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:22,990
the Hillary Clinton had sex
with. Yeah. Yeah. I know.
Twin eight his ass out, right?

1120
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,690
Yeah. Right. That's wild
that she did that story.

1121
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,590
I can't believe sickler hasn't
told that story yet. Hey Ryan,

1122
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:33,730
why don't you tell that story? God,
please bombard him with tweets.

1123
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,190
Seriously.
Hillary Clinton aid your ass out

1124
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:45,640
can protect him when they call me.
When they call me.

1125
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,590
You're going to live
or you're going to die.

1126
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:55,280
Which is it? Let's go. Good.
And this doesn't sound mixed
either. No, it's terrible.

1127
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:59,510
I can you turn it up actually
so I can hear the voiceover
more? Yeah, and he does.

1128
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:03,560
Did you see his mark? Wait, this is
his martial arts. He was doing Tai Chi.

1129
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:06,500
He was like, there's maybe this
fingerless gloves. Anyway. Yeah.

1130
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:11,300
That was how he got ready to fight. He
did like, it's not even there. It is.

1131
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:12,793
Yeah.

1132
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,420
He's got his thumbs out of
it's thumbless glove.

1133
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,290
They call me.
Yeah.

1134
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:31,310
Can protect him when they call me,
when they call me,

1135
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:34,330
you're going to live
or you're going to die.

1136
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,640
That's an improvised line. Yeah.
That sequence. Yeah. It was.

1137
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:42,760
It said something and he was like,
I got, Steven said he got it,

1138
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:46,630
and then the producers that got, damn it.
It's just he doesn't want to memorize.

1139
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,110
Yeah, of course. He's like, I get to
just easy. So you do like at an audition,

1140
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:54,400
you're like, I got, I got the idea. These
title cards are made on a Mac. Definitely.

1141
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:58,120
Like, isn't this a standard? Yeah.
Yeah. This is on your APP. All right,

1142
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,273
let's go.
Good.

1143
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,500
Oh, there it is. A Blue Band

1144
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:10,960
and pointed this out to me.

1145
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,100
You know the trailer is that obviously
it's supposed to highlight the best

1146
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:16,090
moments of your film,

1147
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:20,680
and they clearly leave in a dummy,

1148
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:24,620
like a falling.
This is clearly a dot.

1149
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,460
Yeah. You have to watch it obviously, but
if you, if you're watching the trailer,

1150
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,470
Oh one 21

1151
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,830
they're dropping a clear

1152
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:45,000
damn. Oh my God. You're right, it looked
light and it's like its hands or uh,

1153
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,020
yeah. You wouldn't put that
in the trailer, which Ya know,

1154
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:53,310
or you just cut it faster so that people
can't tell, but you get to see it.

1155
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,870
Wow.
That's exhausting.

1156
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,470
Steven Seagal.
George Saint,

1157
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,430
let's say they may have spent
like 20,000 days step up.

1158
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,810
I'm going to give him some credit here.

1159
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:31,811
I think this one might not be such a such
a piece of shit that is still a piece

1160
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:36,470
of shit, but it's not the worst.
Yeah. This is not the worst

1161
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,350
cartels.

1162
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,140
Well that's the name of the movie cartels.
Cartels.

1163
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:54,810
Cartels. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Yeah.

1164
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:59,180
I wish there would have been
eight. My asshole. So weird. Ryan,

1165
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:04,000
when tell us about that.
I know my mans my legs over her shoulders.

1166
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:11,260
Yeah. It's really crazy. She made me
new copious amounts of cocaine with her.

1167
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,870
There was so much kicky punching in
this though that I feel I have a hint.

1168
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:19,240
I feel like the story will get lost.
Oh,

1169
01:19:19,241 --> 01:19:23,590
you think might suffer a little
cookie bunch kick, kick, kick. Yeah.

1170
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,340
So much kicky and shooty punching.
Yeah,

1171
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,290
it's a lot. God has a lot. Yeah.

1172
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,300
No,
she was numb sucking my asshole.

1173
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,810
Cool. To rise, numb,

1174
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:39,260
sucking to the point of it.
It gets numb.

1175
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,720
You keep sucking on this.
I got it.

1176
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:46,420
So now a picture of Hillary Clinton just
suck in the over and over on that guy's

1177
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,263
bubble.

1178
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,161
So great.

1179
01:19:48,161 --> 01:19:52,910
I didn't know if she was even into like
cocaine and I know she doesn't seem like

1180
01:19:52,911 --> 01:19:55,460
that kind of a lady.
You don't think so? Hmm.

1181
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,030
Let's take of all the bullshit to deal
with the bill all these years while she's

1182
01:19:59,031 --> 01:20:02,900
probably menopausal at this point.
Not Interested in sex the whole lot.

1183
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,900
Do you think at this point she's like, do
your thing. I don't care anymore. Yeah.

1184
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:09,960
Other separate lives have been since the
Wenski scandal for sure. You think so?

1185
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:15,170
If not before then she knew
he was a fucking a real pos
before she's put up with

1186
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:21,420
it for decades, decades. She knew. She
knew about it. She knew everything.

1187
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,050
She was like,
wow.

1188
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:26,460
Whenever it's the price I pay for being
married to power to power their total

1189
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:30,720
house of Farts, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
But do you think that he's like, oh,

1190
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,380
it's going to go to the store and she's
like, I know where you're from. Yeah.

1191
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:38,010
Why lie? Yeah. I don't fucking
this chick. And he's like,
Hey, you know, actually, uh,

1192
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:42,070
I was out. I was walking around and
I was leading by over vermouth soup.

1193
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:45,990
I'm going to go, he's got you mind.
She's like, go do what you gotta do.

1194
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:49,380
Ah Hah.
You insatiable peg.

1195
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:52,890
I couldn't imagine being in a
relationship with somebody like that.

1196
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:57,330
I would have a very hard time. I would
hate that. The People Power dynamic.

1197
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:02,380
That's power. Yeah. At his
house. At farts. How's the
first half of her gone down?

1198
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:09,230
Um, all right. I gotta get
going, gene. Oh, oh, oh, oh,

1199
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:13,680
oh God. No, I love you.

1200
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,530
I love you too. I got, um, let's see.

1201
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:22,080

called sharpening the knife. Um,

1202
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:28,080
so, oh, I know who that's going
to be about. Yeah, please.
