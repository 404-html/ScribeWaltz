Wow.

5

Christina Catholic.

6
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,983
It's sexy.

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,350
That's a deep, who is that?
That was um, content. My jeans,

8
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,260
jeans in my kinds in my account.
I know, but the guy that made it,

9
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,520
he's an actual music. It's not in
this uh, gosh, he's so good too.

10
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,480
He used to send him bang.
This is one of the original,

11
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,990
it's the old school stuff.
If you haven't been deep in the vaults,

12
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:03,290
you wouldn't know jeans in
my car. But that's it. Um,

13
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,140
and it's a great way to start off the
new year. Happy new year, everybody.

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Nappy hairs, everyone. We're recording
this out of sequence so we have to, um,

15
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,230
we're kind of banking some episodes for
stuff we have going on. This should be a,

16
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,070
if everything goes well,
God willing and Shiela,

17
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,090
we'll be doing our next phase,

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,820
allot x next episode in the
new space and the new studio,

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,520
which we're really excited.
Yes. Yeah. I mean, listen,

20
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,920
we haven't really spoken
about it too much at length,

21
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,100
but this is going to be a
pretty great change for us.

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,700
I'm excited for you guys to sound asleep.
It's a dream come true.

23
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:41,120
You know how long I've been like, you
know, uh, I've been wanting to do this.

24
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,000
And then you were like, go ahead,
do your thing, do your move. Well,

25
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:48,080
I'll tell you what happened is that
you kind of wore me down. I was, yeah,

26
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,560
I was in my last trimester of pregnancy
with our second child and I was like,

27
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,480
I was shooting the special for Netflix.
I was already exhausted and,

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,560
and you were like, I want to
build the studio. And I'm like,

29
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,980
right now we're just
about to have a second. We

30
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,070
have this great home studio.
What the heck is wrong with you?

31
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,370
And then you just kept wearing me
down like a guy. It's like a guy,

32
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,560
like we're talking about a few
episodes ago. Just the tip.

33
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,650
Let me just put the tip and see how
that feels. Just, it feels good. Yeah.

34
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:14,260
And I won't put it any more. And
that's right. And you kind of like,

35
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,150
well let me just,
let me just research the spaces.

36
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,790
And then you started to go look at
spaces with our real estate person or

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
whatever. And I was like,
okay, that's the tip.

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,010
I realize that then that the tip
was already in and then you're like,

39
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,620
I found this amazing space. He's showing
me the pictures and then you're, you're,

40
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:29,920
you're all weigh in. Yeah. And I was
like, just go for it. Just finish this.

41
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,340
Hey, I mean, wait till you guys see it.
You'll hopefully see it next week. I mean,

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,410
we didn't hold back.
We want it to do,

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,030
we'll try and we went full throttle
on the new space. But I mean in all,

44
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:45,630
in all facets of it. Um,
full trocar is the set,

45
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,440
the audio, there's an audio, you know,
I've always been like, all right,

46
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:52,710
I hate when any audio thing goes.
You know, we have compressors,

47
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:57,150
we have a whole new set up there
with, with design, a new video,

48
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:57,880
new lighting.

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,680
You want to talk lighting.
Our guy who did our lighting

50
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,690
left as he was setting up
our lighting because a,

51
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:09,570
a certain president Hw Bush died. Right?
And he's like, oh, I got to go like that.

52
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:09,780
Okay.

53
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,170
He lit the corpse of a former president.
Yeah, the Ted Prize. We were like, what?

54
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,940
But that's how legit, legit man,
we went full, full throttle.

55
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,530
Don't worry. Don't worry. That doesn't
mean that the show is going to change.

56
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,090
Oh No, no, no. 100% jeans all the time.

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,220
100% genes. And in fact, I mean,

58
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:33,350
I don't want to give away any
surprises in the new studio yet,

59
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,430
but let's just say there's a lot of
things are finally going to happen.

60
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,910
I only going to happen and don't
think demanding. Oh, you guys are all

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,400
uppity now you got a new
studio. What does, what happens?

62
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,370
Does that mean that you're
going to have, um, you know,

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
guests to talk about math
now? No, it's the same. No.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,630
Same world you love to live in with us.
It's going to be this thing z.

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,980
Oh my God.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,810
Oh,

67
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,460
stuff like that. You
know? Sorry, I just was,

68
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:09,180
remember I was thinking about jeans and
my cat and I just wanted to share it.

69
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,340
Listen, we've had about six studios
now and that's no exaggeration.

70
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,140
So this the new ones, number six,
this is lucky. Six lucky six.

71
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,690
You want to take it through the the

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,940
I'd love to, yeah, let's do it. Go for it.

73
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,260
The first studio was in silver lake over
like in our apartment. That's right.

74
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,590
As a two bedroom.
One of the bedrooms became the room.

75
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:32,591
We did the show in and we shared a wall
with the person who lived behind us and

76
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:36,900
she would cook off of all things
Ethiopian food and it would,

77
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:41,040
we shared event and it would waft in
through the studio indoor room as we were

78
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,874
recording.

79
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,930
Cool thing about the setup
of that apartment was that
wall was like a false wall

80
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,670
paper sent. It was a person, it wasn't how
the, they made it two apartments, right?

81
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,130
There was one a correct.
So guess what?

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,710
If you wanted air conditioning a run,

83
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,050
she had to turn it on and her side,
then the AC would run, look, click on.

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,970
And it was also neat because we
knew her sexual behaviors came hard.

85
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,290
She came really hard. She did.
We knew it was freshly divorced.

86
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,270
She is fresh to divorce.
So there was a lot of do like our,

87
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,070
our bedroom walls border too.

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,270
So she could probably hear us
fucking and we could hear her. Yeah.

89
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,190
So she was kind of a performer.
It's strong performer.

90
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,900
She was a strong performance cleo shapes.
You would really celebrate,

91
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,550
you know, jeans and my cousin. Yeah.
Her jeans and Huracan and a guy.

92
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,943
Ah,

93
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,130
oh man.
Oh Man.

94
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,760
Oh Man. Ah, uh, so I remember, yeah,

95
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,680
that was the very first time we did
the show and if I can't even remember.

96
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,370
And then we did our,

97
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,040
and that's when we actually did start
using stamps.com because we were starting

98
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,890
to send out merge and it was so horrible.
Yeah.

99
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,560
And then the second studio we, we
would do, you guys don't understand.

100
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,420
So we would do, you know, a
shirt and set up. We literally,

101
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,290
you and I wouldn't have the
shirts in our house, right.

102
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,300
Shelves and honor the screen that said,
you know,

103
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:20,530
it was a paypal like set up
and the orange. Oh, okay.

104
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:22,600
We're still as a shirt.
And then sometimes you know,

105
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,310
the next morning you come
back and be like, wow,

106
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:29,311
we sold like 80 shirts and then we
would package and print the label.

107
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:35,680
That's right. For 80 shirts. You and I
would sit down and to keep in mind too,

108
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:38,860
Tommy and I had just started, we
were feature acts. So you know,

109
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,330
you fly out Wednesday night,

110
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,130
we performed Thursday, Saturday,
Sunday, Friday. Oh wait, sorry,

111
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,160
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
shows. And then we'd fly home Monday.

112
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,250
So we had about 72 hours before he
and I would have to go out again.

113
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,750
You do the road. And in those 72 hours
we had to make marital loves, you know,

114
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:58,900
have our dinners, catch up with each
other, pet the dog report, record,

115
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:02,980
the podcast quarter show. And that
took up the majority of a day. And,

116
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,590
and then we did merge, merge
on houses. I, by the way,

117
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,830
it's funny because in La people
would be like, do you live in la?

118
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,100
Like comics would see me somewhere in
there. I'd be like, do you live here?

119
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,070
And like, yeah, of course I live here.
And they're like, I never see you.

120
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,940
And I was always like, well, what
do you do? Like how do you do it?

121
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,230
Because I'm taking every week that I
get offered, both of us were of course,

122
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:27,580
fully packed or calendars or any offer
was yes, of course. Know that it would be,

123
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,200
the offers would be like hustle.
How Bout um, six shows? $600? Yes.

124
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,050
No airfare, no hotel, no hotel.

125
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:39,120
And the flight is $400 and you'd be
like, okay. Yeah, like that kind of shit.

126
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,900
You go into debt and that's why a lot
of people now it bothers me if they're

127
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,350
like, oh, you think you booze, you now
you fly in first class was like, yes,

128
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:50,380
of course I'm flying your first lesson
because I flew in the fucking back of the

129
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:54,870
bus and I put myself into debt. Becoming
a standup comic for a decade. Yes,

130
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm flying first class asshole.
I earned it. You know you,

131
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:03,751
a lot of people don't who sometimes
people like let's say discover who you are

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
now.
They don't see the struggle.

133
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,620
They don't see that this
is year 16 up stand up.

134
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,050
16 years is a long time for me.
I'm talking about talking about practice,

135
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,380
talking about practice right now,
man.

136
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,170
I remember when we lived in
Silver Lake at doing that house.

137
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,880
I remember taking those 6:00 AM flights
across the country and I would wake up

138
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,820
at three 30 in the morning for
a member of those four hammers.

139
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,770
You wake up hoping that the taxi you
ordered or whatever was coming to get you

140
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,650
and your stomach would
hurt. Like you just, Oh God,

141
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,650
it's four in the fucking morning.
You drag your ass to a plane,

142
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:43,020
fall asleep during the announcements.
Wake up,

143
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,030
you know connect cause you're too
cheap to do the nonstop fucking brutal.

144
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,340
Do that twice a week.
Different Times zones,

145
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,290
eating fucking Kraft macaroni and cheese
out of microwave and you know the level

146
00:09:55,291 --> 00:10:00,090
of Aki Anik that you live with.
When you're, oh my God opener,

147
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,970
trying to get that work.
It's so crazy. You live,

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,800
I mean eventually it actually sign up,

149
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,030
kind of goes down because becomes
your normal know. But it's um,

150
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,290
you live with this whole feeling of like,
all right,

151
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,910
what do I have this month and next month?

152
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,950
And then you go like this all week dude.

153
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,280
But I mean like once you get like a couple
months set up, you're like, all right.

154
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,580
But then when you get into
that second month and you ha,

155
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,410
you see that the next month is a down
month, you start to go like, oh shit.

156
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,783
Because you,
you know,

157
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,720
it's only if you have to remember that
every booking is just that weekend.

158
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,770
That's it.
You know,

159
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,400
like the big victories are then when you
start to go like booked out for a few

160
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,020
months because they booked, they usually
book a quarter at a time. So you'll,

161
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,250
you'll get your first quarter bookings,
what,

162
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,980
like the end of third quarter or
something. So yeah, you really,

163
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,280
you don't even know what your
year's going to look like.

164
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:51,330
Especially as an opener though.

165
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,780
It's an open or you have no say no say
and sometimes they'll call you and be

166
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:56,670
like, oh, what are you
doing? We have a fall out.

167
00:10:56,671 --> 00:11:00,370
Can you fly to Miami tomorrow to
start shows? And you're like that,

168
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,670
that plane tickets like $800 I guess so.

169
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,750
Cause I want to work that club and I want
to fuck it up. If it was a filet, yeah,

170
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,680
fall out. But I still remember getting um,
Hartford for some reason. I don't know.

171
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,930
You did fight for it a lot in the early,

172
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,570
I remember opening and Hartford
and they were like, you know,

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,310
here's the offer when you middle,

174
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:22,290
it's $100 a show la to Hartford.
It was like five 50,

175
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,030
uh, fortunate. And I'm like,
that means I'll make $50.

176
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:31,530
And they were like, do you
want to do it as a course?
Okay. And then you just, yeah.

177
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,770
You just, you're like, I'll wrack
up the debt on this. And we did.

178
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:39,420
And that's thing people, yeah, we, you
and I went into debt to become headliners.

179
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,900
And then once your headline here,
you're still not really your,

180
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,500
this is how I'm making money.
I'll tell you this about making money.

181
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,600
We do this as a comedian.
So at the,

182
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,220
I'm trying to think the,
the year that I shot

183
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,820
my comedy Central, Oh, I'll tell you this,

184
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,310
2008 around 2008 late 2008 we get married
at the end of 2008 I get a phone call

185
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,030
that I got my first round
of offers from the Improv's,

186
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:09,490
meaning like multiple
weeks of headlining work,

187
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,630
which is huge,
which is a bump because now you're,

188
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,220
you're actually in the system and
your name is on the thing you want to

189
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,190
basically,
and it is quite an elite club.

190
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,220
When you get the call of like the Improv's
gave me offers and the funny bones.

191
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,430
What that means is you're one of,
there's only 52 weeks.

192
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,410
So out of all the lunatics in the
world, all the scumbags, the Lex,

193
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,780
the Weirdos who want to be standup comics,

194
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,050
you're one a 52 lucky people.
It's very,

195
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:38,010
it's very lucky that gets
his fucking actually do this
for a living proficiently.

196
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,790
It's crazy.

197
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,250
I remember this. Okay.
I remember this detail.

198
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,030
I worked the first 11 weeks in a row,

199
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,150
so that's all of January,

200
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,680
February and basically almost
all of March. Took a week off.

201
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,670
Then worked the next nine
weeks in a row and I was like,

202
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,130
and my head as I was working I was like,

203
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,170
oh like I'll get to chill later and at
the end of those nine weeks I had to go

204
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,150
get a part time job.
Right.

205
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,580
Because it wasn't enough money to live
of course as an like as a first year

206
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:16,581
headliner and then the next year 2010
I still had a part time job and shot a

207
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:23,511
comedy central half hour special bananas
and I still had to get a part time

208
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,710
person and then 2011 I
worked at a like a little,

209
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:34,971
I started to it less the part time and
I think I didn't have a part time like I

210
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:37,770
was like a site rep on those
shoots like showing up.

211
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,030
It's making like hourly stuff.

212
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I don't think that actually stopped
completely until end of 2011 beginning of

213
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:46,780
2012 it's not that long.
Yeah.

214
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,750
Not that long ago either because when I,
yeah, I was headlining. I was doing weeks.

215
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,140
My last day job I was on.
Okay,

216
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:58,820
so the borrow 2011 I think 2012 I
was doing Chelsea lately. The panel,

217
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,650
right? The round table.
Yeah. I would literally go do
Chelsea lately. I would know.

218
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:04,550
Here's what I would do first.
Oh,

219
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,710
you got the booking I you're going
to do Chelsea tomorrow. Great.

220
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:10,070
I would go down to the mall, the
Grove. I would check out clothing.

221
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,420
I would go to nice stores, buy the
outfit I was going to wear on the show,

222
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,840
on a credit card,
leave the tags where it on the show,

223
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,610
where it on the show and the round table.

224
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,800
So I had something nice
to wear the next day,

225
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:26,120
take the clothes immediately back
and then I would go to my day job.

226
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,090
I worked at the girl scouts
of Greater Los Angeles.

227
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,740
I worked in the front desk
and I would, people would be
like, Oh, you want Chelsea?

228
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:36,470
Lately last night and I'm like, Yep,
and I'm working here at the girl scouts.

229
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,090
Did you do that too?

230
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,990
I want to say 2012 I believe was
my last year of having a day job.

231
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,430
And then I became,

232
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,250
and then I just kept getting book as a
headline and doing what you were doing.

233
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,080
Like back to back to back to back.
You just had to,

234
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:49,670
you have to keep working as a headliner.

235
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,710
And then we did our podcast and then
TV stuff kept coming and the stuff kept

236
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,380
throwing, telling people you
gotta stay, you gotta stay in.

237
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:00,800
It just got to keep all it is.
It's a marathon and it's,

238
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,400
it's a game of attrition
like David Goggins. Right.

239
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,730
You got fucking beat your mind,
man. You gotta you just got it.

240
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,550
Who's the toughest motherfucker
out there? That's all it is, dude.

241
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,220
Who was the toughest and also failure.
Like I've,

242
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,730
I had 22 jobs in four years
before I became a standup comic.

243
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,880
I had exhausted all the possibilities.
I dropped out of law school,

244
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,960
I dropped out of graduate school,
like I fucking did it. All. This is

245
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,160
on both sides. That that's
totally, I agree. Yeah.

246
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,500
So let's go back to our list.
So there is silver lake,

247
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,690
that was the first studio and then we
moved to Redondo and we had a two bedroom

248
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,560
in Redondo. We lived in a tiny
guest house. That's right.

249
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And we turned the basically
second bedroom into our studio,

250
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:51,410
into our studio there. And that was fine.
Those were good years. Then we got Fifo,

251
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,470
we did get Fifo,
then a little jeans,

252
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,940
ls jeans was born.
So as when we knew he was coming,

253
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:04,290
we knew that that room had to be the
nursery. Right. So we got an office,

254
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,400
this is amazing.

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,290
We've got an office like three
blocks away and this office complex.

256
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:15,291
And I remember signing the office lease
and the guy wanted three years and I was

257
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,240
like, how about two years?
And then he was like, no,

258
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:21,300
we don't do anything less than
three. So I was like, all right.

259
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,390
And like six months later we moved.
Yeah.

260
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,350
Fuck.
Well,

261
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:33,280
we didn't realize that having a baby and
two dogs cause we also had gotten bitsy

262
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:37,180
just as I found out I was pregnant with
Ellis and I wasn't about to give a puppy

263
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:39,700
back that we, you know, I
committed to getting this dog.

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,980
So I raised a puppy while pregnant and
then we had Ellis and then it was you,

265
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:50,310
me Ellis and two dogs and a tiny guest
house and Redondo and we were losing our

266
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:54,630
minds and we were also still doing tons
of road work. And while you were yeah,

267
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:59,040
I was home taking care of
the baby. Especially where
a grinding those weeks bro.

268
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,250
Cause when you get to your first baby,
believe me, you're like a book. Me,

269
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,970
you get terrified when it was funny
at the time too. Is that your career?

270
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:12,490
I just started really taking off when
Ellis was born and we had been broke for

271
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:17,491
so long and I remember you telling me
cause I was like what are we going to do

272
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,750
this baby? And you're like
no babe, we've got money now.

273
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,050
And I was like no we don't. And you
go, no, it's swear to God. Look, look,

274
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,630
we have like a little bit of money
now. And I was like, you're kidding me.

275
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:26,920
This happened.
Like when did this happen?

276
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:31,720
I was so preoccupied with being pregnant
and my mom had died. Like I didn't,

277
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,800
I looked up and our life had
pretty much completely changed.

278
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,030
And then you know, things, things
got way different once, you know,

279
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:43,660
your first special on Netflix, completely
normal was there. And that took off.

280
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:48,040
And then the second special and then your
mom's house grew and grew and then it

281
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,160
was our lives completely.
Once Ellis

282
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,960
was born, it totally did. Yeah. And we
went to, by the way, the crazy thing was,

283
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:59,790
uh, you know, when we left Redondo,
I had to get a job every day.

284
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,310
Yeah. We're done. That was great. I love
the, I love that beach community. Ah,

285
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,240
but we left there.

286
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,560
The guy that got us the office was able
to find somebody to sublease the office,

287
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:14,700
which was a huge relief,
you know? Yeah. So he did.

288
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,130
And then like, I think we told it
on here, but like, uh, you know,

289
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,370
six months ago this guy was like, you
need to clean your off again, email,

290
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:27,840
you need to clean your office and he's
like, need to clean your office. And I go,

291
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,710
why is it cause it stinks.
And I go, look man, I go,

292
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,580
I haven't been down there in a
couple of years now because of the,

293
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,890
the lease ended like seven,
eight months ago.

294
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,070
So I guess it's like before like around
then, right, like a, it was about eight,

295
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:42,840
nine months ago from
now. I'm saying. Yeah.

296
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,220
So cause that was the end of like the
three year lease. So he's like, you know,

297
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:50,010
there's only a month left but it's
filthy. And I go, how's it? I go,

298
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:53,250
why are you telling me yet? I
sublease it and he's like, oh yeah,

299
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,790
well what's that guy's number? I go,
I don't even know man. Like yeah,

300
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,280
this was all set up through
the real estate guy.

301
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,730
I haven't been down there in a
few years. And he's like, well,

302
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:06,270
I'm just letting you know that I'm going
in there because it stinks. And I go,

303
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,750
I write back to him, I go, you're
telling the wrong guy? Yeah.

304
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,270
Like somebody took over the
lease and he's like, all right.

305
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,890
And then the next day he's like,
oh yeah.

306
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,880
It turns out the guy that sublease it
from you died in there and that's the

307
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:24,670
smell.

308
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,720
Did you hear my husband just said the man,

309
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:31,240
he subleased it died in our old studio.
Yeah.

310
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,230
Left.

311
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,230
Like where we used to film the show and
he was in there so long decamping that

312
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,760
right. That uh, the, the building,
you know, the room started to smell.

313
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,450
Then they said they got the body
out of there and he was like, oh,

314
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:50,060
um, you're going to need it,
clean it up. And I was like,

315
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,220
what are you talking about? That's a
wipey not an emptiness problem, man. No.

316
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,920
So we went through like this
insurance thing. I was like,
no, it's not. No, no, no.

317
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,240
But they had to actually,
it's a small office building.

318
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,680
They actually evacuated the entire
building for a couple of days.

319
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,250
Is that because of the smell was
so strong and that was our third.

320
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:15,000
Your Mom's house studio. Right.
Just so you know right now.

321
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,200
Can I tell you why that makes me really
happy though that a guy died? Yes.

322
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,470
Why does next door to us I go next
door to us was of again thin walls.

323
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,820
I don't know why you and I always seem
to pick places within walls and the

324
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:34,821
fucking bitch next door would you every
phone call on speaker phone and then she

325
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:39,150
had a thing of like Christmas
bells on her door year round.

326
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,400
So whenever anybody open and shut the door
dangling and link slam dangling links,

327
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,920
lamb. And she was yelling into her
speaker phone all long and I was like,

328
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,700
please

329
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
just,
she probably filed the first complaint.

330
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,150
That's where I'm hoping those two
need to clean up their stinky student.

331
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,440
Here's why I'm happy is knowing that the
smell wafted into her life and ruin her

332
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,590
life just a little bit as she ruined
that for people that don't know,

333
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,670
Redondo is like 30 plus miles from central
La and we used to ask people to come

334
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,410
to our show like like you know,

335
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,800
tax or something and like other
comics they'd be like, yeah man,

336
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,450
give me the address and I'd send it and
then like you'd just wait a beat and

337
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:20,410
they'd be like,
hey man,

338
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:25,360
I didn't realize where you are a no
because nobody was cause it was really it.

339
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,140
That was a commute. That's why we
ended up moving back to the city. Yeah.

340
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,680
Once we had Ellis we couldn't,

341
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,490
I didn't want to spend an hour and a half
in traffic away from my kid just to go

342
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,920
into the city and back. It was
craziness. It was terrible.

343
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,150
So that studio number three,

344
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:40,990
somebody died in studio number four was
that of a house we rented as we were

345
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:42,250
looking for this house.

346
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,060
So then that was another bedroom
that we converted into our,

347
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,450
we fucked that walls,
those fuck that up.

348
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,240
Put up some foam adhesive spray,

349
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,690
actually move.
We tore it off and it just like patches

350
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,560
and the guy that owned it
and then she was like, um,

351
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,120
these walls are pretty fucked up.

352
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,950
We'll be talking about are yeah,

353
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,440
they're pretty good
like this before I know.

354
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,560
I remember him looking like that and
that was a fun to do. And that one Ellis,

355
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:15,490
his bedroom bordered that studio.

356
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,410
So some days the baby would be sleeping
and Tom and I would record the show and

357
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:24,010
about the 45 minutes that we had when
Ellis was sleeping and those are those

358
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:28,870
days I was fun. And then we found this
place which is a house with a studio,

359
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,050
which is really cool.
Right.

360
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,010
And now we're going to fuck that all up
by building a studio at another location.

361
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,130
So we, we don't have to utilize
the convenience of the home studio.

362
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,890
Exactly what I like.
I like making things in convenience.

363
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,770
I like not having people at our house.
That's true.

364
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:47,170
Your private privacy private.
Yeah.

365
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,610
I don't like everyone coming over
here and I also feel like, look,

366
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:53,950
it's a proper upgrade this show.

367
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,790
Thanks to the people that listen and
watch this that have grown and grown and

368
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,800
grown to my thing.
I always was like,

369
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,830
I want to deliver a product that I feel
like honestly like they deserve and I

370
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:09,670
think the show deserves, which is this
new space because it looks amazing.

371
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,080
The sound's going to be amazing. It
really is. Total and complete upgrade.

372
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,990
If you want to talk about our inspiration
for the design on the studio. Yeah,

373
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,960
so a few years back we were having dinner
in Austin and we were at this dark ass

374
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,620
steakhouse and Tom and I both
were like, God, this is so great.

375
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,510
I think I wish everything
looked like this.

376
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:32,050
Like I wish my house looked
like steakhouses let go.
We'd love steak houses.

377
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,000
Every time we tell people what our
aesthetic is, or like it's steak house,

378
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:40,600
it's dark brown. I've talked
designers for all types of things,

379
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:44,170
homes and other other pro projects I've
worked on. They're like, well wait,

380
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,050
what are you like?
I'm like a of like steak houses.

381
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,120
This one not as dark as a steakhouse,
but it has a nice aesthetic to it. Well,

382
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:55,010
I'll tell you what we
told the guy we said,

383
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,780
steak house meets masterpiece theater.
Yeah. So you'll see that soon.

384
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm very excited to show that to
you. Um, it's going to be fantastic.

385
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,700
And I like you said too, I'm excited
to, to upgrade the quality of the show.

386
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:11,260
We're going to have people, you
know, producing things more and yeah,

387
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,070
just more production value.
Same Old genes inside of studio genes,

388
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:20,480
same genes, different Turlock, different
tonic, different color. You know,

389
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,810
I just realized, oh wait, wait, wait.
May, may I just finish one thought though.

390
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:26,690
I wanted to say I knew,
I knew when the show took a turn.

391
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,860
Here's when I first knew that your
mom's house had become something really

392
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:31,580
special.

393
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,610
And this is why I brought this whole
thing up when you played jeans in my cunt.

394
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,220
I remember, remember when we did your
mom's house live in Toronto? Matt Miller.

395
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,600
Is that his name? I tried to, the
guy that, I'm not sure. Toronto,

396
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,010
I'm not sure. Memory. We did Toronto.
That was wild. What year was that?

397
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,490
We did Toronto.
Um,

398
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:57,360
maybe 2014.
Yeah,

399
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,250
I would be pregnant with Ellis that
year. No you wouldn't. I was pregnant.

400
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,570
20 delivered him in December of 20 1525
was I was pregnant all of 2015 yeah,

401
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,070
you're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,250
And I remember when we went to
Toronto and we did this theater. Yeah.

403
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,300
For your mom's house and for stand up and,

404
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,170
and we sold out every ticket so
fast was great. And I, and I,

405
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,320
I went out and I wear
denim on Joe to Trudeau,

406
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,810
to Joe to Tia who owns
like a comedy club now.

407
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:27,930
I believe they call it the corner
corner comedy club. I think any huddles.

408
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:28,461
Sorry Joe.

409
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,400
We don't go there cause it's too fucking
far to get there from the west coast.

410
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:34,490
But anyways, I'm going back
to Toronto. He's trying to,

411
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,830
it's just such a hassle to go fucking
customs. They're such jerks. Yeah.

412
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:39,830
Anyways,

413
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,710
I remember coming out on stage wearing
the Canadian Tuxedo and you, my,

414
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,450
my introduction, you wrote, you go proud
winds are native Christina rather. Yeah.

415
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,150
And I remember looking out and like
they were, that people were going nuts.

416
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,090
So then we were playing jeans in my
con while people were being seated.

417
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,580
We put that playlist. I remembered
people jamming it to it and I was like,

418
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:02,330
this is crazy. This is finally
not finally, but this is,

419
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,960
I can't believe people really like
this nonsense that we're doing.

420
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,420
And that's when I realized
that we had some and we,

421
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
after we met all the people
that had come to the shelf,

422
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,210
they put a million genes up on, they
really did that. They hung genes.

423
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,410
So cute outside of the awning,

424
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,890
like all the way around
the front of the building,

425
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,690
if you're driving by,

426
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,930
you would just see jeans and outside
and people waiting in line would walk by

427
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,140
like a hundred pairs of jeans.
So silly. I love that. I love to,

428
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,490
to that whole crew is so
sweet. Test. It's still is.

429
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,440
But that's the first time I knew that
your mom's house had grown and it was the

430
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:44,040
beginning of something big, something
very big. And even now, I mean I,

431
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,250
I'm afraid to tour with your
mom's house. Who knows? Shit,

432
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,060
we have to do fucking arenas.
I just want to, I dunno.

433
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,460
It'd be fun to go do some live ones.
We'll see. Well, if the kids are so young,

434
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:59,370
maybe when the kids are a bit older,
we can take them on the road.

435
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,150
I want to take a fucking infant.
No small.

436
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,820
We could probably do a one or
two night or somewhere. Yeah,

437
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,070
but I have to pee so bad right now.
I drank so much water and I had that.

438
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,020
It's the green shake. I'm sorry. I, I
got p. What do you want me to do it?

439
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:19,530
They just press pause for one second.
All right. All right. All right.

440
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,710
I just drained my, cut my fucking
cut. Well, I just realized that, uh,

441
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,050
we haven't done a proper show in

442
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,820
almost 30 minutes and we haven't done
our dates either. My fucking cat,

443
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,500
my cat, my cat and my
cat. Well, it's sexy.

444
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,970
Is that, is that Jules? No, no, no. No.

445
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,250
Fucking Cup with another strong performer.

446
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,750
Who says my fucking cunt.
Oh,

447
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,430
women don't call their vaginas.
Confluence. Do you ready? Ready.

448
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,773
Let's start it.

449
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,050
This is Matt.
He harmed a BDO.

450
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,690
Never been on get harmed him for my laugh.
I swear I'm not wanting to go out,

451
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,680
run around looking for dates. Just
all time. I'm looking for a woman.

452
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,840
I'm not real picky.
And I know people say,

453
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,270
why are you settling for something
when you could get a lot better? Sure.

454
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,503
No

455
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,300
ice settle.
Can I tell you something?

456
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,750
I'll tell you what the world is changing.

457
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,610
It's the end of the white male
oppression era, right? And listen,

458
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,920
white men have done a lot of great things.

459
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,960
You guys have created civilizations
and contained, contained fire,

460
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,620
quantum mechanics, all
that shit. Not to mention,

461
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,560
not to mention,
but I got to tell you,

462
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,920
the level of delusion of these white men
about what they think they deserve in

463
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:10,280
the world is real.

464
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,360
And that is a direct result
of check your privilege.

465
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,040
I don't believe in that shit.

466
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,790
Entitlements for the viewers.

467
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,840
Teitelman for the listeners who are
not watching what you're seeing,

468
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,660
he looks a little bit like Ron Howard.

469
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,270
Does Ron Howard have hair anymore?
Ron Howard's brother. Yeah, that guy.

470
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,280
That guy's fucking amazing.
Yeah.

471
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,740
Jesus never been on it. Your him.

472
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,010
I'm not wanting to go out, run around
looking for dates. It's dial time.

473
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,500
I'm looking for a woman.
I'm not real picky.

474
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,330
Ah, okay. No. People say why are you
settling when you'd get a lot bad.

475
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,770
Okay, that's amazing. Can floor it.

476
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,430
Preferably a blond haired woman
that my side somewhere around.

477
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,160
Oh class cause your towel.

479
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,990
Oh I and grab me and all my appointments.
Oh what appointments are those?

480
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:20,740
Not The dentist for we send might
go to the pain clinic but what

481
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,070
keeps me from having to go work?

482
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,450
What?
The what?

483
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,260
Preferably somebody who goes to pain
clinics. See this is why you need teeth.

484
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,080
I don't,

485
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,110
people are like why do I need teeth
will because nobody can understand what

486
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:36,910
you're saying.

487
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,440
Referred. We shouldn't paint
pain. Thank. Thank you.

488
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,270
Keep me ma'am.
Go cause like I'll paint green rock.

489
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,770
Unreal. This guy fucking
making me so mad. So angry.

490
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,820
So mad and he's such a piece of shit.

491
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,710
This guy is such a fucking useless piece
of shit and there's women out there.

492
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:12,210
There's so much better than this
guy. He goes to paint a lot. Yeah.

493
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,470
Wow.
Lack to have Bergen

494
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,610
Bergen 2030 year old.
Okay.

495
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,260
One or to my real shit.

496
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,220
[inaudible]

497
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,570
yeah. Do you like teeth? I can't. I
can't even watch them without the teeth.

498
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:36,950
This has to be a bit right.
Performance space though. No.

499
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,880
Hitting all the numbers and he's
like, no, he's doing this face.

500
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,470
This is real bad because his real
face. Yeah. Golden like that.

501
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,600
Yeah.
This guy has a drunk man.

502
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,563
Yeah.

503
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,220
I love this new segment of delusional
men that were doing big asks as what

504
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,770
wrong? It was like big asks. Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,850
This is a delusional male category.
Yeah. This is what I deserve.

506
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,610
It's so hard

507
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,420
how black long walk, because I mostly
stay around the house, home body,

508
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,390
but I do like thick.

509
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,300
Oh, what do you imagine
that guy? Okay, let's do it.

510
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,140
What's the dollar amount?
Hold on, hold on, please.

511
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,790
Brack. Finally, Young Bergen is,

512
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,760
we don't have a lot of faith
that find me a whole lot.

513
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,260
I've got to add down
[inaudible] right now.

514
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I had that much luck yet cause that when
Ratan back upbringing and I won't know

515
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,160
ugly woman,

516
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,620
so he hasn't had it been having a lot
of luck with some of his other ads,

517
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,950
the place other places.

518
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,460
Because some of those women that have
written back or ugly and he doesn't want

519
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:50,430
an ugly woman. No, no

520
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,630
dessert here.

521
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,220
If you're live where white
[inaudible] I don't give a crap.

522
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,750
Wow. [inaudible] party.
And regarding that,

523
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,020
you may get in contact
when we'll get together.

524
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,120
Okay. Ah, that's, that's gotta be a bit,

525
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,700
it's got to be a bit, here's ended it
by going on. He knows what he's doing.

526
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,260
He's got to be, it's all
exaggeration. Well, here's the
deal. Made me laugh though.

527
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,980
Here's the deal, man. It's got
the qualifications of a great,

528
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:27,870
your mom's house does have
it. I just don't know if, if,
if he, if he's self aware.

529
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,230
It's funny that he's doing well. Let's
go through the checklist, shall we? Okay.

530
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,760
A crappy lighting check.
Poor angle check.

531
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,370
Uh, background noise. Not
really. Okay. So he, he,

532
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,180
he knew to make it quiet for
his video. Okay. Location.

533
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:49,140
He looks like he's in a closet.
He's in the closet.

534
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,290
It's um, no cheese, which is a big win.

535
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,320
That's a new, yeah, that's definitely
why I'm a big qualifier. Yeah.

536
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,620
Uh, when you get the notes, he gotta have
no teeth to make a good video. Yeah. You,

537
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,000
you know, if you want it to be a
strong winning video, how about this,

538
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,260
how much money for him to give you
a blow job with those nice new TV.

539
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,920
Jesus Christ.
Babe.

540
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,730
He's got no team and that
kind of every guy's dream.

541
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,380
Yeah.
How much for him to blow you?

542
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:24,450
Let's talk in the number that's a,

543
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,480
uh, man. Hmm.

544
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,180
Be Realistic too. I want, I want tax free

545
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,443
cash,

546
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,100
tax free cash off the books.

547
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,820
How much for that guy to blow you?
I'm trying to think.

548
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,443
MMM.

549
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,210
There'll be a lot. It would
have to be a lot. I mean,

550
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,550
I think it'd be really
horrifying to have that guy,

551
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,033
you know,

552
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:58,200
blow me. So I can't really, it's kind of,

553
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,870
I'm just trying to think about,
okay, how much does the French in

554
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,640
man, that alone, and I'm
not even exaggerating,

555
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,700
I'm being very sincere here.
Yeah. Think about it. Yeah.

556
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,460
Like if you put the money in
a briefcase and you're like,

557
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:16,150
Uncle Sam doesn't touch
it. Yeah. Not Traceable.

558
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,110
I would have to do a million and
$1 million to kiss him to French.

559
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,150
Kiss him,
his tongue and your tongue.

560
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,290
You were talking about scissoring that
crazy lady for like a hundred grand,

561
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,760
but that's not your mouth.

562
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,590
Your mouth on someone else's mouth is
like the most intimate thing you can do.

563
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,090
Now we know you're just full of nonsense.
What are you talking about?

564
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:42,960
Your mouth is your most private,
private, exclusive area.

565
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:47,280
I think I put my mouth on that
fucking nasty mouth. No teeth. Okay,

566
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:50,550
well who would,
why doesn't he have the perfect smile?

567
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,290
Can we send this guy the perfect smile?

568
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,200
Who would you thought need to
needs is the perfect smile?

569
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,140
Who would you make love to first?
That Guy

570
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,090
[inaudible] don't like
him at all. He's creepy.

571
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,180
I'm going to throw out
little boys. Okie doke.

572
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:13,440
Thanks. I got it. Oops. I
don't care about their partner,

573
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,390
right? He's a loving partner. He's a
thoughtful guy. I don't like him the most.

574
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,640
I don't like him the most. I would take
the other guy over. This guy. Really?

575
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,390
This guy is so nasty to me.
He's like a serial killer. Okay.

576
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:28,040
What about between this guy?
This guy right here. Okay. The,

577
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,230
I'll make you cum guy.

578
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,100
So I'll make you come
versus the last guy versus,

579
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:43,130
hold on, let me set it up for you.
I'll take the four stroke versus

580
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,170
when you said to me you want to
go back with your boyfriend, okay,

581
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,320
please erase him from your
memory. Okay. Here's the thing.

582
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,760
All three present different problems.
So let's go through those problems.

583
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,700
Take me through your logic. Okay. Uh,

584
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,330
dom make you calm.

585
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:07,190
Guy Actually at his core
is an insecure little boy,

586
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,480
right? But he's going to talk a
big talk. A lot of sexual bravado.

587
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,900
He's going to be a little
difficult to deal with. He's gonna,

588
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,980
he's gonna do that nagging thing you're
talking about where you put the girl

589
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:23,570
down, maybe to me feel, well,
I've seen prettier. Right. Anyway,

590
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,190
you'll be like,
but he's older,

591
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,000
so it's going to be actually harder to
make him calm unless he's taking Viagra.

592
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,010
Right? The second guy out, the
toothless wonder, that guy is drunk.

593
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:39,020
He's going to fall asleep.
He's going to pass out drunk.

594
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,770
He's not even going to be awake
for that. So it'll be easy. Yeah.

595
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:47,240
He'll diarrhea his pants or something. And
then, okay, so I think between the two,

596
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,740
you're going with the drunk.
No. Then there's Joe, right?

597
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,610
I'm saying I'm talking about the first two
though. You'd be like, yeah, the, yeah,

598
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:59,150
the, the second toothless guy over
Joe would be attentive. I think.

599
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,680
Here's the problem. Here's the problem
with Joe. I think we all know you're done.

600
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,440
And then he's like, this is just
duct tape and it's not going to hurt,

601
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,850
but this way when I give back, you know,
we can talk some more and you're like,

602
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,860
mmm, alright. Right. Yeah.

603
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:21,070
Joe's like obsessive and scary
and you're living in his basement,

604
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,800
right? Like he's going to hold me
hostage and have sex with my tied up body

605
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,990
relentlessly all day. So where does
that, but what order does that put it?

606
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,040
This is so disgusting. Yeah, that's
a good one. Okay. Third places.

607
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:40,090
Joe For obvious mortal mortal
danger. Oh Wow. Mortal danger.

608
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,530
I hope this video doesn't scare you.

609
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,150
Second place I'll make you calm guy.
Disgusting.

610
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,210
And then first started brand new toothless
drunk. He's just a toothless drunk.

611
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,390
Wow. He's not obsessive. He's
a little delusional. Exciting.

612
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,473
What about you?

613
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,020
He doesn't mind
and over.

614
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,910
Are you disappointed?

615
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,020
Oh, I got it. Yeah. Do you want him?

616
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,060
But don't forget.
The Nice thing is I'm not real picky.

617
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,780
He's not real picky. Lisa. You
could be flat like 130 away.

618
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:33,010
One 30 blonde,
pretty virgin.

619
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,190
So you would really let them
down and that department, oh,

620
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,170
all these clocks around the block.

621
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:42,650
I'm morbidly obese by his
standards and I'm real SLE.

622
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,140
Ut Yeah,
for sure.

623
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,453
Yeah.

624
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,970
How do you get that far where you
don't care if you even have teeth?

625
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:59,320
Like can you order the perfect spouse? He
doesn't care. It's $10 he doesn't care.

626
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,550
I don't give a crap.

627
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,250
So it sounds like you're ordered to recap
is you take him first because it seems

628
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:13,420
like second place is I'll make you come.
Yeah.

629
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,910
And third places.
Joe God,

630
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,280
Joe Definitely is the most coherent and
has things the most together and he said

631
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,510
third but that's the
problem is that he'll,

632
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:24,640
he will actually go
through with intercourse.

633
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:28,240
The other two are just big talkers and
you could probably get away with like

634
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:31,270
giving them a hand job.
Joe is going to be like,

635
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,790
I want to love you on one of romance.

636
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:37,090
You talk about this baby we're
going to have. And you're like,

637
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,120
we just started dating.

638
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,800
He's want to make eye contact with you
as I'm making love to you and have a

639
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:45,430
family. He's got it. You'll be actually
the most fascinating thing we had,

640
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:49,930
Julia and Julia introduced us to
him and everything and you know,

641
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,660
she obviously saw the
red flags and running.

642
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,100
Wouldn't it be fascinating to
talk to one of Joe's x's love to.

643
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,430
That would be, that'd be better
than having Joe on love to, Oh,

644
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:02,520
I don't want to talk to Joe. No,
no. We already know his story.

645
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,570
I would love to be like a me to go. She
was like, I dated Joe for six months.

646
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,490
Six months. Anybody makes it that long.
Oh yeah, for sure. And he's got a kid,

647
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:17,290
so he's got those ones. So if someone's
had a relationship with them, probably.

648
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be.

649
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,530
Yeah.
Kind of crazy.

650
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,130
Yeah. You go ahead. Just, she's
so precious. Precious to me.

651
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,140
Oh, look what you did to me. Yeah.

652
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,230
That's why that last one you did to me.
Fucking bitch.

653
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,130
I'll fuck is strangle you.
You stupid bitch.

654
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,330
Call me on the couch with
me and I'll fucking kill you

655
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,083
again.

656
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,470
And he's padding his stomach.
I'm half asleep on the couch.

657
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,560
You're disappointed you got me
wrapped around your finger. Cute.

658
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,380
But that's all you get.
I'm exhausted.

659
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,260
He goes, this is Ali. Yeah.
Disappointed. He's saying,

660
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,910
he's saying that she's disappointed
that he's not gonna do a bigger

661
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,410
man. That would have been so
fun. Julian. Her friends be like,

662
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,060
send us another cool video.

663
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,950
I would love to see their
bait video like Jo Marie,

664
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,960
would you please send me a video?

665
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:46,370
Only though not a text and I want to be
able to watch it over and over and over

666
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,204
and celebrate.

667
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,400
Look what she's done to me.

668
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,690
I'm half asleep on the couch.
Yeah.

669
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,830
So gross.

670
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,360
Have you ever done that?
Like a sexy video? No. Right?

671
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,640
You never did it for me.

672
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,560
Fuck No. That's not me man. Like
I'm just laying here on this,

673
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,970
on this couch right now.
Girl. I'd probably send some
pictures I'm embarrassed of,

674
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,400
but not to me. No, I'm talking
about other road beef chicks.

675
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,300
Oh, what about your dream and your
ma? Your newer drinking? Yeah.

676
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:28,490
So your Black Hawk fantasy that people
remember from a few weeks ago where we

677
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:30,470
saw the Lakers and then you're like,
I had a dream.

678
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:33,200
You had a Black Hawk
last night by the way.

679
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,920
What do they do with their cocks during
the games? And we were like, okay,

680
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:45,770
no work is seen as the lines
that, you know, it's, it's
funny because I don't like,

681
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:50,690
I don't, I don't, I've never dated a
black guy. I don't have a preference.

682
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,350
I know,
I know

683
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:55,990
odd that,

684
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:59,710
that we went to the Laker game and I came
home and I dreamt that you and I were

685
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:04,570
making sweet marital loves
and that everything about
you was in regular colored

686
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:09,280
for you regular colored and then white
guy. Right? Like you are Tom Colored.

687
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,980
You were normal in the,
I meant you were a regular for you,

688
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
like the regular clothes that you always
are and then you're dong was chocolate.

689
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,090
Yeah. You had a chocolate black
Ding Dong. And I was like,

690
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,410
and I remember in the dream tripping out
like Whoa, Tom's kind of a black one.

691
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,610
A big black one. Yeah. And then I was
like, all right, I guess it's my husband.

692
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,444
It's okay.

693
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,880
Cause here's a weird thing about my dreams
and you even in my like I love you so

694
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,630
much and I mean this,
I don't even cheat on you in my dreams.

695
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,870
I can't even have a sexual
dream about somebody else,

696
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:47,460
which kind of fucking sucks actually in
a way. Like I can't even in my dreams,

697
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:50,610
I'm like, no, I'm a good wife.
I actually obviously listen,

698
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:53,450
do I ever tell you where I'm like, dude,
I dreamt that I slept with somebody else.

699
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:53,580
Yeah.

700
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,050
Never get to girl with no
arms and one leg. Yeah,

701
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,210
no arms and one leg. Yeah. Geez. Yeah.

702
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,050
So then last night I had another dream
and this time I dreamt that I had a new

703
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:11,970
husband and it was the guy from entourage.
It was like, I think the guy that,

704
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,660
it's like a blonde guy, I think it
plays, plays his agent or something.

705
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:22,140
Any huddles. And this was so this time
you weren't with me though. So the dream,

706
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:25,500
I was in our house and then this
blonde guy came and he take,

707
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,190
he took me away from you and the next
thing I know, he goes, all right sweetie,

708
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:31,410
I'm going to work. And he gives
me kissing. And I'm like, oh,

709
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:34,230
are you my husband now?
And he and I,

710
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:38,060
and I got really sad and scared and I
was looking for you and looking for Tanya

711
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,920
Lee in your dream. Yeah. I was like,
where's my husband? Where's my husband?

712
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:44,970
And then I saw you finally coming in
in a black coat and I saw your head and

713
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:47,100
your beard. And I was like,
oh, it's Tommee, it's Tommee.

714
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,800
And then I got all excited
and that you were back.

715
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,540
And then this morning I
woke up and I snuggled.

716
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,440
You definitely have different
dreams. No. Who are you begging?

717
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,960
Definitely never see you on that side.
I just,

718
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,930
I just see that road. Beav
and there's, you know,

719
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,790
there's very,
very little.

720
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:13,530
Okay. Let's talk about your
aversion to snap watering. Good.

721
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,950
Go ahead. Let's talk about your
aversion to snuggling. Um, yeah, I,

722
00:46:18,951 --> 00:46:22,600
uh, I'm an virgin to
snuggling. I like styling.

723
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,570
I don't snuggle to sleep.
That's the difference all I want.

724
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,020
Why do you think I have
two dogs? Well, I'm,

725
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:32,270
I'm just telling you I can't
snuggle to sleep. I could snuggle.

726
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:35,330
And then it's like, now I got to go
to sleep. I don't snuggle with sleep.

727
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:39,390
I don't know. I just can't. It's
uncomfortable to sleep that way. I enjoy,

728
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,610
I like the affection of
snuggling to express love,

729
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,880
but then if it's like I got to go to
sleep, I don't sleep that way. I can't,

730
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,400
I don't know what you're
going to tell you. Well,

731
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,870
you got me wrapped around your finger.

732
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,460
No precious. The thing
is too, you love you.

733
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,070
You also don't like being hot.

734
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,250
That's always your big fucking
lie to me like that. It's too hot.

735
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,290
I'm fat. And in fact, people don't like
to be hot because they're naturally hot.

736
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,600
Okay? You're just figuring
this out. Fat. I'm fat.

737
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:16,670
You're not fat. Fat. I'm gross, Mary Rose.

738
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:22,070
But uh, I don't, I don't, I've never
liked a warm room or anything like that.

739
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,240
I don't like,
obviously.

740
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:27,020
I know my whole life is a struggle with
you and you're like, I have a fever.

741
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,170
That's feels terrible the way you're, I
like it. Cool. By the way, I never win.

742
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,700
It's always fucking hot in there. It's
not hot. You'll have it. 77 I'll work.

743
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,940
Perfect. Okay. When I was
on the road, by the way,

744
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,520
I angered a lot of people
on the inner webs. Yeah.

745
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,690
With my Instagram posts and my thermostat
in Philly and in Jude or titties.

746
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,190
It was so fucking cold.
Yeah.

747
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,220
I had it up to 77 and truth be
told and Judah are titties. Yeah.

748
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,030
I would have cranked it up to 80. Oh, my
conscience didn't let me really, well,

749
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:57,850
my bed was right by the window
and the draft was coming in.

750
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:00,040
I was very cold and I was
wearing flannel pajamas.

751
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,050
Mm. Well look, here's the thing
we're going to do right now.

752
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,610
I'm super excited. I'm so excited.
Hold on. I want to make sure I can.

753
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,070
Um,
is this a why IMH exclusive?

754
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,670
It is kind of a why a major
collusive but I want to

755
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,590
get this thing ready for you guys so that
you know what we're talking about here.

756
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:27,440
Oh, um, God, what? Which binder is it in?

757
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,390
I have so many, this is one of the
reasons I liked the idea of going to a new

758
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,950
studio so that I don't have to
search for something every time.

759
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:39,580
I want to show it to you guys will
have painful to listen to dad.

760
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,290
It's painful to do it though. Well
you're not helping, that's for sure.

761
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,230
You're definitely not helping.
You're not helping at all.

762
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:50,640
What are you talking about? You never
helped but this stuff I just do it.

763
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,420
Or Can I help though?
You're the only one you control one thing.

764
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,760
Maybe by not saying like
it's real fun to listen to.

765
00:48:56,761 --> 00:49:01,440
So like stress the person out more like
as they're doing it. You mean like that?

766
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,300
This is the last time you're
ever going to do this.

767
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,020
That's why I'm giving you
shit the last time. All right,

768
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:12,021
well we're having the video FX supervisor
from tiptoes tiptoes is going to join

769
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:20,640

Um, it is very exciting.

770
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:23,970
I will say that I don't think if I'm,

771
00:49:23,971 --> 00:49:27,350
if I'm correct that you're going to be
on the call and I have a phone call and

772
00:49:27,351 --> 00:49:32,070

Okay.
So the video effects supervisor,

774
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,500
so wild from tip toes,

775
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:45,310
tip top tip toes. They're
the title. It's just,

776
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:51,030
that's embarrassing. Woo Hoo.
Greenlit the title. Tip Toes.

777
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,850
Um, I have no idea. Toes.
This guy is coming on,

778
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:00,180
so we're going to ask him questions.
I gotta ask him questions about this.

779
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,440
You'll be back for the second part of the
[inaudible] test. Okay. All right guys.

782
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:14,790
It is time for a y m h exclusive.

783
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,770
This is a wagon again.
H exclusive.

784
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,740
All right,
here we go.

785
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,280
Hello, Doug? Yes.

786
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,990
Hey, it's Tom Segura. How are you?
Good. How are you? I'm doing well man.

787
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,270
Thanks so much for, uh, taking the call

788
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,613
of course.

789
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,960
So we have become semi obsessed,

790
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:44,430
uh,

791
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:49,430
since discovering honestly just
the long form trailer for tiptoes,

792
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,480
um, like over and over.
Can't stop watching it.

793
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:55,970
Okay.

794
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,810
You were the video effects supervisor,
is that correct?

795
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,310
Okay.

796
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,100
Oh,
visual effects producer yet,

797
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,460
sorry.
Visual effects producer on the film.

798
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,600
The thing. Okay. One of the
things before we get into,

799
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,870
like for some reason,
you know,

800
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,390
I never was aware of the
movie when it came out.

801
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Somebody sent in this trailer and
when we watched the trailer were like,

802
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,950
this isn't real. Um,
because the trailer, yeah,

803
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,860
I dunno if you've watched
it recently or anything,

804
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:33,430
but it has like this parody quality to it,

805
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:38,320
like where it's cut to feel like
it's not real. Does that make sense?

806
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,730
It does.
You know,

807
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:45,660
I actually work now at a company
that produces a lot of trailers. Uh,

808
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,010
and so, uh, that whole voiceover style,

809
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:53,460
that whole method of
presenting the character,

810
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:58,190
it just doesn't happen anymore. And
that's why it feels so parody. Right.

811
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:01,710
It cuts the movie is so ridiculous.
I mean it's,

812
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:07,370
it's this incredible actors
somehow bound up in that movie.

813
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,800
Do you remember to figure out,

814
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,880
do you remember when you're working on
it? Like, cause I, I'm always kind of,

815
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,500
I was always fascinated by this.

816
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:19,690
I have a little bit of experience
now as an actor in film.

817
00:52:19,691 --> 00:52:24,170
So some of my questions about it, I
was able to answer. Right. I did three,

818
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,000
I did three films this year,
one big studio movie and to independence.

819
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:33,890
And I remember, I used to always
wonder if during a filming,

820
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,440
like during a shoot,
like when you're actually shooting a film,

821
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,450
whether you get the feeling or not,

822
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:42,500
like this is going to be dog
shit or this is going to be good.

823
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:47,501
Like whether you can know and the truth
is ultimately you can have sensations

824
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,440
about it, but you'll, you'll never really
know it. At least in my experience.

825
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,470
You're kind of like, well, you know,
this seems to be going really well.

826
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,460
I have hope for it. Or maybe
you're working in, you're like, ah,

827
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:01,010
this is kind of kind of sloppy.
This isn't,

828
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,960
I don't know what's going to happen here.
Like it's,

829
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,250
it's still a toss up though until you
see it cut. I mean, where you actually,

830
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,150
since you're visual effects,
where you there like throughout the shoot,

831
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:12,680
were you there?
Like the run a picture?

832
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,690
I was on and off. It
wasn't there every day. Um,

833
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,550
but certainly it wasn't,
it was the sense of sort of,

834
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:26,190
this may not be good.
It was such chaos every day.

835
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,250
And every decision was so strange
because there was this battle between,

836
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,190
you know, these great actors, again,

837
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,600
some of their representatives that are
talented producers in their own right.

838
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:40,950
Okay.

839
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,783
And then the p,

840
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,540
well some balls were all pretty
talented indie producers,

841
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,680
but then there was this
constant undercurrent of
these really low budget, uh,

842
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,540
crew people, uh, not against the
crew, but sort of some of the,

843
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:00,100
the upper management of it that
were just only interested in,

844
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:03,370
in how expensive everything
might might or might not be.

845
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,550
And we're cutting left and
right as we went through it,

846
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,870
even my budget started out pretty decent,
certainly indie level,

847
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:14,830
visual effects budget. And one
day I just got a call like, Hey,

848
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:16,330
I'm stopping payment on those checks.

849
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:19,550
We're not going to do any of those visual
effects. So you were not paying it. And

850
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:25,090
I mean it was just such,
it was every day was like,

851
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:30,340
so this movie was, was in, it
was like an indie budget movie,

852
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,203
is that correct?

853
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,400
Okay.

854
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,900
Correct. Okay. So the guys,

855
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:38,901
the actor is the big name signed on
because they must have bought into the

856
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:42,480
script.
I mean that's always why you land the,

857
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,870
the out of this world
level talent and you know,

858
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:50,340
certainly having Gary Oldman and even
at the time Macada Hay and back in sale,

859
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:55,230
we're like, these are big above
the title kind of names. They,

860
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,630
they must, this script must have really
hit them as a great piece of writing

861
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,500
there. Sure. I don't recall reading
the script and feeling that way, but,

862
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:12,240
but certainly it's spoke to at least
one of them first and plugs, you know,

863
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:15,510
at the time, I have to assume it
was Gary and I think, I think,

864
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:20,511
I know it was Gary initially who
was intrigued by the idea of it.

865
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:25,920
Right. Number one, the script had
some quality too. He was, you know,

866
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:29,010
he's an adventurer. He's an amazing
talent. And, and he was like,

867
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:31,260
well I can do this. Right. Maybe.

868
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,140
And then I think he was somewhat in
between projects. Let's say you held,

869
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,810
he'd had a lot of great projects
beforehand, but this was, you know,

870
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,950
early two thousands before he had
gotten the Harry Potter Gig. Yeah.

871
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,870
40 has gotten the Batman stuff
and so he needed a gig probably.

872
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:53,040
Yeah. And it all sort of
aligned for him to get involved.

873
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,760
And then once you start going
out with, hey, you know,
Gary opens going to do this,

874
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:02,060
then you can convince eight and
Matthew and Peter Dinklage and Patricia

875
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,670
Arquette. I mean it just keeps
going. Keeps going up. These people,

876
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,800
you can keep all these people,

877
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,820
you can convince all these people that
it's worth a shot now and they're good.

878
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,610
So do when you wait two days,
you know,

879
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,030
when you're actually, you know,
let's say midway through it,

880
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,080
there is like the chaos,
the budget stuff.

881
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,740
Do you of, do you, do you still
go like you have hope for it?

882
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,990
Like are you still hopeful
that this turns out well,

883
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,890
I guess,
I mean,

884
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,980
I knew one of the main producers
soon the dollars was uh,

885
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:46,640
John Langley and his company and he's
best known as the guy who does cops.

886
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:51,050
Right. Because that gives
you an indication of these
are people getting into the

887
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:54,350
business. They are aligning themselves
with the people who had been around.

888
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,880
But again,
you know,

889
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:00,560
you also have to consider that time
where a lot of these movies were getting

890
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:02,360
made just to fill the shelves.
Right.

891
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:06,980
You have blockbuster then
needed to constantly fill
the shelves with new movies.

892
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,133
Right?

893
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,200
Yeah.

894
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,033
This is all,

895
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,740
oh, sorry, I'm losing
you a little bit there.

896
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,043
Hmm.

897
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,230
Oh, hey. Hey [inaudible].

898
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,760
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I'm much better.
So you, you said though that you,

899
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:27,590
you were like somewhat hopeful, but like,
not really sure. I'm guessing right. Of,

900
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:28,424
of how it would go.

901
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,250
I mean, I mean for sure. Uh, you know,

902
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:36,650
because it was so interesting and there
was so many crazy things going on.

903
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,800
And again, you have to have faith
in these actors. Uh, but it,

904
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,670
it did seem like I said, like, like
things were off the rails, no question,

905
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,420
uh, given, given just what was
going on every day on set. I mean,

906
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:53,990
you had a set filled with little
people who are all very professional,

907
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:59,000
but it was a lot of things to Wrangell.
And then you had all these actors,

908
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,960
uh, you know, kind of finding
their way through this thing. Um,

909
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:07,490
and so it was a, it was an
interesting experience. I mean, uh,

910
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,960
there was a day we were shooting this one,
one of the main VFX shots,

911
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,270
uh, Gary kind of walks down the hallway
and turns and knocks on the door.

912
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:22,010
And you realize also that I think his
girlfriend's played by Bridget the midget.

913
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:26,330
Right. Which is another,
you know, incredible thing.

914
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:30,040
How did she wind up there? But
she did. Um, so, so anyway, he's,

915
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,490
he's walking down and,
and,

916
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:36,140
and it's a set up as a specific setup
for visual effects. And He, um, you know,

917
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:40,280
they have these little shoes they had
made to go around his knees. And I said,

918
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:44,840
well, I need you to, you know, walk
with those on because we're not sort of,

919
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,200
all we're trying to do is just remove
the back of your legs were we weren't

920
00:58:48,201 --> 00:58:51,260
supposed to animate a shoe.
And He,

921
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,750
and he and hit the prop guy
are like, no, no, no, no.

922
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:58,430
We were told we would never have to
walk with these shoes. I'm like, well,

923
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,250
I don't know what to tell you. I don't
think we can figure this out right now.

924
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:06,020
Is there any way you can do
it? And so they agree to do
it. He walks down, he does,

925
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,400
you know, we do the take and, and they
caught and I'm like, well, you know,

926
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:13,750
you're kind of leaning back because
obviously he's on his knees shuffling

927
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,110
long, shuffling with you're leaning
back with shoes around his knees,

928
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:17,944
I'm assuming.
Right.

929
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:22,820
These little, these little shoes.
Right. So, uh, he, I'm like,

930
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:26,150
you got to kind of stand up straight
and if you could, cause we, you know,

931
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:29,840
we're going to make a knee there. And,
and he just said, he just loses it.

932
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:32,720
And he says, uh, and again, I
have great respect for the man.

933
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:36,710
I hate to telling stories out of school,
but it's a pretty interesting story. So,

934
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:40,580
uh, he's like, why don't I just stick
a feather duster out my fucking ass?

935
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,350
You know? I mean, what
about acting? He's just,

936
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,090
he gets really upset and the
director says, forget it.
Forget it. Just, just to, to,

937
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:48,710
to it and we'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

938
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,820
So he goes and he does it again.
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's fine.

939
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:57,170
We'll make it work. And, and after that,
that take, he goes over the Monitor,

940
00:59:57,171 --> 01:00:01,340
he watches the play back and he comes
over to me and he says, listen man,

941
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:04,180
I'm sorry. Uh, you know, I'm on my,

942
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,270
literally on my knees all day and,
and these,

943
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:12,350
you understand what's going on with this
whole set up here. And it's just, I just,

944
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:14,840
I'm really sorry. You're
absolutely right. I'll do it.

945
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:17,990
I'll make them do another one if you
can. I'm like, no, no, it'll be fine.

946
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:18,824
It'll be fine.

947
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,380
So even he was getting sort of burnt
out by the whole, the whole experience.

948
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:28,520
And again, he was literally, you
know, on his knees the whole time.

949
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,870
Yeah. Oh, so, and as visual
effects you were doing, I mean,

950
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:37,820
did you have to do things in addition
to, to, you know, I guess, I don't know,

951
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:42,500
did they, like, did they green screen
his legs? Like, you know, like, uh,

952
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,030
you know, in Forrest Gump
where Gary Sinise was, was
that that kind of technique?

953
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:47,940
Yeah,
we didn't,

954
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,240
we didn't obviously quite out of the same
budget as Robert Zemeckis Forrest Gump.

955
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:54,110
But certainly we had,

956
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,580
I had wardrobe make
these leggings for him,

957
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,330
weren't super effective.
Again, cause you know,

958
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,680
not to get too into it but without locking
off the camera and they were shooting

959
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:09,040
a lot of a handheld or steady cam.

960
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:12,910
And so it was really a challenge and it
was essentially had to be done by hand

961
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:17,890
anyway. You couldn't really key out
the legs. It had to be done, you know,

962
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:18,760
frame by frame.

963
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,810
I mean there was another shot and I think
it's partially in the trailer to where

964
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:27,040
there, you know, he writes a trike too,
which I never, you know, who knows why.

965
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,840
It's like Peter Dinklage
is dating Patricia Arquette
and he rides a motorcycle.

966
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:36,280
And then, uh, Gary Rides this trike and
there was a scene where they show up.

967
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,280
It was a hotel out near West near lax,
uh,

968
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,310
where we were doing like this little
peoples of America convention.

969
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:48,300
And they show up and Gary has to get off
the trike and walk around and walk into

970
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:51,410
frame. And, uh, they also,

971
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,920
they had a really good double for him.

972
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,840
Like the hair was perfect that his
face was very similar. Um, you know,

973
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:02,800
a little person double and, and they were
debating how to do it. And I said, well,

974
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:05,350
let's, why don't you just have
him hide behind the trike?

975
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:10,510
Gary will step down and then this guy,
I'll walk around and then we'll cut to,

976
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,220
I mean it was just,
again,

977
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:16,180
we were sort of making it up as we went
along and there wasn't a great deal of

978
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:19,500
direction, uh, going on.
It was like I said, uh,

979
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:21,810
pretty crazy set.

980
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:26,610
Wow. I mean, uh, one of the things I've
been curious about, cause uh, I still,

981
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:27,870
like I said,
I haven't actually seen it,

982
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:29,640
we've just been obsessed
with this trailer and,

983
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,730
and I've actually played this for like,

984
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:37,731
I played it for Shawna Anders who directed
instant family that's out right now

985
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:41,820
and directed daddy's home. And he was
like, that's not a real thing. Right.

986
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,910
And I was like, what do you mean? He's
like, that trailer you were playing,

987
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:48,390
that's not real. And I go, yeah, it's
real. It's a real movie. And he was like,

988
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,260
no way. Like I, even when I showed it
to him, he was like, this is not a gag.

989
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:53,910
And I was like, no, no, no, this is real.

990
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:59,270
So we were reading trivia and like the
first trivia point that comes up says a

991
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,540
director, Matthew Bryant was
fired after he turned in his cut.

992
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,790
The whole film was then re edited.

993
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,150
Peter Dinklage has said the
original director's cut,

994
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:11,670
which screened in Austin was gorgeous,

995
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,940
but the people who fired
bright ruined the movie.

996
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,580
Do you know anything about that?

997
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,380
I do. I do. I know quite
a bit actually. I mean,

998
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,410
I'm sure Peter Dinklage has his opinion.
Uh,

999
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:29,070
I don't remember the whole
original director's cut.

1000
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,470
I certainly saw the recut.
So they brought in, uh,

1001
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,230
this well known editor,
Wendy Brickman,

1002
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:40,470
who worked a lot with Ivan Reitman
has done a lot of bigger budget stuff.

1003
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:45,150
Um, I had worked with her on
another project before and
so they brought her in to

1004
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,550
try and find the movie. But you know, and
that's always the case in the editing.

1005
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,510
But in this case, it was
really sort of, you know,

1006
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:55,030
there was a lot of footage that I don't
think had any bearing on, you know,

1007
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,720
the pro how the movie needed to,
to go.

1008
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:01,020
And so I remember her talking to me
about it. Like, yeah, this was a,

1009
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,020
it was a real challenge for her.
Um,

1010
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:07,320
but certainly the sensibility
of Matthew Bright, uh,

1011
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,350
was part of why everybody got involved.
I'm sure you know,

1012
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:11,580
I don't know if you're aware of his,

1013
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,950
his most famous movie is
a movie called freeway.

1014
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,810
It was Reese Witherspoon's
first movie she plays,

1015
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,900
she plays a girl hitchhiking to her
grandmother's house and Kiefer Sutherland

1016
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,320
plays a character of Bob will Vinton,
you know, it's like this red writing.

1017
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:29,820
I saw this movie,
I saw

1018
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,463
crazy movie.

1019
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:35,580
And so that was sort of
where he's established his
reputation as being, you know,

1020
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:38,850
sort of a little bit out there and doing
interesting sort of cold kind of movies.

1021
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,460
Um, but they certainly, I think they got
off the rails pretty badly. And in fact,

1022
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:47,940
at one point after the
producers had taken over the,

1023
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:53,160
the original editor and Matthew called
me because the movie got into Sundance

1024
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:54,653
right?

1025
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,190
As the original cut.

1026
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:00,790
I think so, yes. Although
that's not what they showed a,

1027
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,720
that's not what they showed.
So they, they, uh, uh, they
called me and they say, Hey,

1028
01:05:04,721 --> 01:05:07,540
listen, uh, you know, we know
you're still working for those guys,

1029
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:11,560
but we want you to work for us too.
I'm like, okay, well, you know,

1030
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:15,700
here's the budget. And they go, no, no,
no, we need you to do it for free. I said,

1031
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:19,690
well, I can't really, I'm not sure how I
can, I mean, I'd love to help you. Like,

1032
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:23,290
well, you gotta be on the side of the
filmmakers. I'm like, I really am,

1033
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:28,130
but I can't pay you to work on this
movie for you either. And that,

1034
01:05:28,131 --> 01:05:31,700
that's where it ended. Like,
well, don't tell anybody we
called you. I'm like, well,

1035
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,090
I don't know I can do that
either. You know? It was like,

1036
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,100
it put me in a very challenging spot.

1037
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:41,130
So did you see those showed up? Did
you see? Did you see two cuts though?

1038
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:44,490
Did you see like a cut and
then a totally different cut?

1039
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,470
So I saw something early,

1040
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,530
but I don't know that that
was his cut necessarily.

1041
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:57,650
But certainly I, I, well remember the
other cod in that there's, you know,

1042
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,300
and again,
I don't want to spoil it for you.

1043
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:02,480
I'm hoping it lives up
to your expectations.

1044
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,410
I have a feeling it will no matter
what. Uh, but there's some big gaps.

1045
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:09,010
It's just sorta jumps
across a few gaps that just,

1046
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:13,070
I don't think they had anything
or anywhere to go with it. Um,

1047
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,140
but to say that again, going
back to, you know, Peter's quote,

1048
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,360
I say that the original cut was beautiful,
you know,

1049
01:06:20,361 --> 01:06:22,860
or whatever he exactly said, uh, no,

1050
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,640
that it was a movie that
that could be gorgeous.

1051
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:29,510
I don't know that it was a movie that
that could be shown that anyone would

1052
01:06:29,511 --> 01:06:30,344
understand.

1053
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:31,883
Okay.

1054
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,440
Showed up at Sundance by the way.

1055
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,440
Matthew showed up because of course
Sundance really is on the side of the

1056
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:39,990
filmmakers regardless
of who turns in the cut.

1057
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,520
They invited Matthew and I remember he
got up on stage because I was there.

1058
01:06:44,521 --> 01:06:46,490
I was actually there with another movie.
Uh,

1059
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:50,490
and he got up on stage and he called
the producers assholes with teeth.

1060
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,860
Really?
At Sundance?

1061
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,710
Yes it was. And they were all there. It
was in that big echo theater, you know,

1062
01:06:56,711 --> 01:06:58,150
the one of the biggest rooms.

1063
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,180
And he said this right before
it screened or right after,

1064
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,650
I think it was after.

1065
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:07,010
Yeah. I mean Gary said,
uh, he said that, uh,

1066
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,420
not my best role and it
didn't turn out well. Um,

1067
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:17,810
do you feel like looking back, I mean,
you've worked on a bunch of things,

1068
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,600
would you be like, oh, this is
the worst thing I worked on?

1069
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:27,660
I wish I could say that was true,
but no. Wow. No, not even close.

1070
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:33,450
I would say
there was a time when you could,

1071
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,860
I mean it's Sorta true now,
Netflix and,

1072
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:38,930
and all the streaming that you
can get a lot of projects made.

1073
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:41,390
There's a great deal of
good projects being made,

1074
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:46,870
but then you could sell a movie
foreign with a bunch of names.

1075
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:48,591
Right?
I mean,

1076
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:53,591
I worked on these movies that they would
have Joe [inaudible] and dawn Swayze

1077
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:58,430
and Frank's put on the box.

1078
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:02,780
They could put still alone
Swayze Esta Vez on the box.

1079
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,990
And that's how they
would sell those movies.

1080
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,900
And then they would build the blocks,

1081
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:11,360
but they would feel the blockbuster
shelves with these, you know,

1082
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,780
well intentioned movies. Everybody was, I,

1083
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:19,310
everyone was trying to do their best
work. But yeah, you know, there's,

1084
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:23,980
there's sometimes there's a reason people
rise to a higher level and the bigger

1085
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,823
button,

1086
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,660
it feels like a real

1087
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:27,570
exclusive talent.

1088
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:32,100
Seagal has really taken over
that space of, um, the, uh,

1089
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,000
the $30,000, um, uh, action film.

1090
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:37,590
Now he puts out like six a year.

1091
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:41,730
I don't know if you've ever worked
on any of those, but he, he does. Um,

1092
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:43,620
he does quite a bit of those films now.

1093
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:49,290
No, I did a Chuck Norris movie, which
was a very interesting experience.

1094
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,810
That was a movie called sidekicks.

1095
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,800
Oh yeah.

1096
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:57,800
Oh, a long time ago. That was a crazy,
where he was on set with like kids.

1097
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:01,170
I think that's when he married the
nanny or something like that and uh,

1098
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,810
don't pitch, oh, Kiss
Kapo was in that movie.

1099
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,030
You know, it's, um,

1100
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:08,900
I find that I find fascinating
about the visual effects thing too,

1101
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:13,820
is like there's, there's like
these, these milestones or, or,

1102
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,220
or,
or benchmarks that happen in,

1103
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:19,280
in your guy's field that become,

1104
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:24,320
it's like your brain recognizes
that, that's, you're like, oh,

1105
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:25,940
that's,
that's what that,

1106
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:30,941
when that capability was happening and
it can take you out of a movie or just

1107
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:35,830
kind of make you go like, I dunno,
it, it throws you a little bit if, if,

1108
01:09:35,831 --> 01:09:39,020
if the effects are like super
dated or something, you know,

1109
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:43,880
like there's a way you accept a
really old film. Like say you watch a,

1110
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:48,080
you know, an old Hitchcock movie and you
see, you, you, you know that like, oh,

1111
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:52,490
this is before modern day
visual effects. Right. And then

1112
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,160
right. It'll be rear projection or it'll
be, yeah, paintings and stuff. Yeah.

1113
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,790
So I would like someone falls off a
building and you're like, Ooh, that looks,

1114
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,810
that looks bad.

1115
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,220
The one that I feel like
has some years on it now,

1116
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,910
but must have been,
uh,

1117
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:13,950
after like some really modern capabilities
have held up for me is minority

1118
01:10:14,681 --> 01:10:19,660
report. Like it's at this point it's
gotta be over 10 years old. Right.

1119
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:23,710
But a lot of those visual effects look
amazing. I know it was a huge budget.

1120
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,270
They look amazing. But if you go
back probably 10 years before that,

1121
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:33,040
if you watched the first Jurassic Park,
now that looks kind of wacky.

1122
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,120
It looks wacky now.

1123
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:35,223
Right?

1124
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:40,230
Well we've gotten used to it being so
photo real and so convincing that even

1125
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:45,160
though at the time our eyes were totally
accepting of those dinosaurs and the

1126
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:49,510
quality and texture being
blown away, blown away, Ooh,

1127
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:53,130
I can see where that's just, they're
not, that's not really there.

1128
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,350
It's kind of fastener,
that minority report,

1129
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:01,180
the guy that designed that set up
with the, with the glove and all that,

1130
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:04,420
he went on to develop
that as a real thing.

1131
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,430
What oblong and you can actually
go and do a demo with him.

1132
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,610
He basically installs it in
like conference rooms and stuff.

1133
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:17,220
Usually the CEOs and stuff that use it,
they like to use like a,

1134
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,340
it's kind of like a, a ps four
controller or a controller. Uh,

1135
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:26,370
but you can use the gloves.
It's got all these arrays above you.

1136
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:30,340
And I've seen him do it. It's, it's
pretty remarkable where they're at.

1137
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,530
This was a few years ago, but it's
impressive. They, they rewind some video,

1138
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,480
they go back and forth
and do the whole thing.

1139
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:40,790
The other one dog that takes me
out of the movie always throws me.

1140
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,320
And because of the movie is otherwise
just like a perfect thriller.

1141
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:48,470
Just such a great movie is the fugitive.

1142
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:53,760
When Harrison Ford jumps off the train,
it,

1143
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:57,350
it must have been like, I feel like
when you watch the movie, you're like,

1144
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:02,300
this must have been the year before the
newer technology came out because it

1145
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:05,570
looks so out of place. It looked so, like

1146
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:09,030
we weren't even even a movie.
Like [inaudible] yes,

1147
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,360
they're using a lot of
rear projection or process.

1148
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:17,580
So there that shot, I think I'm, I'm,
I'm guessing that and even when he jumps,

1149
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,030
you know, off the, uh, the, uh
damn and all that. Yeah. Uh,

1150
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,350
I think a lot of that is
matte paintings and, and,

1151
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,840
and process is somewhat old school.

1152
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,420
They were probably
trying to marry in some,

1153
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,490
some wire removal and that kind of
stuff with the old school stuff too.

1154
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:39,630
And again, we eat, you know, if
it's old enough like you said,

1155
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:41,490
it's totally acceptable,
but,

1156
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,720
but when it's supposed to be right
and it just doesn't hold up. Um,

1157
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:51,080
I mean there's a particular scene I
always think of, uh, in T2 where, uh,

1158
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,560
they're on the bike and he jumps or
does something and it's so obviously,

1159
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:58,530
you know, a screen behind him and
it's like, well, they, you know,

1160
01:12:58,531 --> 01:13:00,450
if it was good enough at
the time for James Cameron,

1161
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:02,040
it must've been pretty freaking good.

1162
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,290
Right. Yeah. It makes you go like,
that must have been the best available.

1163
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,710
It's got it had to do it. Yeah,
absolutely. Um, Doug, I am an blankly,

1164
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,310
sorry, go ahead. No, no, you go ahead.

1165
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,740
I was going to say, and, and, and
frankly, back to tip toes, you know, the,

1166
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,520
the ability for somebody
like me to do decent,

1167
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,540
I would say probably not the absolute
best and there weren't a lot of shots that

1168
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:29,460
made it, but decent work on
a workstation, um, you know,

1169
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,320
on a really low budget is informed
by what all those guys did, you know,

1170
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:36,810
going forward in terms of,
of the state of the yard.

1171
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,600
And it's so it's trickled down to that,
you know,

1172
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:44,310
almost anybody can afford some
pretty impressive tools now, uh,

1173
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:48,750
to do really quality work. It's all,
all that's required is talent, you know,

1174
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:51,960
but the machines are there,
they're really accessible.

1175
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,850
And so that's why the quality has
gone up for everything. We look at it.

1176
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,640
Yeah. Now the special effects are
insane, right? It's just like, uh,

1177
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:02,210
it's unbelievable. What's,
what's, what's possible. Um,

1178
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:05,030
I am really looking forward.
I'm going to do it.

1179
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:09,220
I'm going to pull the trigger and
I'm going to watch tiptoes. Um,

1180
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:13,240
I really want to thank you for taking
your time and telling us a little bit

1181
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,880
about it because this is,
um, it's really exciting.

1182
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,520
So Doug socking.
Okay,

1183
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:23,390
glad you found me. Of course. I really
appreciate your appreciation for it.

1184
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,220
Uh, again, you know,

1185
01:14:25,221 --> 01:14:30,221
I'm still proud of working on these movies
to get to work with people like Gary

1186
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:32,240
Oldman and Matthew mcconaughey.
Yeah.

1187
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:37,450
It's really no matter what's going on
to see them work and to be around that

1188
01:14:37,761 --> 01:14:41,960
kind of a talent is always
impressive and enjoyable. And,

1189
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:45,380
uh, like you said, you always
want it to be the best,

1190
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,580
but if it winds up being this colt amazing
classic, that's cool too. You know.

1191
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,800
That's cool. That's a great attitude. Um,

1192
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,190
and thanks again for giving us some
insight on. I appreciate it, Doug.

1193
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:56,400
Okay,

1194
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,230
my pleasure, man. Take it easy.

1195
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,163
Bye.

1196
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:05,890
There was Doug sock in the
video effects producer,

1197
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:11,140
uh, from tiptoes. Um, I got into
more than just tiptoes obviously,

1198
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:14,770
but I enjoyed talking to him. All
right. Be Right back, uh, with, uh,

1199
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,940
Christina after she's done taking a
shit. All right, well that was awesome.

1200
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:22,920
Doug was so cool. You missed it. You were
taking your big dump. But Doug, Kathy,

1201
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:27,650
a video effects producer
from tiptoes and uh,

1202
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,940
you'll have to listen to it. It was, it
was pretty cool. I appreciate his time.

1203
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:34,360
We're gonna switch it up now and um,
go into

1204
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,940
a dark,

1205
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:40,830
dark place with the darkest human being.

1206
01:15:40,831 --> 01:15:44,070
We know. All right ladies
time pull your panties up.

1207
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:47,580
Going to be some redemption here
for the great. Josh Potter is

1208
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,970
joining us. Hi. All the
ladies are Saturday.

1209
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,920
I'm gonna make it better.
I think it's this intro.

1210
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,630
I think it's the intro that's maybe
turning the female listeners off a little.

1211
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:04,500
They don't like it. Do you think
we could get him a different intro?

1212
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:05,731
What would you like?

1213
01:16:05,731 --> 01:16:09,240
Something that's like the dark
wave for something a little more.

1214
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,070
Maybe not women crying and
being strangled. Strangled.

1215
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,690
That's not what they're doing. What's
going on in there? Judge somebody?

1216
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:17,690
Yeah.

1217
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:22,430
No, not the intro. Josh.

1218
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,160
This is the sweetest guy on the planet.
I feel like if you tell a Gif,

1219
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,060
you tell like a nice

1220
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:31,040
girl. Let's say you go, oh, a
potter's here. She would just go,

1221
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:37,740
yeah.

1222
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,590
Yeah. I don't know. I think
that's how they react when they,

1223
01:16:40,591 --> 01:16:44,430
it's like all the cute boys
went home and guess who's left?

1224
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,840
Who's left? Me. Josh
Potter. Everybody. Okay.

1225
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,993
Okay.

1226
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:56,660
So you're not trying to rebrand myself
after last time. Let's talk about this.

1227
01:16:56,661 --> 01:17:00,230
So let's talk about it. So last time you
were here, um, and I ended up getting a,

1228
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:04,490
that was a big episode.
A lot of downloads and a lot of feedback.

1229
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,170
And here's the thing, you were,
um, you were actually saying,

1230
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,563
I'll have to be honest.

1231
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:13,310
It came as somewhat polarizing because
even though we're giving you the a hard

1232
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:17,420
time about a lot of people being upset,
a lot of people really happy.

1233
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,580
A lot of people will really, wow. Well,
sick people, some sick people out there.

1234
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:26,080
They're also, they liked the sick jokes,
which I also like sick jokes. Sure.

1235
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,710
Personally, what a was like. Foof
too much for me was just any,

1236
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:34,840
because I'm a parent. The parent, the
kid stuff, I'm like, God dammit. No idea.

1237
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,000
It doesn't make you laugh. No. But I'll
tell you what it did make me laugh.

1238
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:38,960
What did make me laugh?

1239
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:44,060
What I could've listened to nonstop was
just the stuff about Albert fish hurting

1240
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:46,780
himself. Yeah. That
stuff made me how cute.

1241
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:50,720
He was doing some wild stuff myself.
Like you said,

1242
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:54,870
he put a nails and pins
into is a perennial. Yes.

1243
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:57,770
He throw his taint in his
pelvis and then he, he would uh,

1244
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,310
put a ro froze up his urethra

1245
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:05,460
and one I forgot to mention. If
you want a little tidbit, I'm okay.

1246
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,830
All good over here.
Okie doke.

1247
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:13,970
So he's soaked cotton balls and alcohol
and then put them in his bum bum.

1248
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:20,850
Yeah. And then he lit them on
fire now. That's funny cause yeah,

1249
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:25,590
cause he's a creep so that's good.
Yes. Yeah. He likes that stuff.

1250
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,210
What does that feel like?
So sick. Yeah. Was sick.

1251
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:37,870
You know what I think it is? Look
at you. Look how happy you were.

1252
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,350
Happy you weren't hearing
this kind of stuff. Well,

1253
01:18:40,351 --> 01:18:43,660
I think crazy stuff to yourself
is fun to laugh at it. I don't,

1254
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:47,330
we always wanted to castrate himself but
couldn't bring him. God. I wish that,

1255
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:50,790
yeah means him. Let me say, I like
that. He always want all of humanity,

1256
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:54,060
but he couldn't bring himself
to do it. He never, uh,

1257
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:59,280
was a a raper. Oh yes it
was. Nevermind. Nevermind.

1258
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:04,260
My bad. I'll see. This is, you got me
back here today. You did. He look good.

1259
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:08,760
My hair cut. I cut my face. Shaved it.
You look really handsome son. Josh.

1260
01:19:08,761 --> 01:19:12,330
Look great today. I'm warm in here. I
know you're turned down. Let's get this.

1261
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:13,860
I think it's a perfect 77.

1262
01:19:13,861 --> 01:19:17,760
Actually it is hot in here and all
the lights and stabbed. Shot. Well,

1263
01:19:17,761 --> 01:19:22,680
you look great, Josh. Thank you. I
again, part of my rebranding, you know,

1264
01:19:22,681 --> 01:19:26,850
I don't want everyone to be scared.
I will. I'm not Albert Fish.

1265
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,870
I just told you what I know.
So where do you think it went?

1266
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,610
Like where did it go sideways on the last
one? What does that work? Well, I mean,

1267
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,290
there are some people that were, I uh,
someone last night. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

1268
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:41,500
Oh yeah. Freaked out. So I got a
number of messages and then in person,

1269
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:45,420
somebody last night I ran to the comedy
store was like, Hey, uh, you know,

1270
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:48,460
and I thought she was going to
bring up the thing that upset me,

1271
01:19:48,461 --> 01:19:52,450
which was like kid stuff. She was like,
when he was feeding people the pigs,

1272
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:58,840
I and I go, even those were hungers.
Yeah. You know, they're not real.

1273
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:03,550
Yeah. So, but anyways, I think it was just
too gruesome for some people. But again,

1274
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:07,830
I were leaning on that.
I have to be fair a lot people were

1275
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,010
saying that they thought
Josh was hilarious,

1276
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:15,230
but nevertheless it was a polarizing
segment, which is always a good thing.

1277
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:19,080
You know, we're stirring up
debate, getting attention,
but Josh isn't here. He says,

1278
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,570
you know what? I'm going to redeem
myself. I won't keep to have a good time.

1279
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,510
I want,
I want to have a segment now about love.

1280
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,140
It's all about love.

1281
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:33,380
I thought that I would share with
you some of the best sex toys.

1282
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:38,170
Oh Wow. Because it's the holidays. It's
about to be Valentine's days. True.

1283
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,600
That's true.
You need to like,

1284
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,180
I dunno if you guys need maybe something
in your life. This is actually our, uh,

1285
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,930
our new year's episode we're doing
right now. So this is perfect. Uh,

1286
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,220
start off the new year.

1287
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:55,221
This will be coming out the evening of
the first on audio and this on the second

1288
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,581
on video.

1289
01:20:56,581 --> 01:21:00,630
So this is a what a great way to start
off your perfect time to prepare for

1290
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:05,420
Valentine's Day times. Oh,
you're saying it wrong.

1291
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,360
You're saying my goodness, I'm so
sorry. But uh, yeah, so I thought,

1292
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:13,530
and maybe you guys can take some tips
with you if you need to like spice. Hey,

1293
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:15,000
we're 10 years married,
so yeah,

1294
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:19,050
I mean it's time you just had your
anniversary and that Christina has been

1295
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:22,680
talking about BBC is quite a bit lately.
Uh,

1296
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,190
I think you know what it means
to be British broadcasting.

1297
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,500
What'd you see? What'd you start looking
at? What'd you lick your chops at?

1298
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:36,300
The Lakers. Really? Yes.

1299
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,510
I wish one not licking my chops.

1300
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:43,050
She was looking at shops also about
who she was like, she was like,

1301
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:46,110
guess what? This is the next morning.
She goes, I had a dream last night.

1302
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,910
I was like, okay. She goes that
you had a big black cock. Oh,

1303
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,090
don't you did. I'm proud of is my
therapist. She goes, just curious.

1304
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:56,760
Do you have any, I mean you had
any dreams lately and I go, what?

1305
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,450
As a matter of fact,
yes.

1306
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:03,360
I've had two about my husband and
I have a nice way of phrasing it.

1307
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:06,360
It's not really about your husband,
it's about something else. No.

1308
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,770
When I told her I go and he had a big
black dog, she didn't laugh. She was like,

1309
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,350
no. She was like, that's interesting. And
then the one that my husband was to go,

1310
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,890
I went to the Laker game and then I had

1311
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:23,640
full disclosure and she didn't
judge it. Oh, that's nice.

1312
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:26,970
She said it's an it's anxiety
related [inaudible] about you,

1313
01:22:26,971 --> 01:22:28,890
about not having a big
enough dick and your life.

1314
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:37,260
Tom With Bronze Dick,
I don't know if it's Lebron's sick,

1315
01:22:37,261 --> 01:22:40,350
but it was a big black tech like we were
doing it and everything about him was

1316
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:43,410
himself except for this guy.
Wasn't Lonzo ball's

1317
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:49,920
I could have been d wade is,
he wasn't the guy. That's true.

1318
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:54,570
What a game or Ingram. He's probably
got a hog on him. No. So wait did,

1319
01:22:54,571 --> 01:22:58,830
she was just so many black. The game.
I was like, there's so many black dudes

1320
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:04,420
at a basketball game. Uh, so she's sharp.

1321
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,390
But can you tell us or is
it private? No, it's, it's,

1322
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:11,800
it's more related to anxiety honestly.
Then sexual preference. Yeah.

1323
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:15,790
How has it really,
I mean I'll tell you because I um,

1324
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:20,380
I have a lot of dreams that I'm back in
time or that my life isn't the life I

1325
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:24,130
have now and it's related to
anxiety, anxiety, anxiety.

1326
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:26,900
Because I'm having anxiety actually about
you traveling soon cause you're going

1327
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:30,910
to be traveling and that's what it is.
Just all players travel

1328
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,790
related to like I'm leaving a lot
and a black guy will fill in for him.

1329
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,780
Then a big black black Mamba will
come in and do his thing. That's cool.

1330
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,960
That's the black black Mamba. Yes. He's
not on the team anymore. She's like,

1331
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:50,290
are we going to see Coby tonight? And I'm
like, it's been years since he retired.

1332
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,940
Like he is the vet.

1333
01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:00,900
All the BBC she's never asked
me was for sports immediate.

1334
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:05,240
She's like, when can we go to another
Laker game? Basketball's fun. Yeah, they,

1335
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:09,820
it's just the bbcs maybe it
is to be swinging bs. When
you said go back in time,

1336
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:12,520
I was like to when slavery,
but you meant your life.

1337
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:19,390
Gosh, you are Jesus Christ.

1338
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:23,320
So, uh, so okay. So sex toys.

1339
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:28,770
I don't have BBC on my list too
badly or I have three folders.

1340
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,130
I haven't opened them on purpose. Is there
one I should start with? Right. Okay.

1341
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:37,750
So there should be one labeled for her.
I've picked up for her and to,

1342
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:41,680
for him my favorite of the
year, if you will. So okay.

1343
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:45,100
And then we'll go on to a new different
category, but we'll start with for her.

1344
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:49,510
Okay. Here we go. Open it
up and open the first. The
chronological. Yeah. Here we go.

1345
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:54,450
Keep in mind ladies and Christina,
the this. This is free choice.

1346
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:01,420
Here we go. Ooh. Now what do you think?

1347
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:05,650
That fucking,
even one that's really interesting.

1348
01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:10,651
This is the bumpy Betty tongue vibe throw
up and it is in the shape of a tongue.

1349
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:16,640
I see that it almost looks like it
could be a miniature shoe for a genie,

1350
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:20,710
like a child has a little
tip, but it looks like a
tongue with sores on it. Yeah,

1351
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,131
it does.

1352
01:25:21,131 --> 01:25:26,131
It's like an infection that is the special
edition to the tongue that I thought,

1353
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,470
I mean we all like bumps on our tongues,
right?

1354
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:30,250
It's like if we're going
to have a tongue in us,

1355
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:33,070
I thought for a second you meant that's
how they're marketing it. They're like,

1356
01:25:33,071 --> 01:25:35,110
it's a gonorrhea tongue.
Doesn't it feel dangerous?

1357
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:41,260
That could be the way that's,
maybe that's the extra added bonus for it,

1358
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:45,130
but it does make you curious like, hey,
maybe I should try a gonorrhea tongue.

1359
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,340
This one feels so darn good.
Yeah.

1360
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:51,640
It's just like the state of the art.

1361
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:54,390
This is the latest and greatest kind
of thing. This is the yes. Now it's,

1362
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:56,920
it's no longer dildos that are dicks.

1363
01:25:56,950 --> 01:26:01,660
They also make them in tongue form
because the tongue is the new dick.

1364
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:04,500
Everybody. Yeah, I'll skip.

1365
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:09,740
Dick went after her. In fact,
before you play the show,

1366
01:26:09,741 --> 01:26:10,574
the next image,

1367
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:16,010
oftentimes you see a apparatus that
is like a strap on for the chin,

1368
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:19,760
right? Yeah. The chill though. Yes.

1369
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:24,380
That way you can have a fake
dick with a real tongue. Well,

1370
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:27,890
this one puts that on its head.
Oh,

1371
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:33,470
whoa. Here you can get a
real dick with a fake tongue.

1372
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:34,873
Oh,

1373
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:40,550
so you're Ding Dong is going through this
whole precisely and then that is up at

1374
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:41,960
her.
Hello?

1375
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:46,961
Her BombBomb or maybe
you put it at her hood.

1376
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:51,260
It's versatile tops or her butthole.
Yes.

1377
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,920
If you want your butthole
scraped, what do you think? Well,

1378
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:56,750
I'll tell you what I think. I think
it's a good theory. It's good in theory.

1379
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:00,830
However, this, these look sharp. Well,
that's just also have an image though.

1380
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:04,850
I doubt. Really sharp. They were.
They were down after use. You know,

1381
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:08,870
they become less, you know, they get
you to try. If you had to have the two,

1382
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:12,790
we've seen the first one. I'm afraid
of the sharpness of the, yeah,

1383
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,050
they're not going to be sharp.
It's just the, it's just the look.

1384
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:18,920
I think it's the light hitting the nubs.
Not really. Probably very similar to the,

1385
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,310
to the grumpy. You'd probably put
those things on your bud hall.

1386
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:27,230
I'll put them on your butthole. No,
your buttle. I would put, by the way,

1387
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:29,750
because I don't have a scrum meter
in my life, I would use this.

1388
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,500
I put this that's very
well. Scrum dot. Yeah.

1389
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,910
That's something that
grown dog millionaire.

1390
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:38,090
That's something that it could be for
him as well. I suppose you're right,

1391
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,940
but on the other, on the other
one, you could even take that,

1392
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:46,220
turn it inward on yourself
because it vibrates on the weight.

1393
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:49,760
On the tongue. Yeah. Yeah. You know
what I'm saying? Like you could bring,

1394
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:53,060
give it a shot, bring it
into your, painted it black.
Would you give it a shot?

1395
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:59,920
No. Liquor colors. You have to dig
gold. Let me ask you something.

1396
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,310
You could do that. That's a
cock ring too, right? Yeah.

1397
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,960
You can put that on your cock ring and
then point that without my cock rewards.

1398
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:10,320
But you put on the cock ring.
I put on the Cochrane. Yes.

1399
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:15,110
Well I've been trying to teach
you English. I can't tired.

1400
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:20,090
And then you turn that part around
with the, the tongue bits on your tank.

1401
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,110
Tickle your own. I reached behind your
bag. We'll do something, you know,

1402
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,510
something be on there on your
scrub. You know, it might,

1403
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:32,450
it might nuzzle the bag, which we
feel a nice lodge. Something loose.

1404
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:37,340
You don't know. That's true. You know, I
could be into that. Now for the gentlemen,

1405
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:40,880
I have made a selection. Okay. Uh, okay.

1406
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,220
This now before you show it,

1407
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:48,940
have you ever thought this
sex doll has too many pieces?

1408
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:55,350
Do we really need the armpit
of the SEC style? Right, right.

1409
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:59,630
And then storage I, it's
like, I don't even have that.

1410
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:03,090
I don't have like really that big of
a gap between under my bed. Right.

1411
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:05,760
Where do you keep all
full woman? Right. True.

1412
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:10,910
So this company has come up with a
design that is way more efficient.

1413
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:16,230
Okay, let's look at Chi. Oh whoa.

1414
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:21,980
What the fuck it is all the best parts
of the woman in one compact area.

1415
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,290
My guy can slide this under the couch.

1416
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:32,340
You can put it under the bed.
This is depravity, the bottom.

1417
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:37,260
And I'm not liking
the fact cause I tell you why.

1418
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,230
Why is that?
It looks too small.

1419
01:29:40,231 --> 01:29:43,530
It looks features look kind of childlike.

1420
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,480
They don't look like,
like I see, I see a doll.

1421
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,070
You know what I mean?
It was like a doll.

1422
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:54,960
I'm more disturbed by the
vagina slit with the, the,

1423
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:58,770
the two tits is amen to that.
That's the best thing.

1424
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:02,760
If you ask me, I face looks like a
misprint. Yeah. And I don't know, my,

1425
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:06,480
my mind didn't jump to child because
like what Sean has tits like that.

1426
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:10,830
I mean Geez, I mean a couple of lucky
ones. But what I was thinking was just,

1427
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:14,630
but I mean I love the
ingenuity of giving you the,

1428
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,440
first of all the nose is just be like
this is a face. Yeah. But I mean,

1429
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:21,600
have you ever gotten blown
by a noseless person?

1430
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:25,080
Never the weird person.

1431
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:29,580
I mean the, the tits are kind of the eyes,
which is kind of Nice from that angle.

1432
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,530
Exactly what I tip.
Do you love about men in general?

1433
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,780
Sometimes you guys are just no frills.

1434
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,980
This is such a no frills sex toy.
That's great.

1435
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:43,740
It's just like all the important
bits, Matt. I mean, like I said,

1436
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:48,520
where would you store this is
pretty hot. I would get this. Yeah.

1437
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:51,150
Which one are you buying though?
They're the same thing

1438
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:58,930
now. You know what it's missing
though. What is a be whole,

1439
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:02,740
if I were to read it,

1440
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:05,880
if I were to redesign this side
would have to be whole for me.

1441
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:09,550
I think they want to leave
you wanting more. Oh,

1442
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:14,660
they did version to the next model
will come fully furbished with a deal.

1443
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:19,300
Now you mentioned the mouth and how
creepy it is. I always feel like it's, um,

1444
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:22,350
these things have to be so nasty after it.

1445
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:28,500
I never understood why. Did you ever
try a flashlight? Ever? Because I can't,

1446
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:33,501
I don't have enough mental strength to
then clean my own ges out of it and like

1447
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:37,320
put it in the dishwasher or whatever,
you know,

1448
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:41,580
like how they make that
real normal in there. Oh,

1449
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,060
just scraping by on just outta
here. Cleaning. Throw it here,

1450
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:48,780
put it next to your coffee mug and go
about your day cleaning lady. Do it. Yeah.

1451
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:51,580
Yeah. No, I uh, I like the, the,

1452
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,950
just to disappear in some capacity
immediately almost, you know, whether,

1453
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:57,620
yeah.

1454
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:02,150
Do you guys feel repolish then when
you have it out of you leave your body,

1455
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,670
you're kind of like, Eh, I'm a different
person, you know? Oh, the poisons gone.

1456
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:11,580
It's out there. Yeah. It does
change you completely. 100%.
It really does. I mean it,

1457
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,620
it is like David banner again.

1458
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:19,790
Oh cause it Bruce banner did you get
backed up for number of days too and you

1459
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:22,420
start getting short,
you know,

1460
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:29,560
and just like, yeah, it's a
total, okay. I'm more of like,

1461
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:34,360
when it's out of me, I'm like, Oh
God, I'm terrible person. You know,

1462
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:37,300
like that kind of the shame.
And I have that too.

1463
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:40,180
I have that from a strong
Catholic upbringing. Yeah. Yeah.

1464
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:44,110
Mine's not a Catholic thing. I don't know.
It's just I hate myself thing. I think.

1465
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,360
Isn't that fascinating though?

1466
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:50,920
If it's not like I always thought that
mine was tied to that, that like, um,

1467
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,890
and I feel that shame more alone,
you know?

1468
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:57,380
Like I don't feel it after exacerbate
your spelling, your seed. It's in the,

1469
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,490
it's like the moment after it's
done, I'm like, I'm a bad person.

1470
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:05,380
I have had that where I say like that
where I feel like I'm like, oh, I'm grown.

1471
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,860
I'm a gross person. Then when it's
with a woman, I'm like, Oh God,

1472
01:33:08,861 --> 01:33:13,570
she's regretting this snap. You know what
I'm saying? Yeah. I'm a little patriots.

1473
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:18,580
I'm sorry. Yeah. That's the first way
things up. Yeah. That's so interesting.

1474
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:24,160
It's just self-loathing.
Maybe by yourself. Pleasure.
You think it's shameful,

1475
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:28,900
I guess. Yeah. I, I've always tied
it to the Catholic guilt. Sure.

1476
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:33,640
Because in our house too, it was
really bad. Like sex was, it was like,

1477
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:38,230
Duh, that's not even like a topic
you need to discuss. Not a reality.

1478
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:42,340
Like it was that crazy where you're like,
wow, we're really pretending this hard.

1479
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,930
Yeah.
You know,

1480
01:33:43,931 --> 01:33:48,931
and my mom would be the type that like
if you're watching TV or a movie and a

1481
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:53,590
woman were to walk on screen in
a bikini at a, on a beach scene,

1482
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,330
it would be like you're watching
pornography. Like she wouldn't be kidding.

1483
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:01,390
Cause like, what is this? I'm
like, it's a fucking PG 13 movie.

1484
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:07,000
But you know all that stored up when
your spank bank. I think so. Yeah.

1485
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,880
They fight each other.
That's interesting.

1486
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:13,270
I've never felt like shame about that
kind of thing. It's always just been,

1487
01:34:13,271 --> 01:34:17,590
like I said, I'm like, this can't be fun
for her, you know, that kind of thing.

1488
01:34:17,591 --> 01:34:21,760
Really. And then after I, if it's
just masturbation, I'm just like,

1489
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:26,110
I am gross. Have you
smashed lately dude? No, no,

1490
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:26,890
it's been,

1491
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:31,300
that's part of it is because I'm just
like living in the sewers of life right

1492
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:34,450
now. You know what I'm saying? Really?
Yeah, Dude. I've definitely, like,

1493
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,010
I walk the street at night like, really?
Yeah. I like, what are you doing? No,

1494
01:34:39,011 --> 01:34:43,680
I'm just getting, I don't know. It's
dangerous. It is though. But no, I,

1495
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:47,930
I mean like, you know, just ride the
subway a lot. Yeah. And you're just, uh,

1496
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,190
I'm not in a world where there's women,
I don't know where they are.

1497
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,860
I have to go to a club. I'm not going
to go there, you know? Yeah. No,

1498
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:56,770
you don't need to be,
I'm waiting to find them where I go.

1499
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:00,380
Do you ever do the online thing
at all? Never. I have, but I mean,

1500
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,720
I'm not good at it.
You know,

1501
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:07,160
we just had a session with Kyle
Dunnigan right over his profile.

1502
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:11,050
You're, you would probably be great at
it if you had one. Now. What the fuck?

1503
01:35:11,051 --> 01:35:13,670
Why do you know so much? I
was wondering. It's intuitive.

1504
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,910
It is intuitive and I just don't have
that ability. Well, here's the thing.

1505
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:19,520
If it was all faceless,

1506
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:25,210
I would crush because I can
talk and text pretty great.

1507
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:26,510
Yes.

1508
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:31,360
Now the way to get in with those people
is they have to swipe on you. Yeah.

1509
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:35,450
So they just see what I look like and
I'm like already, but here's the thing.

1510
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,940
Coming from behind. Yeah. Okay.
Here's the thing about that.

1511
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:43,240
You think that and you go like, you
know, I'm not a 10 or whatever. Right.

1512
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:47,290
But if you take, you know,
you get cleaned up, you know,

1513
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,540
I get that part of it. You're going
to get some people swept to me.

1514
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:52,040
I know I'm not like destitute,

1515
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:56,570
but I'm not fucking Zac Efron
here and we just chicks they,

1516
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,780
why don't we just play the numbers
though? I swipe. That's what I do.

1517
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:03,290
I swipe right on everything, see what I
get, and then I sort it out later. Okay.

1518
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,940
You aren't doing it. Sometimes I stopped
doing it. Oh, okay. One second. Can we,

1519
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,900
can we jump? You want to reactivate it
and also Josh too. You're, you're not,

1520
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,960
you're a good looking dude.
And here's what you need to do though.

1521
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:18,550
All you gotta do is it's fashion.
Like, look, this is good.

1522
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:22,520
This is definitely better.
Really. Well, yeah.

1523
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,130
You didn't know that I came in here
specifically to look creepier than normal

1524
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:33,550
shit. Well, that backfired. Yeah,
no, that's what it looks good,

1525
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,880
but it's really accessorizing
properly for dudes.

1526
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:42,980
Like some access meaning just to see.
Of course you go with,

1527
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:47,780
I have a far right one. Oh,
you wish the phone line. Well,

1528
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:52,070
um,
I'd like to see what photos you choose.

1529
01:36:52,071 --> 01:36:56,830
Maybe you can bring us up. I have no good
photos. Did it pick up? No, that's it.

1530
01:36:56,831 --> 01:36:59,720
Now I hear it. I'd like to see.
Let's get some good photos.

1531
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:04,430
The right clothes put up are what?
Three or four best photos?

1532
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:07,040
See what I mean?
You can handle the profile.

1533
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:11,420
Let's just look at the image and then
let's do a swipe right. Experiment.

1534
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,640
Let's see. Okay. I say
we do it in the new year.

1535
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:18,720
We get him I'm game and then a
full report. Sex toys on them.

1536
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:22,940
I also fear maintaining
like the putting up of EHRs.

1537
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:27,350
Like what if I regressed to my
ability, my lack of abilities? No,

1538
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,870
and you know what? I'm still going
to be motivated fashion wise.

1539
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,650
You're going to be motivated. We're
going to motivate, will motivate you.

1540
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:37,280
All right, I'm down. Let's do it. Let's
find him a lady in 2019 even down,

1541
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:42,050
even down to do this. I'll take
you shopping. All my God. Wow.

1542
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,420
That's cannot be exclusive.

1543
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:49,290
It could be the cameras and yeah, we
could do that. That would be dope. Yeah.

1544
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:54,140
Yeah. I would love to see what I'm aiming
wrong. My pickers are on for clothes.

1545
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,460
I think you, you need to
smell the group. Yeah.

1546
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:04,160
What is the, uh, you want to go back? Go
back to the first image. Okay. One moment.

1547
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,750
You brought up the creepiest
part here. Yes. This mouth.
Yes. Well, it's like, it's,

1548
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:11,780
you know what it is that I was wrong
by saying what I'm saying is it,

1549
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:15,770
it looks kind of like a doll
and dolls to me are, you know,

1550
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:19,130
I think of children's. Yeah.
It doesn't look human enough.

1551
01:38:19,131 --> 01:38:22,520
Is that what you're saying? Well, it's
just like, uh, uh, if you were to take a,

1552
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:24,440
if you go to pick up a doll right now,

1553
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:28,940
but that's the image that I
have is like those, you know,

1554
01:38:28,941 --> 01:38:33,290
there's a specific way that the, the lips
layers doll. Well, this might help you,

1555
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:35,600
uh,
go to image too,

1556
01:38:35,601 --> 01:38:39,380
and this might change your mind about
your accuracy of the mountain. Okay.

1557
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:40,813
Oh,

1558
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:41,673
okay.

1559
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:48,010
I think you're right.
I don't see a dollar anymore.

1560
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:52,500
Yeah.
It looks like

1561
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,800
it looks like you're doing it the way
your picture isn't it. Yeah. First of all,

1562
01:38:57,801 --> 01:38:58,634
I didn't really,

1563
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,570
that looks like a toms arm that
looks like a fucking aggressive, ah,

1564
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:08,380
move.
And for our listeners is the same,

1565
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:08,860
uh,

1566
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:13,860
I guess apparatus apparatus and that
little mouth has obviously very pliable,

1567
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:19,480
um, well, because it has an opening
for your, your penis to enter.

1568
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:21,280
But the person pulling the lip up,

1569
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:26,320
showing you to grasp because there
they're pulling it pretty far off.

1570
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:31,530
Yeah. Like face. And you see that there's
teeth in there. Yeah. Go to image three.

1571
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:32,820
If you want to get a better look at it.

1572
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:36,630
Ugh.

1573
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:39,490
Set of teeth and nice. Yeah. Now,

1574
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,950
which just goes to show a Tom
with these guys, these videos,

1575
01:39:42,951 --> 01:39:45,320
and they're according women and
they don't even have their teeth.

1576
01:39:45,321 --> 01:39:50,070
The teeth are very important in the
human cording process. Taught your dog.

1577
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:53,940
Didn't know how the dall teeth would
become important. Maybe you just want,

1578
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:56,800
it's just a mental thing.
Maybe she takes care of herself.

1579
01:39:56,801 --> 01:40:00,580
You know that she's a cleaning lady.
We want it. We want to come so badly.

1580
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,810
I know it's so gross.

1581
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:07,120
Or just like make a fucking
torso with tits and ass hoes.

1582
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:13,340
You did bring up the lack of eyes. Teeth
are there. The teeth are there. I mean,

1583
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:17,370
what do you think if you walk into a
guy's place and you see that red flag,

1584
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:21,090
you would rent Albo red flag,
red flag, like need to marry.

1585
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:27,260
What is the message? I think this is
desperation. Definitely. Really? Yeah.

1586
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:30,750
I kind of don't mind a flashlight. I
don't think that's a bad thing. Yeah.

1587
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,200
That's interesting that you're like,
oh that guy is just getting off.

1588
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:38,940
Because I think the spookiness of this
thing where it's like, I want a mouth,

1589
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:43,320
I want a slit and I want tits
and that's it. It's like, well,

1590
01:40:43,321 --> 01:40:44,940
why not just go look for the whole doll?

1591
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:48,660
Like if someone had a whole dall I'd be
okay with that. Oh, sorry. No fuck though.

1592
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:53,530
I mean I bring up again storage story
because this thing is what's great about

1593
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:56,290
this product. They listen
to their customers. Yes.

1594
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:01,030
What's great about this product is that
you wouldn't have someone like Christina

1595
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:03,790
coming over and happening upon it.
Right.

1596
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:07,860
Unless they're snooping about
because you can keep very Nazi.

1597
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:10,550
Do not snoop. Yeah, no,
I'll keep that in your

1598
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:16,240
call Josh so that men buy it.
Go ahead.

1599
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,150
If they want to ever have a real woman
through that, through that one over there.

1600
01:41:19,151 --> 01:41:24,151
It is the concubine breast stall I
believe is why concubine those dolls,

1601
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:29,050
those real dolls. The first of all for
last I heard there were about $10,000

1602
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,630
and they're very heavy.

1603
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:36,790
I know a lot of women who will do the
things those dolls do for $10,000 is all

1604
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:39,520
I'm saying. Maybe not
forever, but you know,

1605
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:46,420
sessions at a robot would be ideal as I
wonder if that's going to happen anytime

1606
01:41:46,421 --> 01:41:50,500
soon. Yeah, that would be really,
I'm scared of that cool whole thing.

1607
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,710
Now I know you to like the fancier
things in life sometimes. Sure.

1608
01:41:55,120 --> 01:42:00,100
So I thought let's find some of the
best sex toys to share with you.

1609
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:03,340
Oh, fancy toys. Yes. Fans.
The fanciest of toys.

1610
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:08,260
And that's what's in this next folder.
Yes. So you can bring up the first one.

1611
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:12,910
Okay, here we go. Now this one, oh my God,

1612
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,440
this is a silver,

1613
01:42:14,441 --> 01:42:19,120
but plug horse tail that
is 100% authentic horsehair

1614
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:26,050
Verone play. This is for, well, it depends
on what you want. I mean, are you a brony?

1615
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:26,913
I don't know.

1616
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:31,720
This I don't think is up the bronies
alley because it's black and it's silver

1617
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:34,490
and cold and,
and uh,

1618
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:36,820
it's not really the brony speed.

1619
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:41,110
It's more if you want to be like a Viggo
Mortensen and he'll dial go or some

1620
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:43,690
shit. You know what I'm saying?
Like it's a little more angle.

1621
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:45,070
I mean also by the way,

1622
01:42:45,071 --> 01:42:48,770
it looks like there's some real
handiwork in the butt plug aspect here.

1623
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:52,990
I rolled it is made of actual silver.

1624
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:57,380
Do we have a cost on this? D I was going
to ask, would you like to guess? Oh,

1625
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,363
hold on.

1626
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:03,100
Now you're telling me that this is real
horse hair cracked and real silver.

1627
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:07,390
Okay. Because I know in the we've market
when you get like clip ons for women or

1628
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:11,020
extensions in your hair,
human hair costs a God damn fortune.

1629
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:15,070
So if you're going real hair at any
capacity, I imagine it's quite expensive.

1630
01:43:15,071 --> 01:43:16,090
So I'm going to estimate,

1631
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,600
I'm going to go real hair that I'd say
this 609 and then real surreal silver 12

1632
01:43:22,481 --> 01:43:24,760
$1,200 wow.
It's pretty good.

1633
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:29,790
Guess I'll guess more 1650 you guys are
going real high and now this one is in

1634
01:43:31,721 --> 01:43:36,721
the thousands but it's a
retailed at $3,475 oh my God.

1635
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:41,560
3000 for this.
Oh,

1636
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,370
you were doing hundreds when you said
that. I thought you said 16,000 no,

1637
01:43:45,371 --> 01:43:46,870
1600 oh no, no, no, no.

1638
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:50,740
It is 3,470 I thought you were going.

1639
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:54,140
Wow. No, no, no.

1640
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,190
3,475 law.

1641
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,450
That is an investment

1642
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:07,990
where it all the time though. You know, I,

1643
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:12,290
and I mean this like what's the
point of a butt plug? Like I said,

1644
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:15,800
I think it just feels good
to have it always in there.
I don't know about always.

1645
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:17,460
Not always I guess.

1646
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,020
I think it probably a couple of things
probably feels good to some people to

1647
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:25,460
just have it resting in and
out, in and out. You just know,

1648
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:30,200
just pop it in his pocket and then you
will also go in the other way. Right.

1649
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:34,460
One and the pink one and the state.
Yes. There you go dog. But um,

1650
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:39,730
but the other thing is this could also
get you ready if you're going to take on

1651
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:44,090
some other things and I don't know
what you mean. In other words,

1652
01:44:44,091 --> 01:44:46,910
you put the bumps one again to
start. Yeah, start stretching.

1653
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:50,090
So you go like I'm running this train,
the Lakers are in town,

1654
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:54,610
they're all going to get in here. I
need to loosen it up an appetizer. Yeah.

1655
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:58,970
Yeah. That's your, your, your bum
hole. Just going like, oh, okay.

1656
01:44:58,971 --> 01:45:02,240
We're playing ball today. Like
stretch. Sure, sure, sure,
sure, sure, sure. Exactly.

1657
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:05,870
Yeah. Cause it gets bigger as it
gets kind of v shaped, if you will.

1658
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:10,100
And then when the first dawn comes in,
your butthole is like, okay. All right,

1659
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:14,690
we're ready. Yeah. It's like stretching
before you run. Gotcha. The warmup. Yeah.

1660
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:15,860
Gotcha,
Gotcha.

1661
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:19,970
And in this case it has a little fun to
it so you can twirl it in your fingers

1662
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:24,260
or you can, you know,
lift it up. It's true.

1663
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:27,640
Give a little space. Yeah.
You can prance around.

1664
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,950
Get up thing an oats around your head.
Equine diarrhea.

1665
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:41,510
So the next item, what is this next
item? This next item is the, uh,

1666
01:45:41,511 --> 01:45:45,980
the tally Ho chair. Uh Huh. Should
I bring it up? I'm terrified.

1667
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:49,220
What? Fuck is this? What is that?

1668
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:54,280
You guys can't picture multiple
ways to talk sex on this tally.

1669
01:45:54,411 --> 01:45:59,210
Ho Chair. Well, this is a
premier sex chair. Yeah.

1670
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:03,050
Is that like crocodile skin or something?
It is a,

1671
01:46:03,051 --> 01:46:05,540
I don't know what it's actually,
I don't know the upholstery,

1672
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:10,130
but it is blood designed by Marc
brassier Jones who does furniture.

1673
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:13,220
I'm sure you've heard of. Uh, I see,

1674
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:17,150
I see a doctor sitting here and eating
someone's box or something here at the

1675
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:22,120
end. Right. You're like, there's one way.
Am I okay? And Robert, Robert, Robert,

1676
01:46:22,121 --> 01:46:22,520
all wrong.

1677
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:26,180
There's a myriad of positions you can
take with you that I was pregnant.

1678
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:30,530
And then the doctor is like, I got to
check, make sure everything's all right.

1679
01:46:30,531 --> 01:46:34,460
And he's like here that I always saved
this for the ninth month and he unzips

1680
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:37,160
and then he puts it in there. He's
like how everything feels. All right.

1681
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:42,050
What are those called? Cep. The lameness
subset. Speculums yeah. Oh yeah. My,

1682
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,930
my Dick has to work this
time cause my spec was broken

1683
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:52,350
and I skinned
so stupid.

1684
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:59,580
So people purchase these and they have
sex in various positions that you can't

1685
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:04,260
have an a bed. Apparently I
see the curves and um, oh yeah.

1686
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:08,550
I mean this second little
stepladder. Yeah, that's kind
of, that's how you get it.

1687
01:47:08,551 --> 01:47:13,110
You can put your hands here when the lady,
you can get in the door in your hands.

1688
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:15,510
There you go. Upwards, right? Oh yeah.

1689
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:19,910
One thing I'm not really feeling real
freaks. Yeah. Using this thing. Got It.

1690
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:23,820
You come up with a whole different
things when a bed just isn't enough.

1691
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:29,920
Our couch or a sink or a floor or a
hammock or a million other things you need

1692
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:33,360
to buy a specific piece of furniture to
fuck on, but the one that I don't like,

1693
01:47:33,361 --> 01:47:37,630
I'd not feeling this material because
it reminds me of hell raiser hell bound

1694
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,080
hell raiser to when the
people were skinless,

1695
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,510
it was red and you know what I'm saying?

1696
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:46,530
It's like snake skin or or like you know,
red is not the cup type of reptile.

1697
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:50,250
To me that just looks like it's going
to be the kind that like you're sweating

1698
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:54,010
and sticky. It does not seem
for us than inviting. Yeah.

1699
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:59,030
Perhaps your mind will change when you'll
know that this is the actual sex chair

1700
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,820
from 50 shades of gray.
Oh,

1701
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:06,570
I'm such a big fan.
I've read every book that day.

1702
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:10,540
They come out now retail price on that.
Oh,

1703
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:14,040
knowing that fact. Well knowing
that it's from that film, okay,

1704
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:15,120
that's going to be bonkers.

1705
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:19,470
I would almost say that they should tell
you the price without it having been in

1706
01:48:19,471 --> 01:48:23,910
the film. True. The price it was made
specifically for the, for that film.

1707
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:27,630
It's richer designer. No, no,
hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on. That six figures.

1708
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:31,950
This is only the second highest
priced item that I have.
So hold on, hold on. This,

1709
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:35,580
what material is this leather. They don't
tell us. You didn't tell us that? No,

1710
01:48:35,581 --> 01:48:40,290
I don't. Oh, the finest of, Oh,
the finest of sex chairs. Uh,

1711
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:44,760
it is made. That is snake
snakes get, so that's,

1712
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:48,060
that's where the cost is going to be.
And because it's a costume,

1713
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:53,060
we can't mass produce something that
is in this hugely successful franchise.

1714
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:55,050
Cachet of that horse. Shit. Okay.

1715
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:56,980
Uh,

1716
01:48:57,910 --> 01:49:02,590
$37,000 no. What? Okay. Okay. Hold
on, hold on. Okay, let me think.

1717
01:49:02,591 --> 01:49:03,630
Snake skin.

1718
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:11,080
I'm going to go nine,
$999 okay.

1719
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:15,550
Wow. Okay. It is $14,615.

1720
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:20,440
Oh my God. There you go.
For a fuck toy. Yeah.

1721
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:23,740
I mean you were really in
the cheap land get, I mean,

1722
01:49:23,741 --> 01:49:28,360
this is only the second tiered.
We're moving up now. Okay.

1723
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:31,800
Oh my gosh. Okay. You said that.
So let's just, sorry. So get ready.

1724
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:36,460
Shit against time. Ready? You
can, you can bring it up. Um, no.

1725
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:40,840
These fucking dumb things. Do you know
what those are Ben Wa balls. They are,

1726
01:49:40,930 --> 01:49:41,860
I'll tell you something though.

1727
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,960
I don't know a single woman on the
planet that's ever really used these,

1728
01:49:44,961 --> 01:49:46,090
put them in their pussies.
Hey,

1729
01:49:46,091 --> 01:49:48,700
you're supposed to put them in your
pussy then like rock around rocking the

1730
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:51,820
chair. It's, well,

1731
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:54,450
it's four key eagle exercises.
Yeah.

1732
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:59,050
And maybe you'll change your mind after
you'll know that these are made out of

1733
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:02,560
solid gold. Wow. Oh Wow.

1734
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:05,980
And not only that,

1735
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:10,870
the creators guarantee that you will
not get them stuck inside your body.

1736
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:15,220
How that's on the, that's
on there. I don't know.

1737
01:50:15,221 --> 01:50:19,150
How do we know how much they weigh? I
don't know how much they weigh. Shit.

1738
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,180
That would have been quite a carat gold.
Let me,

1739
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:25,120
here's always the problem with
all the gold baby is that they,

1740
01:50:25,121 --> 01:50:28,040
I don't know a single woman on the planet
that's ever been in and really you've

1741
01:50:28,041 --> 01:50:32,830
never been done? Not One. What about a man
buddy? Somebody listening has done this.

1742
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:36,580
Of course right now someone is listening
and doing it. I'm asking you if you are,

1743
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,720
let me know.

1744
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,080
Please let us know or they're listening
to our show now and using them as

1745
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:44,320
they're listening. Sure. How else
would you work out? Key goals. Oh,

1746
01:50:44,321 --> 01:50:45,990
you can do right now doing it right now

1747
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:50,120
and I got both.
Then you can hear him.

1748
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:55,300
The problem is getting them out.

1749
01:50:55,301 --> 01:50:59,260
I imagine now that you can just push
and they probably will come out. Um,

1750
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:03,280
push them out. Um, I'd be a little
scared of having loose things in there.

1751
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:07,600
What about a boy? Do you think you could
keep all this up pal up my booty hole?

1752
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,570
Some gold up your butt if I
wanted to really train those
muscles. Yeah. Hell yeah.

1753
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:17,340
And you can do it for a mere price
of gold oil out auto. Three grand.

1754
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:20,680
Oh wait, you said it's bigger than
the more, it's more so it's more,

1755
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:25,000
what was the last one?
The chair 14 fuck 2020,

1756
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,640
19 uh,
19 six to be exact.

1757
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:36,030
Yeah. In 20 g's on some gold balls for
your blessing. That's a big flex, right?

1758
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:41,470
You get on Instagram, be like,
got my 20 grand pussy balls.

1759
01:51:41,471 --> 01:51:45,220
He was from my key goals. My girl's
pussy. He's got all types of gold.

1760
01:51:45,221 --> 01:51:47,010
His side of it. Tommy. Yes.

1761
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:50,860
Would you close out our son's college
fund and buy me these? I would love to it.

1762
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:56,140
I want to do 'em for Ya.
Just for wanting to be covered in gold.

1763
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:00,580
I want to do this for us as a couple
while you sit down and you tell him, okay,

1764
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,530
what do you do this easy?
You tell him.

1765
01:52:02,531 --> 01:52:04,120
It was like when he's a
senior in high school,

1766
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:08,380
you go your father and I want to tell
you something and then he's like, okay,

1767
01:52:08,381 --> 01:52:12,670
and you're like sit down and then
you reach down and you poop them out.

1768
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:16,990
I go and then you can put them on the
table and you roll them over to him.

1769
01:52:16,991 --> 01:52:19,600
And he's like, what the fuck
is this? And you're like,

1770
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:23,770
that's your college education
fund. And he's like, what is this?

1771
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:28,030
It's mom's gold pussy balls.
And he's like, I love you mom.

1772
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:31,120
Or you can wait even longer.

1773
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:36,370
And then when you pass on the
lawyers reading your son the will,

1774
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:40,210
there you go, even better. And he
said, your mother and father left.

1775
01:52:40,211 --> 01:52:43,580
You're nothing except the one for each

1776
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:48,320
$10,000 per Ellison Julian.
Great.

1777
01:52:48,321 --> 01:52:53,300
It should get one of mommy and daddy's
Ben Wa balls. I could fit more than two.

1778
01:52:53,301 --> 01:52:58,250
I think two is, especially
with your new, uh,

1779
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,440
lane of entertainment
that you're into them,

1780
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,800
you're going to be fitting six times
out of that. And they're, yeah,

1781
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:06,480
I've had two children. You know,
the clippers are in town too.

1782
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:12,500
Um,
now this final item [inaudible] my Lord.

1783
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,850
Now this one is definitely something
that you'll want to invest in. Oh my God.

1784
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:19,820
And a leave to your children
for generations to come.

1785
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:23,330
This is a big King Cobra Cock ring.
Oh my God.

1786
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:28,940
Oh, this is a cock ring.
That is a cock ring.

1787
01:53:28,941 --> 01:53:32,950
It takes over 100 man hours to craft what?
Yes.

1788
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:37,840
Is it made of real two made out of gold
as well. Well how do you, how do you,

1789
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:40,970
I mean this is, this is another
flex move it sounds like. Yes.

1790
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,080
100% and it gives you energy
having that snake on your,

1791
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:49,160
your cock energy that you can't
even quantify with things out money.

1792
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:53,090
I feel like you're really
good spokesman for them. Yeah.

1793
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:56,000
Now if only you found out the price of it.

1794
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:02,000
One question though, cause a cock ring,
you have to kind of sized to you're Dong,

1795
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:05,390
we've made that mistake before. So, um,

1796
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:10,170
well how would you know
that it's true? I don't, I,

1797
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:13,930
I'm not certain I feel like they would
have it a hundred a hundred man hours

1798
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:15,610
takes a lot.
So you would have to order it.

1799
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:20,770
Probably give them the dimensions of
your penis and don't say the wrong size.

1800
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:25,490
Yeah. Give him the real, the real size.
Talked about my dream today. Yeah.

1801
01:54:25,630 --> 01:54:30,140
My therapist. She goes, so the dream
about the black penis, she said penis.

1802
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:33,410
I said, dawn, she usually
mirrors my language to use that.

1803
01:54:33,411 --> 01:54:37,090
You use juvenile word talk about it
Dong right. That's what I'm saying.

1804
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:41,000
But she mirrored, usually she
mirrors back to me with my language,

1805
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:44,660
but she referred to it as a
penis. Yeah. I just remember that.

1806
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:48,530
I had to say a sentence
says Dick. I was like, Ooh.

1807
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:52,460
But she was English as a second language,
you know,

1808
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:54,500
so I was kind of like
laughing and then I was like,

1809
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,073
Dick,

1810
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:03,310
I think you'd have to change the species
of snake for depending on the dog,

1811
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:08,820
obviously. Oh, I see. What do you mean?
Like that's a, that's a cobra for you.

1812
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:11,600
The one you're discussing,
you probably need like an Anaconda.

1813
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:17,540
Still bigger snake. You know, if you're
going to get fit Lebron and his buddy,

1814
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:20,160
you're going to need a bigger snake.
Yeah.

1815
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:24,850
It's like Good Morning King Cobra going
to be like this neck thinks he's are a

1816
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:27,080
bunch of other snacks. I
Dunno if it's gonna work, man,

1817
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:31,710
you're going to need about six snakes
now.

1818
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:36,680
How much you think this fella costs
here? Fuck. Oh Shit. That's, I mean,

1819
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:41,090
that could be anything.
That could be like 40 grand.

1820
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:46,380
It's not the most. It is
the most expensive. Oh, it
is the most expensive. Oh,

1821
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:50,880
okay. Shit. A hundred man hours,

1822
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:53,000
gold cock ring.
Where'd you find this?

1823
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:58,050
This is the silliest thing I've
ever heard of in my life. Um, okay.

1824
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:01,980
That's a silliness. Uh,
I'm going to go with a

1825
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:06,800
$35,000 and your guests,

1826
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:09,050
I'm going to go higher on this one 40.

1827
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:12,530
It is $120,000.

1828
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:16,910
There are some details missing on this
thing. What the fuck, man? What else?

1829
01:56:16,911 --> 01:56:20,060
Is there a rubies, gems and diamonds
in there? The a hundred man hours dog.

1830
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:23,060
Look at that. Craftsmanship.
I know, and the materials

1831
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:27,850
I just figured and they haven't sold many.

1832
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:32,130
That's a true 120,000 yes. Yeah.
You're definitely giving them the,

1833
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:35,980
the specs on your dog. You have to,
but the cock ring, first of all,

1834
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:40,300
the fact that gold is hard, so it's not
comfortable. Do you know what I mean?

1835
01:56:40,301 --> 01:56:43,180
It's heavy. I'm assuming
it's cold. Powerful.

1836
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:47,920
It's like not a good material for
a cock ring. Right. Hard gold.

1837
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:51,730
You know what I'm saying? The way that
they positioned to sell it is it's, uh,

1838
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:54,970
it's first special occasions,
obvious, so obvious,

1839
01:56:54,971 --> 01:56:59,590
and you can wear it all day to really
feel that power. You can just keep it. Oh,

1840
01:56:59,591 --> 01:57:03,670
I see. You're saying. Yes. So it doesn't
stay cold. You know, it's not just like,

1841
01:57:03,671 --> 01:57:05,260
you're not just going to
wear this all the time.

1842
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:08,320
You're putting it on your Dick in
the morning. You're going to work.

1843
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:11,760
You're calling people on the phone being
like, buy, sell, buy, sell, and then your,

1844
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,600
your Dick. You just feel the energy
from it, the whole, right. I see. I see.

1845
01:57:16,601 --> 01:57:19,930
That's why it's a real boss moved on now.
I like that.

1846
01:57:19,931 --> 01:57:23,320
Now I feel like we have to invest in it
as a gold snake hog ring for it. Yeah.

1847
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:26,920
Yeah. It's a good, it's a really
good idea. That's your agent.

1848
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:30,610
We're going to book you a Gig so you
can do it. I gotta get this cock ring.

1849
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:33,700
Anything you can do.

1850
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:38,140
How can I get an extra
hundred and $20,000 crazy?

1851
01:57:38,141 --> 01:57:42,040
Who would spend that on a cock ring? I
don't know. Somebody Sultan of Brunei.

1852
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:43,690
Actually it might even be Lakers.

1853
01:57:43,691 --> 01:57:46,180
There might be like he's playing with it
right now. Yeah, they probably play it.

1854
01:57:46,181 --> 01:57:48,340
We might've. That's true. You know what
they're like, we haven't sold many.

1855
01:57:48,341 --> 01:57:51,370
I bet you fucking half of them
went to some NBA guys. Yeah,

1856
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:55,510
they have a lot of disposable
income. That's true. Um, uh, Josh,

1857
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,590
you definitely redeemed yourself.

1858
01:57:56,591 --> 01:58:01,060
That was a fantastic thank
Josh and then a new song.

1859
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:05,440
Thanks for having me.
We really need to make that happen.

1860
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:10,690
It just feels like a college party.

1861
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:17,560
All right. Jesus. Alright. Yeah, right.

1862
01:58:17,561 --> 01:58:20,080
Really great segment with Josh.
That was great.

1863
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:24,430
I feel like he really brought it home.
He really redeemed himself on that one.

1864
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:27,700
Well, I mean, what do you think? Certainly
nothing wrong with the last time either.

1865
01:58:27,701 --> 01:58:31,630
I know you really were laughing about it.
Uh,

1866
01:58:31,631 --> 01:58:36,631
I want to bring to everyone's attention
a discussion and argument we had the

1867
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:42,270
other day. Yep. You often mispronounced

1868
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:47,140
things make can wait. Can I say why?

1869
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:52,150
Yes. Because I was raised by
two Hungarian parents. Yes.

1870
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:56,600
And they were learning English and
they taught me how to speak English.

1871
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,011
That's true.

1872
01:58:57,011 --> 01:59:02,011
So it's funny because it will carry on
to people who didn't speak correctly.

1873
01:59:02,081 --> 01:59:07,081
We'll teach you and then you will
have it go on through your life.

1874
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:11,620
42 years. You're a native
English speaker. Not True.

1875
01:59:11,621 --> 01:59:15,000
I spoke Hungarian first and then
I learned English all right.

1876
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,880
At the same time as my parents did well,

1877
01:59:16,881 --> 01:59:20,290
I realized the big difference
is that my mother, uh,

1878
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:23,380
mispronounces a lot of things,
there's a lot of things incorrectly,

1879
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:27,190
but I always had the balance
of my father was American,

1880
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:30,910
so he taught you the right
way and it would just stand
out clearly. I'm like, oh,

1881
01:59:30,911 --> 01:59:35,020
she's saying that completely incorrectly
and this person will balance it out.

1882
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:39,210
And also also in my
defense, Tom. Yeah, yeah.

1883
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:44,350
I was an avid reader growing up. Okay.
No, I read a lot of books. However,

1884
01:59:44,351 --> 01:59:47,170
I didn't always know how
to say those words aloud,

1885
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:51,010
so I knew I knew how to read them.
But I didn't know how they were spoken.

1886
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:52,510
So that's another problem.

1887
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:55,900
What was funny to me was that we got
into this conversation about a word I'll

1888
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:56,920
bring up momentarily,

1889
01:59:57,430 --> 02:00:02,430
but what's interesting is that I actually
thought was what's interesting to me,

1890
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:07,300
I actually thought you were
pronouncing it a foreign way,

1891
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:09,160
her announcing it or pronouncing it.

1892
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:12,490
I actually thought you were
pronouncing it a foreign way.

1893
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:17,740
It turns out you are actually pronouncing
it the way supposedly Americans

1894
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:21,740
pronounce it.
Even though I,

1895
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:26,140
I swear I hear it more
said the British way.

1896
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:30,430
So the word is the word that I'm,

1897
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:34,900
it's the full word, the that comes
from, if you were to say mini,

1898
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:37,060
what's the full word?
Miniature.

1899
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:42,130
You say miniature.
Miniature because I am pronouncing,

1900
02:00:42,131 --> 02:00:46,830
it's spelled m. I. N. I.
A. T. U. R. E. Yeah. I've,

1901
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:49,420
I've hung out with some weird people,

1902
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:53,260
but I've always heard people
say miniature miniature.

1903
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:58,090
And it turns out the way that I'm used
to saying it is how the Brits would say

1904
02:00:58,091 --> 02:01:01,210
it meant a Cha.
They say miniature.

1905
02:01:01,211 --> 02:01:05,170
And that's what I said and I
thought you were such a weird,

1906
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:07,360
weird person,
you know?

1907
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:12,000
So the Americans say miniature,

1908
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:17,010
but I swear more Americans that I've
had conversations with pronounce it the

1909
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:21,580
British way. Miniature. I agree.

1910
02:01:21,581 --> 02:01:25,810
I I,
I've heard it spoken both ways.

1911
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:34,820
Oh my God.

1912
02:01:38,570 --> 02:01:40,520
Yeah,
sure.

1913
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:44,300
I want her to do all our
sure announcement. Yeah.

1914
02:01:44,301 --> 02:01:47,620
This is the American flag here,
man.

1915
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,570
Let us know that this is an
American way of saying it.

1916
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,850
I still think it sounds so stupid.

1917
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:56,900
I am only ever thought of it as miniature.
I've only,

1918
02:01:56,901 --> 02:01:59,210
I swear to you miniature was the first,

1919
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:04,420
the first time that it ever caught my
attention was with you in bed when you're

1920
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:08,360
like, oh, like a miniature one.
I was like, wait, what the fuck?

1921
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:12,260
I've only ever said or her miniature.

1922
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:16,190
Miniature. None. That's
interesting though,

1923
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:20,600
because you'd think that the British
pronunciation is mini at Cha. Exactly.

1924
02:02:20,601 --> 02:02:24,550
Which is why I accused you of saying
it the British way. Correct. Yeah.

1925
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:29,060
I was thinking, oh, the phonetic
pronunciation must be the British way.

1926
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:33,200
Correct us as Americans are saying,
like,

1927
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:35,420
I was thinking that my pronunciation,

1928
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:39,470
it must be the dumb American
adoption of it miniature,

1929
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:40,730
but it's the other way around.

1930
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:43,190
Let me tell you another one that had
just occurred to me that I'd like to

1931
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:48,140
investigate right now. Okay. Now, when
I lived in England for a year, yes,

1932
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:50,360
they would always say the phrase,

1933
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:54,830
rightly so and rightly so
and rightly so right now.

1934
02:02:54,831 --> 02:02:58,130
I don't know if in the US, cause
I've said, yeah, rightly so. And I,

1935
02:02:58,131 --> 02:03:01,370
and someone goes, you mean
rightfully so? And I'm like,

1936
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:03,650
I'm not sure which one's correct.
Is it right?

1937
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:08,660
Felisa or rightly so and
rightly sounds more correct to,

1938
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:13,190
to me rightly so. Yeah. Would you look it
up? Is it rightly so? What do you think?

1939
02:03:13,191 --> 02:03:15,570
Or rightfully so.
Um,

1940
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:19,820
rightly so and rightly so.

1941
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:23,930
I think rightly so.
But a lot of people think of rights.

1942
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:27,920
Here's what it says you
want to here it says

1943
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:33,370
in good uses rightly is the
opposite of wrongly, right?

1944
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:38,590
Rightfully means much the
same as by rights and saying
rightfully the announcer.

1945
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:43,790
Oh, is, okay. So it's making that
distinction. Does that make sense to you?

1946
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:46,280
Say it again? Um, right. Oh,

1947
02:03:46,281 --> 02:03:49,900
meaning once pertaining to one's rights.
Yeah,

1948
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:54,910
the rightful owner and
rightly Karoly spoken.

1949
02:03:55,251 --> 02:03:59,420
Used to say that a decision or action
you have just reached is are just

1950
02:03:59,421 --> 02:04:04,060
described as fair. Correct. Morally right.
In your opinion? Rightly so. Correct.

1951
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:09,170
And then write it fully and
then rightfully so is more
means much the same as by

1952
02:04:14,091 --> 02:04:15,380
rights.
I Dunno.

1953
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:20,620
It's your right as by rights I guess
one is correct action and then one is

1954
02:04:22,101 --> 02:04:25,460
within someone's rights.
I don't give a shit. Okay.

1955
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,720
Do you want to know another funny
foreigner thing you made fun of me for?

1956
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,830
We brought the stuff on this show,

1957
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:36,080
but for 42 years of my life
[inaudible] I called it a sun visor.

1958
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:39,840
You also said combative,
combative. It's combative,

1959
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:43,220
combative and then Sun,

1960
02:04:43,221 --> 02:04:48,221
Sun visor and chewing gum
because my mother always
said fucking dive on Sango no

1961
02:04:49,651 --> 02:04:50,484
one says children.

1962
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:55,620
I did until you pointed out that people
don't say when you were like in college

1963
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:57,420
being like, I want a
piece of chewing. Yes.

1964
02:04:57,600 --> 02:05:00,370
My whole and nobody's
at me ever except for,

1965
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:04,920
they probably thought you
were being funny. You know
like it's like your friend.

1966
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:08,880
Yeah. What the fuck? I mean Shauna
is an American. I feel like Sean,

1967
02:05:08,881 --> 02:05:11,240
I should have been like, hey
dude, nobody says chewing gum.

1968
02:05:11,241 --> 02:05:16,080
Cause I would say that chewing gum
like pretending to sound that way.

1969
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:20,730
You know like I just got a
piece of chewing gum but then,

1970
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,970
cause Shauna and I would pluralize
things as much as I'm going to take this

1971
02:05:23,971 --> 02:05:28,770
envelope to the US postal office. Correct.
The full thing to be a dork. Yeah.

1972
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:32,650
Yeah. Our trade that is Joe.
I like to put the s on that,

1973
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,470
but I think Shauna thought you're right.
I think Shauna did think I was drinking.

1974
02:05:37,290 --> 02:05:39,630
Oh yeah, let's have some chewing
gums. Like we'd make fun of.

1975
02:05:39,631 --> 02:05:43,260
Germans had German people say
chewing gums combatitive though.

1976
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,230
But it was all wrong. You
said it, you were like, ah,

1977
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,900
you mean combative and then
when I pointed it out to you,

1978
02:05:48,901 --> 02:05:50,310
I watched your face melt.

1979
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:56,160
I can't believe you couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it.

1980
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:59,460
I didn't want to believe it. I can't,
I mean again, you know I'm not,

1981
02:05:59,461 --> 02:06:03,810
I was raised by fucking
foreigners, man. Yeah. Oh, I
wanted to talk about something.

1982
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:07,710
Oh, I'm, let me see what else I had.
Oh. Oh, here's another pronunciation.

1983
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:12,060
American thing. Okay. How
do you say the word okay?

1984
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:17,060
Our son likes to color
with little wax made thing.

1985
02:06:17,191 --> 02:06:21,780
Since what? Crayons.
Crayons. There's also cranes.

1986
02:06:22,110 --> 02:06:26,550
There's what? Crayons. Crayons.
Crayons. Yeah. That's not it.

1987
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:28,710
I don't think so either.
I think it's crayons.

1988
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:33,060
My dumb friend from Philadelphia
says tournament tournament,

1989
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:34,043
so I don't,

1990
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:39,230
I mean that's so I've heard the original
a tournament or a tour to go on a tour.

1991
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:43,470
Yeah. What do you say?
Tour. Wait, what? A tour.

1992
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:48,030
You see it tour? Yeah. What
do you say? I don't say tour.

1993
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:52,950
Tour is the past tense of tear. I
tore my ligament. I'm going on tour.

1994
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:57,760
I'm going on tour. Oh No. And
tour. That's foreign sounding now.

1995
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:02,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. On tour. If you live
here, you say you're going on tour? No,

1996
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:06,480
that's if you live in the south sea.
Your English dialect is from the south.

1997
02:07:06,481 --> 02:07:09,180
Because Christina, the first,
the first few years of dating,

1998
02:07:09,181 --> 02:07:11,550
you kept saying Christina,
you said my name like that.

1999
02:07:11,551 --> 02:07:16,260
Like a Hillbilly Hillbilly,
North Carolina at time?

2000
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:21,250
No, no, as nim toe torn. It's,

2001
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:27,000
I say tournament. It's
a Torah. A tournament.

2002
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:30,830
I say tournaments as well. That's
what you're saying. Tournament. Okay.

2003
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:35,690
And then you go on tour,
you go on tour, the one

2004
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:41,330
tour tour. But I say tour. You
say tour? I go on tour. Oh,

2005
02:07:41,331 --> 02:07:45,230
come on. You don't really talk to say that
to you? Sure. I go on. I'm going on tour.

2006
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:49,550
Okay. All right. Shit. Um,

2007
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:54,020
I also want, oh well, okay.

2008
02:07:54,140 --> 02:07:58,500
I just thought I'd bring
that up. I took, uh, I, uh,

2009
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:02,850
I took such a fucking
horrendous shit at JFK airport.

2010
02:08:04,190 --> 02:08:05,010
That's is not,

2011
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:09,000
is there nothing worse than taking this
shit and an airport stall and there's

2012
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:13,560
like 500 people walking past
you and talking the whole time.

2013
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:15,570
It was horrific.

2014
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:20,040
And I had eaten eggplant for
dinner and when I woke up at six,

2015
02:08:20,041 --> 02:08:23,730
6:00 AM the farts I had were
really bad and full of sulfur.

2016
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:27,840
So I took a shit in the hotel and then
by the time I got to JFK I had to shit

2017
02:08:27,870 --> 02:08:30,540
again.
It was horrendous.

2018
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,900
It's just hot and the cleanup was bad.

2019
02:08:33,901 --> 02:08:38,230
And then I had to sit on the airplane
for hours with a dirty beat. Oh.

2020
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:40,350
Cause you know,
there's no bad day.

2021
02:08:40,351 --> 02:08:44,660
I didn't have any wipes and it was one of
those never ending wipe situations. Uh,

2022
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:48,380
so, and then every time I was, I had
cough, I had a cough, you know? Yeah.

2023
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:51,120
Then I cough and I piss
a little the whole time

2024
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:57,850
my underwear was a disaster.
Okay. It was yellow and brown.

2025
02:08:57,851 --> 02:09:01,890
And is there anything you'd like
to, uh, so discuss? Oh, nasty.

2026
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:05,610
You're telling me it was a
nightmare. Nasty birth. Oh my God,

2027
02:09:05,611 --> 02:09:06,540
you guys are so disgusting.

2028
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:11,370
Well, you, um, it is, by
the way. Um, oh my God.

2029
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:13,290
Seriously.

2034
02:09:26,401 --> 02:09:29,310
That was how can you let me fucking
ever finish a sentence. Okay.

2035
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,410
So I love getting to do this.

2036
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:36,380

I'm recapping. It's the beginning
of the new year now. Yeah, I know,

2046
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:18,290

It's 2019.

2047
02:10:18,291 --> 02:10:19,370

Pretty strange.

2061
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:11,200
Silence.

2062
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:25,593
Hello?

2063
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:40,673
Nosy.

2064
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:24,163
I don't know.

2065
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:28,963
Action.

2066
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:37,010
What is your reaction?
She's unique.

2067
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:39,720
She called me hours

2068
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:47,370
to call me in the car.

2069
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:51,600
Just don't say anything.

2070
02:13:58,550 --> 02:13:59,383
Yeah,
