But this has absolutely made my weekend.
He's such a dad. He's an ultimate.

83
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,480
Then it's a, it's, it's,
it's labeled as a meme,

84
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,570
which is dad discovers
memes for the first time.

85
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,550
He absolutely loses us
front of mind and he really,

86
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:48,080
I mean the laughter is
other level, you know? Um,

87
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,810
let me pull up the,
I think the full version.

I think your dad were that the rack
like this to my dad leaving thing,

89
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,490
I'll be like, this is really funny. You
would like it. He would like it or not.

90
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,460
He would be like, that's funny,
but there'll be no laughter.

91
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,750
Like there's no feelings.
You know,

92
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,270
your dad would think that's a really
goofy to laugh this. Well. He'd be like,

93
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,300
this fucking guy doesn't want
to get laid obviously. Right.

94
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,990
This guy doesn't give lead how much you
think he gets let your dad so more than

95
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:15,680
you ever would imagine it. More than you
ever. Well, you know what I'm saying?

96
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:20,360
Like probably ever will. Yeah. Yeah. First
of all, you know, I asked him one time,

97
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,720
I was like, how many women do you think
you've been with? And he goes, not enough.

98
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,910
That was about five years ago. It's
the right answer for him. Yeah.

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
We had a conversation.

100
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,310
Not even that indirectly led to some
numbers where I was like, seriously? Yeah.

101
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,950
Yeah. You got numbers. Well,
I didn't get all time numbers.

102
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,550
I got numbers on one trip.
One trip, one of his trips.

103
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,700
Can you please tell me it was pretty high?
What is it,

104
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,410
those double digits for like
a weekend in Club med? No.

105
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,840
Does this club med in the 80s no, he did
tell me about one trip. Okay. Tell me.

106
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,890
I mean really? Yeah. He said it was
a Cruisey went on a cruise one time.

107
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,380
Oh, he's only ever been on
like one gates cruises. Yeah.

108
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,470
Maybe that's why when he said it was
stupid, but he fucked like 10 checks.

109
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,990
Seriously? Yeah. Well I don't
even know this about my dad.
I know. That's so crazy.

110
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,580
Yeah.
When did he tell you this?

111
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,200
We were just talking about not even
about checks and he was like, yeah, fuck,

112
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,980
like 10 checks on it. No where, where were
you? Where were we when this happened?

113
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,110
Or was I not in the room?

114
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,300
Was this somebody out in the ocean? No,
no, no, no, no, no. It was recently.

115
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,660
This is recent. This is like him

bringing this? Yeah. Like that.

119
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,940

Unreal. Yeah, man. He's a savage.

That guy's DNA is core. Like
that's half of me. It's so weird.

124
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,570
It's crazy that you don't have more
siblings that you know about. Oh,

125
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:10,470
I'm sure I do. You really think you

It's like a baby discovering
your face or something. Yeah.

134

he should really wrap his knuckles.

287
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,800
He should at least the very least.
Yeah, that one is really, oof.

288
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,100
It's really bad. Well he's, I think
he's fired up. I think he's really, um,

289
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,860
he's focused energy. He really focused
on you. I mean, I don't know on you,

290
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:33,340
on someone. I don't know. I mean, I
don't know what else. I don't know.

291
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,580
I want to generally make it real clear
that, um, you know what I'm saying?

292
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,810
You know what I'm saying? I got a lot
of, uh, you know, Sam, respect and stuff.

293
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,530
You feel me? You feel me all the time
out. So this is all, it's all good.

294
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:47,470
It's all a, it's all
good. Yeah. Shout out,

295
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,280
shout out to everybody doing they thing,

296
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,260
stuff like stuff like that. I like when
you do it, can you do it for me now?

297
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,900
What's that? The first time we
got, cause you do the head thing,

298
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,260
you gotta shout out to everybody,

299
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,920
shout to everybody by all over
the world doing the thing,

300
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,540
stuff like that. And you know,
you feel me? You know what I mean?

301
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,780
Talking about Katie looks is fire up.

302
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,790
You know what I would love is if he wrote
a song about this and then if you guys

303
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,410
could rap battle, lovey, cooler.

304
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,430
You know what I want to address
is something came in you.

305
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:26,470
You mentioned something during our ads,
this episode,

306
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:31,300
and then there's something kind of related
to it in an email. Let's see. It says,

307
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:35,810
Dear Tom and Tina, I've listened to
your mom's house since episode two.

308
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,750
What I would consider myself
a bit of a mom cast historian

309
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,190
during the heat of the
Fedex Fedex scandal.

310
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,730
I had that little tickle in
the back of my brain saying,

311
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,860
I remember you guys discussing Fedex
podcasts.

312
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,070
Alas, alas, I wrote it off,

313
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,280
but a few weeks ago I decided,
you know what?

314
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

315
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,260
So starting from episode 44 I listen
to all of your podcasts through and

316
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:12,070
through. Oh my God, I'm happy
to report. I fucking found it.

317
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,410
No, I am age episode one 51
I won't go into much detail.

318
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,970
I'll just give you a timestamp.

319
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hopefully this whole debacle can be laid
to rest when a certain main mommy says

320
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,990
FedEx the proper way.
Thank you.

321
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:34,000
Submitted by Tavin. Is it
Tevin? Tevin. Caban well,

322
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,040
well thanks for submitting whatever piece
of that. Every time his name is said,

323
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,700
residents are playing, they playing at
Fedex field. So you'd say FedEx, Fedex,

324
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,140
economic, that kind of thing. But it isn't
that, at least for me, naming rights,

325
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,060
it's called,
right.

326
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,120
It kills my soul just a little
bit to hear a beautiful stadium.

327
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,730
The maybe some man said,
I love to build a stadium.

328
00:23:55,731 --> 00:24:00,140
Let's let's build a stadium where the
people could get together and congregate.

329
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,410
Amazing way. It's a,
it's a Herculean thing.

330
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,590
And then fucking FedEx comes and they
renamed it the Fedex stadium or blah,

331
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,120
blah, blah. And you're like, no,
no, no. It's not called that.

332
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,360
It's called whatever the
Fuck Wrigley Stadium.

333
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,860
It's called this you piece of shit after
the man who designed it or whatever.

334
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,570
I think a lot kinda throw
fans. Yeah, it's fine.

335
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,960
The audio dropped out. Didn't drop out,
you know? Exactly. I didn't hear that.

336
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:29,340
The audio, the Nice, well it's a,

337
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,410
it's a Herculean thing and then fucking
FedEx comes and they rename it the Fedex

338
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
stadium or blah blah blah. And you're
like, no, no, no. It's not called that.

339
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:40,850
It's called,
what's your guys?

340
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,220
I can't believe somebody listened to.
Thank you for doing that.

341
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,750
Can You admit your mistake? No, I mean
I dunno what mistake you speak of.

342
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,070
I just know that this is such
nonsense. What? Fedex? No,

343
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:58,160
I'm saying that fuck says that.
Always said it that way.

344
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:03,080
Maybe I would had a stutter back
then. That his stutter. Yeah,

345
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,860
that was my speech impediment back
when they had one and then I've been in

346
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:11,600
treatment and I don't talk about
doing ridiculous. Just not okay.

347
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,680
I don't know.
I didn't hear all that audio,

348
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,470
but okay.

349
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,600
I'm amazed.
First of all,

350
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:25,230
honor that you listened to so many
episodes and thank you for digging that up

351
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:30,231
and I rightfully will take my place
on top of mount fed ex the king of the

352
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:33,204
castle.

353
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,570
Obviously I had said it right as
most of you seem to acknowledge.

354
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:42,780
So I think you know your place now
and it's, it's, it's at the bottom.

355
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,540
All right. Whatever. Okay. Fedex,
FedEx, Fedex, whatever. Tomato,

356
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:49,850
tomato,
tomato,

357
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,840
tomato predicts on good to me
while I was gone by the way,

358
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,860
sac town ball Sacramento was um,
fantastic.

359
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,080
We have a lot to cover there.

360
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,990
We're going to get into
some of the outside details,

361
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:06,870
but the shows were a lot of fun.
Amazing crowds.

362
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,660
It just have the best fans up there.
Of course

363
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,260
everywhere, same embryo. They all came
out and Brad, it was fun. Thank you.

364
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:16,090
Mommy's for coming.
I knew you were in there.

365
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:19,300
I could hear you tell it their mommy's
cause they laugh at certain things.

366
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,180
People don't. It's great. Well it's,
it's also um, it was really neat.

367
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,100
I walked on stage one of my shows and
a girl was sitting in the front row and

368
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,100
with a marker she had written
on her forehead. Hey Hitler.

369
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,490
So you look at a girl marker and
I'm like lipstick, I don't know.

370
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,550
I go, hey killers on your forehead.
She's like, yeah. I'm like,

371
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,100
and all these people were like,

372
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,510
hey, like screaming, hey guys, the club,

373
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,200
the employees were like what is going
on with the girl on the other comment or

374
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:56,010
the other audience members were like,
why is that going on the Hay?

375
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:59,280
Hitler theme has been one of my
favorite because it's probably the most

376
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:03,360
inappropriate thing. We've honored our
permit. It's the most fun. And look,

377
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,730
if you're on board, you're on board.
If you're not, go fuck yourself.

378
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:10,170
You're not a mommy.
I mean kind of in a way it sort of,

379
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:16,030
hey so I'm the place I want to shit in
your mouth is actually in your mouth.

380
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,060
I'm hoping that they
actually ride the new place.

381
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:26,061
The new thing that takes off is this
and what I want to do is to come

382
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,510
that is again on,

383
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,570
cause that Nice Lady,
it was from a national geographic thing.

384
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,410
I said did the series finale of down.
We haven't watched it yet.

385
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,120
That's probably a good point.
Yeah.

386
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,840
I'm saying this to doing some research.
Stumbled on that.

387
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,300
And then that's how you found that.
I think so. Downton research. Yeah.

388
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,540
I was like Oh in 1926 what happened?

389
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:05,040
And then came out.
What I want to know is this the best,

390
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,130
what I want to know is common.
So hard to find.

391
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,230
Like I just want to give you calm.
You have to really dig for come true.

392
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,080
Yup. Yup. It's all you
know. Well the guy come,

393
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,300
it's always such a hard thing
for men to ejaculate. You know?

394
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,150
It's good that more attention is being
focused on male orgasm gets no attention.

395
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,300
And also I think it's also cool to help
this girl that's trying to find it so

396
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:33,960
badly cause she's probably her whole
life's like I can't find what I'm looking

397
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:34,794
for again,

398
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,630
so sneaker load. So when I was gone, um,

399
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,910
you had a conversation loads.
Your Dad,

400
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,530
who you guys didn't talk about
how many chicks he bang on a trip,

401
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,110
but you did have a conversation with him.
Do you want to set it up? Yeah, sure.

402
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,300
So I invited all the pigeons keys over
or my cousins shotty and Julie and

403
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,370
everybody came to see the baby cause
I've been keeping the baby under wraps,

404
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,050
you know. Anyway, they came, uh,

405
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,480
my father has been reminiscing about
how much he hated having a baby,

406
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,050
like pacifically me, not
just a baby. Sure. Yeah,

407
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:18,270
just me and a,

408
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:21,390
and so I thought I would interview him
about this theme because every time he

409
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:24,840
comes over he like loves
Ellis, but he's like, God, God,

410
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,140
La Fuck wouldn't pay me to do that
shit again. I'm like, what do you,

411
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,170
what was so bad about,
about me? He's like, Oh,

412
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,940
you have to lik you're crying
all the time. He hated it.

413
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,400
He just hated the first part of my life.

414
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,950
But then he loved being a dad later
anyway, I just thought I would ask him.

415
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:46,300
She busted out your phone. Yeah. I just
as a casual interview. Yeah. And um, yeah,

416
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,830
so this is, this is what we were
talking about is the early days of me,

417
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,610
My Life Dad, when tell me about
the best part of parenthood.

418
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:59,290
Tell me when that starts. Go ahead. At
two months. No, not three months. He said,

419
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,490
oh I'm sorry. Yeah. Three years
after. Yeah. That's the three.

420
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:06,430
As you can tell the kid the shut
the fuck up. Sit the fuck down.

421
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,100
Go to sleep, leave me alone.
Let me drink my beer. Oh, right.

422
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,700
Cause I heard a lot of that as a kid.
I heard a go play on the freeway. Yes,

423
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,470
of course. Yeah. Whatsoever
that no, nothing. I turned
out amazing. Now obviously.

424
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,800
Yeah, that's right. I see. Yeah.
Tell me about when I was born.

425
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,940
You said it was the best three
months of your life. All of was bad.

426
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,450
That was a worst three months of
my whole life. I never forget.

427
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,160
What was your favorite part about being
a new parent and not the sleep a second.

428
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,150
Wait. So are parents not supposed to
say this kind of stuff to their kids?

429
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:46,780
Like you guys, I mean, you look at Paul's,
is that normal? I mean, it's a joke.

430
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:51,500
I know he's a good joke. Yeah,
no, it's done. Oh really? No. Oh,

431
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,490
because I've been hearing this shit.

432
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,990
If I just thought everybody how their
parents say crazy stuff like this. No,

433
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,890
really? No. Wow. Okay. I mean there's,
you know, there's different personalities.

434
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:05,630
Like I imagine, I don't
know, like my dad, you know,

435
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,480
he falls in line with a certain
personality type when it comes to that.

436
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:12,740
He doesn't say stuff like that. No, no.
Cause they, they're like, oh well can,

437
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,760
what are your, yeah, they're,
they're, they're kind of
like the overly devoted type.

438
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,540
Right. They go, there was nothing
better. I loved it so much. I mean,

439
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,240
you heard him on that phone call was,
I didn't mind change your diapers.

440
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,970
I love your shoes all over man and
care. He's that kind of love. Yeah.

441
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,530
Where it's like the over the, I mean, I
think there's, there's a middle ground,

442
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:34,700
but yeah. Your Dad, um, I mean,
I don't know if the standard,

443
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,110
you're not supposed to
say that kind of stuff.

444
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:38,840
Do you like it suck to
having yeah, a sign. Well,

445
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,240
I mean maybe that's why I have
such high self esteem. Yeah,

446
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,890
it's probably why I'm sounding
Romanian and hilarious though. Yeah,

447
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,720
totally secure. Grew up. Shut the fuck up.

448
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:51,080
Shut the fuck up is amazing.
Yeah, that's pretty good.

449
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,660
But he would tell me all the time,
go play on the freeway.

450
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,840
When you say shut the fuck up.
No, no, no. There's a joke.

451
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,640
But he would tell me I get lost and go
play on the freeway. Like if cause he,

452
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:04,780
he sounds worse than it is,

453
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,990
but like she would be drinking his beers.
You know what I mean?

454
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:11,800
Like my dad or it's a lie.
I know.

455
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,300
How does an adult, it sounds
really bad. Yeah. Okay.

456
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:22,100
So you know my dad drink like
a 12 hour every night, right?

457
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:25,010
That's normal. No, wait a minute.
Are you serious right now? Yeah.

458
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,340
You think that's normal? Well, it's,
I'm like light beer. It wasn't like,

459
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,380
it's not like always like Miller lite.

460
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,010
I want you to picture something real
quick. Just look at me. I can't,

461
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,780
none that I know this is wrong.
I can't, he wouldn't have a 12

462
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,960
right tomorrow.

463
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,170
Right. Okay. Well it
seemed normal at the time.

464
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,340
Well here's the light light beer,
Miller lite.

465
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:02,970
And the thing is I'm worried
about calories right now. No,

466
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,090
I think because he drank it was like,
I don't fucking know.

467
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,290
You know my dad was a blue collar guy.
I know he was a hard guy and he worked,

468
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,920
he worked on in the forklift business
for many years. He had his own business.

469
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,130
Really successful, you know, the
12 or a night is not injured.

470
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,940
Right.
But again,

471
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:23,870
I have to qualify it with like he
woke up for work at the crack of dawn,

472
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,740
this dude work hard fucking car and
was really successful. Functional,

473
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,830
totally high functioning something,
I don't know.

474
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,690
Right. So 12 or, and then like I'll be,
I'll be like eight or nine, I'd be like,

475
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:41,720
Hey dad, you want to play
golf? Play on the freeway.

476
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,440
And then finally I learned if I asked
him if I could have some of his beer,

477
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,010
like he put some in a cup for me
and then I, he put water in it.

478
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,040
Like I could sit next to him and
he was watching, he liked tennis,

479
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,210
so he'd be watching the tennis game with
a beer and if I drank some of it with

480
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:58,550
them, I could hang out with them. That was
a cool way to bond with your dad. Yeah,

481
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,040
it's weird, right? It's
that you understand what go
play on the freeway. Men,

482
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,430
I laugh. He would laugh and say it.
He'd go, go play on the freeway. C'Mon.

483
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,010
Gumline and it was a joke. It wasn't
like angry and I was kind of like,

484
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:16,490
okay, like I got the message to fuck
off so I would just go fuck off.

485
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,670
And that's the neat thing about being only
between like you're on your own years,

486
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,960
eight, nine and 10 somewhere
later in the beer game.

487
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,450
Yeah. But here's the thing. Well
my dad and his drinking though,

488
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,780
he never really changed.
It wasn't like he went from like,

489
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,981
well that's what happens.

490
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,910
One person tolerance when you
have 12 and nine what happens?

491
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,060
Right. But he never became angry or
shitty or solen like he was just,

492
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,240
he was himself. But with 12 years
it was kind of fucking weird.

493
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,260
And he's from the old country
too. You know, we have a
higher tolerance for, well,

494
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:55,100
my dad told me during communism, everybody
was drunk all day, like on their jobs,

495
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:57,380
cause there's no reason not to be sure.
The full,

496
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,570
what are you going to work hard for?
There was nothing to do.

497
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,860
We know about drink this bottle of vodka
and I'll see what I with a wrench. Yeah,

498
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,180
yeah, yeah. Oh for sure. Old country.
Anyways. Okay, so go ahead, play it.

499
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:11,120
Play the audio. Who Care? My Dad
had to say about my childhood.

500
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,760
Tell me about when I was born. He said it
was the best three months of your life.

501
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,130
That was a worst three months of
my whole life. I never forget.

502
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,710
What was your favorite
part about a parent losing,

503
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,020
including escaping

504
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,650
communism, giving it an internment camp
in Italy. Correct. The refugee camp.

505
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,090
Refugee camp. Yeah. I know, but
this is worse. You been born,

506
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,260
this was worse than being a displaced
homeless immigrant who doesn't speak a

507
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:49,470
word of English at the age of 20?
Escaping from a horrible, yeah.

508
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,800
Did you drink beer when I was a newborn
because of, you know you can do it.

509
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,461
And that guy,

510
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:03,050
the go to the store to get the beer
because always have to take care of you.

511
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,950
What a what a miserable life with a good
thing that in Canada you could order a

512
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:12,230
beer to the house and they the beer
company, we're bringing it off.

513
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,240
No problem. And then so when dogs are
really losing their mind, the background?

514
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,820
Yes.

515
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,240
My cousin's shotty brought
over her two year old. Uh Huh.

516
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,230
And the dogs went bananas.

517
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,410
Just chase this kid and the dog Sefton
I'm the kid step in dog shit and

518
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:28,240
everything. It was really
fun. Really Fun. Okay. Yeah.

519
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,470
Drinking beer. How old was I when
you could hear about cleaning rods?

520
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,650
I'm so glad to hear that.
That was good.

521
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,450
Do you have any parenting
advice for me by a kid, Elise?

522
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,360
See I see at least a two.

523
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,430
Okay.
So that's my cousin shotty.

524
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,230
Who doesn't know what the fuck and be
conversations are and like she chimes in

525
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,880
all the time on everything.

526
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,380
Like I was on the phone with Ryan sickler
talking about like a sleep training,

527
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:02,601
right?

528
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:06,250
Because Ryan has a one year old Bella
and they sleep train her and I'm just

529
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:07,790
curious learning about it,

530
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,850
his method because it worked for them
and Mike fucking cousin is like listening

531
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:17,470
to my conversation on speaker phone with
Ryan and she's like commenting like,

532
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,170
no, it doesn't work. No, you can't
do it until he's six months old.

533
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,080
Like just try me in.
I'm like, motherfucker,

534
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,090
lemongrass is not your conversation
cause she shiny. That's what she does.

535
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,500
She just butts in your shit. Like
she, the personalities, like she just,

536
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,780
she knows everything about everything
and you're like, Bro, it's not,

537
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,100
this is not for you.
Like could you not fucking talk.

538
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,410
So okay. But anyway, so that's shotty.
It's shiny. I love you shiny. I love you.

539
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:45,940
But you know,
stay in B

540
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,520
electrically. I like chick. Yeah,

541
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,530
it shocks the kid had,

542
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:56,550
it falls enough floor sleeves that 15
minutes that comes at the leash bolts.

543
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,730
Like, why now? Why this kid's on fire?

544
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,580
Or I put in the stroller because
otherwise these ESOP cause,

545
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,830
see I thought it was rude of me
to buy her alleys and the airport.

546
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:12,700
I was watching this young kids
that just started to walk.

547
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,560
Thanks. One second. One second.
Then that kid is 30 yards away.

548
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,370
Oh yeah. You gotta have a leader
sometimes a short the bottom line.

549
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,640
I want to keep my appendix.

550
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,220
Yeah, just keep talking. That's so crazy.

551
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,460
Yeah.

552
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,900
Do you ever have people in your life that
just the no one's answering and still,

553
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,060
yeah. The thing is, okay, so the leash,

554
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:46,480
they took me to Europe when I was like
two years old and they put me on a leash

555
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,771
like a harness.

556
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:52,280
It's like a leather harness and there's
pictures of me in a leather harness and

557
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:55,170
let you guys couldn't just hold
my hand or something. Yeah.

558
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,740
We'll put you the leash. I don't
want to lose you. Okay, thanks.

559
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,830
Wow. That's pretty
crazy. Savage. Yeah. Wow.

560
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,950
No,
please don't.

561
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,180
Please don't go.
No.

562
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,150
Is this my therapy after it? My Dad?
Yeah. I'm trying to get you into play.

563
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,590
Shrink tomorrow. Yeah. How do you
feel as primal? Screaming, oh,

564
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,610
is this real or is this
real? Yeah, for real.

565
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,070
It all started. This whole thing began
and the primal scream therapy group.

566
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,900
This is fair.
Some people,

567
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,400
no, it's done. Really? Yeah. It's
like Burke. That's what I said.

568
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,350
Yeah, like if he lost a thousand pounds
and we're sweatpants. Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,780
Well,
very good at this.

570
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,070
The old hands could let go and be
crying within minutes or even seconds.

571
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:09,020
Great racking sobs and he leaves and those
scary silent moments when their lungs

572
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:12,590
would seize up
before the next on slot.

573
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,610
Fuck you. This guy. That's
terrible as it. Cool ponytail.

574
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,440
I know I sang on his shoulder.

575
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,860
He's going to touch it like crazy
loud when he wants you to see it.

576
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:25,220
That's why that he people would, pony
tells you have to display it. The men,

577
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,900
a guy and during one of my shows
this weekend was like Tom, Tom, what?

578
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,090
And he goes, look at it. Let me wear a
ponytail. He showed me his money down.

579
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,560
You have to show you, you have to
showcase it. If you're going to be a dude,

580
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:39,720
look at his deck. You can see it. I just
sweat pants. Yeah, you guys have great.

581
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,010
Yeah.

582
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,580
Sweaters don't look good on me and asked.

583
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,820
One woman was stalking me and
screaming, I hate you. I hate men.

584
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:53,690
And it's also like a bad act in class.
Yeah, that's what I thought this is. Yeah.

585
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,290
See you daddy.
You bastard

586
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,190
and a man in the group would take
this and run with it, but I'm bad.

587
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,150
I'm a man.
My Penis.

588
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,000
Just so you can see his
dick. That's great. That was
terrible. I hate these people.

589
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,020
Yeah. Can I tell you something? My
Dad is, we need to buy this for sure.

590
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:17,570
We're going to, yeah, it, my
dad's behavior is nothing,

591
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:21,140
I think is my mom was such a cray cray.
Then my dad seems normal by comparison.

592
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,330
Yeah. I mean that's why I'm not doing
this kind of stuff and crying in the fetal

593
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:29,030
position. How are you not crazier than
Shit television set comp. I swear to God,

594
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,520
like watching American TV and be like,
oh,

595
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,160
did you think though like

596
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,290
families are like that or just on TV?
No,

597
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,020
I thought that everyone else's
family was like that except for mine.

598
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,180
And like one day I might meet
people like that are really, yeah.

599
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,200
What about when you would hang out
with friends or boyfriends houses?

600
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:49,420
Like were they more normal to you? Yeah,
and that's why I wasn't home alone.

601
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,870
I was always in my France on his house
and shot, it was, his house was heaven.

602
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,920
They had tuna casserole and their
fridge and I was like her much so sweet.

603
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,590
Castro,

604
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,570
this sweet lady and she'd made there's
cookies on the counter and you're like,

605
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:06,890
wait, what? You guys have cookies
casserole? What's that like?

606
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,750
And now what about when she would come
to your house? But she like, ah, yeah.

607
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,610
Really? Yeah. I don't think she
liked, we didn't hang out at my house.

608
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,850
I have much because she was
more like, hey art. Like Ah,

609
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,060
like maybe my dad took us to Hungary. No,
that's right. We were like 18, and uh,

610
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,150
she's used to him now, so yeah.
She's been with my family forever.

611
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:30,240
She just used to it. Yeah. I,
we should ask her actually.
I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. Uh,

612
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,123
but

613
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:35,230
yeah, I dunno. Wait, so what did you
think of, of like sitcoms and stuff?

614
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,430
Um, yeah, I dunno. I mean, I kind
of thought of it as, you know,

615
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,940
I knew that I knew that my, you know,
you're so aware of your foreign,

616
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,190
you have to foreign parents.
Yeah. But I had one,

617
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:47,680
so the distinction is what
really stood out there.

618
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:52,540
Like my dad was a pretty much
your standard American White Guy,

619
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,120
right? He was just Apple Pie, you know?

620
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,190
And my mom was like this total
alien, you know? So you really, yeah.

621
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:03,280
So it wasn't a IC, you're saying?
Yeah. You had some comparison.

622
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,680
The comparison is what would
kind of bounce you go, okay,

623
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,310
this is the American way of doing things,
right.

624
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:11,800
It's like the Latin way of doing things
and that's what stands out, you know?

625
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,120
And he has like,

626
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,120
he has such the eye ideal American
upbringing that we really would got get

627
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:22,220
America normalcy to the fullest and then,

628
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,570
and then she would put a little spices
on it and she would fuck you all up with

629
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:27,460
her bullshit. She would
do, she was just, it was,

630
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,500
that's what stood out is like
that, you know? Yeah, yeah,

631
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,420
yeah.
Cause I really do feel like a,

632
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:37,421
an alien because both my parents were so
hardcore live here and grow up with two

633
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:39,780
foreigners.
Yeah.

634
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,740
You only think you understand as normal
is when you're with other people. Yeah.

635
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,460
Watching TV,
you got what are,

636
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:48,430
then you go to these houses and you see
how they are. I just thought it would.

637
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,490
Yeah. That was just their world. Got
a lot of other houses suck though too,

638
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:56,380
you know? Really. Yeah. I like my house. I
mean, I remember I would go to my buddies,

639
00:43:56,381 --> 00:44:00,340
Dan Dan's house in Minneapolis and one
thing that they always had that we never

640
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:04,510
had was a bunch of junk food. And
I was like, ah man. Just every,

641
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:08,500
they had a one fridge that was just sodas.
Ah, that's cool. You're 10 years old,

642
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,770
you go like,
we're going to do that and just soda.

643
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,640
Yeah. Okay. My Dad had a fridge in the
garage just per fresca. FRESCA and bear.

644
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:21,470
Yeah. You weren't just
a quiet yeah. Hell yeah.

645
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,430
Shit.
Great.

646
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,440
There's uh, yeah, of that stuff.

647
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:30,790
But he had all the sugary drinks,
which has a 10 year old is really,

648
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,070
you know,
and the daily,

649
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,700
they limited what you could eat, your
parents. We just never really had that.

650
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,960
I mean,
it would just wasn't on,

651
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,110
we never were like throwing
it on the grocery list.

652
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,210
I never remember making that request.

653
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,270
It was that thing where we had
soda when you know it was, I dunno,

654
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,000
maybe a weekend and you ordered a pizza
and that's when you would always get

655
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:54,780
like a two liter with a pizza, you
know, delivered. That was the soda.

656
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,920
We didn't have 20 cans of [inaudible] her.
Yeah.

657
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,460
My Dad, we always had it in
my dad's. So we started to,

658
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:06,000
I feel like as we got older, but you
know, they back then when you're a kid,

659
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,460
that's when diet coke became the craze.

660
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,690
So my parents had diet coke in the
house and when you're young you're like,

661
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:16,270
this is fucking disgusting.
Anything as a kid tastes like shit.

662
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,020
And then all of a sudden, I don't
know, you turn 18, you're like, no,

663
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:23,540
it's pretty good. It's better
for me. Yeah. Yeah. So wow.

664
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,500
We didn't have, I mean, so I
remember his house being go,

665
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,320
but then I remember just weird,
weird people's houses.

666
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,860
I remember that going to the,
Oh, I had a friend that I liked,

667
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:35,130
actually my mom's um,
you know,

668
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,440
eccentric or different, um, normalcy was,

669
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,100
was normal to me because that's
home. That's what you grab. What?

670
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:48,450
I had a friend who, they are two
American, there were like too quiet.

671
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,320
I remember like nobody says shit
to each other and they had a goal,

672
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:55,260
like a fish pond in their house and me.
I was like,

673
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:58,380
I'm going to touch all these fucking
fishes. And so I was such an asshole.

674
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,670
I would touch all, they're really
expensive. Quite. Yeah. Oh my God,

675
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,030
that's such a deck yet. But they are
super, super reserved and I'm like,

676
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:08,790
you guys are weird. I don't, I don't
like quiet houses. That's the thing.

677
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:12,630
You know how Charles thing is like you
have to react. Told me like you love it.

678
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,930
So when people were reserved,
I always thought it was weird.

679
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,140
I always took it as this
like duplicitousness like Ah,

680
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:22,770
these motherfuckers are shady.
Like if you're not screaming,

681
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:23,880
I mean something is wrong.

682
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,360
I remember going to my buddy IRA's
place when I was a kid. Yeah.

683
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:33,060
Okay. It was a little, ah, where
did you grow up? There's no,

684
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,270
this kid was it, this is in Milwaukee. And

685
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,980
when I would wake up and know feeling
like Friday night or Saturday night there

686
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:42,240
before they drove us home,

687
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,100
they would toast bagels and melt
cheese on them. And I was like,

688
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,680
this is probably the best thing I've
ever had in my entire life. Huh. I'd,

689
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:55,170
I'd never, never had a Bagel
because you guys are not, you know,

690
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,720
so no funny little hats in
our house, but they, um,

691
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,950
I really did think that was the, and
I thought that was like Rad. I go,

692
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,530
I cannot wait to go to his house
again because, you know, I would say,

693
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,650
why don't we have that at our house? And
then in my house they would go like, Huh,

694
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,860
that was too ethnic. It was just
on your is I think, I dunno.

695
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:19,830
It was just like out of
the realm of possibilities.

696
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,080
I remember I begged my mom to, uh, to
bake something for me. I'd be like, mom,

697
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,110
like all the other moms,
they bake stuff for their kids.

698
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,040
Well fuck these are that a mom.
They don't

699
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,190
have to fucking work for a living. Like,
okay. I'm sorry. Good conversation.

700
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,270
It was fun. Yeah. You mean
a half hour your life. Okay.

701
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,160
Now I'm not talking like
make it from scratch.

702
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:42,970
Like just buy a fucking roll of
Pillsbury bitch. Yeah. Cut that shit up.

703
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:46,240
Put it in the oven. Oh, let me tell you
this before we get too far away from it.

704
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,040
Yeah. Um, so in, in we are
ordering this by the way.

705
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,950
Oh definitely. Yeah, we live and make a
note of that. Yeah, we've got to get that.

706
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,223
That's great.

707
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,910
I was in ball Sacramento this weekend.

708
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,870
And you okay there we get in,

709
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,770
we decided to go get some
pregame pretty showed meal.

710
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,080
We go to, uh, to get some smooshy. Mm.

711
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,680
So we go to this place,

712
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:17,120
it's really close to the
club and we order food.

713
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,260
It's media. It's just like, it's, it's
okay. As far as Sushi places, it's not a,

714
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,360
you know, it's not like, Oh wow, the
Sushi here is amazing, but it's like,

715
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,340
it does the job. You Go, it's not
bad. It's not great. It's fine.

716
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,180
It's not a succulent. Chinese
guests, not secular, but it's fine.

717
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,200
I order, we're done ordering. I'm
there. I'm up there with blue band. Um,

718
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:42,950
the bill comes, she drops off the bill.
Now I'm on a business trip and you know,

719
00:48:42,951 --> 00:48:44,330
this is not unusual.

720
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Most comedians or even people that just
travel for a living a lot to have their,

721
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,030
they're basically personal expense
card and your business expenses.

722
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:55,910
It helps you organize,
do your taxes and whatnot.

723
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:01,220
So I pull out my business card,
which happens to be American Express card.

724
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:06,260
I put it on there and I say, you
know, uh, ready to pay the bill.

725
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:12,070
So the server just kind
of very shortly rudely,

726
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,040
I, in my opinion,
responds visa, mastercard,

727
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,320
cash. No, she's a white lady
it sounds like. No, she,

728
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,410
she's a, she is a Hungarian
wizard. Just got a real treat.

729
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,230
Just that she is, yeah.
Do you want to just,

730
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,740
can we translate what you just said?
Old Pussy eyes. She's Asian. Yeah.

731
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,670
My Dad taught you that or your dad
did teach me. Okay, good. So wow.

732
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:45,590
She's a, yeah. Not from around these
parts and says visa, mastercard, cash.

733
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:49,300
And I go, she goes, which do
you have? Which is not, yeah,

734
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:51,200
it's not an appropriate answer.
It's,

735
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,630
yeah, you can, I think you can go, oh,
we don't take American Express. Right.

736
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,840
Not what he goes, what do you have? And
I go, this is what I have. She goes,

737
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:04,320
you don't have anything else.
And I at that moment I go,

738
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:08,100
it's kind of interesting that she
asks that because instead of saying,

739
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,040
instead of reiterating that they
don't take it right. She says,

740
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:15,690
you don't have anything else.
So I take my chances and say,

741
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,870
no, I don't have anything
else. In other words,

742
00:50:18,871 --> 00:50:21,990
like how are we going to resolve
this? And she goes, okay.

743
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,070
And she takes the card and
she walks away and I go, oh,

744
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,930
I guess they do take it. You assume she's
going to use the card? Well, yeah. I mean,

745
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,420
she took it. She took it, she
leaves with it. She comes back,

746
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,530
know when she comes back,

747
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,920
she puts it down and she goes really
loudly so that the whole section of the

748
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:47,180
restaurant can hear. She goes,
your card declined. Oh yeah. Okay.

749
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,590
And at that point I'm bothered
for a number of reasons.

750
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:54,770
A, I know that she's lying. Yeah. Okay.

751
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,020
I'm 100% certain blackline and
I'm actually going, I'm, you know,

752
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,710
I'm about to investigate.
But the other thing,

753
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:05,300
the thing that really bothers me more
is that her tactic to get the form of

754
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:10,160
payment that she wants is that she's
trying to humiliate me. She's trying to,

755
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,740
she's banking on my announcement
that your payment has been declined,

756
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,970
is going to shame you into paying the
way I want you to pay instead of just

757
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:23,840
being straight forward. And from
the beginning, I'm sorry sir,

758
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:25,000
we don't take a minute to take it,

759
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,340
which you've heard probably many times
I've heard of before or deal with it

760
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:32,180
accordingly. But she left with the
car to run the card. Right. So she,

761
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,450
so when she said your car was a client,

762
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:40,610
I know for certain that she's lying
and just to vet, make sure I go,

763
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,880
okay, I flip the card over. I go, I'm
going to call the credit card. She walked,

764
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:49,430
she was like, kind of didn't anticipate
that that would be an option.

765
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,820
Walks away. Okay. Walk away.

766
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,660
I call the credit card company
American Express. Hey, what's up? Um,

767
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,170
I'm at a restaurant and they just
said that my card was declined.

768
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,030
Was it declined? No. And I said, well,
so what's happening? He goes, well,

769
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,380
there's no attempt made to
charge your card. I said, okay.

770
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:14,390
So now I'm pretty pissed about this, you
know, so she lied. She blatantly lied,

771
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,440
so then I go, Hey, I'm on the phone
with the credit card company. Yeah,

772
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,370
and the card wasn't declined
and she just goes to visa,

773
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,200
mastercard or cash and I go,
no, that's what she says.
Yeah, you, you call her out.

774
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,440
At this point I'm standing at the front
of the restaurant and it's getting,

775
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:34,880
you know, she's being loud. I'm being
loud. I said, visa master. She goes, visa,

776
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:38,600
mastercard or cash, and I go, no, this
is it. This is the only thing I have.

777
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,840
I didn't bring anything else. You're
going to have to run it. She goes,

778
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:46,460
your card declined. I go, no, it
wasn't. Then she takes the card again.

779
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,430
She swipes it,
she hits,

780
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,300
but she starts doing things like
hitting different buttons within.

781
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:56,750
After she swipes, see dark card,
declined card. So I was pointing to the,

782
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,270
to the monitor and I go, it looks
like he was saying, he goes,

783
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,210
your card hasn't been, there's no attempt
made to run your card for your card.

784
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:05,000
Hasn't been declined. And he goes,
your card was just used to rent a car,

785
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,800
which it was. It was just used in the
check into the hotel, which by the way,

786
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,530
they're so good about that. He goes, your
card, your card has not been declined.

787
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,330
I go, okay. So I said, you're going to
have to run the card or that's, you know,

788
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,420
it's going to be it. And
it starts to get, you know,

789
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,340
I could tell that she starts speaking
in her Pussy Samad language to somebody,

790
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,770
um, you know, starts talking some shit.

791
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,050
And I go, no, I'm not, I'm
not going anywhere. You're
going to have to run the card.

792
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah. You know, she,

793
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:40,530
she starts being more like verbal.
Like she goes,

794
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,370
no visa, mastercard. I go, all right,
I'm leaving. I go, I had a hat.

795
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,840
I lost that table. I go to grab it.
And she goes, Huh. And she runs,

796
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,840
she runs from the table back to the
front. He goes, I called police,

797
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:55,170
I called the police. This is for the
whole rest. The whole restaurant is seat.

798
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,390
You went back just for your hat. But I
also, I was implying that I was Bailey.

799
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,160
Oh. So like she got really scared.
And then as she, she's running,

800
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:09,900
she goes to pick up the phone and I go,
well pay the bill. And she goes, okay.

801
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,740
So I take the money, kind of, you
know, throw it on the counter.

802
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,050
And I said, as I left, I go,

803
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:19,400
I want you to know that you're a
liar and you're a bad person. Yeah.

804
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,190
Have someone translate that. And then
I walked out, wow, that's made up yet.

805
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,930
But I did say, you're a liar and
a bad person. Um, so anyways,

806
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,920
I was really fucking pissed about her.

807
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,040
And it wasn't about not
accepting American Express.

808
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,150
It was about the fact that I think, I
think she's a horrific human being. You,

809
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,980
she lied. It was like the whole room. It
was righteous. It was, yeah, it was a lie.

810
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:48,570
But it was, it was that the
attempt to publicly shame someone,

811
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,170
I think,
I don't think there's any end to how,

812
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,620
how much you should be shamed after that
for trying to get your way through that

813
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:02,820
method. I got back to the hotel, um,

814
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:07,230
I put an Instagram post
up later just saying,

815
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,500
this place is terrible.
Um,

816
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,690
I didn't even explain really why I
just said they were fucked up place

817
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:19,440
and then dude, it was
like, it was amazing. The,

818
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,680
uh,
the listeners of our show,

819
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,780
he didn't,
you unleashed mommy power around.

820
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:32,670
The problem is you gotta be careful when
you unleash mommy powers because they

821
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:36,290
are strong. They, it was
artwork. It is. This is, this is,

822
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:40,110
this is some of the modern art
masterpiece. What has happened?

823
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:43,470
I think this is like a happening. What
they used to call him the 60s. This is,

824
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,870
this is fucking art.
I have to commend,

825
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:51,290
I went so our listeners to know that
some of you are fucking legit comedy

826
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:55,430
writers. It was so
funny. I really don't. I,

827
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,370
I can tell you that if you had
people that listen to this show,

828
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,230
that we're professional comedy writers,
they were not,

829
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:06,670
they couldn't do it funnier than what,
you're funny.

830
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,820
These are pure fucking art dude.
Here are some of them. This is,

831
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,670
this is moments after it says,
warning,

832
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,280
this is not a poly by
friendly establishment.

833
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,730
My Mommy also developed an
Asian accent after we ate here.

834
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,340
She can't stop speaking in broken English.
Can someone explain

835
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,210
this? Ah, I'd rather move to the
Midwest. Ooh. Then eat here again.

836
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,810
Mommy told me not to go,

837
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,670
but my boy Tom and Mr. White folks was
in town saying some hoes and also making

838
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:41,440
Kim in airtight and Joe, right. My jeans
were a little high but not too tight.

839
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:45,910
I had a rectum role. And how do you say
an Asshole Ching Chong, Ching Chong.

840
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,100
Next thing I know Mike Tyson comes in
with Bruce Bruce and everyone said,

841
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:55,780
Hey Hitler, next time I will go somewhere
else. Most likely on the hundreds blog.

842
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,950
They don't even have any bikes and they
don't even know who big daddy Kane is.

843
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,260
I mean like they tied
in all the references.

844
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,090
The best part of this is that people who
don't know your mom's house are going

845
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:11,140
to read this. Like the average Yelper is
going to be like, what the fuck happened?

846
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,120
And this restaurant,
um,

847
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,950
read that one actually a pretty
good place. Definitely try the me.

848
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:22,750
So it's Hella Salty. The garden salad was
good, but the dressing was kind of wet.

849
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:27,520
So get that on the side. The staff
was nice. My server's name was DICO.

850
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:32,350
I thought that was inappropriate as I
was with a group of children overall.

851
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:37,210
These particular agents make a pretty good
Sushi. One Star, one star. I don't know.

852
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,790
I don't know if that was any to do
with our show. No, I think it was just,

853
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,460
I think someone's legit so made me
laugh. My server's name was Dick. Oh,

854
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:48,440
this is this one here. I read onstage
and it almost brought the house. Read it.

855
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:52,060
It said, this place really
makes my jeans low. End Loose.

856
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,850
I was treated like a calm
dog and called big words.

857
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,300
The food tastes like the devil's
driveway and made me brown a six.

858
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,490
You know what I'm saying?
For reals doe.

859
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:04,000
I almost threw so much Skype punches
like my boy crazy looks and shit.

860
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:07,690
In conclusion, this place seriously
needs to hide and tight in their jeans.

861
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:12,040
Before my mommy's and I ever consider
making their Sushi into brown ever again.

862
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,920
He asked if I had to choose between
eating here again and being retarded,

863
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,690
I would be retarded.
Good work babies,

864
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,380
baby. See that was from Norcross.
Georgia was really fun. I love,

865
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:31,210
I like the idea. He's like, I would
never make your food into Brownie yet.

866
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,450
That is actually what you do when
you go to a restaurant. You're like,

867
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:37,870
I choose your place to make my brown Brown
Brown. That's so interesting. I never,

868
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:39,790
that's so deep, bro. I never
thought of it that way.

869
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,550
Shout out to everyone out there and
doing their thing and stuff like that.

870
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:47,160
I came here to get my Sushi on. I was very
disappointed. I wore my cleanest done.

871
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:49,060
I'm gonna pull them up
over my retarded tests.

872
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:53,470
The customer service was the worst.
The fish smelled funny,

873
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:56,170
but the way she just said what?
It's only smells. It's okay.

874
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,760
It was very confusing because it clearly
was not only smells and was not okay,

875
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,540
and I made it to my squatty
potty. My, how you say rectum,

876
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,700
a straight seven.
I had to go shit to showers for reals.

877
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:12,190
Doe Next Stop Brown talk.
Know what I'm saying?

878
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,270
I would have to be a lot more
targeted than I already am.

879
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:22,520
So funny. That was like, how
many your mom's house references

880
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,990
can you squeeze in so good in 12 hours?
Yes.

881
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:32,950
Had like 81 one star
reviews fully written.

882
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:38,270
Hilarious. That was not even
meant. So look, I think they got,

883
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,860
they fully got what they deserved.

884
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:45,500
They've already managed to get a
bunch of the reviews removed. Oh yeah,

885
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,160
yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, you know,

886
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,370
I'm glad it caused them to think about
the way they treat their customers.

887
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,330
We don't have to, I'm not asking
you guys to bombard the more,

888
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:59,750
that's why I've attempted
to not mention them again,

889
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,010
but just know that, um, because people
were asking me like, well, what happened?

890
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:04,940
I told you what happened.

891
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:10,070
I felt extremely justified in
asking people to do that to them.

892
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:14,210
Um, and it's just, it's all in fun. I
mean, look, if they're being removed,

893
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:17,000
it's not going to harm
them. And as it's, you know,

894
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,830
it's a silly way of
getting back at a business.

895
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:22,420
That was shit that was shitty to me.
So, uh, but yeah, just the people go,

896
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,310
I wouldn't just do that. I
wouldn't for fun, say, Hey,

897
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:30,290
go fuck up these people's reviews just
for pure amusement or because like, oh,

898
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:34,390
I didn't think the Sushi was good,
but when I feel like, um, you know,

899
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,350
somebody mistreats me or miss [inaudible]
anyone then I don't think it's a,

900
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,760
it's really, you know, going
forward to ask for that. No,

901
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,770
but it's a funny way of getting back.
By the way, this Mug, do you remember,

902
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,600
I don't remember who gave
this to those crew. Yeah.

903
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,440
I don't know if he can see it
on the camera, but it's, it's,

904
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:54,470
it says empty jar guarantee
Australia and he made that. I know.

905
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:55,480
And then it says didn't,

906
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,380
doesn't smell done burn integrase
and it's got chuck Woolery.

907
01:00:58,381 --> 01:01:00,580
We just emailed each other yesterday.
Yeah.

908
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:04,530
This is like my favorite cup and
the house. It's great. Yeah. Yeah.

909
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,430
They made a couple of those, a couple
of go's crew one those funny did. Uh,

910
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,110
Chris and Pete. Yeah. Shout
out to both of you guys

911
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,090
doing your thing and stuff like that. I
know. For real though, y'all are busy.

912
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,190
Yeah. So there's, um, this
I've been wanting to show you,

913
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,670
we have so much to share so much today.

914
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:30,090
I've collected materials you've
collected. Aw, he's back. So this,

915
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,980
we haven't played them in a
while. Um, but he's in the news.

916
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:38,150
Did you know he's in the news
now. I'll get to that. Just
to give you an idea. Yes.

917
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,080
This is Brian Silva,
um,

918
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,480
otherwise known as a vine star
who rolls in swag and he makes,

919
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:53,940
he made a lot of videos talking
about how dope he is and you know,

920
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,170
it'll take your girl and yeah.
Doing this thing, stuff like that.

921
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,890
He was doing his thing. He's really
into his body and his physique and is,

922
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,790
it looks great. It's always like,
by the way, you know, as a fat guy,

923
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,800
nothing irritates me more
than somebody who's super,

924
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:13,670
super thin and it goes like, I'm
super muscular. No, you're not.

925
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,170
You're just really skinny. I like his
body. You do. I, I'd like to have it. Oh,

926
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,900
he's got like a lady's body.
It's a nice figure. Yeah. Yeah.

927
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,980
It's not even a regular body.

928
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:27,180
It's like a 60 [inaudible] guy who I look
at it and I think what a nice figure.

929
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,010
That's, yeah, like a lady.
That's what I'm saying.

930
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:33,420
I wouldn't mind having a teenage boys
physique. That's nice for a lady.

931
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,560
Here's what,
um,

932
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:40,200
here's to give you it to familiarize
you with his brand work. Uh,

933
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,200
here's a little backstory on it. It was
a little bit of what he used to put up.

934
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:43,870
Okay.

935
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,030
Yeah. Seems hollow tips will
be on your dinner plate.

936
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:52,230
I keep a full clip on my hip.
That will knock you off. The map

937
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,180
on the SAB is Nigga,
I'll leave your head old

938
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:02,760
was good bitch sweat. It was mad. Yeah.

939
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,670
You Mad.
Cause I'm a god Nigga.

940
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:11,180
You know, he drops big words
and does, sure it does. That's
a way with it. Well, uh,

941
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:14,380
he might, that might change
pretty soon. Ah, okay.

942
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:18,670
There's a little bit of of,
um,

943
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:23,671
news like as I was mentioning that
will make you reconsider your language.

944
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,870
Here is, uh, some news
that aired about Mr. Silva

945
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,581
over the weekend.

946
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:34,240
Silva is the man who
surrender to Charlottesville
police following a multiple

947
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:35,980
hour standoff on Sunday.

948
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:40,120
The 25 year old would not talk about
what led up to the dispute norm.

949
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,400
Why he barricaded himself in the house.

950
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,330
Brian Silva except excepted Nbcu 29 for
request for an interview at the jail.

951
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,040
We should,

952
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,880
so he's being,

953
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:52,881
they shouldn't clip of him being so I
guess he held somebody in the home at

954
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:56,860
gunpoint and here he's being as chord
with his pants around his knees.

955
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:01,110
I'm surprised he's 25 more than anything.
I thought this kid was like 17. Wow.

956
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,970
Yeah.
For not knowing what to expect.

957
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,060
And all silver would say is free
me over and over again today.

958
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:14,040
Silver stuck to a single message. How
do you think you should be free? Okay.

959
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,070
I told him a big mix up
and they confusion. Truman,

960
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,720
that's all I have to say. Thank you. No,

961
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:26,650
it would not address why he took the
social media and posted videos while

962
01:04:26,651 --> 01:04:28,720
barricaded inside that house.

963
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,280
Hmm. So, um, yeah,

964
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,440
as he was held up in this house,

965
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:40,090
he posted multiple videos. Um, you know,

966
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:44,970
like things that he's famous for.
Um, no I see there's the cops, um,

967
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,970
outside of the house. Um, stuff like
this, check it out, stuff like that,

968
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,833
you know what I'm saying?

969
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,180
Yeah.
You know,

970
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:57,310
did as 12 hate no Nigga
to are there for bill.

971
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:03,660
My big head,
big Zack Nigga fucking rocking.

972
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,630
She clocked up my fucking pocket.

973
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,490
Fuck them Niggas Nigga.
Yeah,

974
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:14,340
you've seen juts out and say bid
right there. And I knew right there.

975

big mix up. Mm hmm. I love the,

987
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:08,940
I love a guy who was talking the most
shit to himself. He's out of his mind.

988
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:11,300
Do you think he's on math?

989
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,020
Some sandals wrong?
I don't know.

990
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,410
I think you know math makes
you real paranoid and like,

991
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:23,040
remember the Henry or old driver is like
how to do math and just look through

992
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:26,580
the peephole. Here's a lot of
crack. Oh, that was cracked.

993
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,050
I goes, my theory, I
don't know. I think he's,

994
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,260
he's a little jacked up on something.
Yeah,

995

1004
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:23,580
He just freely uses the n bomb like that.
He thinks he's black.

1005
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,510
That's the craziest part. He's 25 years
old and he calls himself the n word.

1006
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,770
He gave himself permission.
That's for sure. Did he calls
White People Caucasians?

1007
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,370
Fraud. You wouldn't know about
that cause you Caucasian.

1008

You know he's a victim that you're
probably right that he probably goes,

1010
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:44,580
all these Caucasian mother
fuckers came through.

1011
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,660
He identifies as being
discriminated against.

1012
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,600
I don't know how but wow.

01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,360
He's one of the main hose on the show.

Seven days a week we're going to go sweat

this shitty in real life too. Yeah,

1097
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:20,520

Wait in real life. How do you know?

1098
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,370

it. No you don't. I've seen a TV show.

1099
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:30,390
They can't do it for TV every week
and look at it. Look at this mess.

1100
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:35,040
What the fuck? It was way crazier.
Now what is that? It's way crazier.

1101

Is that a cover up like he had some
swastika isn't, no, it's like, um,

much coffee. What? Like,

1103
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,740

if you're going to be a hoe here,

1104
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:50,990
I'm going to ask my cousin Julie. Julie
listens to the show. Julie. What the fuck?

1105
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,120
Like why,

1106
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:57,500
It doesn't look good. It can't
be, can't be the primary tattoo.

1107
01:13:57,501 --> 01:14:01,510
You know what I mean? Yeah.

1113
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:30,820
Yeah. And he's got his little nip nip
pierced and oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1114
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:35,020
It's, it's a lot men, the guys a
lot. I think when men are this fit,

1115
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:39,640
personally for me, it's very feminine.
It's very vain and a feminist.

1116
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:40,930
What I'm talking about.
No,

1117
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:45,790
I'm Sarah and I'm not just saying that
because you're not to be a people pleaser

1118
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:50,200
here, but I'm serious. Not attractive to
me. Well, it's not just being in shape.

1119
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:54,400
It's the way that you present how you were
in shape. It's vain. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1120
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:56,870
It's wanting to be fit.
But like this, this

1121
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,540
is ridiculous. You're ridiculous
man. Oh my life. Yeah. Oh my,

1122
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:08,140
he's added a lot. Yeah. That
earlier shots. Sure. Um, anyways,

1123
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:10,590
this is not what we're, we're
not focusing just on nick. Yeah.

1124
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:13,240
I mean like tattoos in and
of themselves are not lame.

1125
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:17,610
This Guy Kinda want to talk
about his new song. My fuck. Um,

1126
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:22,950
this actually came out fucking last week.
Oh,

1127
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:26,560
so we, yeah, we've played, yeah, I know.

1128
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:30,280
We've played breaking this guy. Dammit.
We're breaking, breaking a sweat.

1129
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:33,520
The name of this song,
if you listen a few episodes back,

1130
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:36,680
I don't remember the episode
number. We could look it up. We, uh,

1131
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:40,930
we talk about his rap battle with then
we played on the show that they were on

1132
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,110
was Gigolos. So anyways, this came in,

1133
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:49,240
it's a song that he's put out. It's
called breaking a sweat. I, I'm sweating.

1134
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:52,510
I will do, I'm so embarrassed for
him already. Well you shouldn't be.

1135
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:55,960
I think we should have legitimately give
him a shot and let the listeners decide

1136
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,250
whether or not this is a good song.
And I was like, radio stations do that.

1137
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:03,730
They're like, is it hot or not? Like call
us, let us know. You can't really call us,

1138
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,440
but you can certainly let us know.
Oh,

1139
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:08,800
you can certainly comment on
youtube on the video itself and let,

1140
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,100
let a brother know if he's on the right.

1141
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:19,390
All right, so here it is.
It's court. Okay. Ah, Shit.

1142
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,990
Breaking a sweat. Hold on, hold on. I got
to get ready. Are you ready? Here we go.

1143
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,943
Okay.

1144
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:38,743
That's correct.

1145
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,160
Cold bed.
The Ketchup.

1146
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,430
My take off like a jet is a
sense that you watch too much TV.

1147
01:16:52,431 --> 01:16:54,500
You don't know who get met.
I'll never forget,

1148
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,670
I said it doesn't make sense.

1149
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,733
Milk

1150
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:16,370
your boy

1151
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,440
so far. It's really good. Holy Shit.

1152
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:33,080
[inaudible] I can't be bro.

1153
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,530
Daddy sweating those balls. Oh Man. Well,

1154
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,910
we're all wondering is where's the comm?
So wait,

1155
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:42,691
where's the video?

1156
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:46,140
I thought we were going to
see some visuals and I'm
upset that I hope he makes a

1157
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:50,490
video for breaking a sweat, but it does
look like he has a bunch of other songs.

1158
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,160
Cool. I'm ready. I'm ready.
Are you, are you going to,

1159
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,490
do you want to get into all
of them? All right. This song,

1160
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,550
what's the verdict on breaking a
sweat? It's terrible. It's really bad.

1161
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,480
It's terrible. You're really, this
is, this isn't your best work.

1162
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:08,040
This is a really bad song. But in
mixed defense, you buy an album.

1163
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,550
A lot of times you go, sure you know it's
an accomplished musician and you say,

1164
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,880
sure, yeah, this isn't their best song.
Maybe this not, maybe not this number.

1165
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:19,560
Maybe another number. What about born
to be bad? Sure. It's got eight views.

1166
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,320
It's breaking a sweat is 20
and this is pretty bad, Huh?

1167
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,960
It's like kind of an original premise.

1168
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:30,060
Let's see if one to be bad is um,
his good.

1169
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:33,660
Okay. I'm so embarrassed
already. What part?

1170
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,233
Okay.

1171
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:48,690
10 seconds in. It's better than breaking
a sweat. I'll tell you that. Yeah.

1172
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:53,550
This is better than breaking a sweat.
I like the artwork. Yes. It's um,

1173
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:57,670
it's 15 different loads from him.
Yeah. Yes, man. He's very emo.

1174
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:05,440
Must be restored. Shit. My mind, why
are you can't blame me for reading.

1175
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:10,050
Blocking my fire. I paid a lot
more. I walked a tight. Wow.

1176
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,013
Wow.

1177
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:30,590
I keep hearing these voices scream in
Poland and I listened. Dangerous Wall.

1178
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:35,260
They had four paces, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And I'm sick of waiting.

1179
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:40,400
All right. Yeah. Is it me or is,
is it off the timing? Like he,

1180
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:44,460
he raps not in time where there's
a lot that's off. Yeah. Yeah.

1181
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:49,190
Okay. Is there a, is there
an actual video or no,

1182
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:53,960
these are all just the songs.
A gigolo four views.

1183
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:58,160
Four months ago I was put on group.
He pitches step up.

1184
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,350
What do you want to hear? I'm
out of this world. We fight. Um,

1185
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,830
it's up to you. Oh look, leave. Leave
with me. No. Tipping in and has 103 views.

1186
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:11,090
It might be the song of the album.
Is that the breakout hit?

1187
01:20:11,091 --> 01:20:15,270
It could be if it's got 103 views
and this is the last one. Okay.

1188
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:18,810
It hurts my soul. I think we should. Yeah,
we should give it a break after this.

1189
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,130
So this is our last shot.

1190
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:23,280
We're going to go with the
highest viewed song on the album,

1191
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,970
a tipping in sip and let's
see what happens. Here we go.

1192
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:32,100
[inaudible]

1193
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:50,030
anything
past the past I didn't give

1194
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,900
some tracks.

1195
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:56,290
It's not good.
It's better than the other two songs.

1196
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:01,090
Then for those 26 seconds it was, you
know, it's really hard to do. What's that?

1197
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:06,520
To have a video up performance on
youtube and only have two views.

1198
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,960
That's actually really hard.

1199
01:21:07,961 --> 01:21:11,700
Does not have a lot of videos that have
such a low view count and they're able

1200
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:12,910
to have two views

1201
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,140
and it's been up for four months.

1202
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,910
Even someone stumbled on it
accidentally and I was like,

1203
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,200
it looks like it's his page

1204
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,943
here.

1205
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,050
He doesn't have,
he doesn't have a good cadence.

1206
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,610
It doesn't have to be a voice for rapping.

1207
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:46,070
He isn't good at actually writing lyrics
and this is a bad path for him to take

1208
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,900
that good. Yeah. Can I talk like man,
I'm going to throw it out here. Yeah,

1209
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:56,510
he's failing is you see how there's like
12 personalities of nick hoc and that?

1210
01:21:56,570 --> 01:22:00,910
Yes. That's the problem. The guy doesn't
know who he is and what he stands for us.

1211
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:04,310
If you watch the show too, he'll show up
at the bar. Like this guy in the middle.

1212
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:08,750
You don't know who this guy is the next
day he feels like this. Yeah, I know he's,

1213
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:11,240
he doesn't know who he is.
Confused. It's all right.

1214
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:15,920
He needs to pick an identity people
awhile sometimes. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1215
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,130
Yeah.
Um,

1216
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,573
the thing is

1217
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,840
[inaudible]

1218
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:30,600
who do you think you are? I am
something to think about, right?

1219
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:34,140
Yeah. Something to think
about, to think about.

1220
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:40,130
So I have this to show you.
The life is pretty cool,

1221
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:44,290
confused young man, man. That's,
it's all about something's wrong.

1222
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:48,760
Everything here, it's all bad. Ain't
start taking that off. I feel better now.

1223
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,100
It makes me feel weird.
I feel uncomfortable.

1224
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:57,370
I feel his pain or something.
I don't know. Yeah. I feel
like something's wrong. So,

1225
01:22:57,470 --> 01:23:02,230
um, oh, okay. Old School. This
little episode you were on. Yes.

1226
01:23:02,231 --> 01:23:06,080
I was on this episode of [inaudible] two
wraps, man. Miss you. I'm to be wrapped.

1227
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:10,330
I really loved that show.
That show, man. It was,

1228
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:13,480
it was seriously what I look
forward to so much during the week.

1229
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,650
What's the,
what day was this on?

1230
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,740
This was on, what is it?
Original air dates? It was,
was it a weekend show? Friday.

1231
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:24,100
Saturday? I can't remember now. I used
and I used to never miss it. That's funny.

1232
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,390
I used to watch 120 minutes every
Sunday night on MTV at midnight. Yeah.

1233
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,830
It was a good one to stay up for.

1234
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:35,000
And they play all the alternative
videos with the third no videos anymore.

1235
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:39,110
And MTV, right? It's gone. Oh
yeah, it's done. It's a shit show.

1236
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:43,930
Shows 88 to 95. Damn. I feel like it
was on longer than that. It's fun. Yeah.

1237
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,660
Yo,
MTV remedy raps.

1238
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:53,120
Um, it used to add lover was
on there, right? Oh yeah.

1239
01:23:53,121 --> 01:23:55,880
I remember seeing flavor flavor on this
show for the first time and being like,

1240
01:23:55,881 --> 01:24:00,050
what the fuck Dr Dre and Ed Lover. But
it was a different doctor dre. Right.

1241
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,190
The big guy right there. You see, right.
Right to dry and there's Dj dad mouth.

1242
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:08,510
Yeah. Um, and the J Paulie bye.

1243
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:13,440
Yeah. I mean, I remember
watching, I remember watching a,

1244
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,210
like certain episodes stand out to me.

1245
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:19,500
I remember when Wu Tang was on
yo MTV raps and they did the,

1246
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,000
the mystery of chess boxing.
Um, it's like the, one of the,

1247
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:29,040
it looks like the enter the 36
chambers cover like those masks on.

1248
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:32,550
And I was hearing that sound, it was
a sound I'd never heard before. Like,

1249
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,350
what the fuck is this?

1250
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:39,810
That was like the introduction to Wu Tang
was from Yo MTV raps. Oh, okay. To me,

1251
01:24:39,811 --> 01:24:44,400
you know, and probably to most people
why kids are watching 120 minutes. Yeah,

1252
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:46,470
I know. I know. It was
pretty awesome though.

1253
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,500
I remember it was seeing Redman
and are a lot of you anyways.

1254
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,760
Here's Eric B and rock him.

1255
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:55,680
Eric B and Rakim. I like these
two. No, Rakim, Rakim, Rakim,

1256
01:24:55,740 --> 01:25:00,210
raw McKean. Let's see, Eric Bay

1257
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:04,050
rack card. I love, I've got to would be
a rock of the video. One of my favorites.

1258
01:25:04,051 --> 01:25:08,990
I like,
I like that dude.

1259
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:13,260
I listen to my lyrics. You know what
I'm saying? To keep me on my thing.

1260
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:17,490
You know what I'm saying?
That of that nature.

1261
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:20,500
I'll listen to like a Bob James Best

1262
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,660
part of this interview.

1263
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:26,950
So it's Eric B and Rakim probably the
first time they're on yo MTV raps and

1264
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:31,810
they're asking him like, so what do
you, what do you like to listen to?

1265
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,550
And his first,

1266
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,600
I think it's his first answer
is I listened to my shit. Yeah.

1267
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,390
So what's your inspiration?
Me? Yeah, he's smart guys.

1268
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,720
I'll let you know my lyrics.

1269
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:52,300
I listened to her like that. Good. I'd
take her best days when the light bulb.

1270
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:57,050
Tom, what's your favorite comedy? Me.
I listen to my own shit, my jokes.

1271
01:25:57,330 --> 01:26:00,380
So I remind myself of what I'm all about.
That's what you just said.

1272
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,930
What was that guy in the back?
What's that motherfucker doing?

1273
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:08,010
It's like just chilling man.
That is just chilling. He lied.

1274
01:26:08,011 --> 01:26:08,844
He was supposed to be there.

1275
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,070
Dave Brown still my
main thing still it had,

1276
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:14,730
I lived in a little bit of
everything north name because

1277
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,970
the type of music I relate
to them on the plane.

1278
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,430
Wow.
You know what I'm saying?

1279
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,340
That was the filming I'm talking
about and just to be sure,

1280
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
just to make sure we know we have a dozen.

1281
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:36,230
This, this reminds me, this
makes me, um, I don't know.

1282
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,970
This seems so authentic.
It is.

1283
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:42,971
This is a time where like MTV actually
broke music and musicians where music

1284
01:26:44,351 --> 01:26:47,000
should, like these guys were
really fucking musicians. Yeah.

1285
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:48,830
Not this horse shit of today.

1286
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:53,240
These guys are real fast trying to make
it as music. Yeah. Like this was genuine.

1287
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:57,440
I mean these are low shit.
Nick Hawks a yesteryear, right?

1288
01:26:57,441 --> 01:27:00,800
This is before the time of the Internet
and in competition shows where people

1289
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:04,250
thought they could just make a, hey, I,
I'm a musician. Look at me on youtube.

1290
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:07,550
Like these motherfuckers really
did it fucking chain on Eric beat.

1291
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:11,950
It's awesome that you guys got them
with the Mercedes. Yeah, of course.

1292
01:27:11,951 --> 01:27:14,150
That was so cool.
But back then that was like,

1293
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:17,870
what do you think has chain
ways on Eric is so heavy. Yeah.

1294
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:21,200
That's like a 25 pounds away.
His neck down. Yeah, for sure.

1295
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:24,320
I want to get one of those. Yeah.
And you should spend a lot on it. No,

1296
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:27,290
I'll I get a fake one. It's just
all about the look, you know. Okay.

1297
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:32,000
I'll you started going to meetings that
I want you to spend money rope chain 25

1298
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:33,410
grand or something.
Yeah.

1299
01:27:33,411 --> 01:27:36,440
But really personalize it so
that the resale value is low.

1300
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,073
Alright,
here we go.

1301
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,000
Don't say anything.
What I'm saying,

1302
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:48,440
here's why that's good. Short
interview. Lots of trail. Yeah,

1303
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,330
the ratio is good on there. Yeah.
Nah mean no to hell. We don't,

1304
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:58,130
you ain't see anything yet.
And it's a mainstream show,
which is even better. Yeah.

1305
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,290
Yeah. You know what I'm saying? No,

1306
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:05,060
to give him a run for his money cause
we were like, that's pretty cool.

1307
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:10,010
You got the God Mc right there.
That's, you know, rock him. Um,

1308
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,350
is there anything we
can put them up against?

1309
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:17,210
And then we have this from del,
the Funky homosapien.

1310
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,310
Oh, I'm, I know that you
gentlemen as well. Yeah.

1311
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,150
So let's see how he
does on this right here.

1312
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:27,670
Everybody, a rash should be unified. We
all wrapping. You know what I'm saying?

1313
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:32,200
So what I'm saying is why don't
we just build a bad ass man?

1314
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:36,310
Like we ain't got to be told me there.
You might not like somebody,

1315
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,320
you know what I'm saying?
But that don't mean you say,

1316
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:40,540
hey know or nothing like that.
You know what I'm saying?

1317
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:46,660
That's not what I'm talking about.
To pop as one,

1318
01:28:46,661 --> 01:28:51,430
you know what I'm saying? She
be unified. So check this out.

1319
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:57,130
It's a wrap.

1320
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,130
Since we married about six

1321
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:09,900
years old,
he's a kid

1322
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:17,610
but not living, you know,

1323
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,080
you know what I'm saying?

1324
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:25,930
This, I think even if Nick Hawk, we're
just start doing interviews this way,

1325
01:29:25,931 --> 01:29:27,750
he'd be a better rapper then.
He knows that too.

1326
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:32,090
Yeah. But do you see how back then it was
like you fucking started a craft. Yeah.

1327
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:35,770
Uh, being a musician at the age
of like 14, and not only that,

1328
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,130
people actually talk like people,
it wasn't all about like,

1329
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:43,330
I got this motherfucking homes, I've
got money bitches. Yeah. I'm so fucking,

1330
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,480
I'm awesome. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.
Like this guy is actually saying

1331
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,860
Ramazan is one of the best things.

1332
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,630
It's one of the foundations of being
a great MC, right. Is I'm awesome.

1333
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,860
And there's actually a lack of,

1334
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:59,760
I'm awesome now because what you would
say you're awesome about it. Yes.

1335
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:04,050
You need to say you're awesome about
your skillset right now. It's like,

1336
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:08,510
I'm awesome. I own shit. Or like
material in it, you know? Yeah.

1337
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,620
I have a lot of jewelry,

1338
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:16,110
but back then it was like, you don't
want to fuck with my style. Right.

1339
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:21,150
And how my flow is just, you
know. Right. It's unmatchable, um,

1340
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:24,210
the nic hoc of, of you
know, of the rap world.

1341
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:29,130
And so that's what you would say, you
can't fuck with me on. And it was awesome.

1342
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:34,110
Not My stuff. Look at all the shit that
I have. Yeah. Now it's like, exactly.

1343
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:38,610
He's like, I got six houses, 20 cars.
That shit's boring. Yeah, I agree on that.

1344
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:42,390
But you definitely want to say that.
You cannot fuck with me on a mic.

1345
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:44,490
That's what it's all
about. Right? Right. Yeah.

1346
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,170
This guy is actually talking
about other stuff. Yeah.

1347
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:52,260
It's just refreshing to see a rapper or
talk about stuff other than bitches and

1348
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:56,240
money and all we had to do was go back
to 25 years to get somebody to say some

1349
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,970
people were people on television to even
watching those guys on new MTV raps.

1350
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,590
Ed Lover. Yeah. He just acted like a
person, dude. Yeah. It wasn't like,

1351
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,190
hey,
like totally fucking phony Malone.

1352
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:10,380
Yeah. They used to have
the, the real kind of a,

1353
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:15,210
it's a wacky now it's like a wacky
persona. Like they have to act.

1354
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,270
They can't be like, Hey, what's up?
Welcome back. Right. He was like,

1355
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:19,620
he really was himself there

1356
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,040
and it's so much more relaxing
and engaging to watch. Yeah.

1357
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,820
Like I actually wanted to see what
they're, what they're talking about.

1358
01:31:25,821 --> 01:31:27,030
Cause they were normal.
Yeah.

1359
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:31,320
Maybe that's why people like podcasts
now cause we're not fucking being phony

1360
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:34,260
retards. Yeah, yeah. Cheeses. I know.

1361
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:38,210
That's why I saw lobular how la La la,

1362
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,520
he really killed it on that.
You know what I'm saying?

1363
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:46,320
It's a much longer interview. So
again, you gotta go, you know where,

1364
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:48,300
where do you stand on that?
You know, where are you?

1365
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,680
You know what I'm saying? The old
man, you know what I'm saying?

1366
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,650
I'm saying, you know what I'm

1369
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,520
You know what I'm saying? You know what
I'm saying? You know what I'm saying,

1370
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:16,570
by the way. Well, you know what I'm
saying? You know what I'm saying?

1371
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:19,470
By the way, big props to, uh,

1372
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,860
the guy that did the interview
in a loud environment.

1373
01:32:22,861 --> 01:32:27,861
So you hear just boom and music playing
in the background the whole time.

1374
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:34,320
Now is this guy from ban the Pharcyde
del, the Funky homosapien. What is he in?

1375

1383
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:04,860

hill to fetch a pail of water.

You got to stay positive

New Year and how is the new year all over

As I was sitting here pondering that,

1411
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:58,100
I picked up a pen and a
piece of paper and these

1412
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,980
are the words that came
to me at that time. Okay.
