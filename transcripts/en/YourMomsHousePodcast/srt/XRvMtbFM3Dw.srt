1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,950
Christina.
Vincent,

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,670
thank you for gracing us with
your presence today. My pleasure.

4
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:25,160
Thank you for having me. It's
been a while. It has been.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,460
You're the second guest we've had
in three years. Whoa. That's crazy.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,890
Stop doing guest a long time ago.

7
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,010
But then now we have this setup where
like we should bring gas back. Yeah.

8
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,090
Why not? Why not? Fuck it. Yeah. It's
fun. You, we told you we had the uh,

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,410
the water, someone ea
here last week. Yeah. Uh,

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,320
some people thought it was a joke and they
wrote in like, Hey, uh, I turned it off.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,650
I thought that bit was going
kind of on that a bit. Well,

12
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:51,890
cause we play boring cliffs on the show
sometimes. Yeah. And people are like,

13
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:55,370
that was the longest boring clip.
Yeah. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah.

14
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,010
When there's too many laughs, we'll be
like, let's boil it down a little bit.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,060
He'll play something boring and
they're like, it's a long board.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,590
Got a peaks and valleys. Yeah. Lower
the expectations. Slam at home. Yeah.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,740
So we had a bunch of people,
but some people were,

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,610
I would say most people were fascinated.
I was fucking fascinating.

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,740
I had no idea until I walked in here that
that was a real thing. Yeah. And He um,

20
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,380
he, he works at Patina, which
is a restaurant downtown.

21
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:22,240
I don't know if you've been there, but
he created a water menu there. Yeah.

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,340
So when people go, come on and you're
like, yeah, can I have, you know,

23
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,010
you ordered and he's like to drink
and you go, I'll just have water.

24
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,100
He'll be like, I'll be right back. And
then it's a water menu, so you get to, he,

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,010
he basically does what we were
telling you. But you know,

26
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,450
like a beautiful presentation and people
start, if I went out to a restaurant,

27
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:40,790
they had a water menu. I,
it depends on how high am,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,340
if I was really high and be
like, what's going on? Yeah.

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,560
But if I was so bad I was like,
fuck you. I'm a little bit worse.

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,190
But if you're really high you might
be like bringing on of everything.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,960
Let me try all this. You try your
water, man. Yeah. Um, all right.

32
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:57,860
We have an opening clip before we just
think before we get into our irregular as,

33
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:01,490
this is how we open our shows. So we'll
play our clip and then we'll get into it.

34
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:02,324
Here we go.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,250
Around June the 21st when a Skype,
when trance was skyping with me,

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,200
uh, Brent spiner said, hey, you,

37
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:14,340
who Taran so something's going on
with Nancy McCaughan Hayes Penis.

38
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,640
And what was happening was all of my
men's penises were being attacked.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,633
Nope.

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,600
Well,
go to your mom's house,

41
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,903
Christina

42
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,373
courses.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,873
Oh,
I know.

44
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,270
What's this, Bro? What do you mean?

45
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,450
I can be, this is, what is she talking
about? Rational. What's the deal?

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,420
There's one forest Whitaker I going on.
Yeah.

47
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,010
And there's also, there's something
about crazy that does something to your,

48
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,570
you know,
the way you see eyes.

49
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:37,760
And you could tell like if you're
talking to her in person, you'd be like,

50
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,820
even if he didn't say crazy peanut shit,
you'd be like, something's up with her.

51
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,080
Oh, yeah. Well, it's the, the, the gays
that doesn't break. That's right. Yeah.

52
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:49,280
The unknown. Blanking. Yeah. Yeah. It's a
real indicator and sanded. It does a lot.

53
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:49,700
Yeah.

54
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,170
There was a very serious, now where in
the computer system at Church of Gail,

55
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:58,220
it caused all the mandatory to gale to
cause them to have all sorts of penis

56
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:00,010
afflictions.
It's very painful.

57
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,580
Church of Gail, I think that's her own
church. Church of gale. Oh yeah. I think.

58
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:09,270
Why does she think it has to
do with Matthew mcconaughey?
I Dunno, but she goes on

59
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,810
or deal with the penises lasted for
a least a good week in that juice.

60
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:18,230
Like from June 21st of June 28th they
were just having this ordeal with penises

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,100
because of Jesuit trigger programming
on the Church of Gail computers.

62
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:26,390
They spent a lot of time in
sick bay. Uh, actively had them.

63
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,080
Now I know at that point,

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,740
well like mad vagina. Matthew,
his penis went inward.

65
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,450
I think it's funny that she,

66
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,910
she thinks that the Jesuits
are targeting are usually,

67
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,680
you don't hear them mention the you.
It's a very affable, they're fun. Yeah.

68
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,900
That was really highly educated
college. Yeah. They like to drink.

69
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,970
They like to party.
They're not really into this stuff.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,250
You know what's interesting about her,
if you didn't know any better,

71
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,670
like if you spoke a different
language and you listened to her talk,

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,230
he'd be like, well, she seems
to totally rational. Yeah.
She's sitting there calmly,

73
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,320
she's not, she's moving too much. You
maybe she's an expert and like, right.

74
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,300
Ancient civilization. How a lot of cons
happen. I must, I'm assuming, you know,

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,790
like I was watching that
Bernie Madoff movie,

76
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,370
the new one is really good with the
Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer find what's

77
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,920
called wizard of lies.

78
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,780
And they were just talking about how
like his greatest skill was just people

79
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:20,800
manipulating and he had this
crazy thing where he was,

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,620
that's the craziest part of
was he was already successful.

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,180
He was a really well off,
was a multimillionaire and he's still,

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,900
you know,
uh,

83
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,990
design this Ponzi scheme to extract so
much more out of people. And they said,

84
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,600
you know,
because his reputation was such,

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,230
and he was just knew how to talk to
people. They're just handing over money,

86
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:44,320
man in it to fuck people over.
Like for the stuff,

87
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,690
the fun reel of screwing
people over all of it. Yes.

88
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,810
It's a real super addicted to the cash.

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,230
There's a great interview with him on
radio lab and it's really interesting

90
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,240
because they have to
interview him from jail.

91
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,980
And so when you call someone in jail,
you can only talk

92
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,090
to them for 15 minutes and then you have
to wait off the phone for 15 minutes

93
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,610
for them to come back on.
And then 15 minutes again.

94
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,600
So they're interviewing this guy and these
15 minute chunks and it just cuts off

95
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,450
at 15 minutes and they
asked to wait and it,

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,830
but he's describing this waiting and
then as time went on he talks to made off

97
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,890
more and more. It gets more and
more comfortable. But the, the,

98
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,940
the crazy thing about him is the
complete total lack of empathy.

99
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,720
None is no empathy towards the people
you fucked over people that killed

100
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,990
themselves. Like there was a bunch
of people that just, one guy,

101
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,040
which was really fascinating.

102
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,990
He was worth $9 billion and Bernie was
telling him that he had to give seven of

103
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:39,680
it back. He called the guy up, he goes,
look, the CEG is up. Everybody knows.

104
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,140
And apparently he,
he thinks,

105
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,770
or at least his rationale
was that all these people,

106
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:50,600
like the big high roller guys, they
knew that they were ripping people off.

107
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,440
They knew that there was no way
you could always make money,

108
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,450
that there was always
going to be fluctuation.

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,970
But like even in like
the way they describe it,

110
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,070
I don't really necessarily
understand finances that much,

111
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:06,071
but the way they were describing it is
that in like every single move they made,

112
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,120
this one guy wanted to make money
every single, like there was never,

113
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,630
you kid couldn't ever show any losses
at all or this guy would freak out.

114
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:18,350
And he had like, again,
$7 billion in the mix.

115
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,600
That's insane. Yeah. Yeah. He, um,

116
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,470
he said in an interview that when they
were like asking them about, you know,

117
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,080
you destroy it all these people
lives. He was like, yeah,

118
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:31,610
what about their culpability in all of
this? Like, what? And he's like, well,

119
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,790
you know, I mean, they, they, they have
some responsibility and they're like,

120
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:39,500
you stole from them. He's like, yeah, but
they fucking gave me the money, you know?

121
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,500
Yeah. His thing was like, these people,
these people are, they're not starving.

122
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,970
That's what his thing. We're not talking
about people in Africa, you know,

123
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,370
we're not talking about starving.
Villagers were just talking about people.

124
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,630
His own son killed himself.
One of son killed himself.

125
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,810
This guy killed himself that we
talking about the $9 billion guy.

126
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,020
He killed himself because he won.
They wanted them to give back seven.

127
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,400
She's like, I can't
live with to fuck that.

128
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,570
That's so funny. People's
relationship with money. There was a,

129
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,910
I forget it was actually, you might not
have killed himself. Might have drowned.

130
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh really? Yeah, it might not. It
might just took too many drugs,

131
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,880
but there was a New York Knick,
I forget his name,

132
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,710
and they were interviewing him about, you
know, these NBA contracts are bananas.

133
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,820
It's fully guaranteed. It's one of the
leagues that has fully guaranteed money.

134
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,880
So not like the NFL where it's
like you have this much guaranteed.

135
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:33,440
The rest of that, you're not
getting that shit. So NBA, whatever.

136
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,840
Then you know there's salary caps and
he played out one of his contracts and

137
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:37,021
they're like,

138
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:40,440
we want to keep you but we can't give
you like top end money so you're going to

139
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:44,490
get 9 million for next year. And then
his first interview with the press,

140
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:49,290
he was like, I mean, you know it's going
to be tough, but I'll see what I know.

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,460
I'll try to make it happen.
And they're like,

142
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,940
you're going to be tough to survive
on that. And he was like pretty much,

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,040
I mean I have a family

144
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,520
man perspective, man.
People get crazy. Yeah,

145
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,383
well yeah,
because

146
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,730
going out, I mean, you know,

147
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,910
I follow all these kids on
Instagram like Cameron Dallas.

148
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:11,960
Do you know who that is? No, he's
like the sh the millennial hot shit.

149
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:14,930
He's like this hot 18 year old
boy and he and his friends,

150
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:18,080
they just enter this business, you're
going to die. They don't have talent.

151
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:19,970
They're just like cute boys on Instagram.

152
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,890
And they do these meet and greets where
they meet like gaggles just auditoriums

153
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:28,880
theaters full of like tween pre adolescent
girls and their parents and they

154
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:33,210
hugged them and take like chased
pictures and millionaires Maley,

155
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,980
he's on a dolce and Gabbana I
know skillset. None. No talent.

156
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,220
They follow them on Instagram
and cute teen boys. Yeah. Yes.

157
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,520
Hade to meet the people. It's,
it's fascinating. So there's a,

158
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,640
there's a Netflix show called
uh, is it chasing camera? Yeah.

159
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,980
And I'm obsessed with it now.
The thing is that they,

160
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,190
they're spending their money like crazy
cause I follow them on Instagram and

161
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:58,700
every week it's like, here's my new
Ferrari, here's the new Lamborghini,

162
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,430
I'm leasing, here's the new house
I'm renting. And you're like,

163
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:02,600
you're not even buying.
Yeah,

164
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,930
I'll buy that house, dude. Get some
equity on it. Yeah, they're just 18.

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,730
Yes.
But they're also like,

166
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:13,731
I think they don't realize that that
window of cute girls that were being cute

167
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,040
and the girls being like, ah,
it's you is very limited. Yeah.

168
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,190
Everybody says that about Kim
Kardashian. Yeah, I guess so. Right.

169
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,440
But they say they keep growing new ones.
You know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah,

170
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,420
like in a different strokes and they
added like the red haired kid to make the

171
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,254
show appealing.
Again,

172
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,300
talking about the chase
or the Kardashians. The
Kardashians. So they keep the,

173
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,640
so now Kylie's being groomed to,
that's what keeps it going.

174
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,820
It's because I think it's all about
Kim. Really? Yeah, it's Kim and she is.

175
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,240
Even though there's about her,

176
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,910
there's a real mother mother like
Chris Kim is like the matriarch of the,

177
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,560
did you guys cover her fake ass
kick ass photos from Mexico? No,

178
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,900
I think I saw some of them.
Oh well here's the deal.

179
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,230
They always hire their own Paparazzi and
the Paparazzi pretends to just casually

180
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:58,670
catch them taking pictures.

181
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,970
But in Mexico there was real Paparazzi
waiting along with their fake Paparazzi.

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,821
So they're fake.

183
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:08,300
Paparazzi takes the photos and then they
edit them and they smooth out all the

184
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,420
cellulite and all this whole shit
doesn't have it. I mean, yeah,

185
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,950
I mean it's normal human part of zoom,

186
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,060
especially if you're a big fat ass
like that. It's made of fat, but it's,

187
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,240
it's a fake fat ass and it's
super obvious in the new pictures.

188
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:23,630
Look at the Greenlee. Yeah.
Get your life. Got Real one.

189
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Like look at the ones on the left.
Like where in life would you app?

190
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,400
That's a tumor, right? Right,
right. That's a full diaper. Yeah.

191
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,830
Diaper and internal is,
yeah.

192
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,780
I mean your legs are so scrawny and
then she has this giant enormous,

193
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:43,781
but so what they would do with Photoshop
is stretch out the thigh to meet the

194
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:48,250
ass. So it's, it doesn't look so
fucking so was this like a yeah,

195
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,150
that one doctored.
We doctored ones and make it look less.

196
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Right. The real one. It just
looks like chess. Hilarious.
It's like, uh, it's just, uh,

197
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,840
like that. What the fuck is that? What
is that? What do you do in your assets?

198
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:06,160
So rose,
it's so crazy,

199
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,840
but it's so nuts that someone
wants to do that to their body.

200
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,020
Like she's stuffing something in there.
I don't know what it is,

201
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:18,550
but there's no way in nature you would
have those skinny ass legs like that,

202
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,060
that are total unathletic legs.
The legs of someone who doesn't work out.

203
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,940
Yeah, exactly right. There's no muscle
at all and nothing. I mean, I mean,

204
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,370
she maybe works out a little
bit like we go to scrawny arms,

205
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,580
but she's not an athletic person.
You haven't asked like that.

206
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,060
You should be able to jump
over the moon. Right, right.

207
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,500
That's someone who can do hurdles,
but she's kind of good weight,

208
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,850
but she looks good everywhere else. These
are all Photoshop. Let me, it's hard.

209
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,500
I mean, it's hard to say. Everything is
fake. I mean, when you say she looks good,

210
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,490
it's like, yeah, she's not fat.
Right. But yeah, but that's it.

211
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,500
Everything else is just, all surgeries
definitely is a fake as fuck.

212
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,540
Yeah. I mean that's her whole
thing. She's known for her ass.

213
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,880
Like Jennifer Lopez
has a legit Latina ass.

214
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,820
Like that's her real ass. Her legs
match that ass. Take a picture of,

215
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,230
you'll go get me a Jennifer Lopez, his
ass. She's got those big fic mommy thighs.

216
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,900
Yeah, I can dig ass. That's all
there. That's real. You know,

217
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:20,110
you look at that and go,
Ooh baby. Yeah, that's real.

218
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,150
That's a real big juicy ass girl.
Yeah.

219
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:29,990
See how her thighs are so thick. They
eat the ass. That's all proportion. Yeah,

220
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,050
100% that's what it's supposed to
look like. She's a dancer. Classy.

221
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm on, but yeah, you're right.
That's dancing all fucking day.

222
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,390
All our lives a week. Yeah.
That's an athlete's ass.
That's a girl who can, yeah,

223
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,130
you do. That's a girl who can bounce
around and move and you know, I mean,

224
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,740
can you imagine if you had to watch
Kim Kardashian dance on the stage,

225
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,040
you know those little spindly
legs carrying that diaper around?

226
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,350
It does look like full baby died.

227
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,140
Totally looks like.
See that's what an ass,

228
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:06,370
a big juicy real as it's supposed
to look like. It's not preposterous.

229
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:09,910
It's just outstanding.
Didn't know she had a butt implant.

230
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,650
She's got something to go on more
than one I would say that's it.

231
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,040
There's a photo there that has
the the two of them side by side.

232
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,460
They just curse her it
over it right there.

233
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,690
That's Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashians.
The one with the white right here,

234
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,670
here, here, here.

235
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,930
See the one on the left is Jennifer Lopez.
That's a real ass.

236
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,400
One of the right is Kim Kardashian,
is it? Yeah, when my ass obsessed and

237
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,090
spent some time doing other shoes down
the wormhole and it was a very bizarre

238
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:43,924
thing.
It is.

239
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,130
The attraction to shapes is very
bizarre to like like fake tits.

240
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:52,010
Like we know they're fake.
That always astounds me like it's not

241
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,350
that they look like bigger breasts,
they look like big.

242
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,080
Fakers did different things.
Some guys, some goats. Yeah.

243
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,970
I mean some guys meaning
it's a ton of guys,

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,330
but some guys make that distinction
like definitely not into that.

245
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,250
I mean you've said this before is that
you'd prefer hungry tits over big fakers,

246
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,940
hungry,
hungry little ones need to be fed.

247
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,560
I would rather give spoonfuls of
pasta to those hungry tits then. Yeah,

248
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,180
I don't like big fakers man. There's
something weird about them for sure.

249
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,980
It's not a trick. I will say a really
good job of fakes like you can.

250
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,420
There are some magicians out there that
create amazing, like they still look.

251
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,870
You still go like, oh yeah, those look
good, but I still prefer real ones.

252
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,950
I don't know.
I just liked it more.

253
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,750
There's also body dysmorphia thing
because when do you, where does that look?

254
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:46,040
Once you have a baby to your
tits, get mushy. That's it.
That's just, it's nature.

255
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,770
So what should I do? Should I get hoist
him up? Should I have them reduce?

256
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,970
Talk about it.
First of all,

257
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,860
he does shit to yourself with no one would
have kids and our population is going

258
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:54,694
to die off.

259
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,090
It's true quiet Jesus,
but it's fine to let you know.

260
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:05,440
You got to surrender. It's also
part of life, man. Yeah, for sure.

261
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,070
The trade off for making life,
it's now,

262
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,000
are these real or are these Lakers

263
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,880
nutrition and thighs into fitness?

264
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,620
I'm a clean and healthy for date.

265
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,970
There's surprisingly a lot of
nutritional benefits from me to seaman.

266
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,030
Some of it can get to read out to you now.
She eats a lot of calm,

267
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,190
teaspoon contains over 200 proteins,
several helpful bits,

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,240
mints,
calcium chloride,

269
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,373
citric acid.

270
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,190
See Sodium and think,

271
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,640
wow,
that's a not in the shot.

272
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,060
Kids on Youtube talking about it. You can
come. Yeah, we should all eat come. Well,

273
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,030
what I like about this,

274
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:59,680
because we've had other come eating clips
on the show is the science that this

275
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,610
woman is put towards it, that she's a
fitness expert, which is kind of neat.

276
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:06,940
We don't often have experts.
What does that mean though?

277
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,000
Fitness expert. And you can just
say you are being a little bit yeah.

278
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,881
And a life coach.

279
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:16,150
Anybody can say that there's
on certification sports
bra and then you're like,

280
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:21,130
I'm a fucking fitness thing is a weird
one. Anyone can sign up for that shit.

281
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,610
I was watching a Anthony
Robbins Instagram stories.

282
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,070
Tony Robbins is in, he's in Australia
and he gets out to that, uh,

283
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,960
was, was um, black Ip song.
Tonight's going to be a good
night and he's out there,

284
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:38,140
you're assuming is clapping with
his big fucking Frankenstein hands

285
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,920
and he's like, stop it around on
stage. But it's all like, it's,

286
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,830
it's like he's,
his energy is kind of forest and he's got,

287
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,090
he's a little too wide around the waist,
which means eating a little too good.

288
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,410
Living it up a little too much. It's
all just, we're all excited. Okay,

289
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,270
we're going to prosper
here, Huh? I mean crazy.

290
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,190
And it says one of the photos I saved
the photo because I was laughing so hard.

291
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,540
Uh,
I saved it

292
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,280
for me cause it said savage is a picture
of him and he's dancing around clapping

293
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,670
and it just says savage. I'm like,
settle the fuck down buddy here.

294
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,000
Where is it? He uh, by the
way, that life coach thing, but

295
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,720
savage, that's what his Instagram
story. Why is that savage? I,

296
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,300
it's it with his hands in his pocket,
but this is all his dad bod.

297
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,280
I like Tony Robbins a lot,
but the fake energy thing, I,

298
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,560
if I went to his seminar and he made me
fucking stand up and do jumping jacks

299
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,840
every five minutes, I blow my brains
out that stuff. He's like, yeah,

300
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,973
he's a fucking,

301
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,630
it's a giant,
giant is him or whatever.

302
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,160
He actually has a pituitary,
even the jaw,

303
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,590
you know the facial features.

304
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,630
He has like a very mild form of it and I
think so of the giant hog probably part

305
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,220
of what his confidence, his or her. Sure.

306
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,880
Every time and every time he's probably
meeting with his team and there's enough

307
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:16,560
push back on something. He goes,
let me show you some stuff.

308
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,960
That role in carpet and was like,
look at that thing.

309
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,090
Slaps that thank Donald Interns. Like
he's got a point and hold up pizza dough.

310
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,670
Yeah.
It looks like one of those.

311
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,640
So Cinnabons you buy at the grocery store.

312
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,080
Those are good. Good, good.
Look how thin you are, pastor.

313
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,010
I've been working at
Berwyn right back

314
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,740
by the way. Um, so that,
that whole experience

315
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,180
shaking come full.
She demands,

316
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,480
I know it's a friend,
it's a friend. He's like,

317
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:02,260
I'm not in a relationship with friend
did this for me. Nice guy. Well listen,

318
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,090
I would say honey,
I'll come in the,

319
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,290
but honestly the best way is to
just suck it out that we get it all.

320
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,260
I mean just for your sake
guys wash.

321
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,380
Yeah. I know this is important. I'm not
into watching people eat comment. No,

322
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,520
it's weird because outside of porn it's
disgusting. I think in porn, by the way,

323
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,570
when it's like eight dudes in the
glass is fucking gnarly favorite.

324
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:26,790
I have those boot like this,

325
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,580
have them all bookmarked.
It's not enough guys guys.

326
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,740
Oh, the real savages in porn who are these
like Ah. And they like, they keep it in,

327
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,010
then it's like no big deal.

328
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,840
But you can also see in the faith or you
can read someone's when they're like,

329
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,560
why didn't you see that? Yeah. And they're
like, if, if, if the flincher yeah,

330
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,870
that's the fake enthusiasm.

331
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,130
Well, yeah, I mean normally, but you gotta
think the ones that are really into it,

332
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,940
like, no they're not. I mean, you've
gotta be so fucking damaged to be like,

333
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:03,630
I love eight of eight
guys. 10 guys, chase.

334
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,040
Oh Mommy can give you an idea.

335
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,680
She's getting close to the camera.
It, it smells quite mellow.

336
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,750
Smells like bleach kills the,
I

337
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,320
don't even more benefits to drinking
semen for women because it's a depressant

338
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:27,930
because it contains Melatonin.
Oh, I can just take,

339
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,090
get that for vitamins. All right.
Ooh, I just got the chills for real,

340
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:33,924
but oh Jesus.

341
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,480
Dripping and nasty salty.
Surprisingly so.

342
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:45,890
It's not surprising. Let's see the,
if everybody is a guy who, who's the,

343
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,830
about what they're writing. I produced
some of my aunts, semen videos. Watch.

344
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,700
Give me a call. If you ever need
some straight from the source to tap.

345
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,910
I hope you at least give the donor
a hand job. You Selfish Twat.

346
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,500
I have lots of,

347
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,420
see what I can unload on
those big breasts. Jesus.
Why not disable the comments?

348
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,520
She so rocking.
Would you date her knowing she's drunk?

349
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,350
She's drank so many cum shots.
Yeah, of course. Yeah. I'm curious,

350
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,600
are you still have a whole bit
about that? Yeah. Know about, uh,

351
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:27,010
I dated a girl once and she told me
that when guys drink a fruit juice,

352
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,160
especially pineapple juice. Oh yeah.
It makes you calm. Tastes better.

353
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,730
And I was like, how many dicks do you have
to suck for you figure that out. Yeah.

354
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,710
No. What's not wanting to
asparagus? Not Good. Okay,

355
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:43,160
let's try roast beef.
The idea that you,

356
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,460
you've figured that out
through trial and error,

357
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,130
like there's something really
delicious about your coming today.

358
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,930
What's different?
What did you have?

359
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,800
Let's go over my diet to do
an autopsy of it too. Oh,

360
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,740
I drank some water and pineapple at lunch.
I get some water from Hungary.

361
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,370
That helped. Did you? One
thing I don't think you,

362
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:04,371
you got to see throughout there was a
four month build up basically to the weigh

363
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,970
ins. The Barista who is
fat Wayne's where we were.

364
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,190
Bert Kreischer Knight came on you.

365
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,640
I did see a little bit of it on Instagram
and on Twitter with the Hashtag bird

366
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,790
is fat saw. Awesome. Did you see how,

367
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,600
I mean like we had,
I want to show you this.

368
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:24,601
This is like people would call in or
like send in videos saying Burdis fat in

369
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:28,600
different languages. Oh
my God, this is amazing.

370
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,730
Why is twice the so far
Harbert Rawer Cordova, Luxor,

371
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,390
good birth Chrysler is Bert Kreischer.

372
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:40,470
You are a fat cards you off that Nick,
they and Tom Secura might

373
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,770
and then this was my favorite
thing. This was amazing.

374
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,633
People

375
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,730
that listened to the podcasts that teach
English as a second language would use

376
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,650
the whole fat battle to teach English
abroad and in different countries.

377
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,440
The Pan

378
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,183
India

379
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,690
slur you,

380
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,840
you want to
go,

381
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,460
oh my God,

382
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,340
Oh my God,

383
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,580
is this freak you guys out when you see
how popular this is. I love it when, when,

384
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,453
I mean there was,

385
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,860
I remember the first time we figured
out that anyone was listening,

386
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,250
it was back when we were with red bands,

387
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:56,251
so this is like 2010 or 11 2011 and we
were doing shows and we put out a thing

388
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:57,650
like hey tweet this.

389
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,540
And the first time that we saw like the
next day that it was pages of people

390
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,830
tweeted that I was like,
oh there's actually people.

391
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:06,270
I thought there was like a hundred people
listening to this thing. Yeah. I mean,

392
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,910
I didn't have any idea of it,

393
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,210
but when they got to this thing and
they're coming in from different parts of

394
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,390
the world and then we did a thing of,
hey mommy,

395
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:18,130
thanks genes where we'll go through
where you just say that to like the,

396
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:21,220
the teller. And then we started getting
submissions from all over the world.

397
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,340
Follow police people in the squad car,

398
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,660
the squad car pulling people over.
It was, oh, we had a cop to it. Um,

399
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,240
he ordered his whole like on,
on the job,

400
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,890
you use all the inside language to order
it and he's in uniform and like it's

401
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:40,520
just bananas, man. Yeah. It's weird.
I'm like, you know what I like is the,

402
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,090
the silliness of it.
Like the fact that all over the world,

403
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:47,210
something that's stupid. It's
a shared joke. Yeah. You know,

404
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,590
like that's what I like stupid.

405
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,590
It's fat. Yeah. Like

406
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,580
hundreds of these men, like hundreds of
them. Yeah. That's really nice. Yeah.

407
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,780
It's strange, right? This whole
podcast thing is very odd. Yeah.

408
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,840
Your podcast by the way.
Like I remember doing,

409
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,850
I'm on like I think episode three
or five of your podcast. Wow.

410
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,560
Like somebody sent me a thing.
Once they have,

411
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:19,100
they have like it documented all the
episode numbers and they're like,

412
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:22,610
you're on like the one of the first five
or seven and I remember it was on your

413
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:27,440
couch in your office at home. Yeah. And
you kept telling me to sit forward. Yeah.

414
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:31,280
The couches weird couch. Seems like it's
a good idea but it's a terrible idea.

415
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,770
But I wanted to ask you who gate,

416
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,800
like I remember you said that you liked
the opiate Anthony model of like just

417
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:40,190
talking. Yeah. But how did you, did anyone
else have one where you're like, oh,

418
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:44,190
people will listen to this? Like did you
like were you thinking of someone else's

419
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,950
podcast? Like how did you know
anybody would listen to one?

420
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,390
I think Adam Carolla had a podcast
he had at that time. I think he did,

421
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,120
but when he had it,
it was like a radio show.

422
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,140
He did his like a radio show still
does. Right? Yeah. Well that's,

423
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,370
that's actually is downfall now I
think. Really? Yeah. I think people get,

424
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,850
they don't want to hear commercials
that are 15 minutes. Right.

425
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,980
It's not necessary, you
know? And uh, I think, um,

426
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,690
I just like Dell opie and Anthony had
just people come in with no structure,

427
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,150
bunch of comics and just
hang out and start talking.

428
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,950
Did you ever imagine like that your
podcast would be like where it's at now?

429
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:23,610
It was crazy, man. It is really crazy.
There's no way I could have imagined it.

430
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,970
I wouldn't have believed it. It's
so nuts. No, it's just, yeah,

431
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:29,790
I just just thought it was fun to do.
I mean,

432
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:34,740
and like people mentioned it to me all
that like when I, when I'm in an airport,

433
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,680
they'll, you know, they'll mention they're
like, it just still happens though.

434
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,550
Even mentioned the weight load,

435
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:43,551
but like I saw the way last podcast last
week and got one episode got more than

436
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:48,390
6 million and the other one
was like close to 7 million.

437
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,480
That's nuts. Downloads. That
is not, that's then the,

438
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:55,620
and then there's youtube views on top
of it. Yeah. Millions on youtube. Yeah,

439
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,550
it was amazing. How did you know, I
mean, I think I remember we heard, oh,

440
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,050
Joe's doing a podcast. Well, what is that
like even hear about something? Well,

441
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,480
I started doing it on Justin
TV, which was like this, uh,

442
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,240
online webcasting thing
way back in the day.

443
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,540
And what we'd do is we'd do it live
from the green room and Joey Diaz would

444
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,160
always get mad,
shut that fucking thing off.

445
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,860
We'd have a laptop and we'd
be streaming from a laptop,

446
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,940
like from the little Webcam.

447
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:21,270
So we'd have a little what it was back
before laptops had webcams built in.

448
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,140
So we put a little webcam on top of it.
We talk and people would like,

449
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:28,950
and you were doing that before
all this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

450
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,800
That was a long time ago. And then, um,

451
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,930
that was probably like 2003 or
something. Whoa. That's really long ago.

452
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,520
Yeah. And then, um, when I got back from
Colorado, it was kind of bummed out. And,

453
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,460
um,
uh,

454
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,170
I had to move back to California because
my wife was pregnant and you know,

455
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,110
we couldn't live at altitude cause
we were like it in the mountain.

456
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,030
I went to that house,
I was so happy up there.

457
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,880
I remember that I went to there to that
house when you were checking it out.

458
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,490
Yeah, we were doing, we were
doing comedy works. That's right.

459
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,770
And we drove up there and um,

460
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,950
and it was like up this crazy
road and you know, like,

461
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:05,790
like a narrow mountain road. And at the
very top it was like, it was beautiful.

462
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,600
Well for me it was a perfect combination.
Uh,

463
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,040
like it was the perfect balance for like
these shows where all these people and

464
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:18,210
the UFC, all these people then up there
just nature and quiet. I was like, oh,

465
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,670
this is what I need.
I need to balance myself out.

466
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,290
Like just to have enough calm so that
all this craziness sort of makes more

467
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,490
sense. Yeah. Yeah. Now. Um, so the show,

468
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,890
the podcast, obviously it's gotten bigger
and bigger. We've been talking about,

469
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,530
cause we all know people that like you
were a well known guy when I met you for

470
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:38,220
sure,

471
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,220
but you've gotten considerably more
famous but you're not a crazy lunatic.

472
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,950
Yeah. How does that work? How does that
work? You think? I don't know what I mean.

473
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:52,210
Like we, we, we all know people
that like can't handle fame well.

474
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,500
Well I do a lot of really
difficult shit outside of comedy.

475
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,800
I think that's part of it. Do you
think so? Yeah. I think part of it is,

476
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,840
first of all,
I have zero obsession with fame.

477
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,790
Like if all my fame went away tomorrow,
yeah, I'd be totally fine with it. Um,

478
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,310
as long as I have health and as
long as I could pursue my interests,

479
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm 100% fine with it. Yeah. I'm
not really interested in fame.

480
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,230
I'm interested in doing
a good job. Yeah. Like,

481
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:17,200
I know that when people come to see me
that I have a massive responsibility and

482
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:21,730
I work hard on my stand up and I work
hard on my writing and if I have a bad set

483
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,910
it will fuck me up for months and it'll
make me like batten down the hatches and

484
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:30,540
grind harder. Like I don't take
it lightly at all. Right, right.

485
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,010
So that's part of it too.
But it's also,

486
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,510
I do a lot of different stuff.
Like I do yoga,

487
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,370
I do Jujitsu, I do archery,
I do a lot of working out.

488
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,250
I said I've been running recently,
I do difficult shit.

489
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,530
And in doing difficult
show you get humbled.

490
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,940
Like you're always getting
your ass kicked. Yeah,

491
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,130
I run them the mountains near my
house. Yeah. It's so fucking hard man.

492
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,480
Like every time I do like,

493
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,960
I know like that there's people
that can do it way better.

494
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,770
I know there's people that in way
better shape and I know that I,

495
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,420
every time I do it I get a little bit
better and so I just keep pushing on it.

496
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:09,350
Yeah. So I just concentrate.
Excuse me. I just concentrate on,

497
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,120
on doing difficult things. Do you
think though that, sorry, go ahead.

498
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,170
You say that that's probably way or
way healthy thing of doing so basically

499
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:21,980
you're saying that I'm not focused on
my ego and making me a bigger star,

500
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,740
more famous, more famous. That's
usually what people do, right?

501
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:28,010
Like I got to grow this thing.
You're focused is external,

502
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,500
which I think is better as a human being.

503
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,230
Yeah, I think it's definitely better as
a human being. I think the, I don't want,

504
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:37,790
I have zero focus on being more famous.
Zero, right. I pass on everything.

505
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,950
Like as far as like doing talk shows are
doing magazine articles or interviews,

506
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,810
I pass on everything to Shit I
don't do so do you think maybe the,

507
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,970
that these people who
don't handle it well,

508
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
it's that their whole focus
becomes just that they're like,

509
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,390
may we hear about them too much?
Like Amy Schumer is a perfect example.

510
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,080
You hear about her weight too much.
Like there was this big Google story.

511
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,590
I pulled up my Google, this is a story
about her breaking up with her boyfriend.

512
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,050
There was a story angle that
she broke up with her boyfriend.

513
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,000
Like why the fuck is that a store?
Right?

514
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,660
Cause everything's a story because
she's probably got a publicist.

515
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,700
The publicist wants to make sure you
get your name out there all the time.

516
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,050
Guess what? People get fucking sick of
hearing you. Oh yeah. So if people want,

517
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,910
and I'm sure if people are
sick of hearing me too,

518
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,590
but if you don't want to hear me, yeah,
it's easy. Yeah. It's easy to not hear me.

519
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:26,960
Like you got to go looking
for me to hear me. I shake.

520
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:31,910
The more you put yourself
out there, especially today
with, you know, it's, this is,

521
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,200
we're not talking about the
1990s like with social media,

522
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:39,860
it's so easy to get the word out for
all the different things you want to do,

523
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,800
that there's no need to
do all that other stuff.

524
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,940
And if you start doing all
that other stuff, I mean,
you can gain a few new fans,

525
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,660
but you also get annoying.
Yeah. You know, we all know,

526
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,110
we all know people that are just
overexposed. You know who taught me that?

527
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,770
Daniel Tosh. I was about to bring him
up. I was about to bring the best. Yeah,

528
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:00,410
and he, he has that thing. He
doesn't do talk shows. He's the best.

529
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,040
We talked about it at the Improv and he
made total sense with me and it really,

530
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,920
really like cranked home. You
know it. You're like, wow.
Yeah. He's like, yeah, I do.

531
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,130
I don't do anything. He goes, oh, sorry,
go ahead. No, just like he was just like,

532
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:16,460
I'm already famous enough, right?
Yeah. And he goes, he goes,

533
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:21,461
I'm doing an hour a week on a television
show where like they get to see me on

534
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:24,710
TV,
so I don't need to do more than that.

535
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,790
Like there's millions of viewers
watching this thing. The thinking bank,

536
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,310
those who like me are
already engaged with me.

537
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,060
Why am I annoying the rest of the
world if you're not into it? Well,

538
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:39,980
my podcast built up 100% from
someone telling other people. Right.

539
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,140
100% I didn't do anything to promote it.

540
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,950
I've never done anything I've
never done. That's banana. Yeah.

541
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,620
I had one big bump when rolling stone
did a story on me and that was one of the

542
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:50,150
most uncomfortable weeks.

543
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,300
That guy following me around and hanging
out when it's staring at me and writing

544
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:57,440
things down like oh yeah, it's like weird.
But that did give a a bump though. Yeah,

545
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,690
that was a bump for sure
that that gave me a bump.

546
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,840
But all the other bumps or just it just,
it was a gradual,

547
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:07,841
slow sort of escalation until
about maybe two years ago.

548
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,410
And then it just started really
ramping up like ridiculous. Like yeah,

549
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:15,650
many millions more per month,
every month, millions more.

550
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,720
And then just started getting scary.
We always referred to like when a,

551
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:22,670
I'll talk to other people about
it too about your model of, um,

552
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,360
cause I feel like it's definitely one
of your ideas just to hit them with

553
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:29,120
content. In other words, just
put stuff out there all the time.

554
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,850
Cause that's like every week. I mean, I'll
just be on Instagram and I'll see you.

555
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:33,750
You're like this,

556
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,130
you had a physicist on and you have a
comedian on and then you have a fucking

557
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,900
hunter on and you're just like,
well,

558
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,480
I'm just putting stuff out there and
then whatever you want consuming.

559
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,830
But it's also honestly,

560
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,950
it's selfish because these are all just
people that I want to talk to. Yeah.

561
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,000
So like if I at Lawrence Krauss in the
studio who's a theoretical physicist,

562
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,500
I have questions I want to ask him about
the, you know, the birth of the universe,

563
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,750
what he thinks the,
the boundaries of,

564
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,380
of infinity are and all these
different and fascinating people.

565
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:04,730
So I have these one on one conversations
with no interruptions for three hours

566
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:08,060
with someone who you would never get a
chance to do that in real life because if

567
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:10,880
you were at a dinner table with them,
they would get up to go to the bathroom.

568
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,780
They checked their phone,

569
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,720
other than people would chime in and
someone else would come over this as your

570
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:18,890
own conversation, just you and them alone
in a room just staring at each other.

571
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:22,550
And you get, you get an
education through that. I've got,

572
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:27,290
I've become a much better
conversationalist. I think
I understand people better.

573
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,610
I get, I understand motives better.
I understand interaction better.

574
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,560
I understand ego and understand all
kinds of weird stuff you pick up.

575
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,310
It's like chunking,
you know,

576
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:42,150
you just sort of recognize patterns
in people and you start applying them.

577
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:46,830
I just have a much better understanding
of myself and of people and a an end of

578
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,840
being a good conversationalist.
Yeah.

579
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,060
You've got your definitely
highly skilled at it now.

580
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,560
I mean not that you weren't before,

581
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:55,530
but I mean I think it's obvious like that
that's a skill you develop because you

582
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,200
work on it all the time. What's crazy?
Cause I never thought it was a skill.

583
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,270
I never,
before I started doing podcasts,

584
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,330
I would never thought being a
conversationalist is a skill. Yeah.

585
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,340
I would've thought, yeah, you
just talk to people. You know,

586
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,740
I notice it more like a, somebody that
does podcasts a lot. When I watched,

587
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:14,340
especially if I watch a television
interview, I can tell or I listen to them.

588
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,070
Like on the radio,
I can hear that,

589
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,030
oh this host is a give
or like a gracious host.

590
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:24,600
He's letting his subject, you
know, say what he has to say.

591
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,080
And then I can also feel like, oh,
the host is trying to dominate.

592
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,450
You pick up on it. You know,
like you're like, oh this,

593
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,810
he's making it about himself all the time.
That is an issue with people.

594
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Like sometimes someone will interrupt a
really good story and take a side track

595
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,760
where they talk about themselves.

596
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,330
Like they have an opportunity
to talk about themselves,

597
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,620
but you're in a middle of a story. Oh
Brian, you've done this. Yeah. Yeah.

598
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,300
And it just becomes a real problem.

599
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,030
A lack of awareness and a clumsiness
can really sabotage and throw a monkey

600
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,130
wrench into the gears of a conversation.
Yeah.

601
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,220
And it makes it real awkward cause the
other person is aware of it and they're

602
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,930
trying to be gracious and get through it.

603
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,960
And then you know it just
when someone else is talking,

604
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,010
when two people are having a conversation
and someone else is just kind of like

605
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,990
clunky like it, it affects the
way you're able to communicate.

606
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,170
So like as a host of a podcast and you
having a conversation with someone,

607
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:21,410
part of the skill of it is like trying
to figure out how to get that person the

608
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:25,230
most comfortable and the most relaxed.

609
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,380
And then the most like I
asked the questions with the
enough economy of words to

610
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:33,990
get them to express themselves
the cleanest. Right.

611
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:39,170
That's why I don't like participating in
or listening to podcasts with too many

612
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,200
mics on them. They get rough, they
get robbed, it's too much and,

613
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,034
and,
and,

614
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,290
and usually what happens is at least
for me as a listener of one of them,

615
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,290
I'll be like every interesting
point that I was looking forward.

616
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:55,620
Like I can hear coming gets
derailed and like taking them like,

617
00:37:55,621 --> 00:38:00,621
well watching CNN sometimes and
there's like six people on there.

618
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,590
I just want to hear one, one person,
dude, I don't want to hear all this.

619
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,800
It makes me nuts too much.
Does like nine.

620
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:10,320
Sometimes it's too much and they're all,

621
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,820
they're all just like trying to get their
sound bites in there. It's so obvious.

622
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,790
I was watching something on
Trump the other day and it was,

623
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,260
it was just fucking gross.

624
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:23,820
What do you think of what the whole
current state of things with Trump,

625
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,990
it's what happens when you get a guy
who does not understand what being

626
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:32,130
president is and is used to running
businesses and then all of a sudden you,

627
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:35,100
you let them run the presidency and
he's trying to run it like a business.

628
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,290
He's firing people that he
doesn't agree with. Like the,

629
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:42,550
I didn't know that the president could
just fire the FBI chief like that.

630
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,420
I didn't know it either. But like when he
fired Comey and it's like the guys are,

631
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,290
he's a real pain in my ass and this
investigation, like what I get.

632
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,990
So obviously obstruction of justice.

633
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,580
I think he has like obviously
really wide ranging, uh,

634
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,710
liberties when it comes to hiring
and firing as press. Amazing.

635
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,770
And we didn't know about that
until this happened. Yeah.

636
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,250
Because most people have the good sense
not to do things like that because it

637
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:08,260
looks bad. Right? Look suspicious.

638
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,720
People forget though that
Clinton did the same thing.

639
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,770
Clinton fired the head of the FBI as
well and he fired him in the middle of an

640
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,190
investigation.
I forget what the investigation was.

641
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,580
I forget what the circumstances were,
but it wasn't as egregious.

642
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,490
But it was pretty similar
because this feels like, I mean,

643
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:27,420
at least from the outside,
it does feel like, you know,

644
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,610
every day it feels like this is heating
up into some like major scandal.

645
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,560
Who knows?
Cause evidence wise,

646
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:36,730
I know it's always pointed out that we
don't have any, you know, smoking gun yet,

647
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:39,340
but it does feel like it's cooking up
into something, you know? I don't know.

648
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:42,090
I think everybody wants it to,
that has that sense too.

649
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,090
Here's the question of like what's
inappropriate and what's illegal?

650
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,460
And I think a lot of it's
been inappropriate, but how
much of it is illegal? True.

651
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,410
Like Sam Harris is a podcast
where he had these, uh,

652
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,400
political experts on talking about what
Trump did when he had those Russians

653
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,300
over the White House.

654
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,340
And he gave them top secret classified
information about Isis wanting to use

655
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:07,900
laptops to blow planes up. And he's
like, Hey, you know, when you do that,

656
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,770
you've compromised all these people
that were embedded in isis that we're

657
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:16,420
telling the government about
this plan that they have now.

658
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:19,660
They have to get these people out and
hope these people don't get assassinated.

659
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,680
Like you can't, like in thinking in him
thinking that he's sharing information,

660
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:25,030
like, you know, I'll let you know secret,

661
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,170
like what you're doing is you're
exposing sources and it's, and you know,

662
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:30,370
it's obvious too that like,

663
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:34,180
he's the type of guy that loves having
that sheriff secret moment. Like,

664
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,160
I'm sure he was like,
you got to tell you something.

665
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,770
Well that's the whole thing
with Comi. Like, you know,

666
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:42,520
like he wanted to hug him and he want to
say, luck, I hope you can let this go.

667
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,990
But he's like telling someone to let
go a criminal investigation crazy into

668
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:48,610
being compromised by Russia.

669
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,820
And apparently they were
warned that that Flynn guy was,

670
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,050
he was compromised by Russia before he
even got into off a, they were, they were,

671
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:59,440
he was worn by the Obama administration.
And then when,

672
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,360
when Yates came over the, uh, the
deputy attorney general and warned, uh,

673
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,740
uh, Trump's lawyer about it, they still
didn't act for another week or two.

674
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,980
She was a gangster.
Those fucking hearings she was,

675
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,300
she was so good because she,

676
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:18,810
they were trying to chip away at her and
she was like, look what school? Yeah,

677
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,720
school. And I'm on the constitution
school and I'm on law school in Amman,

678
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,500
ethics and about her responsibility
to the American people. It's like, no,

679
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:31,180
I'm not going to institute a travel ban
on Muslims. You out of your fucking mind.

680
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,550
I can't do that.
This is a country of immigrants.

681
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,850
You wanted me to institute a travel
ban. So upsetting to me. Yeah.

682
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,260
It's know he's like,
he's like a murderer and you know,

683
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:43,340
and they all get caught
cause they brag about shit.

684
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,690
Like he couldn't help himself
talking about Isis. Probably
like, I got some good,

685
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:49,780
I got to share it.
I gotta Brag about the shit.

686
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,480
I love all the child's about how they go.

687
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:58,481
It's really difficult because of his
short attention span and he has a tendency

688
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,990
to be easily distracted.
He likes the visual aids to you.

689
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,460
If you talk about something,
you have to show pictures to him.

690
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,180
He wakes up in wines now with cable
news and he brags that I don't read.

691
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,290
He's like, I don't like reading. You
know? Another thing is hilarious.

692
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,890
Let's talk about the shows that he
watches. They're there, number one,

693
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,550
because everyone knows I'm watching.
Oh, right. By him saying that,

694
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:29,600
everyone knows that he's watching
these Fox News shows. I'm fine. It's,

695
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,930
it's hilarious that he believes
that that's why they're number one.

696
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,260
But we've never had a president light.
Like imagine if Obama did that.

697
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:40,580
If Obama said, well, the reason why this
shows number one is because I watch it.

698
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,160
Everyone knows that I'm amazing.
Yeah. Everyone, everyone loves Obama.

699
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,320
Oh, he loves Obama, so I love him. Yeah.

700
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,540
I keeps talking about Kanye. Kanye
loves Trump. He loves Trump. Yeah,

701
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,813
everyone loves Trump.

702
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:00,290
But the fact that he talks about himself
like he's fucking Roy Jones Jr Jones in

703
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:03,470
his prime and Roy Johnson's don't mean
he was the baddest motherfucker on the

704
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:05,150
planet and he was talking
about it in his prime.

705
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,410
It was a way to establish that he was,
I mean, it's a psychological thing.

706
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,520
He was like,
when Roy Jones Jr gets out to everybody,

707
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,810
joined Julie going to take care of
business and everybody's like, okay, yeah,

708
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,490
like a separate power
almost. Right. He was like,

709
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:21,810
I'm talking about this other
aspect of myself. Yeah.

710
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,670
He was talking about like this,

711
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,340
this superhuman force
that was Roy Jones Jr

712
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,890
Joe rocks the House Thompson box,
the motherfucking house.

713
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,870
Many presidents in the past where this
psychotic, but because of Twitter maybe,

714
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,320
but maybe it's because of things like
Twitter that we now see inside. I mean,

715
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:44,150
what if Nixon was this bat shit crazy too,

716
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:48,410
but because of the limited acts
Spo Nixon tapes, that's great,

717
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:51,290
but they play the actual tapes.
It's really great.

718
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,690
What he had a drunken moment with a,

719
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:58,190
it's a famous drunken moment with a
reporter where he was talking about how he

720
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:00,480
has the power to,
um,

721
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,880
just go into a room and make the
decision to kill 6 million people with a

722
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:07,850
nuclear bomb. And that, you
know, that that hangs over him.

723
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,390
Apparently he was intoxicated when
he was talking about this, this,

724
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,100
this nuclear option power.

725
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,380
That's another very terrifying
thing about the president.

726
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,900
The president really does have legitimate
power to, to wife out, to wipe out,

727
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,850
to use nukes.
I mean,

728
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,910
he has a lot more power than we thought
they did because there was so much

729
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:29,420
restraint showed by Clinton,
even by Bush. Believe it or not,

730
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,450
like bushes even criticized the
Trump administration, which is crazy.

731
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,520
And Bush, I mean, Bush seems like a
fucking, like a, like a liberal daisy,

732
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,010
right? Compared to them. So
reasonable Einstein compared to, well,

733
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,860
the Supreme Court, when the
Supreme Court ruled against, uh,

734
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,700
one of Trump's things and Trump's
like, I'll see you in court, you know,

735
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:51,570
whereas a dude that was
court. Yeah, that was great.

736
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,170
That was the best court man.
But like Bush,

737
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,120
they showed this clip of Bush losing
a similar ruling to this cream supreme

738
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:03,750
court and his reaction to it was
so reasonable. Yeah. He was like,

739
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:06,840
well we have to respect the court and
the court's decision and this is just the

740
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,880
way it is.
Although I'm disappointed.

741
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:11,820
I understand that they're doing
their best in like a big part of it.

742
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,420
I do think you're right though is is
the lack of Twitter restraint because

743
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,240
nobody would ever act like that.
I know they had sort lay,

744
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,170
there was an article that said they had
an intervention last week and they're

745
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:24,990
like, you're making it harder for
yourself and there. And they were like,

746
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:26,850
and they showed him with visual aids,

747
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,790
like when you tweeted this and then
this was the pushback and these were the

748
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:33,330
articles written afterwards.
Like you got to fucking stop.

749
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,860
It's hilarious. It is. I mean, who knows?

750
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,980
It's good in that we need to know that
this is a stupid fucking position that no

751
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:44,340
one should really have.

752
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,670
No one should really have the ability
to just be the top chimp over 300 plus

753
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:53,940
million people. It's crazy that you give
anybody that power. There's no reason to,

754
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,890
unless you raise a philosopher king,

755
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,710
even a philosopher king
is subject to the immune.

756
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,170
If he has an ego and
if he's a human being,

757
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,680
he has the same possibility of
going out of their fucking minds.

758
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,920
Just it's just too much.
But why risk it?

759
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,680
It's just there should be way
more checks and balances in place.

760
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,070
Nutty to even want to be president.
Of course,

761
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,440
it's an absurd job. They're
all, they're all megalomaniacs.

762
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,770
Who knows. Could be
next. Maybe a Glen Moon.

763
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:28,240
Hi, Glenn Moon officially announced my
candidacy armed forces commander and chief

764
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:30,940
office President United States of America.
If elected,

765
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:35,410
I will serve holy will of God named Jesus
Christ and Power Holy Spirit from God

766
00:46:35,411 --> 00:46:39,880
and named Jesus Christ. Volt Moan
USA. President 2012 November.

767
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,950
Oh, he didn't make it,
Huh? I don't eat it,

768
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,850
but I don't know if he's
going to come back, man. Hey,

769
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,130
email person self described
18 year old former student,

770
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:52,390
Franklin or Churchill High School I met
earlier this year, 2011 library. Livonia.

771
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,230
If anyone knows Amy who my last,

772
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:57,550
I entering her friend's house on six
mile road service drive west of farm to

773
00:46:57,551 --> 00:47:00,370
road after I drove her there and
my motor vehicle from library.

774
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:02,440
I would appreciate you giving
her my Facebook address.

775
00:47:02,441 --> 00:47:06,310
You are l I could use some help
securing 18 to 20 year old vote.

776
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,110
Wow.
Yeah.

777
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,670
Well he was doing the sign of the
cross wise that helps presidents.

778
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,190
Here's some balloons out there.
What do you do with those?

779
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:16,360
Shoot them in the head or let them live.

780
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,980
I think you've got to
let them live until they,

781
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,680
until they show up at the address.

782
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,570
We have to keep them at containment
systems though. That's the problem.

783
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:28,990
Reagan let them loose and we need
to re get real them in a little.

784
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,040
It needs to be a park. Yeah. What did
Reagan do? He lowered the bar right?

785
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,850
The institutionalized,
uh, the mentally ill.

786
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:39,700
So we unleash them on the streets and it
crazy because he's the guy got shot by

787
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:44,050
a mentally a little breath
out now. Yeah, he's out now.

788
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,350
He has a, it's like some type
of supervisor but he's out.

789
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:48,640
But he was like supervise.

790
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:52,780
He has to go I think to his mother's
house or something and, but he's, yeah.

791
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,860
He's not in a prison. Yeah. So
weird. How old is he though?

792
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,450
He was probably in the 60s. He can
still kill. Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure.

793
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,380
Yeah. It's, it's, it's,

794
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,320
it's a bad job and it's not a,
it's not a smart job.

795
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,300
It was a job that made sense back when
we were dealing with kings and we said,

796
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:16,090
well, what's having an elected
representative instead of a King?

797
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,100
So it was a superior alternative.

798
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,950
And then we had all these
checks and balances like
representative government and

799
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:23,440
having senators and congressmen
and all these different people.

800
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,390
They were there to make decisions for
the individual states and the engine.

801
00:48:26,391 --> 00:48:30,580
A little individual states could have
their own laws and regulations and it was,

802
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,490
it was a fairly good system for the time.

803
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,130
But when you deal with
electronic media and, uh,

804
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:40,310
our ability to gather information
instantaneously, like,

805
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,430
and communicate information,

806
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,980
like there's no reason why we shouldn't
be able to vote online. No, no, none.

807
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,470
We should all be able to vote online.
Registration should be super easy.

808
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,900
The very least the, you know all
these, I didn't know, but all these,

809
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,310
all these European countries do weekend
voting for national elections and it ups

810
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:01,960
their turnouts by like 60% yeah,
that's a great idea as well.

811
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,090
There's a lot of different ways
they don't want that though. Right?

812
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,970
They literally don't want any more
participation because first of all,

813
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,910
one of the things that you're seeing
with Trump that's really disturbing is

814
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:16,120
you're seeing the rise
of the asshole class.

815
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,870
Like there are a lot of assholes out
there that will never represented and they

816
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,150
don't necessarily agree with his politics,

817
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,530
but they have like an identity thing now.
It's,

818
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,550
it's more like they're in a a group of
likeminded people than it is even that,

819
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:33,670
it's like a political party. It's
like a cult. It's a douchebag.

820
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:41,410
It's legit. Like there's a lot of people
that are enjoying this because the,

821
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:46,000
they're on a team and it's like whether
they're rooting for the fucking dolphins

822
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:49,330
or they're rooting for Trump,
it's, it's kind of the same thing.

823
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,190
They identify with a clan.

824
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,810
This clan of people are a Trump
supporters, right wingers,

825
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,600
whatever they're doing,
but it's it.

826
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,870
They just happened to beat
Trump supporters and lingers.

827
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,050
They could be anything else.

828
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,940
It's just people love to be in a support
group of likeminded people that agree

829
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:08,830
to a certain thing.
I don't think that they also,

830
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:10,780
like I noticed during
the campaigns it was,

831
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,990
it seemed like it was a lot
more just fuck the other team,

832
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,771
like that kind of thing.

833
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:18,880
It wasn't like about like he makes
sense on these points. It was just like,

834
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:19,780
fuck you guys.

835
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:23,260
I'm going to just imagine if Hillary got
into office and was doing all the same

836
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:26,260
things that Trump has done as far as
like giving way classified information to

837
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:28,580
Russia,
compromising sources,

838
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,770
firing the head of the FBI because he
was investigating her. The lock her up,

839
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,260
lock her up,
lock her up.

840
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:39,170
All that was like a big chant during
the campaign member. Yeah. Yeah.

841
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,240
Well he's done shit way worse.
Why?

842
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,320
Worser and worser chick.

843
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:48,920
He's got worker from clip.
Oh No,

844
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,390
the Gypsies. Gypsies. Yeah.

845
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,330
Total white trash people and she's,
she's fighting with some other woman.

846
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:57,570
She was like, okay, shit. Just
got, why worser, you know?

847
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,020
No. What else is interesting? Um, the,

848
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,350
that I was listening to the Sam Harris'
podcast they were talking about,

849
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,470
I like the reviews are good.
Yeah, he's amazing. The real,

850
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:11,710
the real interesting issue is the ebb
and flow of support and that if the pro

851
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:18,230
Trump media unitedly turned on him,

852
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,370
because there was some speculation that
they were upset that Trump was doing

853
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,330
some things,

854
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:28,690
some intervention things in
foreign countries and mangle
it a meddling and other

855
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,890
affairs that they didn't want. They
wanted more of a separatist sort of like,

856
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,830
you know, it's going to take care of
itself and fuck all those other companies.

857
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,290
But when we started bombing Syria,

858
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,750
we dropped the Moab bomb and
all this different stuff.

859
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,090
There's a lot of people that
expressed some, like they,

860
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,760
some discontent. Like this is not
what we wanted it, we sign up. Right.

861
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,070
If it turns and they United as
a United front turn on Trump,

862
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:58,940
the very people that support them,
which by the way could absolutely happen.

863
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,020
Sure when you're,

864
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,460
when you're a guy who like
mobilizes those armies,

865
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,910
those armies of assholes,
they're stair subject to turn on you.

866
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,550
Especially if you're clearly
an asshole yourself. Sure.

867
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,990
If he does enough asshole ish things and
then one day they just decided to turn

868
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:15,500
on him.

869
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,290
They were talking about this like this
could be catastrophic for his campaign.

870
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,520
Look at it. Literally could the
very people that put him in office,

871
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,120
this same group, if they have
someone who represents them better,

872
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,550
well it's a Ron Paul or someone else,

873
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,460
someone who they can get
with philosophically,

874
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:35,660
but they don't think like
what for whatever reason
they just decided they don't

875
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,940
like him anymore.
Which can easily happen.

876
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:38,390
Totally.

877
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,270
Well it can happen to you because I
don't think Trump really believes all the

878
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:43,190
crap that he was saying
that he was behind.

879
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:46,610
Like do you really think he's antiabortion
like how many abortions has that

880
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:49,430
motherfucker probably paid for it himself.
You know what I mean?

881
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:52,910
Like he's not about all the stuff that,
do you really believe? I think he's,

882
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,600
I think, no, I know he's
a, he's a, he's a great,

883
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,560
you have to give them credit for being
the, the super talented self promoter,

884
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,800
super talented and organizing them,
filling things in the moment. Yeah.

885
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:06,800
I don't think he believes all that believe
and I know that he definitely lost at

886
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:11,060
least a segment of people
this past week with, uh,

887
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,580
having his first foreign
trip to Saudi Arabia.

888
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,330
Like there was a lot of people that were,
I mean I'm talking about like very,

889
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:21,110
very hardcore, you know, far right
people that were upset that like,

890
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,260
what are you doing going there and your
first foreign trip you should be having

891
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:26,160
them pay us back

892
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,630
for nine 11. You should, you know,

893
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:32,100
why are you basically mingling with
them negotiating an arms deal? I mean,

894
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:32,910
it's just,
there's,

895
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,480
there's going to be things that pop up
every week that people will, you know,

896
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,350
get upset about.

897
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,440
Have you seen the picture of Trump and
that Saudi Arabian guy and some other

898
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:45,060
dude holding on to that glowing
gas? So creative, what is
that going? What is that?

899
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,860
A global, yeah. And it's
like showing, it's funny too,

900
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:52,470
cause he was like the Anti
Globalist Campaign Guy, right?

901
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,490
It was like America first nationalism
and then now it's like this is a global,

902
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:57,990
but it's all about the whole world.

903
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:01,080
What is it with these people once
they get into office? Even Obama,

904
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,740
once he got into office, like became
kind of a different person I think.

905
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,040
Well especially like when you're
in that first term, you know,

906
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,210
I think everything just
shifts to like I got to make,

907
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,020
I got to get that second term. It's
all they care about. I mean that's it.

908
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:14,970
Or do you think that's a
big part of it because they,

909
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,100
they especially like the
one thing I will say,

910
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:20,250
I think I noticed with Trump is
I think at the end of the day,

911
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:25,200
I don't think he cares about
anything other than winning,

912
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,210
winning the campaign, winning
votes, winning for him.
He's a, I think he a highly,

913
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:34,470
highly, highly competitive guy. And to
him it's just like everything is about,

914
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:38,580
it's a victory. Whether it's
this executive order signed,
this is like a victory.

915
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,970
Uh, you know, the, the, the, when
the healthcare thing went down,

916
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:42,990
that was considered a loss.

917
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:47,430
I think that would probably suit
like destructive to his whole psyche.

918
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:51,210
And I think all he wants is to win again.

919
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,740
Have another shot at the presidency again.
Only because it means he won.

920
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,500
Not because he really cares
about being president.

921
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,390
I think he just wants to win
man. Yeah, it could be. Yeah.

922
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,350
I'm, I'm enjoying the campaign
at like the, the, sorry,

923
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,100
the coverage of Melania hating him.
Like there's there weighing stuff.

924
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:14,780
Like he tries to hold her hand and she
swats it away and shit like that. I enjoy.

925
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:17,320
Yeah, I think, you know, there's
a lot of stuff they read,

926
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,890
they reach obviously for anything,
right? Like if you're pressed,

927
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,370
that's the thing is like the
level of scrutiny on everything.

928
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:25,040
It's like they were holding hands and
then they let go and they're like,

929
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:27,430
she swatted that. They, you know,

930
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,500
they want to visit great animated gift
though where he looks over at her smiling

931
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,850
and then he turns away and she like,
yeah,

932
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,690
she's like incidents at the inauguration.
Yeah. That's amazing. It's weird.

933
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,740
It is weird. What do you think
that it reads so clearly too?

934
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:46,020
It's like you can say a lot of
these things are ah, your slip.

935
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:50,930
But that seems so much, cause
she's like, well that seems legit.

936
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:55,430
And also the fact that she doesn't live
there. Well fuck. What'd you want to,

937
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:58,060
she just, you know, that's not what
she signed up for it, you know.

938
00:55:58,061 --> 00:56:02,600
And she did she sign up for, she signed
up for some Bj's and some scrolling. Yeah.

939
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:04,370
You know what I'm saying?
Some Fendi bags

940
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,300
teaspoon a day. And then how much dick can
you suck. Right. Let me think about it.

941
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,610
It's a great gig cause he's probably
only a horny a couple days a week. Yeah,

942
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,640
it's 75 or something like that. You
can only probably get it up a few days.

943
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:23,520
Even with Viagara probably only wants
to pussy a few days a week. Yeah.

944
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:28,150
And then the rest of the days a week
she's driving Rolls Royces party New York.

945
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,700
Yeah. Trump. So she's right here. Right.

946
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,800
And so he's gonna turn
back, smile. Big Smile,

947
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,133
right?

948
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:45,840
Yeah. It's a big smiler. But
you forget, she's my tribe.

949
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,560
This is actually the coldness of
the eastern blocker as well. Yeah.

950
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,170
My stepmother had a little of that
at a little, yeah, a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

951
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:57,870
So do you think that it's also like
part of the reason why she accepted this

952
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:02,280
position life in the first place?
It's like there's like, uh,

953
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:07,120
like a pragmatism, like a cold pragmatism.
Like this is a good move. Yeah,

954
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,450
of course. Yeah. Well she was a hot
check, right? She's like, I'm not sure.

955
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,570
So that's what you gotta
do. It's a, you know,

956
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:17,630
you can't model forever pictures of her
and it lesbian sort of photo shoot type

957
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:21,080
thing.
I know there's some nude modeling modeling

958
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,090
prison, Nudie pics of our first lady.
That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy.

959
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,620
I be crazy. If they were like butthole
pics, if she would like to spread them.

960
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,930
Shot looked like a string
of spit. Yeah. Figures.

961
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,500
And we're back to your mom.
I got serious for a minute,

962
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,250
but we got back to the important stuff.
Clicks. Oh yeah. We're living in the,

963
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:48,330
one of the weirdest times ever in human
history is cause it's total uncharted

964
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,850
territory. Yeah. And was that

965
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:56,690
just glassing glassing dude that's
become in the hunting community. Yeah.

966
00:57:56,691 --> 00:58:01,380
That's become a giant punchline. It is
all over. Like I sent you that meat eater.

967
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,573
Yeah.

968
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,250
They said we're going to beat you guys
to the punchline sending pictures out in

969
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:09,630
this glass and yeah,
it's a beautiful photo there.

970
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:14,050
Look overlooking this incredible landscape
and everybody just say just glass and

971
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:19,051
you know like when you know we have all
these like little inside jokes that one

972
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:23,220
went like so crazy haywire.
It went haywire.

973
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,440
People brought binoculars
to my shows in New York.

974
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:31,090
Look at the map. This is why,
this is why I came up here,

975
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:36,230
but slipping along, that's a
beautiful, I'll call him at all,

976
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,010
stopping along here.
Just glass and just go there.

977
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:45,510
But all of a sudden have my head.
And it also fired up.

978
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,530
And this also opened up
a whole new world for us,

979
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,750
which was the excitement of a dad boner.

980
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,980
Like when a dad gets really
excited about something,

981
00:58:56,981 --> 00:59:01,060
that enthusiasm is not any other kind,
a different kind of enthusiastic. Yeah.

982
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:01,361
Well,

983
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:05,740
because it's usually for something that
nobody would get that excited about it

984
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,140
except for that. Well, you
know, he's a very famous,

985
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:13,030
both Fred Eichler people are emailing
us like, yeah, that's not good friend.

986
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:17,860
I did not tell you. I told
you to remember. He's, I
watched him on TV. Oh yeah,

987
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:20,320
you did say you watch his
show. Yeah. Yeah. And he's so,

988
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:21,920
he glasses whole like what's was

989
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,320
killed everything in the
world with a comp. I read it.
We read about him after it.

990
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:29,050
Yeah. He's killed the
animal kingdom. Yeah. Yes.

991
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,180
He's killed Noah's Ark with turbo w a
recurve bow is like a traditional old

992
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:37,310
Skool Bo. It's like legit.
This dude's just, Oh yeah.

993
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:40,760
He's one of the best bow hunters in
the world. Recognized. Hmm. Yeah.

994
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:44,180
So it does he know about this? I
don't know. I know we emailed them,

995
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,850
we reached out. I'm sure I reached
out this guy. He's probably upset.

996
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,840
People were all swearing. Yeah. Oh, he's
super nice. Oh, remember? Sure. Yeah,

997
00:59:52,841 --> 00:59:53,480
he had that one.

998
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,890
He had a video where he goes and he
spanks a little cub bear that there was a

999
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,820
little bear eating out of like a dumpster
by his house and he ran up and spanked

1000
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:05,390
it and was like, Ooh, ran back and
got all excited about it. Yeah.

1001
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,320
He's like way out in the
wilderness. I don't know. I
believe he lives in Colorado.

1002
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,620
I think that's it. Yeah, it's
glass. We have all these other,

1003
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:17,180
so we started to look for dads that
get excited about things, you know,

1004
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:21,080
like that. We consider him in that
category and like, so like there's,

1005
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,920
you know what foamers are
no foamers are people,

1006
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:29,090
they get really into trains and they like,

1007
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:33,770
we'll wait at train stations for trains
to drive by and they fucking get really

1008
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:34,604
excited.

1009
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:39,830
Foamers Damn New York
once again on the SNC.

1010
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:45,920
Yeah. So I'm trying, coming
here southbound on North Creek.

1011
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,440
They get really into it then.
Boy.

1012
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,800
Wow. That's cool. Well that sounds

1013
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,640
quite,
Gosh.

1014
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,790
Oh my God.
It sounds like an Alco,

1015
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,600
oh 1943 I asked too.

1016
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,823
Wow.

1017
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,090
Oh God.
Oh Man.

1018
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:32,560
Yeah. Okay. Cat Away. Wow.

1019
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,190
Guys.
Just won't wait for trains like ours.

1020
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,490
He's so excited about that train.
So excited.

1021
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:43,360
Don't you kind of envy this guy's ability
to get super stoked on something so

1022
01:01:43,361 --> 01:01:45,520
dumb. No. That guy needs
to find pussy. Yeah.

1023
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,580
You would just abandon all those numbers.
Keep rattling. It's our f four five, six,

1024
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:55,490
two nine. Here's the solar
equipment. That's why their dads

1025
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,900
look at this. Oh my God. It's
coming. The Moon's shadow is coming.

1026
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:07,390
It is coming. The watch in front of, yeah.
Oh my God. Here it comes. Look at this.

1027
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:11,200
I never seen him like this. No
flashes. Oh my God. Here we go.

1028
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,780
Look at it. Oh my God. Whoa. Look at that.

1029
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:21,110
Oh my God. Here we go. Oh my God. It's
coming right over a second. Sorry.

1030
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:25,920
I'm looking at this. Oh my God. We're
getting close. It's getting close. No,

1031
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:29,790
felt the dog. I got corona.
That is Diamond Bailey's beads.

1032
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,780
Very big diamond ring.
Look. ADAC totality.

1033
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,760
Oh my God. Look good. I mean,

1034
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:42,750
it's cool to see. That makes
sense. Look at the phone.

1035
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,700
Maybe that's it. Oh, look it down there.

1036
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,590
That's pretty rare. Look
at it. Look at that.

1037
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,490
Oh my God. But it does sound like
he's going to come with and, awesome.

1038
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,600
I wonder if you took
that flight specifically.

1039
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:05,160
Does that guy seems so into it
and was so much knowledge? Yeah,

1040
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,620
it doesn't seem like a casual trip.

1041
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:10,590
I think by far the craziest one
that we found because we've,

1042
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,460
we've been sent a lot of these
things is this fucking guy.

1043
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,730
I'm getting excited about something.
So God damn mundane.

1044
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:21,270
The Trans Canada highway. Yeah. Oh God.
I love this one. I finally found the last

1045
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:25,400
paved. Oh, okay, cool. Oh

1046
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,933
Wow.

1047
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,920
This guy doesn't Fuck
Trans Canada highway baby.

1048
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,600
We are standing in
beautiful sunny Beretta.

1049
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,860
It's Columbia.

1050
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:51,610
The kilometer marker 7,128 and this

1051
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:59,220
with a 90% no.

1052
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:04,240
Make that 95% chance that this is in fact
the very place where the Trans Canada

1053
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,030
paved. It's last woo.

1054
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,290
I mean this is about a highway
being completed, right? Wow.

1055
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:23,560
Canada has on asphalt belt and God Barco

1056
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:30,450
and there was a highway.
Ooh. Goes running on it

1057
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,210
and you're like, oh, those towels,

1058
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:43,460
he's running on the highway right
in time down the middle. Oh,

1059
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:49,320
oh, oh, oh,

1060
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:54,130
oh, oh, this is a downhill
sucks. Fortunately

1061
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,480
so strong.

1062
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:02,660
Yeah. I mean I like it. It makes
me happy every time. I mean,

1063
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:06,560
why does it make you happy? Because I
lacked that enthusiasm for the road.

1064
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:10,770
Like this guy has found a way to get
pumped on something so benign. See it. My,

1065
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,990
my brain decided about, I
get excited about a lot of
shit, but this with this guy,

1066
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:16,940
I see that and I go, okay, I want to,

1067
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,740
to that guy about normal life there has
got to come up in a normal conversation

1068
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:23,590
where he falls apart. Like
there's, it's a normal shit.

1069
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:26,990
We talked to this guy about and he's
got some weird disconnecting, well,

1070
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,720
I don't like to talk about bathrooms and
this is where he sublimating all that

1071
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:35,910
weirdness. Yeah. He's finding he's
bottleneck in some way. He is.

1072
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,000
And you're right about the lack of
sexual intercourse. There's no, wow,

1073
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:42,400
this guy's good or any of these dads.
But that's why their dads,

1074
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:45,660
because they show their dads that guy by
be a loner. Well, yeah, I think we're,

1075
01:05:45,661 --> 01:05:49,900
we're labeling dad. Yeah. You Call Him Him
Dad's cause they're older guys. Yes, yes.

1076
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:53,270
I'm assuming that they're, they've shut
it down or their wives have shut it down.

1077
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:58,120
The wife has a very short hair cut
and she's wearing Ku lots and sandals.

1078
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,860
You know what I mean? Like
they're just shut down. Yeah.

1079
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,440
Now Ladies and gentlemen,

1080
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,700
your Trans Canada highway

1081
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,290
as yours,
Canada,

1082
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,980
it would be something that if you heard

1083
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,603
back,

1084
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,150
this video is dedicated.
All the men,

1085
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:25,960
the women who made this great possible
at great highway possible thank you.

1086
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:30,570
And you all caps exclamation points.
It's just, whoa, those noises though.

1087
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,100
Or like

1088
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:41,630
crazy crazy. That's gang bang. So yes.

1089
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,680
I mean that's for a highway being,

1090
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,170
I almost feel like he's seen every stretch
of it. Right? Like that's the thing.

1091
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,300
Maybe this is the completion of 10
years of traveling is fucking highway in

1092
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:56,200
documenting the whole thing. We like
to think of the backstory. Yeah.

1093
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,710
Wasn't there for the construction.
Was He part of it somehow?

1094
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:03,820
I had a guy on my podcast, Chris Cage,
who's a walk the Appalachian trail.

1095
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,250
Do you know what the Appalachian
trail is? Yeah, it's a, yeah,

1096
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:08,170
it's all through the
Carolinas, right? Yeah.

1097
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:11,420
You start in Georgia and it goes all
the way to Maine and he walked in.

1098
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:16,330
It took six months of walking. Whoa.
Yeah, and this was like a dream.

1099
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,900
His dream. I don't know. He had it
in his head that he wanted to do it.

1100
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,140
How did he eat? Did he bring, how
does the food work? Bring Food?

1101
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:28,120
You buy food along the way.
Okay. Yeah. You bring some
food. Oh yes. My only concern.

1102
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,800
Now you say you get you saying
that I don't get excited.

1103
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:35,080
I have an email from a listener I thought
would be a nice time. Okay. Your Mommy.

1104
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:35,411
Tina,

1105
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:40,090
I completely understand your need for
Tom to have enthusiasm as my fiance is

1106
01:07:40,091 --> 01:07:44,440
just as chill an unexcitable as Tom.
There is nothing more agitating.

1107
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:47,800
Them being excited for something and
only getting a smile from my man.

1108
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,120
That just proves that you are the
personality champ personalities all about

1109
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:53,080
getting excited,

1110
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,890
having different moods and responding
accordingly to other people.

1111
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:01,240
Clearly Tom doesn't have what it takes
to be considered a champ. It's all you.

1112
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:05,290
Ps. I also get farted on and
treating less treated like a sister.

1113
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,450
We are definitely into weird territory.

1114
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,990
I feel like this only happens with
couples who are on the same playing field.

1115
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,870
Lots of love, Hannah. Thank
youThanks. Huge mistake.

1116
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,190
Do you have it now your email address?

1117
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,620
I just want to say that predicting
to get more from Hannah now. Yeah,

1118
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,300
10 is going to start crying for sure.
I caught him 40 on my sister.

1119
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:26,490
Things are getting weird.
I can't believe you.

1120
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:31,250
You think I don't get excited about
and I mean we discovered that Tom gets

1121
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:35,210
excited about football but I mean,
okay. It was seldom is there a big,

1122
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,430
I mean you've known him for years
too and gets excited when he goes to,

1123
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,270
goes to shows when he does a
great show. I do. I get excited.

1124
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:46,220
You Express your enthusiasm for good
shape. Fucking show. Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,950
You could tell he gets pumped.
Yeah, I do. I get a rush.

1126
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,170
What is pounce look like from Tom Cow?

1127
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:00,030
I like cars. I get excited
by cars, get excited. When I
saw, I saw one of his cars,

1128
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,730
I got, I was used to seeing that was
what you had a video camera on me.

1129
01:09:02,731 --> 01:09:06,290
I was like, ah. I was glowing
at the thing. I like cars.

1130
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,540
I buy car magazines and looking
at a kid. That's true. Yeah.

1131
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:15,660
All the corvette. Right. So cool.
He's like a little kid. Yeah,

1132
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,300
I do like it. So there you go.
You farted this morning. Uh,

1133
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,790
horrendously this morning or last night.

1134
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,660
Probably bug you excited about that too?
He changed.

1135
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:35,640
I was a marital relations and
then afterwards we were, you know,

1136
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:40,830
whatever, lame around and he
goes, you know, you're lucky.
I go, why? He goes, well,

1137
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:44,220
I held in a Fart for you that
whole time. And I go, wow,

1138
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:47,500
what a lucky gal and I should
get credit for that. I feel like,

1139
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,490
I feel like some guys would have
let that go and I was like, nope,

1140
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:55,530
don't do that right now. I
had just settled in, you know,

1141
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:59,280
and I was like, Nah, don't let this
go right now. That's beautiful. Yeah.

1142
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:01,430
See he can appreciate it.
It's amazing.

1143
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,010
I get excited talking about this with you.
Be,

1144
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,960
would she consider it
nice too that you owe?

1145
01:10:09,961 --> 01:10:14,961
Do you hold them in or do you try my
best and if I do accidentally let one go,

1146
01:10:15,331 --> 01:10:17,610
I'd let everybody know. Get out
of the way. Get out of the way.

1147
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:21,380
Everybody clear house? No, you got ladies
around here. A little girls, right?

1148
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:26,190
So yeah, house filled with girls. Thank
you gentlemen. I got the opposite.

1149
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:30,360
It's all dicks all day
balls and farts.

1150
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,730
Don't you think that you
get material out of that?

1151
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,680
That's probably a blessing for
you. I'm used to it. I'm, you know,

1152
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:39,730
I'm more male energy. Wait, not good with,

1153
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:45,150
we haven't done this during the
show. You need to do this, Christina.

1154
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,520
My big announcement just
means there's a big enough,

1155
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:56,120
there's

1156
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,570
a big news coming. Oh, it's a sound cue.

1157
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,730
You know how like morning shows we'll
have like air horns or whatever.

1158
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,440
We have chips in the ball.
She was in a bowl.

1159
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:06,120
But what kind of chips of those things
are potato chips being poured into?

1160
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:11,060
So loud? It sounds like, I thought it
was gambling chips. Yeah. Oh, right.

1161
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:13,050
Oh, that's interesting. I've
never thought of that know know.

1162
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,160
I don't think there's a distinction

1163
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,000
made, but it's so clunky. It is. Yeah.
I think they're the thin lays kind.

1164
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:22,880
That's the kind I see when I ruffles.
Yeah. Yup. Okay. Uh, anyways,

1165
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,940
big news.
I'm finally shooting my hour special.

1166
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,913
Oh,

1167
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:36,970
you shooting it? All right. Here it is.
Denounce Mike and finally make it June 20

1168
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:41,971
fourth@theshoeboxtheaterinseattleandticketsareonthousandranch.com.

1169
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:47,650
The link is up and is active, so you can
get those tickets now. Please Mommy's,

1170
01:11:47,651 --> 01:11:50,770
let's pack it out so I can have a
great taping. There's two shows,

1171
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,980
a seven and nine 30 Bang Bang.

1172
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,590
And the great city of meat rattle.

1173
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:59,800
I can't wait to go there with so many
mommy's there. It's gonna be awesome.

1174
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,430
And I'm still very happy for you.

1175
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:06,320
Seattle's on the shortlist of places
I would live outside of La as, yeah.

1176
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:10,010
Same as me. I like, they're very,
yeah, get through the winter.

1177
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,070
I'd just go to Hawaii a couple of times
or something to get through that fucking

1178
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:16,460
rainy bullshit yeah. To deal with.
But once you get through that,

1179
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,930
I think like intellectually, I think
it's one of the best cities. Like people,

1180
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,410
they're not as pretentious.
They're, but they're smart.

1181
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,120
There's no show Biz influence,

1182
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:29,170
which I think is one of the things
that fucks us up here. Yeah. Is the,

1183
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:33,770
the desire for fame. Like he's, it's a,
this is a total absence of that up there.

1184
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,880
You see way less fake. Yup. Fake
tits, fake lips, fake ass people.

1185
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,990
What is that? They look like people.
It's a really cool city. I um,

1186
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,940
I didn't realize,
you know,

1187
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,920
sometimes you just see like one
thing and in a theater and so you,

1188
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:51,980
you don't know if you've been there
before. I did the more and uh,

1189
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,190
I didn't realize until afterwards when
I went to the lobby that I'd been there

1190
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:57,470
with you cause the lobby.
Yeah. Stood out to me.

1191
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,750
I didn't realize that when
you're before in Seattle.

1192
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,530
I did it a couple of weeks ago and
as as we were in there, they're like,

1193
01:13:03,531 --> 01:13:04,940
you've been here before. I was
like, never been here before.

1194
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,350
And then we got the lobby and I was like,

1195
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:09,950
I have been here before because I remember
doing like a meet and greet with you.

1196
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,850
With a, yeah. Have we done so many places?
Do I forget? Forget them all. Yeah.

1197
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,160
They all get, they blend
in Seattle. I mean, yeah,

1198
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:20,740
every time I've gone there I've had some
of the most fun shows that the average,

1199
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:24,650
yeah. That's why I chose that
city. I mean, I, you know,
La is obviously my heart.

1200
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:29,150
Yeah. What'd you say? The the
showbiz element, that is the problem.

1201
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,520
It's the problem.
There's not just a showbiz element,

1202
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:34,490
but the problem that you were talking
about what that Instagram kids and the

1203
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:37,200
Kardashians,
they're not necessarily even showbiz.

1204
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,250
They were like at the attention
industry. The attention industry. Yeah.

1205
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:45,050
It's like there's so much fake bullshit
and so much like flossy nonsense.

1206
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,340
Crazy. Yeah. I mean,

1207
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:51,370
I feel like Seattle is basis Microsoft
and Amazon and there's a lot of tech

1208
01:13:51,981 --> 01:13:54,130
money there and a lot of
really smart people. Yeah.

1209
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,800
And it's also super green and I feel
like being next to the ocean and Super

1210
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,930
Green, like you've seen a
lot of green mountains. Yeah.
It's something about that.

1211
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:07,580
It's just better for you. Yeah,
definitely. I think so too.

1212
01:14:07,581 --> 01:14:11,770
If your brain is a very like kind
of showy town know that we live in,

1213
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:13,330
it's like a very like show off thing.

1214
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:17,590
I think one of the funny things is like
the idea like that you think you have

1215
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:22,150
money in this town like and people who
are trying to come across that way and

1216
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:24,400
you go to a town like
Seattle where like no, those,

1217
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:29,320
those 22 people are billionaires and
then they're not even trying to show you

1218
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,510
that there weren't like a sweater

1219
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,030
Bill Gates dresses like a fucking like
killing and yeah.

1220
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,800
Yeah. It's, it's odd, right? What
are you doing all that money. He,

1221
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:45,430
but he does a lot of humanitarian sons
of it. That's incredible what he's done.

1222
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:49,450
And he got a lot of other super
wealthy people to donate their money.

1223
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,560
A lot of them like they do that. The
pledge. Well, how about Warren Buffet?

1224
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:57,430
He's given it all that and that's through
gates. He's done it through gates. Yeah.

1225
01:14:57,431 --> 01:14:59,650
He's an interesting cat.
Like he's literally,

1226
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:03,490
when he dies he will die and
leave it all to charity. Yeah.

1227
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,550
So that's and there and he's been
giving a lot, some of it, those guys,

1228
01:15:06,551 --> 01:15:08,890
they've been giving
billions as they're alive.

1229
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:12,790
Even Warren Buffet also lives in
like the same house that he bought,

1230
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:17,740
like 30 Maha Nebraska. It's
a super normal house. Yeah.

1231
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:21,870
It drove the same car for like 20 years.
Like why have all that money then?

1232
01:15:21,871 --> 01:15:25,420
No one understands.
Aren't you fucking flossing?

1233
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:30,190
He's balling his level. You
should definitely be balling
slightly. A little bit.

1234
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:34,480
The same lady, I think he's
divorced. He got divorced. Yeah,

1235
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:37,360
she got like 1.5 billion,
which to him was like,

1236
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:41,200
once you stop lik nagging at me,

1237
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,810
take a little 1 billion
billion. Dot. Yeah. Yeah.

1238
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:50,890
He's, he's still doing pretty
well now. Jude Dork titties.
That's a great city too.

1239
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,490
Yeah. Jude Dork titties. Yeah.

1240
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,780
Yeah, yeah. That's a place
that I would consider living.

1241
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,990
I would consider living in New York
City in the winter months. Yeah.

1242
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:05,170
It doesn't bother me that much.
I think it's all about,

1243
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:07,270
one thing is like in La after a while,

1244
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:10,940
even though compared to most of
the country lifestyle, you know,

1245
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:16,030
cost of living is much higher. It's still
significantly different than New York.

1246
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:21,540
And like I would only go there if I
could definitely live at least pretty

1247
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:25,100
comfortably. You know what I mean? Like
I've taught a baller, baller all. Yeah.

1248
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,970
You don't want to struggle in New York.
My wife wants,

1249
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:29,400
she's talked about moving there.

1250
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:32,440
This is like one place where she said she
would go like, if you want to go there,

1251
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:33,770
I'll go there. Really? Yeah.

1252
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:37,480
I think she just thinks it's like
a big glamour shopping trip though.

1253
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:41,890
So she looks at it. Well
she, she's right to a point.

1254
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,970
I mean like incredible shock.
The other colds rough,

1255
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:50,300
but you know, you just dress
warm, which is not that difficult.

1256
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:54,190
So you'd be doing like eight
spots a night. I know that
you yeah, maybe but not,

1257
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:57,970
I don't like that many spots as
much as I like longer spots. Right.

1258
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,360
I think longer spots like too long spa,
take two,

1259
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:04,540
one half hour spots over eight 15.
Yeah,

1260
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,400
because as far as like
developing material, I think
it's really important to,

1261
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:12,500
to stretch out a little bit because
you're creating like you've composing

1262
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:15,800
something, you're putting
something together, a peak
and a valley. And you know,

1263
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,230
Diaz and I had a conversation
about that yesterday. He was like,

1264
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:21,050
I got to go to more places where
I could work an hour. He goes,

1265
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:24,260
cause sometimes I'm home for like
a month and I don't go on the road.

1266
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,250
I don't do an hour set.

1267
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:28,700
And then I got to go do an hour set and
I got a piece it all together and make

1268
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:32,450
that make sense at a like short
spots. And it, and especially if you,

1269
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,980
if you're touring a lot like I have been
and you're doing that long set every

1270
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:41,840
night. Uh, I, I don't particularly
get a thrill out of a 15 minute spot.

1271
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:42,920
It feels like, it feels like, I mean,

1272
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:44,970
I understand it's a totally
different thing and it's,

1273
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:46,520
it becomes like a different skill set,

1274
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,230
but it doesn't even feel that rewarding
because like the benefit is like,

1275
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:54,270
it doesn't feel like it lines up with
what I'm doing. Know that you just can't,

1276
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,410
and cooking. Yeah, yeah.
You're just getting started in
the light goes on, you know?

1277
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:02,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're
saying. But to me, I treat them as blocks.

1278
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,230
Like I have a four 15 minute
blocks. And so like, uh,

1279
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,390
like if I'm doing a set tonight, I'll say,
okay, well I did this block last night,

1280
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:15,080
so tonight I'll do this blog. And
that's true. You know? And then, um,

1281
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:19,820
one of the cool things about La is that
I can do three or four blocks and night.

1282
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:23,870
Like I'll do one set at the Improv and
I'll do two sets of the comedy store.

1283
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:27,320
I did three sets of the comedy store and
one side of the Improv on two Thursdays

1284
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:30,050
ago. And you had like a
killer feature sets. Yeah.

1285
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:35,051
Well no one one different
to the same and one was uh,

1286
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:41,120
the um, uh, Jeremiah Watkins fuck
around shy. Yeah, yeah. I'm doing that.

1287
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:43,460
Next thing that's a great show.
Can't wait. I've never done it.

1288
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,660
Oh it's the best people.

1289
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:47,540
They yell at a subject and then
you start riffing on the subject.

1290
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:51,710
It's just yell out like
cats. Yeah, Yup, Yup.

1291
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:53,400
And you start talking about it and it's,

1292
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,550
you come up with material and punch lines.
You come up with taglines,

1293
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,140
you come up with,
like you might have a,

1294
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:03,950
a section of something that you've
ran about that doesn't fit anything.

1295
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,860
And then one day you have a
new bit and then you go, oh,

1296
01:19:06,861 --> 01:19:10,310
and then there's that thing that I did
on stage that night and then it slides

1297
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:14,780
right into there. I'm a big believer
in that. It's not that hard, you know,

1298
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:18,820
relatively speaking to
say something like a joke,

1299
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,820
come up with something funny.

1300
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:24,500
It's much more of a challenge to come up
with an interesting topic or a premise,

1301
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:28,460
you know? So that's what like that,
that show sounds exciting. Yeah.

1302
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:31,970
I feel like I'm saying like
talk about this topic. Yeah,

1303
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,500
premises are giant premises are
giant and a point of view is giant.

1304
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:40,040
And then from there I feel like it's like
that's the scaffolding that you'll add

1305
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:45,041
jokes too and you'll figure out a way
to make it funny and figure out a way to

1306
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:48,020
just do it the right way.
And for me,

1307
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:50,570
one of the things that I started doing
really recently that really made a big

1308
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:54,550
difference is, um, I'll, I'll have
a bit, even if the bits killing, uh,

1309
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,530
and I know like this pits
going well is developing well,

1310
01:19:57,531 --> 01:20:00,440
I will outside of stand up,

1311
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:04,790
I'll sit in front of my computer and just
write on that subject right on it in a

1312
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:07,680
completely different way. Like,
say if I approach from one,

1313
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:10,260
like say like you're talking
about going on a boat,

1314
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,820
you're approached it from this way,

1315
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:16,350
then I'll just approach it
from a completely different
way and just say, okay,

1316
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,680
well this is already in the can, this
one's done. All right, I've got it.

1317
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:22,050
So let me just try a new attack on it.

1318
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,470
And I've come up with so many different
punchlines coming at it from a different

1319
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:29,670
angle, but forcing myself to sit in
front of the computer and you know,

1320
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:33,060
I used that program, right.
Room ever showed you that
program, blacks, everything,

1321
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,020
blacks, everything out and gives you
green font. So it's like the matrix font.

1322
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:41,370
Yeah. And I just sit there and I can't
access email. I don't get notifications.

1323
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:42,030
Nothing.

1324
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,580
So when you, um, when you
write from a different angle,

1325
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:48,660
will you then in your bit do the
chunk that works and then be like,

1326
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:51,270
or what if somebody, and then like all
of a sudden present the other angle?

1327
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:56,570
Sometimes it fits in, sometimes it just,
I just find a way where it fits in.

1328
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,920
Yeah. But it just, it's just creating
more tags lines. Uh, more tag lines,

1329
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:03,780
more punch lines. You have a new
hour though, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1330
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:07,760
So how long did that take you? It didn't
take you that long. Six months. Yeah.

1331
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,670
That's awesome. Every day I'm
hustling. But I've seen you actually,

1332
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:12,763
it's a good lesson

1333
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:16,090
I think for a lot of a lot
of comics. Like you, uh,

1334
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:20,700
it came out and then you didn't, haven't
chilled at all on that. You just like,

1335
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:21,580
we're were,
I've see you,

1336
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,970
I see on posts all the time that you're
just like spot spot, like working,

1337
01:21:24,971 --> 01:21:26,050
working,
working all the time.

1338
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:30,320
Yeah, I do. Um, five or six
nights a week. Lately. At least.

1339
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:34,580
At least four. Always at least four.
Really. Like I worked last night.

1340
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:38,360
I take off tonight, I work Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

1341
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:42,110
I got a hot date with the wife and
then I'll probably work Sunday too.

1342
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,110
And then I'll go out it again next
week. And you're doing, by the way,

1343
01:21:45,111 --> 01:21:49,730
congrats on this tour because I saw it's,
it's big time shit, man. It's crazy.

1344
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:52,910
It's crazy. It's because you're doing the
theater at Madison Square Garden. Yeah,

1345
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:58,040
it's almost sold out. That's what's great.
Is that like 7,000 seats or something?

1346
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:01,850
That's some something crazy, crazy.
Dallas was nuts, man. Dallas was a,

1347
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:05,630
I just did Dallas. It was the biggest
place ever sold out. That was 6,000 seats.

1348
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,530
It was maniacal.
That's crazy energy that you get.

1349
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,553
How do you like it?

1350
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,640
Because it's a total different
thing from 1500 or 2000 seater.

1351
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,490
It's different.
It's a different thing,

1352
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,180
but the energy when you get
6,000 people laughing is crazy.

1353
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:26,150
It's weird. It's just circuits. Oh roar.
So it's a, it's a different feeling,

1354
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:31,000
but you know, man, I just, I
really like creating stuff. Yeah.

1355
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:34,160
I really like putting
together, stand up, you know?

1356
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:39,161
And I really love the process of writing
things down and going over my notes.

1357
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,960
I'd love the process of
creating new material.

1358
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:46,040
I love the process of sitting in front
of that laptop and staring at the screen.

1359
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,570
I love the whole process.

1360
01:22:47,571 --> 01:22:52,040
I love the process of going on a run and
like recording a new idea that I have

1361
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:55,250
in my head and then looking at the
notes that I have on my phone and then

1362
01:22:55,251 --> 01:22:58,670
breaking those down on paper and then
sitting in front of the laptop and then

1363
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:00,590
taking these ideas,
smoking a joint,

1364
01:23:00,591 --> 01:23:04,160
going on stage with it and riffing with
it and then recording it and listening

1365
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:08,870
to the recording on the home.
It's like the whole process to me is I've,

1366
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:13,080
it's my favorite thing to do. It
really is. Other than you know, me too.

1367
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:16,990
I think it is like the biggest thrill
I was talking to somebody about it that

1368
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:17,260
like,

1369
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:22,260
I think the biggest thrill still of all
things is coming up with something new

1370
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,460
and having it be, you know, the
validated and rewarded. You're like,

1371
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:30,010
that's a bigger thrill than
anything. Yeah. It really is.

1372
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:31,450
Like I thought of this thing,

1373
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:36,190
I said it and this group
of people reacting and then
abandoning it. Yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:39,190
You have to have staff.
Do you do or record a special,

1375
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:42,830
like somebody yelled out like do the Kim
Kardashians, the Bruce Jenner bit, right?

1376
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:45,250
Yeah. And I'm like, dude, I don't
even know how to do it anymore.

1377
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,590
I literally don't know how to do it.
People don't understand that.

1378
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,570
Only comics understanding.
Yeah, there you go.

1379
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,410
I've been doing this other thing for so
long now that I don't remember the beats

1380
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:55,320
of that.
Somebody tried to get I,

1381
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:00,010
I started to do one and I was like 30%
through it and I got an a on what happens

1382
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:04,090
next? The audience yelled out the next
line. I was like, well there you go.

1383
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,073
You guys know.

1384
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,520
Then as I'm ramping up
to tape it in a month,

1385
01:24:07,521 --> 01:24:12,140
like I have to sit down and really go
through my notes and really remember every

1386
01:24:12,141 --> 01:24:14,960
little beat. Yeah. Bump to
it and bell and whistle.

1387
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:16,580
Cause of course forget the cadence,

1388
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,490
get away without doing that.
But make no mistake about it.

1389
01:24:19,491 --> 01:24:22,580
The more attention you spend thinking
about that material, the better.

1390
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,850
Yeah, most definitely. Yeah. And
I have to get full focus. Like,

1391
01:24:25,851 --> 01:24:29,360
I can't fuck around with anything
like it's laser until that date.

1392
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,290
You know what I know that's
really kind of weird.

1393
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:35,850
I know guys that write on shows and
they'll write sitcoms scripts and they'll

1394
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:37,910
write movie scripts and then they,

1395
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,120
they have like a chalkboard
or a whiteboard and they're
right on the whiteboard

1396
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,000
and they'll have notes that put
like scenes, different scenes,

1397
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:48,950
but they don't ever do that
about their own act. Right.
And, and then their, their,

1398
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,240
their own act, they treat like, you know,

1399
01:24:51,241 --> 01:24:53,520
like a red headed
stepchild and never really,

1400
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,240
they never really have that kind of
professional focus cause you don't have to

1401
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:58,980
because no one's telling you to write.

1402
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,320
But when it comes to like writing
a show or writing a movie to,

1403
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,730
you have to write that because
everyone's going over bit by bit.

1404
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:08,580
You have writer's meetings, you go to the
writer's room, you sit down with people.

1405
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,270
There's no writer's room or
writer's meetings for standup.

1406
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:15,050
Well why isn't there like why? Why
don't we, because we're fucking lazy,

1407
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,000
nice discipline.
It's self discipline.

1408
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:21,010
And also it's hard to look at yourself
and look and step back and separate you

1409
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:24,100
from your work and got, yeah, that
kind of sock like that can be better.

1410
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:25,090
I should do this there.

1411
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:29,110
You know what I love the most is knowing
that I'm about to say some crazy shit.

1412
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,020
Like when you're like you take the
risk and in your heart you're like, oh,

1413
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:34,810
I'm so scared of this could be really
there. Shouldn't, I shouldn't say this.

1414
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:38,720
And then you say, yeah, you get addicted
to that feeling. Yeah, I like that part.

1415
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:42,130
Like I'm going to take a leap right
here. Yeah. This is scary. And yeah,

1416
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,450
hopefully they'll come with me.

1417
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:46,410
And it's not just talking about airplanes
and cats and dogs. You're like, yeah,

1418
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,610
they say some crazy shit.
Yeah. And they, and then

1419
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,100
there's a, there is that the risk, the
risk is what the, is that feeling of like,

1420
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:57,480
yeah, there's this pair shoes it,
yeah. And then the, the like, it's,

1421
01:25:57,481 --> 01:25:58,920
you don't think about it at the time,

1422
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:03,921
but the knowing that a bunch of
people are getting babysitters,

1423
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,170
they're spending their money,

1424
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:10,400
they're coming out to see you and there's
this massive responsibility to incite

1425
01:26:10,401 --> 01:26:11,600
a reaction in them.
Yeah.

1426
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,110
With just your words and thoughts and the
amount of responsibility that's on you

1427
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:17,990
do that. It's pretty intense. I've, I've,

1428
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:21,410
I've paid more attention to it over the
last year or so that I have like ever in

1429
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:25,580
my life. Yeah. Have ramped
it up more. Yeah. I've, I've,

1430
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:27,620
I just think it's constantly,

1431
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:32,060
and then my standards always get
hired too. It's like I need to,

1432
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:37,010
I can't have a new special that's not
as good as the last one. So I feel like,

1433
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:38,570
man,
I gotta make sure this one's better.

1434
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:42,680
So I have to like watch my old one and
go, well, what were, where's there?

1435
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:46,730
Too much fluff. Too much. Oh, you
did that. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1436
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:49,260
Like maybe I could cut this down.
Maybe I shouldn't.

1437
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:52,490
Maybe this isn't as good as
this part. You know, all that.

1438
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:57,170
It's just all sharpening the Samurai
Sword, hammering that fucking metal down.

1439
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:01,740
Yeah. I know. My problem is
I'm a perfectionist, so like
an, it's never good enough.

1440
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:04,200
It's never going to be, that's
everybody's problem. I hate it.

1441
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,220
Everybody hates if anybody who's any
good hates everything they do. It's true.

1442
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:12,180
Everybody I know that loves
their act is terrible.

1443
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,000
Everybody tells me all my new stuff's
amazing. I love it. Get away from it.

1444
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:19,570
It's gross.
I've heard the,

1445
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:22,530
remember we did this job one time where
that guy was like, oh, it goes like,

1446
01:27:22,531 --> 01:27:25,230
don't show that of going
back and watching. Yeah.

1447
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:29,520
I love watching yourself and like it was
terrible. It was terrible. There you go.

1448
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:32,190
That's always the case. Yeah. It's weird.

1449
01:27:32,191 --> 01:27:36,210
It's always the case and there they're
always like big self promoters to, Oh God.

1450
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:38,220
Yeah. Yeah. Letterman hated himself.

1451
01:27:38,221 --> 01:27:42,990
I read some book about him years ago and
every episode he would go home and just

1452
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,460
put on the hair shirt and
flog himself like that.

1453
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:49,140
I was the worst episode ever and
I, in my estimation, he's the best.

1454
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:53,090
I love farming so much. But he why
he's the best though. Yeah. Cause he,

1455
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,670
cause he had these high standards,
he wasn't just half ass it. Yeah,

1456
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,880
yeah, yeah. It's true.

1457
01:27:57,910 --> 01:28:01,770
I remember a guy one time asked
me to get them a guest spot in.

1458
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:05,350
It's like I went to a city and he was
like, I knew him, I met him before.

1459
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:07,810
So I talked to the manager
of the club and I was like,

1460
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,960
can I get this guy a guest spot? And
she was like, are you vouching for him?

1461
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,860
I was like, yeah, yeah. So cause okay,

1462
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:20,020
so he goes up there,
just eats such a big bag of shit.

1463
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:25,000
So then the club manager is like, what
the fuck was that? And I go, wow, I just,

1464
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:29,860
I dunno. So there's a second
show. And I go, dude, that
was like, yeah. He was like,

1465
01:28:29,861 --> 01:28:32,790
I know, I know. He's like, I'll do a
totally different set on the second.

1466
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:35,830
So totally have different set and, and
I'll, I'll make up for it. And I go, okay.

1467
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:39,460
So I go, let's just let him,
he'll do a totally different set.

1468
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,710
No,
not only does he do the same set,

1469
01:28:43,711 --> 01:28:48,711
he does x verbatim the same opening and
since she's looking at me like what's

1470
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:53,550
going on? And I'm like, I see him. I
go, yeah, you did the same exact thing.

1471
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:54,960
And he was like,
yeah,

1472
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,910
what was his reasoning blackout
or something. You got nervous.

1473
01:28:59,911 --> 01:29:02,040
And the other thing is that
that stood is that he had, this

1474
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,540
is quite a few years ago,

1475
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:08,660
like amazing website and like all this
other stuff had incredible attention.

1476
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:12,510
You know like those guys. Yeah. Yeah.

1477
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:15,650
When you started doing standup
and the car, I bought new cards.

1478
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:20,150
I remember that like cards that
say your name and like, like about,

1479
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:24,830
this is every time I meet a guy in a
town and he wants to do a guest set,

1480
01:29:24,831 --> 01:29:27,890
I'm almost positive they suck.
They're always like real true to him.

1481
01:29:27,891 --> 01:29:29,450
And I really love to
have guests on your show.

1482
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:33,840
Would guest said there's 6,000 people.
So you're going to do a guest bet.

1483
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:39,200
I know a bunch of guys do that.
I've had.

1484
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:43,370
I've also had guys that are like
marginal headliners and you know,

1485
01:29:43,371 --> 01:29:45,590
work in comics.
Just show up,

1486
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:50,570
just show up at my show and asked to do
a guest set. I'd like to Chicago Theater.

1487
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:55,520
It's crazy. I'm not kidding. 3,700 people.
Hey, I like to do a guest set. Hey,

1488
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:59,300
I'd like you to go fuck yourself. Yeah,
tell them what do you say? No, I go to,

1489
01:29:59,301 --> 01:30:03,500
this is all set up like this guy's
going to do 20 a you know he's got,

1490
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,440
Ian's going to do 20 Tony Hinchcliffe
so coming into 20 and then I'm doing an

1491
01:30:06,441 --> 01:30:08,960
hour and 10 like this is what
it is. Is it? This is the show,

1492
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:12,440
like there's no room for your guests
said, I'll just do like seven minutes. No,

1493
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:15,060
you're not doing anything. I don't
even know what you're doing. Yeah.

1494
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:16,180
I don't know what kind of moody,

1495
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:19,550
what if you go up on stage and
you start doing my, my subjects,

1496
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:22,980
like get the fuck out of you
just got an email about theater.

1497
01:30:22,981 --> 01:30:26,420
It's about one for a theater show where
they were like, but here's the thing.

1498
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,510
Would you ever do that?
Never. Never the thing.

1499
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:34,750
Imagine showing up at a, if you were
a musician, there's a band plan like,

1500
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:37,610
hey man, I just like to go home and do
a song. Which is like what the fuck?

1501
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:38,783
Fucking mind.

1502
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:42,350
Well the crazy thing about this email too,
cause I've had this a few times,

1503
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:47,030
is it's an email saying, hey, you're
coming to the city. I'd love to do a set.

1504
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,400
Not only do you not know who I am,

1505
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,120
I will provide no link to anything
so that you could check out.

1506
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:56,630
Like in other words, it's just sight
unseen. You don't know anything about me.

1507
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,440
Can I be on your show?
Can I do like 20 minutes?

1508
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:05,510
That's good to know. You
know, maybe like five.

1509
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:08,140
I had a guy show up in Atlanta
and he wanted to do a half hour.

1510
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:11,590
That's what he said. Yeah. I said,
do you want to do, he goes, he goes,

1511
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,500
I want to do a guest set. He goes, jump
note. Only talking like 30 minutes,

1512
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:15,334
not like an hour.

1513
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:21,960
I remember once I had hockey.
I love Dan Godfrey.

1514
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:25,680
He used to run the Brayer Improv and
now he like overseas I think all the

1515
01:31:25,681 --> 01:31:30,600
Improv's. Yeah. And one time I was
in a brayer and I was, I think man,

1516
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:35,490
I want to say I was
middling. This is like, uh,

1517
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:39,990
probably like oh six or something.
And the, but I was, oh I was,

1518
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,580
yeah it was middling. And the, the MC was
like, I'll do turn to him. I was like,

1519
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:48,300
I'll do 20 and uh,
and then him and then Dan goes,

1520
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:51,450
you'll do 10 you won't do a
minute more like just straight up.

1521
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:55,520
Cause the guy was like announcing how
much time he's going to do from the AAMC

1522
01:31:55,521 --> 01:31:59,070
slot out. Yeah. He was like,
I'll do 20 and then how much
do you do? And he's like,

1523
01:31:59,260 --> 01:31:59,980
do 10 and not

1524
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,813
a second more

1525
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:05,050
telling him like don't even
fucking dream about doing that.

1526
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,670
Yeah. And people get mad
listening this inevitably,

1527
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:12,290
oh I'll get an angry tweet or an angry
Facebook message and people will get mad

1528
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,190
thinking that,
you know,

1529
01:32:13,191 --> 01:32:15,860
like you just don't appreciate
people that are trying to make it.

1530
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,570
And when you were trying to make it,
listen,

1531
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,090
I'm telling you all the people that
are out there listening that have that

1532
01:32:20,091 --> 01:32:23,840
mindset, no one does that. No
one who's any good does that.

1533
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,630
It's just not what you do.
You don't ever ask for guest spots.

1534
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:31,010
If you get to know someone and you start
working with someone and you work with

1535
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:34,420
them on a regular basis and you want
to work with them somewhere, you know,

1536
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:37,490
that's one thing.
Like say if you know,

1537
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:41,290
like say if you were going to be in town
doing a wedding or something like that,

1538
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:43,850
like you were a friend who was getting
married. So my dad, he like, dude,

1539
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:47,000
you're working that night.
And I'd be like, yeah, you
want to do a set and be like,

1540
01:32:47,001 --> 01:32:50,150
fuck yeah. And then we would work
around it. Sure. I figure it out.

1541
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,510
But it's only because we've
worked together so many
times and know each other so

1542
01:32:53,511 --> 01:32:57,290
well. Like to have someone who you
don't even know want to interject.

1543
01:32:57,291 --> 01:33:01,790
Like your s your show is
like a complete package.

1544
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:05,390
Like you've put it together, right?
You know who you opening acts are,

1545
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,870
you know what kind of material they do
totally and you're thinking about how

1546
01:33:08,871 --> 01:33:11,330
this whole thing is going to play out
together and you want to make sure that

1547
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:14,720
that audience who gets that babysitter
and goes out and we do want to make sure

1548
01:33:14,721 --> 01:33:16,850
that they get the best set possible.

1549
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:21,940
And I'm old school I guess in the
sense that I am 100% of the idea that

1550
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:26,600
everything at any show is
absolutely all about the headliners,

1551
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:30,440
desires and wants for it's their show.

1552
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,670
Like whenever I opened for you and like
somebody would say like, Hey, do you,

1553
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:38,510
I'd be like, I don't know, ask him. It's
his fucking show. Like we're all here.

1554
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:40,010
It's called support for a reason.

1555
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:45,070
Like we're supporting the headlining
act and I fucking hate when they try to

1556
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:49,460
involve anybody else in decision
making or how do you want to go.

1557
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:53,420
It's all about whoever's name is on the
more whatever they dictate is the way

1558
01:33:53,421 --> 01:33:55,340
that show goes and you
should respect that.

1559
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:57,980
You should respect what it took
for them to get to that point.

1560
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:00,990
And you should respect their
desires at the show though,

1561
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:04,520
if you want to talk about lighting
or music or how much time all,

1562
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:08,220
it's all that person's
decision so everybody else
can go fuck themselves. Yeah.

1563
01:34:08,221 --> 01:34:11,060
You know what? I also find to be a
problem that I don't, I don't do.

1564
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:14,950
I don't take guys in the road to do
crowd work. Oh boy. Get your life.

1565
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:18,500
It just opens up Pandora's box.

1566
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:23,270
It becomes a real problem where when
someone loves to do crowd work and they

1567
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:26,210
start what you do for a living, sir,
I'm looking at you with that suit on.

1568
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:30,370
I'm imagining good salesman and
now you know that the problem

1569
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,380
people start boozing and they want to,
I'm going to get my chance.

1570
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:35,230
He's going to talk to me,

1571
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,530
and then they start gearing up and then
it at the time never comes and then

1572
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:40,630
you're on stage and they
want to start yelling,

1573
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,471
sit down. You're like, oh.

1574
01:34:41,471 --> 01:34:46,471
It changes the expectations of the show
and somebody who's the show is not about

1575
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,900
them has made that decision.
That's what's fucked up about it.

1576
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:51,910
I've had that were like,
Holy Shit.

1577
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:56,050
One Guy did eight 20 minute Crowdwork
set front of me. Really? Yeah.

1578
01:34:56,051 --> 01:34:58,100
And did like a, I mean this is
few years ago we got it worked

1579
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,190
into a frenzy and then you get up there
and if some guys like and you're like,

1580
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:05,960
shut the fuck up. I'm not talking
to you man. It's a problem. Yeah,

1581
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:08,300
it becomes a problem because
then the audience mad at you.

1582
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:11,160
How come you just get to talk?
All right, why don't I talk.

1583
01:35:11,161 --> 01:35:14,930
Guy was waiting to talk.
Yeah, I just love it.

1584
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:17,120
They used to really mismatch my opener.
It's like,

1585
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:21,250
this is back in the day I was opening
Fort Lauderdale and they gave me this, uh,

1586
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:25,870
this guy who was like,
ladies, you will guide us.

1587
01:35:25,871 --> 01:35:30,470
Suck Good Dick.
That's why they call it a blow job.

1588
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:33,370
Not a career. Some shit. And I was like,
all like, ladies, you got to suck Dick.

1589
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:38,030
Get the fuck Outta here. Like, do you
even know who I am? No. Don't give a shit.

1590
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:41,960
They're not putting care. They're
not considering it as your show. Now,

1591
01:35:41,961 --> 01:35:44,810
that guy would never even be near me.

1592
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:48,980
Like a guy that the club
found funny and they go, yeah,

1593
01:35:48,981 --> 01:35:53,570
I've got it open week for
male to female comic plus it.

1594
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:58,100
Fort Lauderdale
is there other than Jim Brewer,

1595
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:01,040
is there a funny comic that's ever
come out of Florida? Is he had,

1596
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:05,120
is he had a Florida? I didn't
even know that crusher.

1597
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:09,830
He's Tosh tosh before too. In
Florida too. There goes my theory.

1598
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:13,730
Todd Barry's Todd Barry said Florida.
Wow.

1599
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:17,410
But I know you're saying in terms of like
the fame, there's not abutment there.

1600
01:36:17,411 --> 01:36:20,300
They developed somewhere else. There's
one other guy too that's really fun to,

1601
01:36:20,301 --> 01:36:24,440
they came out of Florida. Um, Brian Regan
didn't, Brian Regan came out of Florida.

1602
01:36:24,441 --> 01:36:28,220
You might be right. Yes. He's from
Miami. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So my,

1603
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:30,660
my theory sucks. Yeah.
But no, you're right.

1604
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,520
But there's no bastion of comedic
glory like Fort Lauderdale's not worth.

1605
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:37,950
We all go to get really good. Well,
there's no community, right? Yeah.

1606
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,410
Apparently there was developing one in
Miami because last time was in Miami was

1607
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:44,800
a couple of years ago and I did the uh,
you know,

1608
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,550
they have that South
beach comedy festival.

1609
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:50,270
I went with you on this right
and we were after the show,

1610
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:52,910
we were talking to some people, it's one
of the local bars. They're like, yeah,

1611
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:57,440
we're local comics. We have like
a comedy show here and a bar here.

1612
01:36:57,441 --> 01:37:00,600
And like we put together like a
real community. I'm like, Oh yeah,

1613
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,390
like that didn't exist for a while.

1614
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:07,190
Miami was the worst impression
history of people don't,

1615
01:37:07,191 --> 01:37:09,320
I'm walking around the world,
they cancel my week.

1616
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:11,780
I got a call like a month
before and they're like, look,

1617
01:37:11,781 --> 01:37:14,720
we can't sell tickets for a white girl.
We're going to have to pull your week.

1618
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:15,930
And I was like,
no problem.

1619
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:20,630
A month before they knew were
like the writing's on the wall.

1620
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,710
No one take it for this white
girl speak English. That's crazy.

1621
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:29,480
Shows that Joey d is used to do half
Spanish shows there. Like he would,

1622
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:33,920
he would yell out half the punchline
would be in Spanish and people would fall

1623
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:36,560
out of their fucking chairs crying,
laughing.

1624
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:41,690
We did shows there and they were just,
it was thunder dome. It was chaos.

1625
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,440
It was chaos.
It was,

1626
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,190
I did a set there where I would
weave in and out of Spanish too.

1627
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:48,440
And that's right. You speak
full span. And I would,

1628
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,550
and it would be crushing it pandemonium.
It would be nice.

1629
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:55,740
And I did one one time middling

1630
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:00,360
and the headliner did 35 minutes
afterwards. Oh my God. He's like,

1631
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:04,910
I'm out of here. Almost have
to be bilingual. Yeah. Yeah.

1632
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,730
And that like if you,

1633
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:09,150
if you were to ask that staff like
are you going to police the room?

1634
01:38:09,151 --> 01:38:11,950
They'd be like that.
No Dude.

1635
01:38:11,951 --> 01:38:16,290
And everyone was 18 the audience was all
under each and they gave away tickets.

1636
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,940
It was a whole papered room. They told
me a story about how, you know there was,

1637
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:23,520
that was in coconut
grove and there's some,

1638
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,830
there's some bad parts
near that in that area.

1639
01:38:26,831 --> 01:38:27,720
Like they would also tell you like,

1640
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:30,810
don't walk down the street from
the club and you're like, oh great.

1641
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:34,200
And so this one, you know
there's like this Haitian
gang, I forget the name of it,

1642
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:38,550
but anyways, dominant in that area.
So one time, some guy, I don't know,

1643
01:38:38,551 --> 01:38:41,400
he's being loud or something. So they
go to one of the guys is like, Hey,

1644
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:45,270
could you keep it down?
And then when he comes back a second time,

1645
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:50,540
the guy opens his jacket and shows
him he's got a gun in his waistband.

1646
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:55,230
So the guys like fucking, I'm not
getting killed over the Goddamn Improv,

1647
01:38:55,231 --> 01:38:58,350
you know, so he goes, tells the manager,

1648
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:03,150
the manager knows that the head Honcho
of that gang is a big fan of show.

1649
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:05,850
It goes to shows there.
So, and he's in the room.

1650
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:10,110
So they go tell the gang leader that like,
hey,

1651
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:13,860
this other guy just flashed
a gun to one of my staff.

1652
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:18,930
And that guy just turns in the
middle of the show to the guy who,

1653
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:23,850
who showed the gun and was like, Hey, no.
And so he got up, went out to his car,

1654
01:39:23,851 --> 01:39:27,570
put his gun in his car, came
back, was like, sorry about
that, and they were like,

1655
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,433
all right,

1656
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:33,180
there's no involving anyone else and
no throwing him out or just like be a,

1657
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:36,880
be a decent guy. Put your gun
in your car. Christ. Yeah.

1658
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:41,760
That room was chaos. No, I did it. I,

1659
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,060
I've done the room
before it. Yes, go ahead.

1660
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,350
It was one of the first clubs that
I said I would never go back to.

1661
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,790
I told them on stage,
I go,

1662
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:51,540
you are the dumbest fucking people I
have ever performed and they were howling

1663
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:53,670
laughing. I go, you don't
understand. I'm so serious.

1664
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:00,310
I'm like, I'm not coming back. Yeah.

1665
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,280
I remember Diaz having some
choice words about it too.

1666
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,280
He was when Diaz is like this too
fucking crazy. Still fucking crazy down.

1667
01:40:08,281 --> 01:40:11,220
There are a lot of nail was a
close second. I would say Miami.

1668
01:40:11,221 --> 01:40:13,610
It was number one in Fort Lauderdale
at the Hollywood improv. Yeah.

1669
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:17,730
I always had a good time there.
The Seminole. Yeah. For me. I mean,

1670
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:22,310
that's when I was like coming up,
whatever it was. Okay. Dot. A Bluetooth,

1671
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:25,920
Bluetooth. Oh, those Bluetooth
taxis. I remember those guys

1672
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:34,780
stopped. They ended, thank
God. Isn't that weird?

1673
01:40:34,781 --> 01:40:39,700
Do you know of Ryan sickler story
about that? So he had a, uh,

1674
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:44,370
he needed a tape for something. And so
Ryan sickler is one of my good friends,

1675
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,110
very funny comic set up.

1676
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:48,060
And you know what it's like when
you taping a set for something,

1677
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,560
you want everything to come together.

1678
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:54,890
So he sets up a camera in the back of
the Hollywood improv and records his own

1679
01:40:55,661 --> 01:41:00,580
set and he's up there having a great
set killing leave stage like I got,

1680
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:04,780
I got my set to submit to whatever thing
he's sending it in for comedy stars or

1681
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:05,614
something.

1682
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,800
So he's just happy he gets back to
review it and a guy sitting next to the

1683
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:16,820
camera, the tripod with the camera as
soon as Ryan gets onstage was like, hello.

1684
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:22,370
Huh? Comedy Club comedy.
I'm at a comedy club.

1685
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,620
And throughout.
Ryan said,

1686
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,800
you just hear the guy on his phone
calls saying over and over comedy club,

1687
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,390
I'm at a comedy club.
So that's what Ryan has a tape,

1688
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,350
guys yelling,
I'm at a con,

1689
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:43,180
you know Bluetooth Man,

1690
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,000
that Bluetooth Cleveland though.
It's interesting.

1691
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:51,250
I don't want to see them anymore. It was
almost a point of, um, it was like a,

1692
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:54,620
like a floss. It was like showing like
you were telling people that you had one.

1693
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,560
It wasn't about I need to get
calls all the time. It was like,

1694
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:02,610
you see the blinking, I'm a businessman.
I'm balling Cleveland Improv.

1695
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:07,080
It was just like a sea of Bluetooth
ear pieces. Man. I gotta get back.

1696
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:10,230
By the way. That one was rough, terrible.

1697
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:13,580
Cleveland seems to have made a comeback
though. Cleveland is doing. And I, and I,

1698
01:42:13,581 --> 01:42:17,470
you know, I've had great
shows in that city that I, I,

1699
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:20,080
but that club,
Cleveland Improv,

1700
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:24,580
I definitely had some fucking
really bad crazy shows.

1701
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:25,511
I mean,

1702
01:42:25,511 --> 01:42:30,511
there was a guy arrested during the show
who he sent back because it says one

1703
01:42:32,471 --> 01:42:37,090
pound chicken wings and he goes, that
wasn't a pound. And they were like,

1704
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:42,370
it's what it is man. He was like, take
me to the kitchen and weigh, weigh them.

1705
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,520
Cause I know that's not a pound.
And they have a, by the way,

1706
01:42:45,521 --> 01:42:49,660
this is one of the clubs that there's
a permanent police officer stationed in

1707
01:42:49,661 --> 01:42:53,260
the lobby. And so they were like, no.
He's like, well I'm not paying for it.

1708
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:57,370
So they just get the cop and
they go, hey, here's the deal.

1709
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:00,640
And the cop goes, look, I
thinking like this is, look man,

1710
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:04,180
you're either paying for them, I'm taking
you to jail. And the guy just goes,

1711
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:08,270
there you go. Go ahead.
So they arrest him. Wow.

1712
01:43:08,271 --> 01:43:11,240
Over an order of chicken wings.
He didn't want to pay for it. Wow.

1713
01:43:11,241 --> 01:43:15,470
This is not a pound. That
was the Cleveland Improv
merge stolen off your tape.

1714
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,011
I had merged,

1715
01:43:16,011 --> 01:43:20,000
stolen at the Cleveland Browns who still
your March people like they were like,

1716
01:43:20,001 --> 01:43:22,820
we want a picture.
And they like totally distracted me.

1717
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:26,330
And then when I looked down I was like
doing my own thing. Then like, you know,

1718
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:28,610
I have plenty of these,
there's like five gone.

1719
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:32,060
They just set me up for a picture and
then I turned back and they were gone.

1720
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,990
Like, know who the people were. Just see
them leave. Did you go after that? I mean,

1721
01:43:35,991 --> 01:43:39,170
I, it's like I turned and I was like,
Hey, I'm telling like this security guy,

1722
01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:43,760
like they just stole it. He was like,
yes. Sucks man. Like it wasn't like,

1723
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:50,630
you know, it is man. People
Steal Shit. You're in Cleveland.

1724
01:43:50,631 --> 01:43:52,240
Yeah. Tried to sell cds. Yeah,

1725
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:52,670
man.

1726
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:56,980
Yeah. I was such a rough, the first night
I ever did the Cleveland Improv, uh,

1727
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,220
uh, uh, John and a pimp. I have a chart,
you know what I'm saying? The pimp,

1728
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,530
the hooker and the John,

1729
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:07,380
we're getting in a fight right at the
front row and they got thrown out like

1730
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:11,360
this is who took a hooker to a
show. Yes. I found out later,

1731
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:13,760
I didn't know at the time and
I was just starting my set.

1732
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:16,970
Here I am my first time in Cleveland, just
trying to survive and I look in there,

1733
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:19,470
they're getting ushered out.
I'm like, what happened? Well,

1734
01:44:19,471 --> 01:44:20,990
it was a hooker and a the John,

1735
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:23,480
they're in a fight and that it had done
anything on arrest and they have to,

1736
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:26,470
yeah, I've had people vomit in my
showroom on Cinco de Mayo. Okay.

1737
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:32,790
As a Cleveland and probably the ones
that was grinding through a rough set and

1738
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,420
this guy and the third goal
goes, uh, he goes terrible man,

1739
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,260
like fully loud.
Like this guy's terrible.

1740
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,970
What's up man?
And then some lady in the bag goes,

1741
01:44:45,971 --> 01:44:48,390
your mama should have swallowed that nut.
Like God,

1742
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:52,780
meaning like this is in
Cleveland? Yeah, the Cleveland
Improv. Wow. I was like, damn,

1743
01:44:52,781 --> 01:44:57,350
yeah, I go, your dad should have stuck
around to raise you. And then, oh,

1744
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:02,050
and then like I got out of
there pretty quick. It was,

1745
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:05,070
what did she say when you said
that? Uh, it, it was just, it was,

1746
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:08,860
there was so much oohing and aahing and
like, and swearing, and then she was,

1747
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:12,370
she was removed.
So like she was allowed to say her thing.

1748
01:45:12,371 --> 01:45:15,670
I said my thing and then there was like,
fuck, fuck, fuck. Like fuck you, fuck you,

1749
01:45:15,671 --> 01:45:19,030
fuck you. And then they actually throw
them out. What happened after that?

1750
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:21,580
The show calm down or
no? Yeah, they let me,

1751
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,870
it was like as I'm winding into the
closing bit of the set, so I was like,

1752
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:28,780
it was right before I shut it down anyway.
Like it was,

1753
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,970
I was about to close and then,
yeah,

1754
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:34,420
I mean I remember I walked pretty fast
offstage though as I got out of there,

1755
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,660
but that was, that was, there were
some rough sets in that room and yeah,

1756
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:42,730
Cleveland's rough. But, but hilarity
is, is pretty fucking different.

1757
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:47,240
That's different. Yeah.
Different. Yeah. It's like, it,

1758
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:50,680
it's a beautiful room and like, you know,
I mean, they'd probably has great clubs.

1759
01:45:50,681 --> 01:45:53,040
Don't get me wrong. Yeah. That's like
a rough rule. How's it different?

1760
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,940
Yeah, I was there recently
with Fitzsimmons polarities.
Yeah. I was there on a,

1761
01:45:57,941 --> 01:46:01,490
I can't, I flew in on Thursday night.
I had a show there on Friday and uh,

1762
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:02,660
fits in misery on Thursday.

1763
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:07,350
So I did a set on his show on Thursday
and it was great. This is great.

1764
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:10,810
He's hilarious. We started out like a week
apart from each other. Did you really?

1765
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:12,400
Yeah, yeah. Literally a week apart.

1766
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:17,040
I just did his podcast couple
of weeks ago. He's a natural,

1767
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:20,160
like when we talk about the
skill set of conversations. Yeah.

1768
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:23,160
He's really good at it. His Dad
was a big time radio host. Yeah.

1769
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,013
Oh I didn't know that.

1770
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:28,210
Yeah. Wow. Greg and I did so
many fucking cakes together.

1771
01:46:28,211 --> 01:46:31,780
We steal each other's material.
Really? We had a deal cause we both,

1772
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:35,620
neither one of us were really, we really
shouldn't have been working, you know,

1773
01:46:35,621 --> 01:46:40,510
we would only like 20 years ago.
More. More. Yeah. Like 89, 88.

1774
01:46:40,511 --> 01:46:45,100
Wait, how long have you been doing
it? Since 88. August 27th, 1980 h wow.

1775
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:51,150
And um, so we're coming up on your
anniversary. Yeah, yeah. In 19. Yeah.

1776
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:55,020
In 2018 it will be my 30th
anniversary. Wow. Crazy.

1777
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:58,950
I'm exactly half that. Yeah. Um,

1778
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,480
and anyway, um, so Greg and
I would like, would do gigs,

1779
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:07,470
like when we're a year in and we'd
get paid, you know, to go on the road.

1780
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:08,760
And so we had like a deal,

1781
01:47:08,761 --> 01:47:12,840
like you could do my material to your
materials were really good friends.

1782
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:16,200
So he's like, dude, you're fucking
material is killing in Connecticut.

1783
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:20,010
And he was like serious, like yeah, I
would tell him no that bit that you do.

1784
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:21,510
I did that and fucking Rhode Island.

1785
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:25,520
But it was like it was
parachutes for you guys. Oh yeah.

1786
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:27,450
We really shouldn't have been working.
I mean,

1787
01:47:27,451 --> 01:47:32,400
we're doing comedy a fucking year and
if something went bad it went bad.

1788
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:35,820
You know? Like I'd never recovered.
Never. I mean I can, you know,

1789
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:38,900
you got to have a shit joke and
just bounce back from it. Toto,

1790
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,670
if somebody stumbled through something,
you can bounce back from it.

1791
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:43,560
Back then there was no,
there was no recovery.

1792
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:48,120
I remember opening on a bad joke
and just riding that bad way.

1793
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:53,340
Long set. Yeah. You open bed. Yeah. I
didn't have a way to put it back together.

1794
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:58,040
Yeah, you come out stumbling, you just
never get your balance back. Now you open.

1795
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:00,090
If you open bad, you'd be
like, all right. You know,

1796
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:02,250
it's the one place where you
won't work where you want,

1797
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:04,740
where you won't get booked. He's
just like, I'm not going there.

1798
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:09,320
Like where's the Cleveland
Improv? Well, does

1799
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:15,530
they cultivate a bad audience?
Right. That does happen. It's,

1800
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:19,530
you know what the problem is? It's
the same thing that happened, um,

1801
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:20,970
with Miami did with their,

1802
01:48:20,971 --> 01:48:25,800
with their club is that they used to like
announce that you can get free tickets

1803
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:29,520
here. So like I remember one time
going there working and I was like,

1804
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:32,580
check out this line. This is awesome.
It's going to be, it's going to be great.

1805
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:36,540
And the guy goes here, here for the
free tickets. So like when you're,

1806
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:41,190
when you cultivate this is free. It
just, it, you know, it's, it's, it's,

1807
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:44,820
that's why there's been so good. It
does. But when you just go like, look,

1808
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:48,330
these are $5 tickets, you're making an
investment in your night in the show.

1809
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:52,020
And that changes it. And I think
Cleveland did a lot of that too.

1810
01:48:52,021 --> 01:48:53,340
A lot of like this is free.

1811
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,340
It's the worst thing you could ever
do to a show paper it because then the

1812
01:48:56,341 --> 01:48:59,700
people just start talking. They don't
give a fuck. It doesn't mean anything to,

1813
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,880
they'll get up and leave in
the middle of the show. Yeah.

1814
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:05,530
Nothing invested in it for me. It's
Connecticut. I don't go to Kim. Yeah,

1815
01:49:05,531 --> 01:49:09,570
you told me that. You're telling me
can I can suck my dick the whole state.

1816
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:13,850
The whole state. No, no disrespect to
anybody in Connecticut. Disrespect.

1817
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:18,810
No disrespect. I did it like two times
this year. Yeah. Yeah. All those people,

1818
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:22,860
you know, you know where you live. I
did Yukon. I had a great time at Yukon.

1819
01:49:22,861 --> 01:49:25,930
I did the college. Yeah. A bunch of
people from somewhere else. Yeah,

1820
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:27,760
just stuck in there.
That's true.

1821
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:30,480
If I can guarantee that they'd bus
people in from New York and Boston,

1822
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:35,460
I'd do a show there.
He would never do the Foxwoods Fox.

1823
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:39,400
Where are you most excited about to
go on the store? I like Texas. Well,

1824
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:42,450
I mean I just,
I like going places where it's fun.

1825
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,090
There's something about
Connecticut that's bleak.

1826
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:48,030
There's like a lack of opportunity.
This

1827
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:51,550
is something bleak about it. It's,
it's almost like an illegitimate state.

1828
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,790
It's like a highway between Boston and
New York. That's really what it is.

1829
01:49:54,791 --> 01:49:58,600
And it always feels like that when
you're there just feels weird.

1830
01:49:58,601 --> 01:50:02,680
Like there's a lot, like almost like
there's a sadness that permeates the show.

1831
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:03,520
Even when they laugh.
Like

1832
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:13,690
I love that you hate a place
that much bad sets. They're like,

1833
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:17,440
I hit a lot of places when the cameras
are off, we can talk about them then. Oh,

1834
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:22,830
well Diaz and Ari and I did a show
at Fox woods a few years back and um,

1835
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:25,600
and I told them before I go,

1836
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,510
it was like a Monday and a Tuesday
night because they had a comedy club at

1837
01:50:28,511 --> 01:50:32,200
Foxwoods
comedy club and restaurant.

1838
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,600
I had to put that on my website.
I had a bad,

1839
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:37,810
it's comedy club and restaurant had
called, they make you say an restaurant.

1840
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:40,930
Restaurant. Yeah. And make you make you
on the, on your promos. They're like,

1841
01:50:40,931 --> 01:50:45,310
could you fucking say the full name?
Oh my God. I had a bag when there,

1842
01:50:45,311 --> 01:50:50,230
I had a bad set. That was great. That
was the last time. And I was like,

1843
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:53,260
never again. I told you guys before,
this is probably going to suck.

1844
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,420
And Ari was like,
I knew it was going to suck,

1845
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:59,770
but I didn't know what was going to
saw. I got, yeah, it sucked. It's just,

1846
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,710
it's just the people were,
they wouldn't stop heckling,

1847
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:06,430
they were yelling out during Ari set
yelling out during even Diaz is like,

1848
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:08,170
we just shut the fuck up.

1849
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:12,100
Like yelling at someone thrown
out of there and afterwards,

1850
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:14,140
like some of the staff was like,
so what was going on?

1851
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,790
And the other thing is

1852
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:22,530
bad thing about people don't realize
about casinos is that there's a,

1853
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:27,590
there's an like this total idea that
it benefits any aspect of the casino to

1854
01:51:30,301 --> 01:51:35,130
keep the customer happy regardless
of every other circumstance.

1855
01:51:35,131 --> 01:51:39,420
In other words, somebody is
upset at the restaurant, uh,

1856
01:51:39,450 --> 01:51:42,390
well let's try to make it right because
they're, they're here at the casino.

1857
01:51:42,391 --> 01:51:45,840
We want them to stay happy, keep
getting, they go to a comedy show. Well,

1858
01:51:45,841 --> 01:51:47,460
whatever they're doing, it's
fine. It's like, no, no, no,

1859
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:50,790
whatever they're doing is not fun
because this, this is about the show.

1860
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,120
But the venues point of
view is this is a gambler.

1861
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,770
This is somebody who's
here to spend money.

1862
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:00,690
So we should always acquiesce
to their desires and needs and,

1863
01:52:00,691 --> 01:52:03,070
and don't,
don't do anything to upset them.

1864
01:52:03,071 --> 01:52:06,540
And you're like that how that works
man. Like this is, this is our show.

1865
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,660
My favorite what the Casino Gig.
It's always how they, uh, you know,

1866
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:13,310
you've got the Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding,
Ding. The machine sounds and they're like,

1867
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:17,130
but there's a curtain that separates the
comedy club from the Ding, Ding, Ding.

1868
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:21,370
Denae and you could still hear it like
they actually have a show in Vegas at the

1869
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:25,150
south point. That dirty.
Yeah. Like you're,

1870
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:28,870
you could look out and you see
the casino while you're on stage.

1871
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:31,810
The back of the room.
There's the bar.

1872
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:36,310
I don't want to fucking casinos right
there. Um, it's weird. Can I ask you,

1873
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:40,750
would you ever date your mom?
Uh, definitely not. First of all,

1874
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:43,810
she's older than me. Second
of all, she's my mom. Well,

1875
01:52:44,110 --> 01:52:49,110
why I'm your mom and you're my son
and I if falling in love with him.

1876
01:52:49,610 --> 01:52:52,580
He says, are you really? I said,
yes, I am. He said, you know what,

1877
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:56,570
I was scared to let you know too.
I am too. Both consenting adults.

1878
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,580
If it comes down to it, you know, it's
just like the gays there, there, you know,

1879
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,960
as long as they're over 18 everything's
fine. You know what I mean?

1880
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:09,680
The U s wants to gel them for 18 months
with that'll fix it. They got arrested.

1881
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:12,260
They actually got arrested. Oh well
this should definitely arrest them.

1882
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,170
There's a fuck if you want to
fuck your mom. That's our point.

1883
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:22,970
I don't care. I don't care at
all. But I think it's at the,

1884
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:26,060
he wants to marry his mom.
There comes the legality is a shit.

1885
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:30,950
She got a tattoo on her face. I
said go for it. Go back to her.

1886
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:35,820
Definitely like relaying that. It
is just like the gays, the same.

1887
01:53:35,821 --> 01:53:40,820
Mine is the same, but there's
nothing quite like marrying your mom.

1888
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:45,620
It's very strange though. See
them making out. It's horrendous.

1889
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:48,910
Ever. Get your mom and he said,
what you did your son. I said,

1890
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:52,520
19 years,

1891
01:53:52,521 --> 01:53:55,250
you're the best thing that ever happened
to me and I really want to be with the

1892
01:53:55,251 --> 01:53:56,084
rest of my life.

1893
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,520
Don't be bag of potatoes
Tattoo on her face.

1894
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:06,930
It's just like the gays. Oh, we're
the best thing ever. I asked,

1895
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:11,190
I asked and there's no k in
that. Yeah, that's a tell mom.

1896
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:15,830
There's no doctors that say, I asked
him where's the hurt? Like asked him

1897
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,120
fake. It's so, it's so
crazy. It feels like it,

1898
01:54:20,121 --> 01:54:23,690
but I think it is real because I read
a followup articles about like getting

1899
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:26,690
arrested and everything. So
what do they do? They tell them,

1900
01:54:26,691 --> 01:54:29,690
you got to stop fucking the Gar.
How they do it.

1901
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:33,080
That, yeah, that's true.

1902
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:36,980
But I also feel like if you're fucking
or like you want to get married to your

1903
01:54:36,981 --> 01:54:41,140
mom, like you just stay
inside and don't tell him.

1904
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:43,880
Yeah, it's that they're doing this. See,

1905
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:48,230
that's the problem with today's society
is that everybody has to be out and

1906
01:54:48,231 --> 01:54:51,320
proud about every stupid fucking thing
they're doing. What happened to you?

1907
01:54:51,321 --> 01:54:55,330
A little sense of shame. Keep it inside.
You know, it's fucking weird. Yeah.

1908
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:57,590
It's weird. Yeah. It's
just like what the gays,

1909
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:02,790
the gays,
the gays.

1910
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:11,720
No, no, no, no. There's other gay
people they see that's, it's definitely,

1911
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:14,930
unless you're fucking your dad, it's
different. Well that's different

1912
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:21,440
fantasies.
You do feel guilt or shame around them.

1913
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:27,620
Maybe you've never allowed yourself to
have them because it pink you would be a

1914
01:55:27,621 --> 01:55:31,460
horrible person if you ever went there.
So it's all suppressed.

1915
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:36,260
She went on to say that she started to
masturbate and then thought of everyone

1916
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:39,110
in her family and realize the only
one that turned around was her dad.

1917
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:43,100
She thought about her mom and her son
and all these people and she said,

1918
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,033
didn't do anything for me.

1919
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:47,910
Dad Did. And it also made me think,
it's just like the gays, you know?

1920
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:53,010
Real quick, where are you with
me? When we were, uh, when I did,

1921
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:58,410
I don't know if you were with me that time
when I did. Um, what's it called, Jim?

1922
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:02,190
When it was opie and Jim
and, uh, we watched that.

1923
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:06,480
Were you with me when we watched the
footage of the guy at the car port,

1924
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:11,540
the guy in the garage, the Asian guy.
Jesus. Which one was it? What? What was,

1925
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:13,010
let me see. Oh, did you

1926
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:16,853
this footage?

1927
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:23,680
It's a car backing into a garage,
like a mechanic shop.

1928
01:56:23,681 --> 01:56:28,540
Basically his face while this place he,
does this look familiar or no? Not yet.

1929
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:31,390
I've seen too much. Yeah, that's true.

1930
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:38,320
Did people ask like different,

1931
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:52,013
okay.

1932
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:58,700
Not seen a lot of laughter on
Joe's goes face. I see a lot of

1933
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:04,373
broken

1934
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,540
that dude and Ceca.
How concern his friends are.

1935
01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:15,780
Some happen. Well, yeah. Look,

1936
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:19,740
look at how fucking cold back. I still
don't hear Joe's laughter, you know?

1937
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:24,960
It's not really a too many injuries.
Injuries to me aren't funny.

1938
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:28,290
What's interesting is let's
keep going with this thread.

1939
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:32,850
Why aren't injuries funny? Just like I
see people get fucked up all the time.

1940
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,013
Yeah.
It's called,

1941
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:42,150
that guy's got a broken legs. Broken
hip, like the impact with that,

1942
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:45,940
the cement wall and then the
toolbox and then his legs,

1943
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:48,400
the legs of the soft thing
the legs are going to give.

1944
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:49,390
That's kind of funny though.

1945
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:54,190
The nothing funny about that.
To me. The wait a minute. Wait,

1946
01:57:54,191 --> 01:57:55,870
that's interesting.
What did you just say,

1947
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,130
Joe? That's how funny to me. Yeah,

1948
01:57:58,190 --> 01:58:02,620
me neither because I think we
have empathy or broken legs. Yeah.

1949
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:06,710
His work this out before.
No, I really don't know.

1950
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:10,040
I'm not good with injuries. Really.
Yeah. I always do too many injuries.

1951
01:58:10,041 --> 01:58:12,980
Here's my problem. My
God, I've always laughed.

1952
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,830
I think it's because of my own fear
of them. Probably on some level.

1953
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,910
I've always had a,

1954
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:21,530
like I remember one time
I worked construction in
Florida one summer and one of

1955
01:58:21,531 --> 01:58:22,010
the formulas,

1956
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:25,580
like I had a bathtub dropped on my
neck and I started laughing so hard,

1957
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,780
like tears running down my face.

1958
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:30,860
He had a bathtub dropped in
his and he had a permanent, uh,

1959
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:36,020
morphine pack's sewn into his insight into
is just drip it on his neck. And I go,

1960
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:40,940
oh Jesus. I just laughed and laughed.
I go to stop laughing. So crazy.

1961
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,310
But I mean it's not even

1962
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:46,810
a, it's not a calculated choice
to laugh. It just happens.

1963
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:50,350
That's why I think it's it. It's
cause I, I actually fear it happened.

1964
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:53,890
If it's not calculated, it's just starts
happening. It just started happening.

1965
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:57,400
I can't control myself. I see
so many injuries. That's true.

1966
01:58:57,550 --> 01:59:01,720
You've seen people's heads get bashed
in and you to realize I've probably seen

1967
01:59:01,721 --> 01:59:06,721
more people fuck people up like physically
and fights then maybe almost anybody

1968
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:12,610
who's ever lived. That's probably
true. Upclose yeah, I've called.

1969
01:59:12,611 --> 01:59:16,210
I mean there's probably a few guys that
are closing in on me now. Numbers wise,

1970
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:17,950
other commentators on fights,

1971
01:59:17,951 --> 01:59:22,110
but I've commentated thousands of fights.
Yeah.

1972
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:25,000
Think about that.
All the different concussions.

1973
01:59:25,001 --> 01:59:26,920
I've seen all the different knockouts.

1974
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:28,840
Now here's the funny thing
is that I really don't,

1975
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:33,760
I don't laugh when I see head trauma.
No, no, it doesn't do it to me.

1976
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:38,310
Like leg trauma does it. Leg
screaming. The screaming is like,

1977
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:39,453
it makes me laugh.

1978
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:45,420
Being crushed by the left Pelvic Steevo
did show me this new guy that he's

1979
01:59:45,641 --> 01:59:46,301
working with.

1980
01:59:46,301 --> 01:59:51,301
Steve O's like mentoring some young
psycho who's doing a lot of like jackass

1981
01:59:51,911 --> 01:59:56,911
style Stansa and this kid put on a
speedo and rode a skateboard off of a

1982
01:59:57,941 --> 02:00:02,920
makeshift ramp into a pile of
cactuses. Oh, it was so fucking crazy.

1983
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:06,040
I was watching it. I'm like,
oh my God. Like my whole body.

1984
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:10,180
You know that thing we get when you see
someone about to get in an accident and

1985
02:00:10,181 --> 02:00:13,680
like, yeah, tense adrenaline
pumps through your body and like,

1986
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:17,440
it's almost like you feel like sharp
pointers all over your skin. Yeah.

1987
02:00:17,441 --> 02:00:18,580
That's how I felt when I saw,

1988
02:00:18,581 --> 02:00:23,290
I've watched this kid launches body into
the cactus. No, we saw one last week.

1989
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,030
Uh, remember that, that whole thing

1990
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:32,040
where this dude was trying
to do at Jackass and he and
he tied a rope around his

1991
02:00:32,171 --> 02:00:36,580
nut sack and tied the other end to a
tree and then ran and jumped. Oh No.

1992
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:39,910
The rip his balls off. Yeah, he die. Well,

1993
02:00:39,911 --> 02:00:43,870
I don't know no balls anymore,
man.

1994
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:47,360
It's this,
don't show it to me.

1995
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:49,923
Show it to me.

1996
02:00:58,920 --> 02:00:59,753
Uh,

1997
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:10,240
when I came out dip shit when I came out.

1998
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:11,900
Well,
what did you think was going to happen?

1999
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:18,950
I can't even look at that. I
don't like, I can't see like,

2000
02:01:18,951 --> 02:01:22,880
that doesn't make me laugh at deputies
freaks me out. But do you think that,

2001
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:25,610
I mean,
this is like a cliche thing to say,

2002
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:31,090
but don't you think that that in some
ways is evolution like that there are,

2003
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:35,630
there's dumb people that will
do dumb things and it's almost,

2004
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:40,400
they're supposed to die or lose their
bill. I mean it's, it's kind of symbolic

2005
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,960
that this guy's tying this to his
reproductive organs you're offering.

2006
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:47,720
Maybe it's an unconscious
wish fulfillment.

2007
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:51,380
Like he doesn't want to live to reproduce.
There's something there. I mean, what,

2008
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:53,540
what would be best case scenario there?

2009
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:57,470
It would hurt his balls and they
wouldn't rip off. Yeah, right, right.

2010
02:01:57,530 --> 02:02:00,840
He jumped with a rope tie.
Oh Dude.

2011
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:06,060
Oh my God. Oh my God. God.
Okay. All right. All right. So,

2012
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:11,430
oh my God. Oh my God.
Anything else Jean? Far,

2013
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:16,740
far and no, I mean, I wanted to talk
about your morning farts, but that,

2014
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:17,930
you know,
I got it

2015
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:25,360
and mourning for it as opposed to what
evening farts they different. Well,

2016
02:02:25,361 --> 02:02:29,650
I'm a real, I don't know if you or
I wake up with lots of noises. No,

2017
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:33,530
just all heart horror game.

2018
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:35,750
I'm a symphony and the music

2019
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:40,140
find that your digestive tract and
everything is working better. Excuse me.

2020
02:02:40,141 --> 02:02:42,610
Working better since your diet?
100% yeah.

2021
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:45,910
He used to shit a lot worse
and now it's much better. Yeah.

2022
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:48,210
He used to have like diarrhea every day.
Yeah.

2023
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:50,810
I think he's allergic to
sugar or some reaction

2024
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:54,270
buddy is the one I have. Like
even now, you know, I'll,

2025
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:58,620
I'll be pretty clean for a number
of days or even weeks. I'll be like,

2026
02:02:58,670 --> 02:03:03,670
I'm gonna eat this right now and I'll
indulge in something rich in sugar if

2027
02:03:03,841 --> 02:03:07,620
fucking never agrees with me. Oh, kills
you. Yeah. You got used to it for a while,

2028
02:03:07,621 --> 02:03:09,660
right? Yeah. And now that
you're not used to it,

2029
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,880
your body doesn't know what to do with it.
That's what is this.

2030
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:13,270
I actually found that,
um,

2031
02:03:13,470 --> 02:03:17,150
in a lot of times what I want is
just like a taste of something. Oh,

2032
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:19,920
he's have a bite and I'll be like, I'm
actually, I don't, I used to go like,

2033
02:03:19,950 --> 02:03:24,650
I'll have 70 bytes of that and now it's
like one or two kind of satisfies it.

2034
02:03:24,651 --> 02:03:28,500
Yeah. And then I don't feel sick. Isn't
that Zevs stuff? Fucking amazing dude.

2035
02:03:29,070 --> 02:03:32,400
I love it. Hate it. She needs it. The uh,

2036
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:37,770
the water guy spit it out
when he was throwing water.

2037
02:03:37,771 --> 02:03:41,690
Yeah. Martin Teresa
spit it out and, and uh,

2038
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:43,620
but my theory on it is this though,

2039
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:47,760
as somebody who's like restricting
themselves from sweetness all the time,

2040
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:52,490
it's like an indulgence you can have. Yes.
So it is like, it's, I notice it's a lot,

2041
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:54,420
it's too sweet for a
lot of people's palate,

2042
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:57,900
but you don't know how much sugar there
regularly having other words. For me,

2043
02:03:57,901 --> 02:04:02,190
I feel like it's that, uh, it's like the
free cheat. Right? So you have your z via,

2044
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:03,810
you taste sweetness.
Again,

2045
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:07,020
it sounds, it doesn't bother me
even a little, I enjoy the taste.

2046
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:11,400
I feel like it's too synthetic tasting.
That's what bothers me.

2047
02:04:11,401 --> 02:04:15,980
It's like I liked the Dr Pepper alike
taste, but yeah, I like a loquat.

2048
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:17,550
I'd rather do that. Oh, those are great.

2049
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:19,920
I love those too because
those are so light. Yeah.

2050
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:24,390
We know they have Zevia water where it's
just a good, the tiniest hint of flavor.

2051
02:04:24,391 --> 02:04:27,960
It's more like a loquat. Okay. Right.
Yeah. So they have the cvs soda,

2052
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:31,480
the of v a um, energy drinks
too, which are amazing. Hmm.

2053
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:35,760
Really good. This is so much
better tasting than red bull.
Oh yeah, totally. People,

2054
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:38,100
we get a lot of songs and people send

2055
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,370
in songs they make. Do you
know, like somebody made,

2056
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:46,110
let's go water champ that you said into
a song and they do at least tell the

2057
02:04:46,111 --> 02:04:47,550
audience so I can have pretty good.
Yeah.

2058
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:52,130
That you're impressed with my water
consumption. You're the water champ champ.

2059
02:04:52,131 --> 02:04:55,080
Or as long as I've known you in power,
the water in the water.

2060
02:04:57,290 --> 02:05:01,640
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

2061
02:05:02,210 --> 02:05:05,550
Let's go.
Water chaps catchy pounding the water.

2062
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,090
Water champ out on the water.
The water.

2063
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:18,070
Does that bother you?
You guys are competitive,

2064
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:21,160
are you guys competitive with everything?

2065
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:25,640
Just where it can you guys competitive
with stand up. Zero personality.

2066
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:30,070
Literally zero. Probably. Why we transfer
it into like water and personalities.

2067
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:34,630
So it's never been like,
this is a real argument but like,

2068
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:35,890
but I mean it was,

2069
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:39,250
it was real when we were arguing
initially about who drinks more water.

2070
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:42,680
I thought it was,
no,

2071
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:46,330
I had a doctor telling me I should
stop drinking so much water use.

2072
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,950
What kind of doctor was he? Urologist. He
goes, you're drinking too much. You drink,

2073
02:05:50,951 --> 02:05:52,850
drink far less.
You have to remember she's,

2074
02:05:52,910 --> 02:05:57,490
she's an exaggerator didn't really
tell you to stop drinking was he goes,

2075
02:05:57,491 --> 02:05:59,690
how much are you drinking? And I told
him, he goes, you don't need to do that.

2076
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:03,370
That's a myth. He goes, just drink when
you're thirsty, you're over hydrating.

2077
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:07,450
True Story. Can you over hydrate
though? You can if you go really,

2078
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:12,510
really nuts if you go like look
a radio contest or when we um,

2079
02:06:12,910 --> 02:06:15,910
when we did water cut for the weigh ins,
uh,

2080
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:18,100
I mean I don't know exactly what,

2081
02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:23,130
I know I didn't feel good but I drank
over a gallon of water like during that

2082
02:06:24,011 --> 02:06:26,680
pot.
The last podcast didn't have to pee yet.

2083
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:29,590
I remember that you kept throwing
down the water. We talked about it.

2084
02:06:29,591 --> 02:06:34,060
You had like nine or 10 fucking bottles,
but I mean that's not good.

2085
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,000
Probably my body was
like so craving water,

2086
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:41,020
but you just wanted to win that
running away show. That was a horrible,

2087
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:44,620
that the two or three days leading up
to those weigh ins were just horrible at

2088
02:06:44,621 --> 02:06:45,011
our house.

2089
02:06:45,011 --> 02:06:48,850
I mean he was taking hot baths and then
going into the Jacuzzi and drinking

2090
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:52,480
distilled water and then going to Burke
Williams and doing the sauna and then

2091
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:55,480
there was a lot that he was going to die.
Really did it though.

2092
02:06:55,481 --> 02:06:57,020
That was what was impressive about it.

2093
02:06:57,021 --> 02:07:00,910
It's like you fucking went for like Burt
was kind of pretending to be going for

2094
02:07:00,911 --> 02:07:03,760
it, which is really interesting because
you were talking shit to them and I know

2095
02:07:03,761 --> 02:07:06,370
you're being comedic,
but you were also being honest,

2096
02:07:06,590 --> 02:07:09,370
like this was calling
playing catchup suckers.

2097
02:07:09,910 --> 02:07:12,890
You guys want to buy
into that shit. Yeah. He,

2098
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:17,800
he was trying to catch up at the end
or is you had a sustained effort,

2099
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:20,980
a discipline to effort over
long from the jump off.

2100
02:07:21,010 --> 02:07:24,910
I knew that that would be the two
ways psychologically that we'd go.

2101
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,780
I know from the very beginning that he
had a, you had to deal with his craziness.

2102
02:07:28,781 --> 02:07:29,170
Yes.

2103
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:32,800
That was the thing about crazy and I
even talked to him about that and I said,

2104
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:35,020
the crazies going to help you.
I go,

2105
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,330
you're going to need more than the
crazy I go, because you're crazy.

2106
02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:38,891
He's going to help you,

2107
02:07:38,891 --> 02:07:41,980
but your body can only lose so much
weight over a short period of time. Right.

2108
02:07:42,010 --> 02:07:45,280
So don't think that, because
Tom's not fucking around. I go,

2109
02:07:45,281 --> 02:07:49,390
he's really doing this. So like you can't
just rely on crazy. Yeah. It's like,

2110
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:52,720
I know, I know. I know. I know. I'm all,
I'm only drinking double Tito's and sodas.

2111
02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:56,740
So crazy. It's so crazy. So his videos,

2112
02:07:56,741 --> 02:08:00,610
he's always so drunk that I worry
about him man. Cause he's like, what,

2113
02:08:00,611 --> 02:08:05,470
46 now or something like that. How old
is he? 23. Oh, that's not blow off.

2114
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:11,800
But what's crazy is okay, but
here's the thing, say he's 43.

2115
02:08:12,190 --> 02:08:16,240
You can't do that when you're 50. I
agree. I agree. And you meet Kinda Ken,

2116
02:08:16,241 --> 02:08:17,650
but you're,
you're going to fall apart.

2117
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:21,730
Well you can't if you have those Mickey
mantle jeans. Yeah. That long form DNA,

2118
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:26,200
long strand DNA. Yeah. You, there comes
a point in time where your body is like,

2119
02:08:26,201 --> 02:08:28,930
hey man, you can't do this
every day. I know. It's enough.

2120
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:33,660
He does have an incredible
standing, uh, to, uh,

2121
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:36,070
the, the ability, you know,

2122
02:08:36,071 --> 02:08:40,480
like I'm admittedly not a party guy man.

2123
02:08:40,481 --> 02:08:43,570
Like if I have a few drinks and I'm 38,

2124
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:49,060
I mean I feel it for days. He has that.
Like, he's just like, what, let's go out.

2125
02:08:49,061 --> 02:08:50,710
And I'd be like, dude, like when we,

2126
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:55,240
when you say very graciously sent us to
go watch the calves and warriors play

2127
02:08:55,241 --> 02:08:58,450
for, for doing the weight
loss thing, you know, I mean,

2128
02:08:58,451 --> 02:09:01,600
we were like drinking in the morning
and I was like, I got to go take a nap.

2129
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:06,750
He was like, I'll go to the bar
too low. And I just, you know, I,

2130
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:12,100
I took a nap and like, I mean, I had
to like really pace myself by the way.

2131
02:09:12,101 --> 02:09:16,720
It was whatever came out of that
with Ari. Ari, uh, well as, I mean,

2132
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:20,840
people know now he's, he was
gone for a long time. He, uh,

2133
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:25,690
finally came back from his, uh,
his vision quest and four months,

2134
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:29,100
four months off, I'm going, no, right.

2135
02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:33,570
85% of it was to avoid his
debt with you guys. But he, uh,

2136
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:36,340
as long as they just don't have an
email or don't answer her phone,

2137
02:09:36,341 --> 02:09:41,110
he said that he did a podcast. He
opened up by saying it was because, uh,

2138
02:09:41,190 --> 02:09:45,130
Tom's tastes or so outrageous
though he snacks on caviar.

2139
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:48,590
Yeah. So it's pretty funny. It
was pretty, it was very funny.

2140
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:51,040
His podcast coming back was hilarious.
Very funny.

2141
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:55,700
And he was actually even joking around
that. That was why man. Um, he's like,

2142
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:59,560
he called me, he goes, all right, where
do you, where do you want to go? And I go,

2143
02:09:59,561 --> 02:10:01,690
I don't know. He's like, I've
got to fucking do something.

2144
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:06,370
Like I get like a hundred tweets a day.
Like pay you already took care of it,

2145
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:09,750
dude. I, I told him I go, I don't,
there's no, I don't want to go fine.

2146
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:13,870
But he was like, oh take you
somewhere. Well he fucked up when it,

2147
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:17,870
when it happened at the time you're
supposed to step up then. Yeah,

2148
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:23,020
he was trying to figure
it out of it. Yeah. He was
trying to, you know, 0.1, two,

2149
02:10:23,021 --> 02:10:27,190
five things shorter. I'm like, all
right man. Yeah. Well what was his, his,

2150
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:30,610
his argument, the BMI.
He was like, he's like,

2151
02:10:30,611 --> 02:10:34,370
well BMI wise you're not actually six
feet, you're five and eight tenths.

2152
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:36,300
So your actual BMI to get out of that,

2153
02:10:36,301 --> 02:10:41,180
it had to be if you were an inch taller
or no, they said 25 pounds. Right. Dude,

2154
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:44,810
it was kind of write it down on
paper with him. I know, I know.

2155
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:49,850
I learned my lesson. There's
some other crazy shit he
say. No, I'll tell you later.

2156
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:55,730
Dump dump
now.

2157
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:59,300
All right, we should, we should,
we should wrap this up. So, um,

2158
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:03,600
is there anything else you have? Okay. All
right. Uh, thank you for coming Joe. Yeah,
