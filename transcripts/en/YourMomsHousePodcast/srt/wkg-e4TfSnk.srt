Oh your jeans up.

85
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,160
Broward Sheriff's office says Wilson
and the man got into a verbal over her

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,150
quote farting loudly.
Boys want to see that on TV?

87
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,710
Fall in line.

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,310
And that is when she pulled a knife and
threatened the man before leaving the

89
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,144
store.

90
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,653
Don't bring it

91
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,350
to your mom.
So

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,130
I got it.
I got to

93
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,360
tell you right now. I got to tell
you, I get it. I kinda like the Armos,

94
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,370
the Greeks,
the guineas,

95
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:33,150
the blacks had been wearing these Valore
tracksuits for years and the Hungarians.

96
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,150
Momo, the crime demo. You
got me one? Yeah, I'm wearing
it right now. It's great.

97
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:41,670
Right? It's really comfortable. Yeah.
Can I tell you? Oh, I get it. Yeah.

98
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,520
And nothing makes me happier.
If you want to get me any gift,

99
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,530
anytime the Nova Lore tracksuit me, it's
so soft. It's the fucking bomb. Right.

100
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,500
The ease of it. The parents. Yes.
Easy to take on and off this.

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,170
Aw. Yeah, I'm jealous.
I kinda, I want one.

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,870
The problem with the ladies versions, they
always make them too tight. Oh, right.

103
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,130
I'm saying like sexy. Juicy. Yeah,
but you want it loose and comfy. Yes.

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,100
I may have to get like a men's comfort.
Comfort over. Yeah, of course the,

105
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:14,370
but I'm so happy that you're filing on
board with the velocitor showed up with

106
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:17,750
one yesterday. No, I've been trying to
ease you into this shift for 14 years.

107
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,380
What does it take is fine. I
just put it on. I mean, what a,

108
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,170
there wasn't hard to convince me.
I know,

109
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,600
but I feel like I've bought you
these things over the years.

110
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,580
Haven't not full full Valore. I just know.
You know why I felt like it was time.

111
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:33,540
You're ready for it. Why? I don't
know. I feel like now that your dad,

112
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,460
your father of two, yeah, you're
officially in dad mode. You're like,

113
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,700
yeah, I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

114
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,860
And I wore my three stripe
just to commemorate.

115
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,660
I feel like we're in it to get where
we're like total eastern blockers now.

116
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,070
We are.
Um,

117
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,570
so this lady farted and then all the
knife on somebody or for talking about her

118
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:55,950
fart.
That crazy.

119
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,350
Really wild out of flatulence and a
Florida store leads to police making a

120
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:05,800
stranger rest. It's a lot of
purple Chanetta Wilson notion.

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,510
Their Shahada,

122
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,800
she was arrested for aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon after she pulled a

123
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:15,780
knife on a man who was offended when she
allegedly passed gas while waiting in

124
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:19,590
line. So she farted somebody
who was like, Hey, do you mind?

125
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,950
And then she pulled a knife on him.
Fuck you off far one on one a fart.

126
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,180
The Broward Sheriff's office says awesome.
And the man got into a verbal dispute.

127
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:31,680
Oh her, her quote, farting
loudly. Boys on to say that on TV.

128
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,960
Tang loud. And that is when she pulled a
knife and threatened the mandible there.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,600
Laughter here. Yes, I
did. Far Tang and loud.

130
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,820
Loud
play it again.

131
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,170
Yeah, it was great. Far
tarting. Loudly. Farting.

132
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,240
Loud. Loud. Why did she get
of a flatulence by the way,

133
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,530
such a Dick. I have.
Usually when they only,

134
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,780
if there's a fart story involved.

135
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Does the anchor person ever say like
there's the person when their image comes

136
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:13,800
up like she did, she was like,
they're like, they never do that.

137
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,590
Well because it's fart related.
They're like, there she is.

138
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,800
She's mocking the credit.
She's a serious crime though.

139
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,770
She pulls a knife on
fucking aggravated assault.

140
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:27,540
Of course they're Chanetta. They're
shutting you tick. Yeah. We know.

141
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,990
Like our son now, our oldest son
is going Yay. Just out of nowhere.

142
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:41,770
It was yes. Forever.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Jeez.

143
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,470
Like your lunch. Yay. He sounds
like the guy from sexy beast. Yeah.

144
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,580
Yeah. He's um, loud.

145
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,350
It's like someone learning
to say the word loudly.

146
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,230
Farting, loud. Farting, farting, loud.

147
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,383
Loud.

148
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,220
I fart loudly.
A lot in public.

149
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,540
I can't hold them in any more after
two children cause I, you know,

150
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,870
when you have a vaginal birth it
kind of loosens everything up. Yeah,

151
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,480
that's pretty wild.
You're, uh, your farts.

152
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,770
It's really been so hard to look at you
because you've been cutting your own

153
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,400
hair. Hey, let's talk about it. It's
terrible. Let's talk about what happened.

154
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,450
So I want to post the
photographs on my Instagram,

155
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:37,710
the Christina piece so you guys can see
what I'm dealing with. So last night,

156
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,800
is it the Christina?
I do the Christina

157
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,800
there.
Shanana

158
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,390
it's the Christina p instead
of the worst social media.

159
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,900
Any huddles.
I was relaxing last night.

160
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,720
You always did this to me when
I'm like having my glass of wine,

161
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:01,890
I'm chilling down.
You come downstairs and you're like,

162
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,330
you're bald. You look like
Bruce Willis. And I'm like,

163
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,120
what the fuck did you do to yourself?
Because you,

164
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,360
you've been cutting your
own hair with your clippers.

165
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,250
I get impatient and impulsive and I
just, sometimes I just, here's the thing,

166
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,050
because my balding is in the front.

167
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,520
What happens is like when you take it
down all the way, you're like, cool,

168
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:27,060
it's this, this, this is how it
should be. As it starts to grow out,

169
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,920
what stands out is that the
front center is obviously thin,

170
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,810
so it stands out that, oh, everything else
is getting longer, starts to look bad.

171
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,380
Sometimes it'll be like a second or
third time. You look in the mirror like,

172
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:43,140
I got to do something about
it now. Oh, I see. So what?

173
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,440
What's happening is because
I don't mind that, that you,

174
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:49,470
you're cutting your hair short. It's
just that you're doing it, like you said,

175
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,290
impulsively in poor lighting at night,
so you're not,

176
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
you're missing a lot of spots.

177
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,430
You're not really doing a good
job. Yeah. You, why not wait?

178
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,470
Because Alan's coming over tomorrow.

179
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,580
He's going to be in your house and he
can do your hair properly. First of all,

180
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:08,550
I didn't know Ellen was
coming over. I didn't make an
appointment with him. Right.

181
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,300
I just saw what happened was I saw how
thick. Okay, so I start to see that.

182
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,020
Then I start to see how thick the beard
gets. My beard will get really thick.

183
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm also going to post that on Instagram,
on the Christine and p.

184
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:24,640
You guys can see what I saw in the bowl
when I went to go brush my teeth the

185
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,960
other day. Half your dirty disgusting
whiskers. We're in the ball. It's,

186
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,170
well let me ask you,
I understand you take half of it now but,

187
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:35,740
but the thought it doesn't occur to
you like maybe I should maybe clean the

188
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:39,420
whiskers. I did. I did.
Eventually eventually it did.

189
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,530
If you go look in the sink,
it's clean.

190
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,320
It doesn't make you sick to
leave it there. And initially,

191
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,450
not initially because I'm not done yet.

192
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,780
Do what happened was I did a pass on
the beard and then I came downstairs and

193
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,830
then I was like Ah, I got to do
the head note. Went back upstairs.

194
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,670
I think you saw it in between the two.
Then I did the head, then I cleaned up.

195
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,600
It was an all day thing cause I was in
the afternoon or the kind of afternoon.

196
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,310
No, no, no, it was both were
in the evening. Oh, okay. Okay.

197
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:12,311
You said you didn't notice the beard
until you like I'm saying my beard change

198
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,130
until you notice the head
change, so, right. So what you,

199
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,960
you call me upstairs and I'm already
been drinking so I'm by drinking,

200
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:23,730
I mean I have my one glass of
wine palm juice nosedive too.

201
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,240
And so that's when you hand me
the clippers and you're like,

202
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,260
can you clean me up? And I'm like, Hey,
no, because the lighting's terrible.

203
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:35,950
It's nighttime be, I'm
already a little bit, yeah.

204
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,750
Sauced yeah. Okay. Uh,

205
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,620
three I don't cut hair professionally.

206
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,860
I can't do anything better than what
you're amazing is how badly you have

207
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:51,710
adapted to just neck trimming over years.
Like I have neck

208
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,890
and on my neck tremor, you know,
it's just one of these like little,

209
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,310
the trimmers, you know, I mean
a wall or something, tremor.

210
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,020
And you still hold it backwards
and the wrong way. I'm like, look,

211
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,060
it's either like this or like this.

212
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,520
And I give it to you and I always
see you go the wrong way. I'm like,

213
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,720
how many times am I going to ask you?
Because every time you ask me to do it,

214
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm already been drinking or it's
bedtime and you're pulling me out of bed.

215
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,250
You pulled me out of bed last time,
eight months pregnant to do it,

216
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,390
nine months pregnant. And, and then you
got mad at me that I didn't do a good job.

217
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,010
I was tired, I was almost
asleep. And you're like, come
trim my hair. Well anyways,

218
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:35,570
so last night I go and I look at
your head and I see it in the end,

219
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,930
the damn bathroom light.
And I'm like,

220
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,720
you got to see what you've
been walking around with brow.

221
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,640
Well block it around for an hour,
but still it's bad enough.

222
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:45,670
And I take a photo chunks,
just long shocks,

223
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,750
patchy scrap.

224
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,040
And then I'm looking at your beard now

225
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,930
and it's not good. I gotta be
honest because listen, just listen,

226
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,830
it's patchy as fuck on the sides.
And then when,

227
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,780
and then you left a Brussels beard,
like a schnauzer beard down here.

228
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,330
So this is, it looks like
a goatee. Good. It looks,

229
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,560
it looks like you cut a goatee on
your beard. It doesn't look good.

230
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:16,640
People like it. Nobody likes
it compliments all day to
day. It looks terrible.

231
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,810
It looks so good. And how the fuck did
you do this? You did this with your dog.

232
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,830
Clippers with your head clippers. You do
this with your beard. No head clippers.

233
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,650
I just threw on a different garden. Went.
Yeah. It shows that you just read judges.

234
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,440
You just Willy Nilly you wiggled
your rest around and that,

235
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,510
that looks awesome.
Yeah.

236
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Well I'm a tell Alan the clean that
beard up me really fucked that shit up.

237
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,030
I did not really fuck that shit up com.

238
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,860
It looks like you look like
good morning Julia and the Frat.

239
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,250
I don't look like Joe.
You've got the,

240
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,260
it's like a long schnauzer beard in
the front. My flower, my every Tang.

241
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,370
Me You yesterday.
I can't stop thinking about him.

242
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,290
It's amaze. I can't stop thinking
about Joe. Come on and Julia,

243
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,390
you yesterday.
Meet me my soon to be my everything.

244
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,740
My soon to be my
everything. My flower. Ah,

245
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,410
the kiss is just the worst.

246
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,560
Um, me, you, well, a couple
of things. First of all,

247
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:25,790
don't go back to your boyfriend.

248
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,900
We didn't do this on the podcast because
I didn't know if it would be a bad idea

249
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,330
to do on the podcast because
of the reach of the podcast,

250
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,930
which is we held a screening for
instant family in thousand oaks.

251
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,600
Let me, first of all, my husband
is very humble and sweet.

252
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,850
Let me tell you what my
husband really is saying,

253
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,450
that when the oak park shooting
happened and then the fires happened,

254
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,570
it was horrible.

255
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And my husband bought out a theater so
that people could go see instant family.

256
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:02,441
You buy it up all the tickets so that
we could host a free screening for the

257
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,780
Community of Oak Park. That's what you
did, Tommy. Cause you're a sweet man.

258
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,130
Thank you. Um, what I was trying
to say was that I did not do that.

259
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm just being fair here. What I was
saying was that I would charge people dub.

260
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,900
I've, what I did was I wanted to do
it in that community, but I, I, um,

261
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,130
I only announced it on social media
cause I didn't know if we did it on the

262
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:25,490
podcast.
You have a limited number obviously,

263
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:30,110
of tickets for a movie screening. Right.
And if I announced it on the podcast,

264
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,380
I didn't want like too many people to
show up and be disappointed because I felt

265
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:40,250
like the podcast response
would be even crazier.

266
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,360
I just announced it on Instagram,
Twitter,

267
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,620
and Facebook and we held it
on Sunday and people came out.

268
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,040
They were extremely

269
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,570
nice and grateful and so many mommy's
such a respectful audience. And you know,

270
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,450
most of them came up to me and told me
they enjoyed the movie and the movie's a

271
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:04,630
well done movie for the, uh, for sure.

272
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,520
Like a family kind of came on the screen.
Everybody clapped.

273
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,450
But that was very funny. People would
clap when my name would come up,

274
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,870
when I would walk on swear. They were
like, Whoa, that's very funny. Um,

275
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,300
but thank you guys for coming out.
I really enjoyed doing that. Um,

276
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,660
it was very fun actually. Uh, we had
our friends kind of weight. Yeah.

277
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,500
Cousin Bree. Bree came, Ryan
sickler sickle cell was there.

278
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,000
Who Stavo who plays a horn and your
movie was there and Rena and Matt. Yeah.

279
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:36,960
That was really fun. That was a good time.
Um, what else did I want to tell you? Oh,

280
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,920
this other thing,
I mean has taken off.

281
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,870
If you don't know over the
weekend, Garth's, Notre Dame

282
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,820
for fuck's sake. You're just
going to walk into this. So

283
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,590
many, there's so many. First of all,

284
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,400
when he was saying as the week
was building up, Holy Shit,

285
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,090
his Instagram is over.

286
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,570
I didn't realize there was one
thing where I did where I go,

287
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,070
I opened one of his posts and I go,
I want to scroll through the comments,

288
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:12,810
see how long it takes to see a non
related comment.

289
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,700
I couldn't find, it was just like scroll,
Scroll, Scroll through. I was like,

290
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,420
Geez. I was like 50 comments in
nothing to do with him. You know

291
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,220
about our show and the people
who listen to us. Yeah. Is this

292
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,310
the best? Number one, there's nothing
that compares fun. We have a common,

293
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,540
we have a common target here. Come
here. All right, so here's an idea.

294
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,410
So you post this about
his Christmas music thing.

295
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,850
Miss your wood here was like, there's
nothing bad spending Christmas together,

296
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:51,330
right? And then you
open it up. Hey Hitler,

297
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,320
will you guys be performing the classmate
Christmas song machines within? If not,

298
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:58,350
you guys should try it out. Keep
them high and tight, right? No,

299
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,510
there actually is real common,
sweetest couple ever.

300
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,520
Then it says keep it high and tight.
Hashtag dedication.

301
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,870
You are not Gareth and Trish
doesn't look like either. Um,

302
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,890
so that's one there.

303
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,580
Now here's his Notre Dame post gene,
high and tight. You want to move in?

304
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:21,890
You could move it a try it
out. Oh my God. It's just like,

305
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,690
it's relentless fans of the podcast.
I listened to troll Garth Brooks.

306
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,940
I was starting to pick up,
started to pick it up.

307
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,310
Open your heart to me in your arms.
Just like Joe, you don't need lube.

308
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:39,210
You need to spit.
Oh my God.

309
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,960
You don't need, you don't need spit.
Yeah, that's right. Um, here's his head.

310
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,100
All you post. Well, it's official.
We're on Facebook. I told,

311
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,300
Gee, and he didn't believe me. He believes
me. Now it's just endless. It is endless.

312
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,030
I mean, every post to every
single post is like this God,

313
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:02,830
what the fuck is going on here? This girl
wrote, what is going on? I'm confused.

314
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:06,710
Physical four strokes. What the
fuck? And then someone wrote,

315
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,880
he just wanted a poop through a hammock.
I said, why not? It's just like the gays.

316
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,050
That's their explanation to someone
who was like, what's going on here?

317
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,790
Are you planning to release B side
version of this album with just Trish

318
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,200
blasting carts into the mic?

319
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,960
And by the way, every time I've
seen, uh, cause I follow him,

320
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,280
I'll just, every time a new
post comes up, within seconds,

321
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,380
it's completely,
completely

322
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,420
just getting pummeled. Piss
on me, beat me, try it out.

323
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,280
Or asking them, how often do you miss
your would go full throttle. Jesus.

324
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,630
Yeah.
It's endless.

325
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,950
If you really want to be
amused by who is Julia?

326
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,840
Good Morning Juliet.

327
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,710
I could see you use your lung
disease as an instrument,

328
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,080
maybe even playing machines
within for the mommies.

329
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,120
How you're only takes forester.

330
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,670
Somebody wrote $100 as
Garth is a ball hall.

331
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,980
I'm not sure what that means.
I like the interaction though,

332
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:13,070
like the confusion.
Oh my God,

333
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,173
God,

334
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,010
I got friends and mom's places where
the jeans are tight and Burt is racist.

335
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,630
That's hilarious. Yeah, so if you
really want to have a good time,

336
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,000
check that out. Oh God,
no. But it's just, it gets,

337
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:38,320
so that's just the beginning of my
last few days with Garth on Instagram.

338
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,190
So he's been promoting that CBS
concert that aired on Sunday night.

339
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,240
And let me just say it was
the most unnatural video.

340
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,670
Do you have that one? Can
you pull that one up? Oh,

341
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,310
the one where he like introduces that.
He's doing a concert.

342
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,360
We're going to fill this up.

343
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,620
[inaudible]

344
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,590
here's my room again before anyone.

345
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,810
Garth Brooks is undoubtedly talented and
he makes millions of people happy with

346
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:20,350
what he does. We're not crapping on
this guy, his talent or anything,

347
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,850
but the social media component needs
to be managed where he's like, can you,

348
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,550
can you believe this work?
We're going to feel this.

349
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,020
Oh, it kills me is the fake, the
fake humble pie of it. Like, well,

350
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,180
we're going to, we're
going to feel it. Like,

351
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,660
of course you are your agent book to you
in an arena tour because you're going

352
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:46,100
to sell all these tickets, asshole.
He was doing all this promo

353
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,270
for this, uh, you know, cause it was a
seep televised event. Let's be crazy.

354
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,140
And I saw him doing this interview where
he was like, well first, uh, you know,

355
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,520
you're scared because a, you're like,
are we going to even be able to sell it?

356
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,820
May tickets. And he goes, and then it
sold out in an hour and you're like,

357
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:05,510
so you're like, you dick, like so nervous.

358
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,770
But then an hour later it was all sold
out. Well, it's the, yeah, the fake.

359
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:14,300
Like I just can't, I don't know if we're
going to be just happy anyone showed up.

360
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,310
Just humble pie.
He's not the,

361
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,760
the number one entertainer of course,
in the world right now.

362
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,500
Yeah. That's such weird ever held at
legendary Notre Dame stadium. Yeah.

363
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,640
I got friends in Notre Dame stadium.
Oh boy.

364
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,980
Five at Notre Dame to
knock after a 60 minutes.

365
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,950
And the thing is too,
like it doesn't,

366
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:41,940
he have other highly successful
songs other than I've got
friends. Oh yeah, yeah,

367
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:44,640
yeah. I think that's, that's
the, that's his anthem.

368
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,040
That's the same joke over is that yeah,

369
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:51,900
I've got friends in Notre Dame
stadium. Yeah. Well they have to do,

370
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,850
it's so weird too because
you imagine like his, uh,

371
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,700
his fans obviously like his hardcore fans.

372
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,140
I think that's a hilarious, that's a
funny joke. Sure. Yeah. They're like, Huh.

373
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,930
Cause he's got a song called,
I got friends

374
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,080
the agile,
see he did a joke about it like that.

375
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,213
Huh?

376
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,450
What's this richer reminding you to
tune into CBS is Sunday a Sunday eastern

377
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,730
seven central. Right. Don't
miss live at Notre Dame.

378
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,080
Garth Brooks is going to be fine. Gold.
Yeah. He just doesn't know how to do it.

379
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,870
Hey everybody, I just going to
tell you, hey, he's so awesome.

380
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,350
He's a great performer. Yeah. Amazing.
Just like a weird social media guy. Yeah.

381
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,960
Really, really weird. Really. And

382
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,920
how are we going?
Are we going to fill this up?

383
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,610
But the thing that we all suspected

384
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,970
is actually true.

385
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,240
That's the last time you're ever going
to see him perform a concert because

386
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:57,780
apparently it's all over.
It's all over. Okay.

387
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,460
Because this came out this morning. Oh,
okay. This was on the news this morning.

388
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,810
Okay.
You want to see it all right?

389
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,290
Yeah. I'm, I'm upset. I'm upset already.

390
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,110
I don't know what to expect down
opposite Garth Brooks in this interview.

391
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:13,460
I want her and what he would tell me how
hard it would be to get him to discuss

392
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:17,900
his horrific crimes. What I found
was that he was very forthcoming.

393
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,050
He volunteered details that
may be difficult to hear.

394
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,920
I began by asking what he wanted
from the men he picked up.

395
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,523
Yeah.

396
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,170
It's hard to comment on anything
they do because if you do that,

397
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,320
then you got to comment on the fact that
yes, you do have three arms. I mean,

398
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,670
just don't want to show the other one.

399
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,960
That's why you count them.

400
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm the last guy that wants to see it
over. The greatest part is the fun of it.

401
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,370
Good. Um, you know, your time
comes when your time goes. It

402
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,160
was two years ago in this apartment

403
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,000
in Milwaukee,

404
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,920
police discovered the grizzly remnants
of one of the most horrible crime sprees

405
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:53,520
in American history.
Confessed that he had seduced,

406
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,640
murdered and dismembered 17 young men.

407
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,150
He even ate some of his victim's body
parts. That was not my first choice.

408
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:03,970
Basically, I wanted somebody that was
thin and beautiful and lots of hair.

409
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,180
There it is. Wow. We knew
it. We knew it all along.

410
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,610
It's surprising, but not surprising. Not
Surprising. He is a deadly psychopathic.

411
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:17,560
Of course.
Of course.

412
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:21,400
Who made that one magnum meme
one I think nagged a meme.

413
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,530
I don't know if the one is there. Look,
look for me. Yeah. Wow. Great job.

414
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,460
Exposing the truth, but
a psycho, that guy is,

415
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,110
he really has killed a lot
of people. Kid Ness. Um,

416
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,050
that was so funny. Yeah.
No, it's just no one. It's a
magnum underscore me. My, okay.

417
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,830
My Instagram again,

418
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:45,790
I'll be reposting all the ones that
roll in because I posted the initial,

419
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,310
one of his horrible cvs and then I
requested people make their own and remix

420
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:53,950
them. We can't often play
it all because of the song,

421
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,560
but I can post them on social.
So here you go.

422
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,690
God Damn God damn be posting
Tom's horrific hair, hair pics.

423
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,990
I did a good job. No, I did a good job.

424
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,290
How are we going? How are we going
to fill this big old, big old arena?

425
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,700
You know some people aren't so happy that
we tease Garth. Did you know that? Oh,

426
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:20,140
I bet. I bet. Kind of upset. Okay,

427
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,040
well,
well sometimes Sagora right?

428
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:31,110
Vernon Brooks to third of the Garth
called me up last night was talking shit.

429
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,780
You speak fucking funny man.
Messing with our ticket sales.

430
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,970
Well, Tom Jagger ruined your
wife, Christina passage and

431
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm going to tell you right now,

432
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,000
I've got a jar of peanut butter bag
full of broken glass. I'm a duck,

433
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,440
my knuckles. Then finally time
second, look at me. I'm shaking.

434
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:57,530
I'm so pissed off right now. I've
got Kim, don't tell me how tank.

435
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,820
I've got to get this dumb bitch time.
Sandra miss with my uncle.

436
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,260
He left two tickets sales last week.
Tickets up down.

437
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,830
Ain't nobody coming to the big
ass mother fucker stadium tour.

438
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,570
The town stagger keeps on running
his mouth. People are getting,

439
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,530
so I'm going tell you one time time.

440
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:22,300
Sagora you won't meet me a dark alley
or you could close your mouth about my

441
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,134
uncle Garth.

442
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,210
He's a good man with trees are so
sad and got a lot of fucking money.

443
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,540
Piss me off. No more tabs. Sagora

444
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,450
come on over pissing my mouth.
Try it out, mother fucker.

445
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,910
This guys familiar.
He's the same guy that did Billy.

446
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,190
Good Morning Juliet
and he was all battered

447
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,000
up and ray, the black guys related
to Garth. But he's right. No,

448
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,250
this is Garth's cousin. Yeah,
that's pretty wild. Dam. Yeah. Sad.

449
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,770
Gra. Yeah. This is so bananas.

450
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:57,730
What do you think people love so
much about Garth Brooks? What is it?

451
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,930
He must be just, it must be just
dynamite fucking shows. I have to be,

452
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,400
I've heard people say that the live,
the live shows amazing. They, oh,

453
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,910
well you have to like the music
first by country, right. His country.

454
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,240
And then I see that he has a girls and
like cheerleading outfits and they're

455
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:19,080
shooting off guns of
stuff in that CBS train.

456
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,270
That's cheerleaders probably cause
it's at Notre Dame stadium. Oh, right.

457
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:27,370
So I imagine that's part of the fun. Yeah.
Probably special for that. But I mean,

458
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,220
generally speaking,
he just puts on a crazy show.

459
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,230
He sells out more than like lady
Gaga. Uh, that's a good question.

460
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,990
I Dunno. I really don't know. I mean,

461
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:42,010
I know the weirdest thing to me is that
he's huge in Ireland. That's bizarre.

462
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,540
Like huge. Yeah. He's, he's
so fucking famous over there.

463
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,200
I'm like Ireland. Really. I don't, I
don't get it. Lady Gaga is, you know,

464
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,850
definitely international superstars. So
who knows. But there definitely both.

465
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:55,684
Monsters

466
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,990
gave me so much joy is the
weird his weirdness. Uh, last
week, you know, we had the,

467
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:02,824
um,

468
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:08,110
the guy who told you that, like, you,

469
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,310
you make my eyes a telescope.
Yeah. Yeah. The homeless guy.

470
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,800
He wasn't homeless. The horsey it,
what are you talking about? Hey,

471
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:19,630
that guy's not normal. What?
No. Why would you say that?

472
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,640
Because he looks homeless. What's,
no, he's definitely homeless. Tommy.

473
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,760
I think I was not home.
He's like a doctor or something.

474
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,060
I don't know if he was a
doctor, a lawyer, a lawyer.

475
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,630
Was it last week or was
it the week before? Uh,

476
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:37,720
it's been the council for you remember
this guy? He's my now he's super weird.

477
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,030
You, uh, yeah.

478
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,380
Uh Huh.
Because honestly,

479
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:51,010
there's really nothing that compares a
black dude spitting game. Like they're,

480
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,990
they're the ultimate, right.
Well, for sure. Puerto Ricans to,

481
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,060
yeah. I don't know. I think, I think
brothers were the number one. So Geez,

482
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,680
we have a segment now,
this black dude spitting game.

483
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,400
Right.

484
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,233
So,

485
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,740
so, um, because it's just, there's
so many great videos of this.

486
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,930
I haven't seen this yet, just so you
know, a lot of times, a lot of times,

487
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,120
neither one of us has seen we're,

488
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,920
we're seeing it the first
time you're seeing it.

489
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,160
So I think some people think
that like there are times, yeah,

490
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:41,630
there are times where I'll see a and that
I just want to like surprise you with

491
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:46,430
it. But most of the time I haven't seen
the videos and just let me be clear here.

492
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,970
You're running under the assumption that
it's black guys who spent the most of a

493
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,120
folder for me. Oh. And
it just says that, well,

494
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:56,810
it doesn't say that black guys usually
split the most game saying that this is a

495
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:59,600
video about that. Oh, Gotcha. Okay.

496
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,190
Claiming racially that they had the
best game. Well that is what I'm saying.

497
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,630
The video that I'm hoping supports that.
I'll see it.

498
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,010
Another thing to point out quickly,

499
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,390
stop fucking sending videos that
you want on the show to anywhere,

500
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:17,540
but the email address. Oh,
right. I'm not going to open it.

501
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,200
I don't watch them on Instagram.
If you sent it to me on Facebook,

502
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:24,440
if you send it to me on Twitter. No,
that's why we have an email address.

503
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,320
We have a producer that reads
these and watches these.

504
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,180
So if you want it to play on the show,

505
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,450
your mom's podcast@gmail.com there's
no house in that email address.

506
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,980
Send it to my personal email to stuff
for the show. We don't play it. I don't,

507
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,550
you know,

508
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,230
I think one out of 50 of those will make
it like a half to happen to open it and

509
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,740
want it to move it forward. Just send it
to him if he wanted to play on the show.

510
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,000
All right,
here you go.

511
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,200
[inaudible]

512
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,470
well I will say this, that doesn't
necessarily support what I was going for.

513
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
A this guy is like mouth to mouth really
close and the cording himself kind of

514
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,700
whispering or singing I will
say doesn't have the best teeth.

515
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,660
Um, and which kind of is a
distraction about it cause he,

516
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,510
oh he has them but there's
like they're not all there one.

517
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,500
The ones that are there like candy,
corn

518
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,990
cousin.
But I love you.

519
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,830
Okay. A couple of things.
This is not spitting game.

520
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:05,540
This dude is just singing along to a song.
He has four teeth,

521
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,190
three are a different color, top teeth.
So he might have some more bottom you. Um,

522
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,660
but she's really into it. She
is really, she really digs it.

523
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,380
Summarize cares what we think. Exactly.
Smell. He thinks he's the best.

524
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:22,250
They can't smell good. That mouth. Can't
Smith's a bad mouth. That is a bad mouth.

525
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,450
But are you, are you really objecting to
the blanket statement? Black dudes spit.

526
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,080
Here's the deal and here's,
here's why.

527
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm just wanting to challenge it a
little bit cause I feel like Puerto Rican

528
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:37,200
guys are up there too.
Where you think they got it from pro?

529
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:42,180
The black guys of course. Okay. You think
they train has seminars and they train.

530
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,580
It wasn't a seminar. Just they
just picked up on it. Black.

531
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:49,530
There's definitely split the most game.
Yeah, of course. That's true. Yeah.

532
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,840
Because here's the difference.
I find that like when I was a single lady,

533
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:56,530
like I'd be walking through a parking
lot just at like the grocery store. Yeah.

534
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,180
And a black dude would yell at me from
like across the parking lot like sub girl

535
00:36:01,181 --> 00:36:02,980
and like what's our bread or whatever.

536
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:05,140
I got I red red hair or
whatever your hair color is.

537
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:06,210
That's how they would yell at him.

538
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,373
Sure.

539
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,180
And then they start talk talking shit
like how you know across a parking lot the

540
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,200
Latino guy might,

541
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,230
Latino guy might actually want to be
face to face interaction different degree

542
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,200
later. Yeah. Of Skill. Just
like in any sport. Yeah.

543
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,190
I mean the guy that yelled, hey
red, he might be an amateur. Right.

544
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,520
Or you put a professional in front of
you. Sure you pay. These are coming off.

545
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,220
Sure. Okay. Oh Shit.

546
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,040
Ah.

547
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,600
Oh God.

548
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,750
His mouth is so bad.

549
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,640
There's like there's also rotten parts.
Yeah.

550
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,500
He has like dump gum decay and
Ah, ah. It can't smell good.

551
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,110
God,
she loves it.

552
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,760
She really loves him a lot and he really,

553
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:15,620
really ruined my pitch. I thought we were
going to listen to someone being like,

554
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,370
I turned it to a telescope again.
Like that car

555
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,343
man.

556
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,300
Darn it. Turn it to a telescope.
You melt me every day.

557
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,710
Yeah. Fuck dammit.

558
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,420
I've been looking at your picture.
So low weight.

559
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,350
Yeah. That dude that dude has got
Todd this mouth thing is really,

560
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,440
I don't like it.
That mouth.

561
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,350
Who? The fucking blue band.
Why would you, ah, God mean.

562
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,200
Yeah. That's pretty nice. That guy needs
dental surgery to yesterday. Yeah, Bro.

563
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,190
Dm it.
So upsetting.

564
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,380
So upsetting.

565
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,410
Speaking of upsetting,

566
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,400
we were watching the Shahs of sunset
last night on our bravo. Whoa.

567
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,630
Yeah.
Catching up.

568
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:09,370
We have a lot of our favorite word
catching up on and you got so upset.

569
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:13,070
It was a Mercedes was
getting married and the,

570
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,880
I haven't seen you this upset a lot.
One of March.

571
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,400
You were like, I'm so upset
right now. I'm so upset.

572
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:25,690
What about her wedding upset you the most?
Um,

573
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,790
I dunno,
I guess I,

574
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I guess in my core I like certain
levels of respect for certain events.

575
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,160
Yeah. You so like, I mean they even
commented on one aspect of it during it,

576
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:40,180
she's walking down the aisle,

577
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,530
she stopped walking down the aisle to s
shake hands with people and say thanks

578
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,770
for coming. Like as she's walking down
the aisle until I was watching, I'm like,

579
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:52,360
what are you doing? She was
drunk. They were, they're both so,

580
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:55,360
and then, uh, like she was
like, oh my God. And she's like,

581
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:58,960
I can't believe you're here and
hey, you came to this, oh my God.

582
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,680
And like walked down the aisle.
That's for after the right.

583
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:05,740
So she's plastered that. I just
started to cringe at, I was like, Ooh.

584
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,840
Then it's their wedding. It's
like this beautiful setup, right?

585
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,260
I mean, yeah. Lovely decorations.

586
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,530
And then the officiant officiant says,

587
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,730
you know, whatever he says, and
then he's like, will you take her?

588
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:27,730
And the guy's like, apps
a Fuckin lutely, you know?

589
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,370
Do you want that for your wedding too? I
don't know. To me, I mean, these aren't,

590
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:38,110
it wasn't a punk rock wedding. It's
like black tie. It's a nice looking.

591
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,090
And then like what I, where I
wanted to just crawl inside myself,

592
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,070
I felt cringey or than watching
my own audition was a, the vows,

593
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,460
the vows exchanged.
They didn't right and advanced.

594
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,410
Now he said something like
pretty like decent, you know,

595
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:01,170
for his mouth. I'm not criticizing
the, you know, the writing of it. Um,

596
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,160
like she kind of cut
them off at one point,

597
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,310
but he got out a nice thing and then she
bombed so hard and she started talking

598
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:14,560
to other people and was like, don't look
over there. Okay. Do you not want valves?

599
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,790
Okay, I'm not going to do vows that like
during the week I was like, I hate this.

600
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,440
It made me so uncomfortable.

601
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,240
It made me upset because it feels like
a disrespect of not only the event but

602
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:29,710
like of the people there and showed up
to come to your wedding, the whole thing.

603
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:34,430
The whole thing made me, I think you and
I are traditionalist in that sense. Yeah.

604
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,440
I personally,

605
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:39,910
and this is just me like I believe in
wearing closed toe shoes to your own

606
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:43,930
wedding. To your wedding. Okay.
Instead of like flip flops.

607
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:46,260
I know sometimes people wear flip flops.
Well,

608
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,360
a beach wedding you got to
where I'm at the beach wedding.

609
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,340
Let's just say we've attended
a ceremony where, Oh yeah,

610
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:58,300
that was nowhere near a beach.
That was weird. That's weird. Yeah.

611
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:03,040
We weren't even close to it be.
It was an indoor daytime affair.

612
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,470
However everyone else,
I would say that the,

613
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,210
the audience was dressed more
dress better than the groom.

614
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,300
He was wearing flip flops.
That was weird.

615
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,670
Flip flops are basically
not for most situations.

616
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,440
Correct.
We know they're the ultimate leisure wear.

617
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,480
It's great if you want to wear them
to run errands or go to the beach,

618
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:30,480
obviously listen, even
as a city dweller. Yeah.

619
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,620
I don't really like wearing flip flops
in the streets. Do you know what I mean?

620
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,010
Yeah.
I'm

621
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,850
a little even like, it's a lot of shit
out there. There's no holes and shit.

622
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,860
You're in Hollywood.
You're like,

623
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,950
I got to tell you the grossest
is a flip flops in New York City.

624
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,450
When you see people like
Hollywood basically walking
the streets and you're like,

625
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:54,410
dude, this shit is nasty. Like there's
fucking plague on the ground. Pretty much.

626
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,100
But how do you know what I'm saying?
Like have some respects.

627
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:02,790
It's your one wedding dance.
Fuck, it's a desert. Sure.

628
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,330
But it's still like the
streets are nasty bro.

629
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,880
Line to vomit and garbage
and you're walking around
pretty much barefoot almost.

630
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:15,840
There's a very thin barrier.
Yeah.

631
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,580
I think you and I are are traditionalist
when it comes to those types of things.

632
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,570
I don't, I don't like being too
irreverent on solemn occasions,

633
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,970
like marriage, baptisms, things
of that nature. Have some respect.

634
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,680
Who told me about somebody thinks that
I'm crazy at a funeral too. Oh yeah, no,

635
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,320
we read it on this show.
We write it on the show.

636
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,830
It was a while back where somebody
wrote in how they said that um,

637
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,460
as they were lowering a casket of a
family member that the grandmother has her

638
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:51,830
phone and was like, I dunno, like
around two I could be there. Yeah.

639
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:56,250
Sandwiches are like just took a while.
Calls during the funeral.

640
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,310
No. What do you fucking do me have
some respect? I guess that's my thing.

641
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,090
I have a little fucking respect.
Oh my God. Speaking of respect,

642
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,790
I have two incidences.
I what the star,

643
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:09,710
but I was at the Starbucks on my way
home from man Diego and there was a chick

644
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:14,300
watching a video, full volume, full
volume, just sitting at a table,

645
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,540
a young 20 somethings
like lack of respect.

646
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,170
Nobody wants to hear your crazy video.
Secondly,

647
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:26,171
there was only one bathroom
at the Starbucks and I
just don't believe in going

648
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:29,600
in there and posting up
and taking a huge shit.

649
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:34,100
When you know that there's one bathroom
for the entire Starbucks population,

650
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,120
it's not fair to do that because there's
a line that forms and then you know

651
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:41,150
like you would on an airplane, there's
two bathrooms sometimes front and back,

652
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,230
so was like, okay, some guys shouldn't be
here. It is shit fuel. That's what it is.

653
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,030
All it is,
it's bowel and and urine maker.

654
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,720
Yeah,

655
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,220
it's bowel torture and bladder torture
and then they only give you one toilet to

656
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,900
rotate at all code code.
Do you know the code?

657
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,600
I got to shit right now the
code is nine one one bitch,

658
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,980
I've got to go down and then
they're like, ah, the coat today.

659
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,300
Today it's a, it's one
one. It's one eight,

660
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:15,880
one six I should be try it. Try. Yeah. And
you're like, Oh God, you got to put pound.

661
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:20,881
I think before you do you pound first
one you're shaking and sweating trying to

662
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:24,380
take a shit. But what I'm saying
is, look, if you got to shit,

663
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,920
you get in to Starbucks right
quick, quick, quick, and then out.

664
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,200
But I'm talking like this fool posted up.
You know what I'm saying?

665
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,160
And there's a 10 minutes of a shit. Don't
do your 10 minutes shit. Oh, I know.

666
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:38,100
There's a lot of people that
just abuse that. Are you crazy?

667
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,820
I think they just do an
email. Yeah. And He, you know,

668
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:45,750
people are waiting asshole and they really
got to shit. They really got to shit.

669
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,610
Yeah.
I got to shit and piss now.

670
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,490
Second place is we were
interviewing for a babysitter man.

671
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,910
Farting loudly. Yeah. Anyways,

672
00:44:56,911 --> 00:45:01,440
so what I do is I interview people and
I let them hang out with the kid with me

673
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:06,030
around supervising and see how they jive.
So this person was in our home,

674
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:11,031
may be a couple of hours and I come inside
from being outside and she opens the

675
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:15,920
bathroom door and this, this flushing
sound and she says to me, Oh,

676
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,970
do you have a spray?
And I see the I,

677
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,240
the smell hits me and I'm like,

678
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,200
this bitch took a shit in my house.
Hey,

679
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,040
one minute one bro. Bold, bold, bold.

680
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,900
You can't just go to like a potential
employers house. I got to shit right now.

681
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,860
Right now. No. How are you going to bring
you to shit right before you got here?

682
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,580
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah. You don't shit day like
right away. Minute one at my,

683
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:45,260
you have a right to shit obviously, but
you know. Well I don't even know you.

684
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:49,170
It's a, it's a bold choice cause you're
not going to hold your shit in, you know,

685
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,970
but no, but I didn't fucking
bring your own spray Jesus.

686
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,200
Or I guess I just don't think you
should have this amazing spray shit and

687
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:00,090
someone's fucking house
that you don't know.

688
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,240
I ordered a spray that you're going
to flip out. Yeah, it's amazing.

689
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:07,890
The headed at the gym. Okay. I say the
best spray. It's a shit spray. Well yeah,

690
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,260
yeah. But it's like, it's not what you
think is not one of those big error.

691
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:13,260
So it's just like a, yeah, the smell is,

692
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:17,160
so the thing is we have another
bathroom that has those sprays. Yeah.

693
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,560
There is a bathroom that contains those
fucking know when to shit and when to

694
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:24,690
keep your ass hole closed dude.

695
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:28,710
Or at least courtesy flush that the
smell doesn't. And it was nasty.

696
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:33,690
Like she really, she
said, oh she really shit.

697
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,430
Aw, it's so nasty. Oh No, she's
not going to work here. Yeah,

698
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,730
I know. Crazy down. Are you
shitting someone's house?

699
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,870
You don't even fucking know them yet.

700
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,060
Yeah. That's Kinda wild. Um, look,

701
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:51,061
the phenomena has also just exploded
for us reviving this a good morning.

702
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,350
Julia has just been such an amazing thing.

703
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,290
Um, and everyone's getting
involved. I can say that,

704
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,020
um,
people that you don't expect,

705
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,310
and I want to give credit because
we've made mention of this before,

706
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,110
that you know,

707
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,940
a lot of dudes are usually the ones that
do to send in a lot of their things.

708
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:17,680
You know, it's a lot. It's a lot of guys.

709
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,900
But the ladies they came through on,

710
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,140
right. Let's see some lady,
Julia's ladies want to Julia.

711
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,920
So here is lacy

712
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,340
Juliette.
Hi.

713
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,780
This car here that I'm driving.
Yeah,

714
00:47:42,781 --> 00:47:47,250
I built it myself eating that he
didn't work when I got the car,

715
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:49,710
but it's like I'm really
handy so I was able to fix it.

716
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:56,060
What else do am I really good at? Oh,
fucking a lot of makeup. All comments.

717
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,920
You know what I mean?
Five Times minimum.

718
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,673
Think about it.

719
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,290
Oh,
I realize too that there's,

720
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,340
there's gotta be no one that understands
the creepiness of Joe's thing more than

721
00:48:11,031 --> 00:48:15,830
women. Of course, you guys are the ones
that get bombarded by the guy who's like,

722
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,030
I know how to fuck.
I want to be with you no matter what.

723
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,050
Yeah, it's, it's really never
welcome. And here's the thing,

724
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,100
the guy that you do want to date, it's
never that guy telling you that stuff.

725
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,190
Right. It's always the creeper who
you're trying to, the guy that you do,

726
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:32,630
you wish would say that to you,

727
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,890
like probably you're not sure if he's
going to call, you know? But yeah,

728
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:41,210
just a regular, yeah, he's, it's never,
it's never a wanted thing generally.

729
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:44,120
Of course. Let me tell you a crazy
shit like that. And what's this here

730
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,570
chose sex life. You know, he's

731
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,680
really great guy.

732
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,580
He taught me a lot about ventilation.

733
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,183
One Hansen,

734
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,430
he damaged his right hand in a fight
with my first husband. But you know what?

735
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:18,870
I had to deal with insurance
money out of the past.

736
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:23,760
You don't need to know about that shit
anyway. So I think you should try him out.

737
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,060
I think you should go full throttle.
I think that um,

738
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,230
one thing about him is SOM Yukata
make sure he takes his meds on.

739
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:36,030
So that's one thing.
He's a guy of his pure heart,

740
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:39,320
but you got to make sure he takes his
valley. I'm and as valid tracks in a,

741
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,730
and if he's not, he just give it to them
on a piece of cheese. He'll never know

742
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,720
the difference. But I really think
the two of you should go full.

743
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:52,770
Trotta I really do. You
both like gyms, you know,

744
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:57,060
I hear you both. They both have
a lot of similarities and dumb.

745
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,080
You know, I think you
should do it. Okay. So

746
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,350
get him the fuck out my life. Go
for this. I just need to move on.

747
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:09,200
You know what?
I love the

748
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,070
fuck out of my life.
No, she did. No kidding.

749
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,160
A lot of friends.
He built that place.

750
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,960
One handed here is Rebecca.
Good morning. Julia was me.

751
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:26,880
Joe Ley, you know that meeting you
yesterday. It's the best day of my,

752
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,920
you're still beautiful
flower.

753
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
I know it was. Might be a little
hard to hear for you right now, but

754
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,350
I'm making a video.

755
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,940
You know what she really nails is the
intensity because he's so overwhelmed.

756
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:51,040
She was like doing the thing
which you solve. Rom saying it.

757
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,930
That's what made the eyes
closed. It's emotion. You.

758
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,560
I love you. That's called a grounded
performance. Yeah, I like it.

759
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,900
Good Morning Julia. It's me. Joe,

760
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,930
on my way to work here wanting
to make you a quick video.

761
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,430
Just tell you how gorgeous you
ask God. It's good. So gorgeous.

762
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,670
When I sniffed your bike,
see? Yes. Oh my God.

763
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:24,610
The fragrance took me away.

764
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,210
All right, I'll see you later on
him. I'm picking up for dinner.

765
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,970
That boyfriends that we're
going to have some problems.

766
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:34,700
Giulia announcing problems.

767
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:37,370
You don't want to mess with me
when I'm full throttle Julia.

768
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:43,020
Oh, that's good. She got the creepiness
down real aggressive to the women.

769
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,080
The women nailed as a
creaminess intensity. Yeah.

770
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,130
Yeah, you're right that
they must feel that. Oh,

771
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,980
we feel that and then say that they,
Gosh. Oh, here's one more from Olivia.

772
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,550
Good morning, Julia. I miss you so much.

773
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,200
I've been thinking about you every
day since I met you and I've just,

774
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,960
you know, I wanted to get you something,
so I got you. What dog? Julie,

775
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:15,670
guess what?
I named her that Sariah I named after you,

776
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,740
so anytime you're not here I can
just come out and say good morning.

777
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:26,710
Can't wait to meet you. I know she
already loves you so much, just like I do.

778
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,960
Right?
I love you Julie.

779
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:38,950
She nailed the psychotic lost in love,

780
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,430
but this is for you.

781
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:49,630
She named the dog. Keeps
saying her name. Well,

782
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,800
are you ready for the thing that
we've been waiting for for a while?

783
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,310
Finally can try to do it right now.
All right.

784
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:02,550
We have been in contact with the Giulia
from going to my God and I'm going to

785
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:08,620
try to call her right now.
Ready? I'm ready. Here we go.

786
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,733
I hope she,

787
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,043
hello.

788
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,450
Good afternoon,
Julia.

789
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,330
Hi,
how are you?

790
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,250
I'm great. This is Tom Segura.
I'm here with Christina P.

791
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,350
And. M. We are so excited, Julia.

792
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:43,450
So excited. Thank you for
taking the time to do this call.

793
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,960
Oh yes,
no problem.

794
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,570
I am. So I want to start
with one thing. First of all,

795
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,410
uh, you know, we didn't know that this,
when this was brought to our attention,

796
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,590
we didn't know that it was like a thing
and then it kind of faded away and it

797
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:58,850
was brought to our attention.
Again,

798
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:03,851
we've been mesmerized by it and there's
so many different stories about the

799
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,810
origin of,
of you getting this video,

800
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:13,040
a message on your phone. People
said, you know, it was a bar.

801
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,900
It was a parking lot.
It was the gym.

802
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,710
Can you tell us how this
actually came about?

803
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,810
Yeah. So this took place actually it
was about three years ago. Was it?

804
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,370
2015. Okay. Um, I was going
to the gym, not to work out,

805
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,110
but to Chan and I'm at planet fitness.

806
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,820
One of the things you have
to do is you sign in. Okay.

807
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,270
So I go and I sign in, 15
minutes goes by, you know,

808
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:43,080
I walk out and it's pitch black out.
I'm walking to my car to here,

809
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:46,470
my name's Julia Julia.
I turned around and like with the house.

810
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:51,300
So I started kind of walking slowly
back over to this voice I heard.

811
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:55,200
And as I reach this man,
he's older,

812
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:59,490
I'm probably 20 years older
than me. I'm kind of like,
all right. And he's like, oh,

813
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:01,170
Julia. And I was just like, yeah,

814
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:05,730
do I know you and you my hand
him the maybe you know a friend,

815
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:08,220
someone who works there, I
have no idea. So he goes, oh,

816
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,130
I thought you were really
beautiful and I had to talk to you.

817
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:15,720
I looked at the sign in sheet and I had
to wait till you came out just to say

818
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:18,810
hello. So I'm standing
there like, oh my God,

819
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,510
no wonder the bargain. I like terrified.
And I'm just like, okay, let's, you know,

820
00:55:24,511 --> 00:55:28,080
let's get this going. [inaudible] you
know, he's like, oh, you know, can I,

821
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,300
can I take you out for
dinner or drinks some?

822
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:34,740
At the time I was still kind of talking
to an ex boyfriend and I was like,

823
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:38,670
listen, you know, I'm still talking to
my ass. I'm hoping something works out.

824
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,190
Um,
so probably not

825
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,950
as you're saying that to him though,

826
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,120
you're basically just trying to like
ease this guy down. You're like, ah,

827
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,110
I'm talking to me.

828
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:52,520
Like you're trying to be sorta diplomatic
to let them know that, you know,

829
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,820
I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm not
interested. Right. It sounds like that.

830
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,040
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

831
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,860
You mean things that normal human beings
pick up on? I got it. Okay. Keep going.

832
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:07,750
Okay. Um, so he's saying,
Oh, you know, let me,

833
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:10,870
let me get your number. So my phone's
in my hands. I'm kind of just like,

834
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:12,190
all right, you know, I
don't know what to do.

835
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,230
So I just kind of handed him thinking,

836
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:17,290
let me get his number so
then he doesn't have mine.

837
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,090
Oh,
okay.

838
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:25,660
Me. So instead of just putting his
number and he called with my phone,

839
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,600
his phone,

840
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,310
uh,

841
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,240
Joe's no newbies.
Yup.

842
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:43,420
I'm driving to work and I get a check
and I'm looking, I said, you know,

843
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:47,590
who the hell is this that there are
no tax. It's just a video message.

844
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,480
I opened that video and I am mortified.

845
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,260
It's six 30 in the morning.
I'm like, what the hell?

846
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,270
So I didn't tell him, I didn't tell
anyone. So I had, um, at the time,

847
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:08,920
three girl roommates,
I told no one for about a week and a half,

848
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:12,430
two weeks. Cause I was just like, oh
my God, I can't believe this happened.

849
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,610
So I get another video a few days later.

850
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,820
The car one car one

851
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,730
the car, the bar one. Yeah.

852
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,150
This is like my flower.

853
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,440
Yes, yes. I respond and I said, Oh,

854
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:35,280
you know, ha ha, you know,
still not interested.

855
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:39,120
Um, so little mold. I ended up
telling my friends when that,

856
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:40,280
when we're drinking and I'm just like,

857
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:42,960
and you show you guys something really
freaked me out and they're like,

858
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,440
oh my God, this is hilarious.
You just did. On the Internet.

859
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,180
I'm like, dateline, like I
don't want to go missing.

860
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,820
And they're just like, no, no. I'm like,

861
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,080
he's like my dad's age and I'm
just like, you know, I feel bad.

862
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't want an embarrassing
one time goodbye.

863
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,650
My friends share with other
people. So I started, you know,

864
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:13,080
everyone just made a joke at him. I got
flip videos from my friends, you know,

865
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:15,380
people text me. Good morning, Julia. Um,

866
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,820
still a year,
a year ago is by,

867
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,680
and I get a text from one of my friends
and I don't have Twitter, but she does.

868
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,210
And she goes, someone's
talking posted your video on
Twitter. And I was just like,

869
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:32,220
no way. I was like, no way.

870
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:36,780
So that's how that whole girl who
went to the bar in Chicago methods,

871
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:40,110
creepy guy named Joe. Uh,
how's that rumor got started?

872
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:44,700
So my roommate and she was like, I'm
getting, I'm going to tell everyone,

873
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:48,540
I'm just like, okay, I don't care. Do
whatever you gotta do. Um, whatever.

874
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,540
So video dies down again
until you guys can't,

875
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:55,770
I have no idea who sent it to you.
And the other day,

876
00:58:55,771 --> 00:58:57,500
one of your band messaged me,

877
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,110
not sure how they got my Instagram message
either they're just like, you know,

878
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:03,450
we found you and uh,
you know,

879
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:06,210
I think you should get to the bottom
of it and you should call them.

880
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:08,640
And I was just like, you know what,
why not? It's been three years.

881
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,500
The real story out there.

882
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,060
Have you seen,
have you seen the fans?

883
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:22,010
Have you seen the fans making
their versions? Good morning, Julia

884
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,843
videos?

885
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,830
Oh my God, yes. Are
hilarious. Yes. And there's,

886
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,970
we just got through playing six more
that were submitted all by women.

887
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:36,390
So it's a women's women's versions of
it and it's really hilarious. I mean,

888
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,143
so

889
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:38,940
right

890
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,240
now back to the, to the,
so this guy you, oh,

891
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,550
so you told him like,

892
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,910
oh my ex and I bobbled so that's
why he was bringing that up.

893
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,890
Did anything ever come about?

894
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,010
Like did you ever run into him
again at the gym or anywhere else?

895
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,920
Um, I stopped going to the
gym shortly after that.

896
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:01,630
They didn't want to run into him, so
I ended up switching jam. Oh yeah.

897
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,800
My, yeah. But I did find out,

898
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:09,820
one of my friends was like, you know,
I'm curious if you has a Facebook.

899
01:00:09,821 --> 01:00:11,020
So we took his number,

900
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:15,160
we put it into Facebook and its profile
showed up and she goes, oh my God,

901
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:18,970
I went to high school with his
kid. Oh, he's about, I'm, yeah.

902
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,440
So I'm 28 hours to about
25 at the time she was 19

903
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,570
she was, wait, she was in
high school with his kid.

904
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,820
No kid is a kid. Yeah.
With his kid. Oh my God.

905
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,980
But he's 20 years older than Eylea that.
Yeah.

906
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:38,330
Gotcha. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. So he's
definitely a little bit, yeah, exactly.

907
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,590
Now, most importantly, Juliet,

908
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,600
did you ever have him do the
crown molding in your house?

909
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,280
The ceiling fans?
Do you like it?

910
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:48,821
You know,

911
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:52,540
I have some ceiling fans in my closet
right now that I need to be put up,

912
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,610
so I might give him a call.

913
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:00,160
The funny, you know, I gotta say
it's like it is, you know, I,

914
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,970
there's things to laugh at it in the
video. Obviously it's so ridiculous.

915
01:01:03,971 --> 01:01:08,971
But then I do kind of feel badly for him
because I see how desperately it's um,

916
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:15,340
you know, it's unnatural to express that
level of love for somebody you just met,

917
01:01:15,341 --> 01:01:17,320
but he's just mesmerized by it.

918
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,380
Mentally ill psychotic.
Yeah. It's psychotic.

919
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:27,020
I'm not, I'm, I'm not your Noah,
you're going no, no. You Go Juliet.

920
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,010
No, not really quite. I'm not quite sure.

921
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,880
I'm not really quite sure cause it's
not like it was like a good day that I'm

922
01:01:32,881 --> 01:01:34,320
out of like out at the bar.

923
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:38,460
Like I was literally hair up looking
like a mess coming from canning.

924
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,370
Yeah. I tried it. Two guys a compliment.

925
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:45,090
But I mean he knew what he was doing
because at the end of the video when you

926
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:46,890
study,
I hope this video didn't scare you.

927
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,290
Yes, that's right. Yes.
He always stood out to us.

928
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:55,040
He knows. And I'll tell you what's
really great about this, Julia,

929
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,660
is that because we've exposed this
guy for a creeper, it's not fair.

930
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:01,670
First of all, yes, we
have empathy for him.

931
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:04,920
But it's not fair that you've had to
change your life and your routine,

932
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,350
you a different gym and all.
Yeah,

933
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,870
because this guy doesn't know
how to fucking reign it in.

934
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:13,850
And he's so he's an adult. He
has, yeah. A kid is his kid,

935
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:15,560
by the way, a girl. Is it a daughter?

936
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,610
Um, I think he has two.
From what I remember.

937
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:24,620
I think he has two twins. I think
one's a boy, one's a girl or boy,

938
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,650
I'm not quite sure.

939
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:28,260
Well good. So he's a great
example for both. Not quite sure.

940
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,130
I know that when our sons,
when our son's reached a certain age,

941
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,930
I will play that video and be like,
don't ever do this to a girl. Okay.

942
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,320
Um,
yeah.

943
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:44,130
But I would encourage all the women
listening to send us your videos of guys

944
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:47,960
being creepy because this shit needs to
stop. It's not fair that she has no fair.

945
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:51,650
No, it's not scares. It's not
course. No, it's not cool at all.

946
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,500
Know. I always found it like as
people were before the store again,

947
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,550
people were like hating
on, you know, hating on me.

948
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:01,280
And it wasn't even me who supposed
and they're just like, oh,

949
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:04,880
she would have been younger or the guy
would have been is the guy would have

950
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,000
been younger and you know,
like more her type.

951
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,820
Then she would have loved it and
I always disagreed with that.

952
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:17,010
I can't stand to come up to me at the
bar and it doesn't matter the age or who

953
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:19,670
were you is I think it was that.
That's too much.

954
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:26,810
I'm giving them the exact same
reaction that I would give Joe.

955
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:31,280
It's not that he's older than I am
and why, you know, it's a big deal.

956
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:34,730
It was just creepy,
creepy and it was just too much.

957
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:38,190
His game is all so fun.

958
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,700
Hey, now I wish, I wish someone
would build, build me a house now.

959
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:48,650
Yeah. I mean the thing is
too, it's like there's a,

960
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,320
we were just talking about the fact that
the person that you want to send their

961
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:57,760
love video is never the person that's
like, you know what I mean? Like,

962
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,240
if you saw like whatever the
hottest guy ever is to you,

963
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:05,830
he's never going to send you a video like
that. That's the guy who, who you never,

964
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:10,010
you know, he probably doesn't
call cause it's just out of it

965
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:15,280
now. What about dating now Julia,
are you, are you a single lady?

966
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,393
Good.

967
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:37,010
I'm actually wanting to get back together,
you know,

968
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:37,853
that's over with.

969
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:44,170
And what is your sense of, uh,
what is your current boyfriend?

970
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,520
Think of all this nonsense as he amused
by it. I'm amused by Joe or what?

971
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,010
Oh Man.
When I first,

972
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:56,650
just so he's been around probably two
and a half of the three years I've been

973
01:04:56,651 --> 01:05:00,790
going on. He thought it was hilarious
when we first found out and he,

974
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,400
he didn't know what he always said.
He's like, Oh yeah, you know, go,

975
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,620
go talk on a show about
a few different places.

976
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:10,920
And I was just like, ah, I
don't know. I don't know.

977
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:13,450
So what I told him that you guys,
he's like, yeah, just do it. Do it.

978
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,010
Would you say that,

979
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:20,011
would you say that you and your current
are going full throttle or are you guys

980
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:21,100
kind of like,
you know,

981
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,470
okay.

982
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,980
You know,
I shouldn't embarrass them,

983
01:05:24,981 --> 01:05:28,090
but I'd like if we went full
throttle a little more. Ah,

984
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:33,490
wait till he finds out, we better
get on it before you get more videos.

985
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:39,250
So can I ask you to where,
where is it, where is Joe from?

986
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:42,880
Where is this region? I mean,
give us the general region.

987
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:46,660
East Coast,

988
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,270
east coast. I would say jersey.
I'm thinking he's north. Central.

989
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,300
North. Central East. Okay. He's
Darya. Okay. We don't want to give it,

990
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:56,790

991
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,240
I know. I don't want,
I don't need gym now.

992
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:06,890
No, no, no, no, no, no. But, uh,
okay. That's about right. Yeah,

993
01:06:06,891 --> 01:06:11,540

994
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,370
Yeah,

995
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,520
yeah, I was gonna say, I think
it's acting kind of gives it away.

996
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:21,460
Yeah, yeah. Just making sure.
Yeah. Wow. Um, yeah, it's,

Putting the bed, the rumors,

1000
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,550
letting us know how this really happened.

1001
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:38,410
We're huge fans of yours and
have this amazing video that, uh,

1002
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,060
I'm sure at moments terrified you.

1003
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:43,840
But thankfully we can all have
a good laugh at it now. Um,

1004
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:48,310
thanks for taking your time. Anything
else you want to add, Christina? No,

1005
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:52,810

full throttle with a new man, a new man.

1006
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,270
Factful and a, I'm sorry that that

1008
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:05,590

can have some fun with it now. Yeah.

1009
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,060
Okay.

1010
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,280
Oh yeah, no, definitely
not. I mean, like I said,

1011
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:11,890
it cracks me up all these
videos I keep saying and yeah,

1012
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:14,740
I like when I'm driving to
work and I'm like miserable,

1013
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:18,100
like waking up or I just kind of like
listening to, I'm getting a good laugh,

1014
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,780
so it starts my day off.
Wow.

1015
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,420
Great. Well listen to this, uh,
to this episode because it has,

1016
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:28,480
like I said, uh, all women doing
their good morning, Julia as in,

1017
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:29,610
it's pretty amazing.

1018
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:32,410
Oh,
that's awesome.

1019
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,820
All right. Thanks so much Julia.
Take care. Good bye Julia.

1020
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,240
Hi.
There you go.

1021
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:47,770
Me a you. Yes ma'am. You on
the phone was the greatest.

1022
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,130
I'm going to start taxing her
all the time. Come on. And Julia,

1023
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,040
do you think her friends just
do that relent? Lovely whores.

1024
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,670
I would never let it end. Like it hasn't
stopped in three years. They started,

1025
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:00,490
they probably started to fade and
then when this came back they're like,

1026
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,440
it's odd. They were like, I was
waiting for this to come back. Well,

1027
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,390
cause we've been saying it to each other
when we wake up in the morning. Oh yeah.

1028
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:11,260
That's how I get to that baby. Julian,
when I'm on the road every morning I say,

1029
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:14,800
good morning Julia from you. Will
you text me every morning? My flower,

1030
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,330
my everything.

1031
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,930
Um, all right, well we have uh, some
more stuff lined up. Let's, uh, let's,

1032
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:24,920
let's grab our boy here and get this
going. This is so fun. All right.

1033
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:29,720
That was such an amazing call with the
real Julia from Good Morning Julia and do

1034
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:34,040
two unbelievable demand and requests.
We did it.

1035
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,070
Um,
it's up in the store now.

1036
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,820
There are less go full throttle and good
morning Julia shirts with ceiling fans.

1037
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,850
And here's what we did,
both men's and women's guts.

1038
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,890
A lot of women have asked for, uh, some
of the shorts to be in women's cuts.

1039
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:54,050
So we did it. Uh, there's black,

1040
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,490
let's go full throttle and there's
gray. Good Morning Julia. Of course.

1041
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:01,070

It was great. Anyway. Oh yeah. Um,

1122
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:21,820
go back and get that one to listen if
you haven't heard of that one and look up

1123
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:26,320
last time Josh was here, so this
time gene, I said, Josh, let's go.

1124
01:14:26,321 --> 01:14:29,320
Let's do a deep dive.
Last time it was pornography.

1125
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:33,160
What have you got for me this time?
I'll let him introduce it. Josh,

1126
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,410
what are we talking about?

1127
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:38,450
Well, I thought this would be sort of
a public service for you, Christina.

1128
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,600
You think Tom's going to murder you?
Probably at some point.

1129
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,760
That's like a possibility.
Yes.

1130
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,880
Well today we can compare him to some
past serial killers and we can see some

1131
01:14:51,451 --> 01:14:55,230
similarities. Perhaps. Maybe
some differences. Maybe you'll be

1132
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:58,070
maybe some differences.
Maybe you know,

1133
01:14:58,071 --> 01:15:01,120
a few hearing that maybe you'll
be calmed after this, like, oh,

1134
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:06,050
I'm not going to get murdered.
Right. Thanks. I appreciate
it. This Josh. No problem.

1135
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,180
Um, Josh, who should I pull up first?

1136
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,850
Well,
I brought three cases with me today.

1137
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:13,160
Maybe you're familiar with some of them.
Maybe you're not.

1138
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,720
I wait, honestly, only
one of the, well, sorry,

1139
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:21,020
one of the names is vaguely familiar and
then one of the monikers I'm familiar

1140
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:23,530
with. Okay. So you're
pretty well versed already.

1141
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:27,220
I thought it was pulling some obscure.
It's still, I don't know a lot about this.

1142
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,890
Well, let's start with good
old. This is recent, by the way.

1143
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:34,880
Robert Pickton Aka the pig farmer killer.

1144
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,520
God a k a pork chop.
Rob.

1145
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,030
Well, he has the same beard shaving
technique that my husband does.

1146
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,940
That's a similarity. That
haircut too. I probably could,

1147
01:15:43,941 --> 01:15:47,840
this front is pretty much gone. I could
grow the back out. Ever think about that.

1148
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:52,520
Um, I don't know. That's kind of an
interesting look. I will say, um,

1149
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,960
from this profile, it's a, you know,
not the worst looking guy. I mean,

1150
01:15:56,961 --> 01:15:58,730
he's not the most handsome man.

1151
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:03,070
There are women, almost a hundred
that would agree with you.

1152
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:06,610
Holy Shit. That many, well,

1153
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:12,430
pork chop rob here. Uh, would you
guess that he's a millionaire?

1154
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:17,260
He really, he's a millionaire from
which is the most fascinating farming.

1155
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,510
Well, yes, it's from owning a farm.

1156
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:24,040
His parents had owned this farm for a
hundred years and they bought it for 13

1157
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:28,750
grand in like 1963 and then in 1994,

1158
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:33,730
he's found out the farm was worth
seven point $2 million on my life.

1159
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,120
So he sold portions of it here
and there every couple of years.

1160
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,750
Keep that fund verse some millions
of dollars. And needless to say,

1161
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:44,710
the farming went to shit.
They weren't really doing that anymore,

1162
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:48,220
but he still had a lot
of hogs on the farm,

1163
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:52,640
including a 600 pound boar that
would like patrol the farm and,

1164
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:53,620
and bite and things.

1165
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,530
Did he put his talents into another
field when it wasn't farming?

1166
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:57,460
Did He do other things?

1167
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,290
In fact, he did. He uh,

1168
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,510
made a non for profit organization out
of his farm called the piggy palace.

1169
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:06,350
Good Times place.

1170
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:11,830
And it was a society that would hold
events and parties for organizations so

1171
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:17,420
that,
that farm of his became a party zone.

1172
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,110
Can I pull up this farm? Yes, of course.
Yes. This is what the farm looked like.

1173
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,120
Very vast.

1174
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:28,150
That barn right there held many of
parties for vagrants and sex workers and

1175
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,740
hell's angels.

1176
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:35,420
Lots of cool rad people were
partying with the piggy palace boys

1177
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:38,970
and our man here. Uh, was it the pork,

1178
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:42,860
the pork man porkchop
rob door, chuck Robb. Um,

1179
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:45,020
his target though was lady.

1180
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:49,970
Yes. Ladies of the night sex
workers in particular. Oh. And uh,

1181
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,090
when you would hold these parties,
of course it would attract those people.

1182
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:58,091
They'd come and do drugs and drink and
then he would rape and murder them.

1183
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,950
Subsequently you,
yeah.

1184
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:04,790
So eventually one of the workers of
the farm kind of noticed, you know,

1185
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,420
all these women that are coming
around here seem to go missing.

1186
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:13,970
So something's up. And uh, eventually, uh,

1187
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:17,990
an investigation was held.
This investigation was so thorough.

1188
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,410
They called it the ground zero of Canada.
Why?

1189
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:25,610
Because they had to bring in
heavy machinery, excavators,

1190
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:30,470
things of that nature so that they could
find human remains and they hadn't had

1191
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:35,471
an undertaking quite like that since
Ground Zero in nine 11 oh my God.

1192
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,400
Because there were very few
remains left DC. What rob did,

1193
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:45,730
the reason he is the pork shop king is
because he would feed the women and their

1194
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:48,080
remains to the pigs.
Okay.

1195
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:53,140
And then he would take the pigs and
make bacon and things and sell it to the

1196
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:57,200
public.
Oh my God.

1197
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:02,700
Did you know about this? Tom?
Why are you laughing? Psycho?

1198
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:05,520
Pretty crazy. Yeah. There was a name

1199
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,201
or who is like,

1200
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:10,280
I bought Bacon from that guy all the
time and now he has to live with himself

1201
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,910
that he aid basically. Yeah, a lady.

1202
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:14,690
It could you imagine just
going about your day.

1203
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:19,760
Wow. So he might kill and dismember
and then feed that to the pigs.

1204
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:23,780
Right. And then tailor the Higgs
and make Bacon and yes, I really,

1205
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:27,230
great way to get rid of evidence.
A brilliant, right. I mean,

1206
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:31,250
I mean he's a millionaire. Yes. The thing
is, that's a good thing about capitalism.

1207
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:33,350
You can always exploit
something to your advantage.

1208
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:36,590
We've talked about this forever.
What's the best way to dispose of a body?

1209
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:40,070
And I think we found it now feeding
it to the pigs and then selling,

1210
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,130
well we have some clubs

1211
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:46,010
they can. So they convicted him
of 27 murders. That's a lot,

1212
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:51,140
right in this clip
he adds to the number a little bit.

1213
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,930
So this is, uh, this is him in, he's
already in, in a jail cell in a, in uh,

1214
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:02,140
his cellmate has been undercover for
months embedding himself in order to get a

1215
01:20:02,241 --> 01:20:03,500
confession out of him.
Cause like I said,

1216
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:08,501
this investigation at the farm so thorough
and also not really raising a lot of

1217
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:12,120
answers. They're spending millions
of dollars to investigate.

1218
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,740
And so they need to this guy to
get a confession. That's really,

1219
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,920
are you really all the
darkest motherfucker? I know
how much knowledge you have.

1220
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:22,440
Let's, let's, uh, let's
watch these cloves. Tell me
what's going on here. Okay.

1221
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:30,123
Yeah.

1222
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:36,450
Well it's kind of inaudible there, but
just saying that he's, that he got sloppy.

1223
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,620
Yes, he got sloppy at the end and he's
lamenting in that fact. He's saying,

1224
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:44,580
you know, I, if I woulda
kept my shit right and tight,

1225
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:47,180
I would have fucking murdered
more bitches, you know? Yeah.

1226
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,750
And the officer is saying, oh, but it's
just like, oh, that's fucked up and stuff,

1227
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,850
you know? Yeah. He's not doing
a real good job. The officer.

1228
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:55,303
Okay.

1229
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,410
Yeah. Do you wanted one
more? He said he couldn't,

1230
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:08,110
so he confessed to 49 and you want to
add one more to make an even fig make the

1231
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:08,730
big five

1232
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,570
zero.
Yeah.

1233
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,080
So like what was Mayweather when he
went did exactly like 49 all right.

1234
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:18,830
Sound is nicest. You have to get
that 50 you get that big 50 spots.

1235
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,860
Half a hundred yes. Gotta be a thrill to
do this. All right, here is, let's see,

1236
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:25,450
there was a stop so you can
go relieve yourself of that

1237
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,460
early 2007

1238
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:31,663
Oh,

1239
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,300
that's right, officer. It is
math. That's good math. Yeah.

1240
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:42,130
They're just kind of
reconfirm. He's like, yeah man.

1241
01:21:42,131 --> 01:21:45,790
Fucking imagine if I had gotten
50 yeah. So he's just like, man,

1242
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:49,810
I'm a real cool dude. I, I coulda
got 50 trying to talk to the officer.

1243
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:52,480
Like he's one of his,
yeah.

1244
01:21:59,170 --> 01:21:59,470
Yeah.

1245
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:02,410
It's a theme that will carry on
through all this, by the way,

1246
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:06,600
is injecting women with, I didn't, I, you
know, you wonder how do they kill him?

1247
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:08,820
Do they strangle him,
stab him and stuff?

1248
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,930
It turns out a lot of them
were just injecting things
like antifreeze into their

1249
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:17,010
veins or Windex was used. All these like
in five to 10 minutes, they're dead.

1250
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:19,510
That's all it takes. And I
didn't know that. I mean, yeah,

1251
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:24,930
you might want to write that one
down. Don't write that down. Damn you.

1252
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,270
Where'd you find this footage?
This is, I didn't know that.

1253
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:30,240
This is your guest is
fighting that if this footage,

1254
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,540
you gotta read this audience,
they can't hear anything.

1255
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:43,630
So he's saying, uh, the, the killer
saying another party says, yeah,

1256
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:48,310
I mean all this, all, they fucking
got a lot of stuff on me. Um,

1257
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:53,180
and then the officer says
no. Oh Shit. Hey. Yeah,

1258
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,010
Canadian. That's yes. That's what, that's,

1259
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:01,930
that's why it's, what is it not part of
it? I don't really know because, well,

1260
01:23:01,931 --> 01:23:05,650
what's happened? Like I said, he
was convicted of 27 murders. Oh.

1261
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:08,170
So he's saying like that's why it's
here. He's admitting. He's like,

1262
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:11,780
that's why you know, I,
I killed way more. Yeah.

1263
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,620
But it's not part of it cause they
don't know. But I got sloppy at the end,

1264
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:18,160
so they found some, uh, wow.

1265
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:22,240
So now they're going after him for even
while he's dead. He got he, he died.

1266
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:27,250
He's dead. He died naturally. Sure.
Yeah. But just somebody kill him. Ah,

1267
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:31,120
Shit I should have, that's one part. I
didn't look it up. Hold on. Let's see.

1268
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:35,590
That's tragic. High. Are you really
sad that that guy's dead time? Not Sad.

1269
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:39,740
He died at 69. Hey, nice.

1270
01:23:39,741 --> 01:23:44,320
Say Hey and I'll have you know that a
farm is being made to a children's park

1271
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:48,940
now. Yeah. Morbid thing to
do, right? He's this Christ.

1272
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,170
Well, you know that murderer
land is discount land. Uh,

1273
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:56,080
one time I had lunch with the guy
bought the Charles Manson murder house.

1274
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,690
He ended up being a
television producer anyways.

1275
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,390
He got it at a significant discount
because those Manson murders murders

1276
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:05,320
happened there. Was he stoked that that
went down there? Yeah, I mean, not stuck,

1277
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:07,870
but he was like, oh, it was
cheaper because no one wanted
to live here. I'm like,

1278
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:12,220
yeah, no shit. Also, I had to change the
street address. That's terrible, Tom.

1279
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:15,170
So how hard are you right now
having watched that? Well,

1280
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:17,970
I'm glad there's a desk
here. I'll just say that. Um,

1281
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,410
these next fellows,

1282
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:24,370
these ones you might remember from
your childhood call one second.

1283
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:29,200
I just wanted to see. Yes, we
had you so terrifying. Potter.

1284
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:33,010
I'm just looking to see like
what his cause of death,

1285
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:37,720
but I can't really see just evil baby.
No, I just wanted to see if there was,

1286
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:40,030
if he was,
if he himself was killed.

1287
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:42,370
I don't think they have
death penalty and they don't.

1288
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:44,800
I meant like an inmate or
something. Oh, I see. I see.

1289
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,470
But somebody injected him with Windex.

1290
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:51,970
He probably died of some cardiovascular
thing. Eating all that pork

1291
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,800
doesn't show that he's dead.
Oh, okay. So he's not done.

1292
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:00,350
He's not that he could very well be
living. I mean this again happened,

1293
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:05,310
he was put in jail 10 years. It was not
fair though. He got life in prison. Yeah.

1294
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:08,950
Why is that not fair? I
mean, I mean, you know,

1295
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:11,490
like why don't you give the guy a
shot to get out there and make some

1296
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:16,480
rehabilitation has been saying that for
so long that the prison system does not

1297
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:20,800
rehab criminals enough. It's crazy.
This guy's just a lost cause.

1298
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:25,870
Yeah, he is super smart. I mean his whole
scheme was really intelligent. Right.

1299
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:29,020
To set up a non for profit
to hold parties to get,

1300
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:34,470
I mean good on him for
having that Shithole farm and
getting a bunch of hookers

1301
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:38,830
to come hangout. That's true. I mean
he was getting laid a lot, you know,

1302
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:42,130
so I mean maybe not take it
as far as murdering them,

1303
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,340
but he was definitely getting his
date. Then again, when you murder them,

1304
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:48,420
you don't have to, he's saving
money too. We didn't think about it.

1305
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:53,170
He's making money. Right. Oh right, right.
It's going to feed them to the pigs.

1306
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:57,600
Pork meat. Yeah. So he's getting
more out of the pig when,

1307
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:02,530
when I take that away from him, um, who we
have next? Well these ones, like I said,

1308
01:26:02,531 --> 01:26:06,680
you might remember from your childhood
because these dudes were chilling in La.

1309
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:12,770
No, no, these are the hillside
strangler and aware of them.

1310
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,110
Look at those two. Cool. Damn it.

1311
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,220
These guys actually they did all
their dastardly deeds here in la,

1312
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,880
but there from where I live,
western New York, a Rochester,

1313
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:26,540
New York is where they were born. So
there you go. Product of Rochester,

1314
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:30,620
New York right there. That's Kenneth
Biyanki and Angelo blown. Okay.

1315
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,050
I remember it seemed like
empty dark eyes here.

1316
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,750
And this guy seems like he's
got a good sense of humor.

1317
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,160
He's a real,
that guy.

1318
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:41,690
I mean they're both real pieces of shit.
Yeah.

1319
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,350
The guy on the right,
uh,

1320
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,350
he's described as a are self described
as a world renowned car upholster.

1321
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:49,790
Oh yeah.

1322
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:55,180
Which is actually hate this segment or
pretty much goes with murdering people.

1323
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:58,740
I mean you gotta, you gotta read a
pollster your car. So what was the,

1324
01:26:58,850 --> 01:26:59,631
what was there?

1325
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:03,830
So they were western New York guys while
Kenneth there was getting into a lot of

1326
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:06,920
trouble out in western New York and
he thought, I gotta get Outta here.

1327
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:07,940
I got to find a new life.

1328
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,470
So he hooks up with his cousin Angelo
there who lives in La and who's, uh,

1329
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:16,010
a real to do out here, a real mover and
shaker, you know, real upholstering cars.

1330
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,800
Uh, he's a a real ladies' man
apparently. And so when they arrived,

1331
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:24,440
they started, you know, hanging out
together. They decide, you know,

1332
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:28,910
sense Angela such a ladies' man,
why don't we prostitute women?

1333
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:34,100
Oh right. Natural, make some money to
go. Yeah. So they started doing this,

1334
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:38,770
you guys, exactly. These guys are
trying to make a quick buck and a,

1335
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:43,170
they know how to do it and so eventually
it start pimping out women. And

1336
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:48,140
uh, why, why did the sex workers
always get it? You know what I mean?

1337
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:52,340
Those are nice ladies. Those are high a
grade. He's just trying to make money.

1338
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:56,570
And then time and time again, I would
date a sex worker over a regular girl.

1339
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:00,020
Of course, hands down.
But why is your reasoning?

1340
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:03,680
Because I feel like I have the right
frame of mind. I don't get jealous.

1341
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:07,730
I wouldn't like bother. I think you would
actually come. You would be great. Yeah.

1342
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:12,890
It'd be great for dating like a porn
girls dominate traits about him already.

1343
01:28:12,891 --> 01:28:13,920
Like what would he,

1344
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:17,240
cause he doesn't want to because
some of the things he just said,

1345
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:20,420
I think he would be like really?
He's the guy who wouldn't be bothered.

1346
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:23,380
You know he'd be, he's
so, he wouldn't be weird.

1347
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,570
Get Jealous and like even on a lower
level like a bartender or like a Hooters

1348
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:29,470
waitress or something.

1349
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:34,000
I would love to watch them work and like
pray on some dude and be like flirting

1350
01:28:34,001 --> 01:28:38,290
with him just to get their cash and then
we take their cash home and like smoke

1351
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,250
weed and watch Netflix.
You

1352
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,130
kind of a cook thing you like,

1353
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,260
it's not a cook thing cause it's not
like I'm getting off on it but I can just

1354
01:28:44,261 --> 01:28:45,940
accept that that's rolls with it.

1355
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:50,770
I can accept that that's the way they
make money and they can separate that from

1356
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:51,970
them.
Loving me.

1357
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,680
Josh is also low maintenance
and adaptable. Yes.

1358
01:28:56,681 --> 01:29:00,550
So like whatever the circumstances,
he's just going to go with it.

1359
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:01,920
I'm like water baby.
I flow,

1360
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:03,643
he flows.

1361
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,780
But I imagine I would have like a sex
worker just because I imagine they've seen

1362
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:10,050
it all. They've done been there, done
that. They're probably really sympathetic,

1363
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:14,110
kind BYO. Oh, of course. I've been
through everything, you know? Yeah.

1364
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,170
He would be a good match on that level.

1365
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:19,770
And then every once in a
while he'd be like, you know,
why don't you eat my scrum?

1366
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:23,280
And she'd be like, yeah, because she'd be,
and she'd be like, I'm the best of that.

1367
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:27,110
And Blah, blah. Nothing phases.
I checked. No, no. True.

1368
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:29,370
And into what your point is.

1369
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,990
No one really gives a shit about the sex
workers and that's why these two dumb

1370
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:37,470
dumbs got away with shit for
so long because it wasn't. Yes,

1371
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:42,420
there's one of their dead
holes. Jesus. Yeah, no problem.

1372
01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:45,600
Strangled body. Yes. They found
this body, I forget which,

1373
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:50,340
where that one was fun because they were
littering them throughout La County and

1374
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:54,510
uh, they were found on the same days.
When did this happen? This is the 70s,

1375
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,250
late seventies.

1376
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:01,520
And it wasn't until they raped
and murdered two sex workers.

1377
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,600
Oh. People started giving a
shit. People are like, Ooh.

1378
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:08,670
And then they kind of connected
the dots from there. And was it a,

1379
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,420
was the nostrils workers just like girls
they met at a bar kind of thing? Uh, no.

1380
01:30:12,421 --> 01:30:15,800
They were 12 year olds.
No.

1381
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:20,170
What's the RFD line? Is that a bus
line? Do you know that? Oh, our TTD.

1382
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:21,810
The rapid transit.

1383
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,440
I wasn't sure if that's what that
meant or if it was like a short bus or

1384
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:29,360
something. No. Okay. Our bus system and
then, I don't know what they call it now.

1385
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,950
Rtd, but yes, they found them. Uh,

1386
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,730
they got off of stop there last they were
seeing and then they were getting into

1387
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:39,930
a car driven by one of these dudes and a,
that was the end of them.

1388
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,030
That's when people started that
sniff and no kids though. Yes.

1389
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,050
But to them it was almost the same thing.

1390
01:30:46,051 --> 01:30:51,051
These guys were the typical guys that
like once they're pimping business went

1391
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:54,840
dry, they're like these fucking
whores. No one cares about them. Right.

1392
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,940
I bet no one would care
if they went missing.

1393
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,180
And then they started like laughing
about that and then they started cruising

1394
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:04,080
around in their car posing as undercover
police officers. That's how they would,

1395
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:08,880
oh my God. Yes, they
fake badges. Oh my God.

1396
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:14,040
And then how did they get caught? They
got caught because they were just sloppy.

1397
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:18,330
They were littering these bodies about
no one really connected the dots until

1398
01:31:18,331 --> 01:31:22,050
they murdered those two non sex workers.
And then they were kind of like, Whoa,

1399
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:25,980
this is similar to this and this and this.
And then through their, one of their,

1400
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:30,360
um, attempted victims. What
was this chick's name? Uh,

1401
01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:33,630
it was the daughter of an actor.
It's a,

1402
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:38,640
her name is Catherine. Laura Baker.
It's Peter Laura's daughter. Oh my God.

1403
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:42,960
So they attempted to kill her and they
abducted her and everything and they

1404
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:45,960
aborted it because they found a picture
of her on her father's lap and they're

1405
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:49,560
like, no shit. You're Peter
Lauren's daughter. I love
him. They let her go. Why?

1406
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:55,620
They found a picture of
her on her father's lap,

1407
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:58,260
like in her belongings and

1408
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,970
Peter Lorre from from m is for
murder or whatever is great.

1409
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,800
I love this guy because he played like
a killer or whatever. I'm also now,

1410
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,740
now I'll have, you know, I
know this is a running theme.

1411
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:16,770
I can cry to fellows had their
own ride or die and FTD RTD.

1412
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:21,250
Yes. Really. Victoria Compton's
her name. There she is.

1413
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,690
This woman was so in love with
Kenneth Biyanki. Oh my God.

1414
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,610
That she,

1415
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,060
once they were captured and
they were in jail and on trial,

1416
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:34,610
she attempted to lure and uh,

1417
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:39,550
kill a woman in a motel to
make it look like the hillside.

1418
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:41,620
Stranglers were still on
the loose and we'll hack.

1419
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:46,690
And Kenneth even gave her some
dude from jails Jizz to plant.

1420
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:50,530
So it looked like a rate and she was
about to do all that. But she fucked up.

1421
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:54,970
She fucked up. Yeah, she got caught. But
did she kill someone? No, she got like,

1422
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:58,120
it wasn't a test. She fucked it
all up. Got got caught for it.

1423
01:32:59,140 --> 01:32:59,973
It was an attempt.

1424
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:03,850
I tell you it's how you wouldn't do those
things that she attempted to strangle.

1425
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:07,600
Yes. I never understand
what the, the attraction is.

1426
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:12,250
Is it women who like that kind of
power that the serial killer has?

1427
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:17,050
I don't know. Is it the the perception
of yeah, like strength and power.

1428
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,270
Cause a lot of women like Charles Manson,

1429
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:23,740
he had a wife before he died and he gets
celebrity celebrity, average Ramirez.

1430
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:27,430
The Richard Mirrors, right? Yeah, the,
the night stalker. He had chicks into him.

1431
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:28,323
Even like,
uh,

1432
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:33,220
the dude who shot up Aurora movie theater
was like chicks were sending him nudes

1433
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:33,760
and stuff.

1434
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,750
Oh yeah.
Manson.

1435
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:37,360
All the girls were in love with Charles
Manz even though he didn't technically

1436
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,810
murder anybody. Right. Tom, you're
always bringing that point up to me.

1437
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:45,300
He told people look younger, but they
followed his orders. Right, right, right.

1438
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:50,500
I mean bad guy. Worst Guy, but
I dunno, it was worst guy. Um,

1439
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:56,290
but yes, Victoria would, you
wouldn't do any of those things? No.

1440
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,070
No, not for time. I throw his ass in
jail. She's still alive. By the way.

1441
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:03,370
Do you think we could at least send her
a shirt and FTD? Our team. Oh my gosh.

1442
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,620
She deserves that. If anyone
does, she's the real deal.

1443
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,090
He says she's the Ogf tea RTD men.

1444
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:12,400
I mean, who's ges? Would
you plant on a person?

1445
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:16,630
If you are going to frame them for murder,
he was evil.

1446
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,310
You'd have to extract the
ges to, Oh, how do you even

1447
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,110
asking? Wow. What did they do to get it?

1448
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:28,520
I know this guy,

1449
01:34:28,521 --> 01:34:33,521
he got some random dude in the prisons
jizz cheese money for it and I was like,

1450
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:38,570
dude, got killed back. A smokes
all jerk off into this cup.

1451
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,440
Really only probably had lord. I'm
with like, I just like to drink it.

1452
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:45,770
Will you just leave it in a cup for
me? All right, put this in a body.

1453
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,650
There's no way. He was like, what
I'm going to do is smuggle this.

1454
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:52,160
Just have it planted on some.
Thinking about the logistics,

1455
01:34:52,161 --> 01:34:55,980
how do you smuggle ges out of a
prison? Oh, there's tons of ways.

1456
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,703
What Josh,

1457
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:02,810
what are you talking about?
The little smuggle all kinds
of knives and guns. Dope.

1458
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:05,030
Is is liquid.
I mean you could smuggle that.

1459
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:08,620
You could just like smuggle it
in your mouth. I'll and France.

1460
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:10,800
Nobody

1461
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,130
get a Dixie Cup or something and he's
little ball it out. All right guys.

1462
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:18,740
Okie doke. There's tons of ways. Okay,
well, interesting. Well thank you.

1463
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,930
What a ray of sunshine you've been.
There's a Jesus.

1464
01:35:21,931 --> 01:35:26,550
Now there's one more
gentleman is my favorite.

1465
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:30,320
I hate the segment right now.
Let me get back to filthy porn.

1466
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:35,550
I'm so terrified right now.
Bullies terrifies. Scary.
This is not Christina crime.

1467
01:35:35,551 --> 01:35:38,030
That last one was pretty. That
was pretty bad. I'm so scared.

1468
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,360
This guy is now.
I mean,

1469
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:43,550
I don't even know if I want to
tell you about this guy anymore.

1470
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:47,480
Sounds like it's going to be bad.
This Guy Albert fish is his name. Oh,

1471
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,151
look at that guy.

1472
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:52,340
You think he could make some great youtube
videos if he had it back in the day,

1473
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:57,190
right? He's just sweet. Imagine that guy
asking you to come over and Piss on him.

1474
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,330
Okay.

1475
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:04,210
Sky Empty in there. Oh, you don't
have to. No fucking idea. He's full,

1476
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:08,170
but not with a soul. No,
she looks like a refugee.

1477
01:36:08,171 --> 01:36:11,500
This gentlemen is a child rapist

1478
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,470
and accountable. I can't hear
this shit. I'm a mother of two,

1479
01:36:15,471 --> 01:36:20,130
you know that I can't even
walk. What's that? That, what is

1480
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:24,610
that? This guy has a fucked up life. Okay.

1481
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,660
He was born into a terrible home.
His mother was an alcoholic,

1482
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,190
a prostitute,

1483
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:35,550
and she sent him away to an orphanage
where he was beat by nuns and shit cause

1484
01:36:35,561 --> 01:36:36,910
it's like the 18 hundreds.

1485
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:42,480
And he started to enjoy the
beatings a little bit too much.

1486
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:46,840
So as he grew up,
this guy even got married,

1487
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:51,090
had kids at six fucking kids and it's uh,

1488
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,780
noted that he did never was known
to attack or abuses on children,

1489
01:36:55,930 --> 01:37:00,930
but he would have them and their friends
slap his ass with that little guy right

1490
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:03,770
there with nails coming
through it. Yes. Okay.

1491
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:06,250
And that is not even the expense,

1492
01:37:06,251 --> 01:37:09,230
like mild for this cool dude
and this far as what he likes.

1493
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:13,300
This is kids to do that. Yes.
Hey Son. Yeah. Yeah. Hey,

1494
01:37:13,301 --> 01:37:16,450
why don't you get your friend bill to
come over and slap dad's ass with the

1495
01:37:16,451 --> 01:37:18,980
fucking with nail nail
pat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1496
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:23,260
Hold this guy also
enjoyed a little activity.

1497
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:26,470
Now I don't know if you've seen Tom
doing this or caught him doing it.

1498
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,980
It's would be a red flag. But
go ahead. This guy liked to uh,

1499
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:35,170
put rose stems up his urethra.
Yes.

1500
01:37:35,171 --> 01:37:40,150
I've seen them posing a mirror with it,
with those in there.

1501
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:44,110
This guy, this guy right
here is a pioneer by the way.

1502
01:37:44,111 --> 01:37:49,030
He's like a g o d in the body
modification community can be clearly.

1503
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:50,230
Yeah,
he has,

1504
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:55,231
like I have noted there are five aspects
of body modification people do for like

1505
01:37:56,311 --> 01:38:00,990
enjoyment today that this guy was all
about like a play piercing. For instance.

1506
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,760
Uh, this guy, you stick inserts,

1507
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:07,140
sewing needles under his fingernails
as a game and he has to do with

1508
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:12,810
not only that, when he
was a debt, when he died,

1509
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:17,811
they found 29 sewing needles in his
pelvis that he would insert through.

1510
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:23,460
I'll, let's see if I get this word right.
The perineal. Do you know where that is?

1511
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:28,380
Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's your tank. He'd,
he would stay those on them up in there.

1512
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:33,000
And there is a, I don't know if I included
that picture. That's a crime scene.

1513
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:34,620
I might've,
I did.

1514
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:39,360
I can't believe I forgot to include the
picture of the x ray of his pelvis with

1515
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:42,900
all those needles in it.
Now what is this letter here?

1516
01:38:42,901 --> 01:38:47,370
Is this audio someone read that's an audio
drama to [inaudible] of a letter that

1517
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:52,140
he wrote. This is how he got caught.
Because eventually, like all of them,

1518
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:54,630
they get sloppy. Yep. But this,
that's the time, by the way,

1519
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:58,630
the time to get away with things late
18 hundreds early 1,980 course. Oh,

1520
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:03,540
before forensic. Yeah. DNA. And so
Albert's like toward the end of his life,

1521
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:04,830
right?
He has been doing all this shit.

1522
01:39:04,831 --> 01:39:08,580
He's into all this like a
torture and everything like that.

1523
01:39:08,581 --> 01:39:10,140
He loves all that crap.

1524
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:16,120
What he decides now he reads an ad in a
paper where an 18 year old gentlemen is

1525
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:19,980
talking about, he's like hardy stock
looking for citizenship. You know,

1526
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:22,590
this is like the 18 hundreds classified.
This guy's looking for work.

1527
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:27,060
So Albert answers the ad just to go check,
Holla at your boy thinking like,

1528
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:31,410
I'm going to eat this fucking guy. Yeah.
Uh, because he loves eating human beings.

1529
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:34,230
And so he shows up there and
he meets the Guy Thinking,

1530
01:39:34,231 --> 01:39:38,190
I'm going to murder this guy. But then
he meets his little sister and is like,

1531
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,570
nope, I'm eating hurt. Oh Geez.
So then he like tells him like,

1532
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,370
I'll come back and let
you know about the job.

1533
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,950
I'll be back here in a little
bit and we'll talk about it.

1534
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:50,860
So he comes back and he goes, you know
what? It's my nieces birthday. Okay.

1535
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:55,320
You mind if I take grace to the
party? And they're like, yeah,

1536
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:57,990
go ahead. Creepy old man. What?

1537
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:01,080
And they let him do that and
they never saw her again.

1538
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:05,010
And then years later after, you
know, she's been missing. I mean,

1539
01:40:05,011 --> 01:40:08,310
they assume she's dead probably, you know,
but they don't know have any answers.

1540
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,640
He sends them this anonymous letter,
uh,

1541
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:15,790
which I gave you a dramatic reading of it.

1542
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,400
I really don't want to hear this jar.

1543
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:25,730
My dear.
Mrs Bud on June 3rd,

1544
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:30,730
1928 I called on you at four oh six
West 15th Street and brought to you pot,

1545
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:33,770
cheese and strawberries.
We had lunch.

1546
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:36,590
Grace sat on my lap and kissed me,
right.

1547
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:41,300
Oh No, thank you. Taking her
to a party, you said yes,

1548
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:42,980
she can go to

1549
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:47,700
an named Dee home in Westchester. I had
already picked out when we got there.

1550
01:40:47,701 --> 01:40:51,990
I told her to remain outside.
She picked wild flowers.

1551
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,830
I went upstairs and stripped all my
clothes off. I knew if I did not,

1552
01:40:57,070 --> 01:40:59,080
I would get our blood on them.

1553
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,820
Oh no thank you. Push. No, no, no more.

1554
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:03,680
Can't. I can't. I can't.

1555
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:07,810
Went to the window and called her and I
hid in the closet until she was in the

1556
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:09,940
room.
When she saw me all naked,

1557
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:13,540
she began to cry and
tried to run downstairs.

1558
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:16,350
I grabbed her and she said
she would tell her Mama,

1559
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,220
there's a twist.
I stripped her naked.

1560
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:23,370
How she did kick by 10 scratch.

1561
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:28,370
I choked her to death and Carter into
small pieces so I could take the meat to

1562
01:41:28,371 --> 01:41:30,980
my rooms,
cook and eat it.

1563
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:36,910
How sweet and tender her little
ass was roasted in the oven.

1564
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:40,250
It took me nine days to eat her in time.

1565
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,100
Shit.
But

1566
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:45,840
no,
I did not fuck her though.

1567
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:49,860
I could have if I wished
she died a virgin.

1568
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,810
Well that is the nice solace at the
end, Huh? Right side to all that.

1569
01:41:55,650 --> 01:42:00,090
Cause you not fucking bring
kid things over. Come on man.

1570
01:42:00,091 --> 01:42:03,480
I can't hear this stuff. Albert
fish though. Kind of a pioneer.

1571
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:06,090
He was eating ass before.
It was cool. Okay.

1572
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:12,890
Right.
Find a real,

1573
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:15,960
you find a real savage out there.
You've got to get her to Albert Fish,

1574
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:17,550
ladies and gentlemen,
Josh.

1575
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:22,940
Oh my God,
I'm starving.

1576
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:25,630
Thanks for having me having

1577
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:28,100
me. Yeah, thanks. Bye. Bye. Now

1578
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:35,050
can we stick to porn on the website?
You know the next dark web thing?

1579
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:40,280
You've got to top this, right? Ah,
fuck. He's going to get hard though.

1580
01:42:40,281 --> 01:42:43,820
You can do it Josh, anywhere.
Anybody can see you coming up.

1581
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:47,670
I'm going to be at a helium
in Buffalo, New York, uh,

1582
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,240
for New Year's Eve with rich
Voss. That's right. Hell yeah.

1583
01:42:51,241 --> 01:42:53,750
And then I'm going to be in San Francisco
with you the week after that. Sonic.

1584
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:58,820
January 4th and fifth. That's
right. All right. Thanks Josh.

1585
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:02,450
No problem. Terrible. All right.

1586
01:43:02,451 --> 01:43:07,360
So we just wrapped up the, um, one of the
most deprived and depressing segments,

1587
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,860
everyone of this show.
And uh,

1588
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,710
we want to keep that energy rolling.

1589
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:17,470
So we brought in one of the most deprived
human beings we could ever think of it

1590
01:43:17,471 --> 01:43:21,770
to have on here. I will say this,
man, I'm not always an early adapter.

1591
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,240
I feel like I was an early adapter early
fan of Kyle done against Instagram page,

1592
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:30,140
the funniest Instagram page.
I think you might've been the very first.

1593
01:43:30,141 --> 01:43:33,540
It was the first person that like
posted something of mine that,

1594
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:38,700
that blew it up. Well, and did you
send Joe Rogan stuff? Oh, so yeah,

1595
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,760
you started my whole,
uh,

1596
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:46,510
Instagram year and Tom Talks about your
Instagram feed to me and got me on it.

1597
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,680
Did you, were you annoyed
or where you were like, oh,
this is great Instagram fan.

1598
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:54,050
So when I saw your shit I was like,
this is great.

1599
01:43:54,051 --> 01:43:55,510
Here's the thing too is like the,

1600
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:00,500
I I've talked about this many
times on the show that um,

1601
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:01,700
throughout my life,

1602
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:06,790
nothing makes me laugh harder still
than getting a reaction of disgust or

1603
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:12,980
contempt for my mother on something.
Like it's still the thing,

1604
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,850
it's like it's in the DNA where
it reminds me of like, you know,

1605
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,670
burping at the table and being
like chastised for doing that.

1606
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,780
And it would make me laugh.

1607
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:25,250
And that video that you do
where you do the chicken,

1608
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:28,820
but one where I was like,
is this real?

1609
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:33,350
And like did you really first
one was real surprise her.

1610
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:37,830
Sometimes she, but she'll know
I'm doing something man. The,

1611
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:41,000
the fact that the shit out of
her. Right. I remember this one.

1612
01:44:41,001 --> 01:44:46,000
So this bit was like he's doing a
character, you're doing a with Craig or,

1613
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:51,260
and, and you're going like, hey mom.
And she was like, what? I guess what,

1614
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:54,060
what chicken button? And
she's like, all right.

1615
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:59,280
And then like she's on the
phone, mom. Guess what man?

1616
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:02,280
And she's like,
she's doing that thing like I'm on.

1617
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,030
And You keep like,

1618
01:45:05,031 --> 01:45:08,390
cause it feels like you know a kid
basically like I know what you're talking.

1619
01:45:08,391 --> 01:45:10,970
She's like, Oh for crying
what? Chicken Butt?

1620
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:13,550
And then it just keeps
building until you do it.

1621
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,570
She was in the bathroom and then like
in the middle of the night she's like,

1622
01:45:17,571 --> 01:45:22,340
oh it's fluorescent. Had those two
are set up. But that was perfect.

1623
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:27,120
Nailed it. Yeah, she's good. She
nailed it. She gets nervous and uh, uh,

1624
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:28,123
self doubt,

1625
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:32,960
which I recognized that was you
fooled me cause I was like Holy Shit.

1626
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:38,250
She's, it's four in the morning and
she's like, oh chicken by. Yeah.

1627
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:42,710
So that was like its own lane
of a type of video style.

1628
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:47,390
But then I think what's really blown
up is like your face swap character.

1629
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:52,430
Um, cause you have, you
know, like you do Trump ones,

1630
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:55,740
the Jenners the Kardashians. Yeah. Baby.

1631
01:45:57,940 --> 01:45:58,960
Yeah. They, uh,

1632
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:02,270
I first started just doing straight up
and then I was trying to figure out how

1633
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:05,720
to get them to talk to each other cause
it's people who have done it where they

1634
01:46:05,721 --> 01:46:06,740
just cut back and forth.

1635
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:10,940
So I thought about the facetiming
so can all see them at once,

1636
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:14,570
which works for the town.
When you do that family,

1637
01:46:14,571 --> 01:46:18,550
you're so good at the I put
a new one up today. Yeah.

1638
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,820
This shit makes me why you left

1639
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:27,170
your house burned down
for a minute there.

1640
01:46:27,171 --> 01:46:30,150
I thought I was going to suffer
the shame. Famous my nuts. Shack.

1641
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:32,623
You get all your,

1642
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:40,880
the first thing I did when I saw the
flames just grabbed my crotch and my

1643
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:45,230
Alexander McQueen stiletto pumps.
Yeah.

1644
01:46:45,231 --> 01:46:49,830
Then I ran back to get my Louis
Vuitton alligator duffle bag show.

1645
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:50,340
Beautiful.

1646
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:55,260
Like demands attention shy 17
Jimmy Choo and my dog checkers.

1647
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,260
But there was only enough time to
save tool. Those things girls. Oh,

1648
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:03,750
I think Sophie's choice. What's
that? What did you choose?

1649
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,510
Oh, checkers is fucking dad. Yeah.

1650
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:11,360
I had at least she's got my old
balls and stick to play with up us.

1651
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:19,410
Oh Man. Oh my God. You do that? Vacant
Kardashians think so, man. Oh yeah.

1652
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:24,070
Just put one up. Oh, this job one
sounds great. Yeah. CAITLIN's,

1653
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:29,440
wow. I love when people jump in. I like
when stormy jumps in on somebody's. Yeah.

1654
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,370
Really funny.
Yeah.

1655
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:33,540
Caitlin jumps in on now and they're
going to their magic and hit him from the

1656
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:34,800
lady I love about stormy two.

1657
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:38,160
Stormy's character is basically
an invention in a way.

1658
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:41,730
Like it's not really that storming body.
Yeah.

1659
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:44,400
I don't know how she talks about
it's perfect. You're like, oh yeah,

1660
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:47,520
that's the perfect character. If they
want you to imagine. Yeah. He's like, Oh,

1661
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:50,580
I'm not going to swallow. You can knock
anyone fucking your whole cog. Gotcha.

1662
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:55,260
Halfway down. Can we watch
this one? Yeah. Let's watch it.

1663
01:47:55,980 --> 01:48:00,780
This is the, this is a, what do you
call it? Hot off the press premiere.

1664
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:05,400
Okay. And we got who we got here.
Let's Dr Phil and Bill Maher. Bill,

1665
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,840
what the Fuck Your Bill Maher impression
you always knew you could do bill. Uh,

1666
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:14,220
I've done it for a few years.
Yeah. Do you remember doing him?

1667
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:16,770
Like did you used to watch, you
know, whatever his show was?

1668
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:21,840
Yeah and I yeah I was auditioning for
like mad TV or something and sort of try

1669
01:48:22,191 --> 01:48:24,970
to get it done and someone told me
once about like people who nail it,

1670
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,730
I've always like, you know, oh my God,

1671
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,910
I just got a flashback to
auditioning for mad TV. Yeah, me too.

1672
01:48:29,911 --> 01:48:31,410
I did a couple of times I feel,

1673
01:48:31,411 --> 01:48:36,411
I feel the chill cause like I remember
that I was doing something that was

1674
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:42,300
working like yeah, joke wise. And then
she goes like, do you do any impressions?

1675
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,040
And I go like, Nah. And she goes,

1676
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:48,810
and I remember her specifically going
tried Jack Black and I was like,

1677
01:48:48,811 --> 01:48:51,930
no. Okay. And I was like,

1678
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:56,070
I'm Jack Black. Hi, I'm Jay.
I was like, Hey, what's up?

1679
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:00,690
Like just imagine something just spiraling
out of control. And she was like, yeah,

1680
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:01,980
now that didn't really
work. I'm like, yeah,

1681
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:05,160
I didn't come in here saying I do a
Jack Black impression and your left,

1682
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:08,430
you left her with that impression.
And then she was just like, yeah,

1683
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:12,000
that wasn't really a, yeah, yeah. Spot on.
Impression, the Jack Black and I was like,

1684
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:14,010
I know a random person.

1685
01:49:14,011 --> 01:49:17,700
To me it has to be hard about those mad
TV auditions back in the day is that

1686
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:20,850
everyone was probably doing the same
fucking impressions is it was the same.

1687
01:49:20,851 --> 01:49:23,380
He was like Brittany Spears for walking.
Yeah.

1688
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,300
You really have to blow people away
with something original like that.

1689
01:49:27,850 --> 01:49:30,180
It's so hard. I went in, I auditioned for,

1690
01:49:30,181 --> 01:49:33,870
sorry live and you know they fly out to
New York and everything and while ago.

1691
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:37,610
Yeah, 2010 okay. And I,

1692
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,470
I like had evidence would be the
most nerve wracking thing. Right?

1693
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,130
I was out of my mind because like
you're in a hotel room for two days by

1694
01:49:44,131 --> 01:49:45,270
yourself running.

1695
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:49,630
I just ran it over and over and I was
like minutes and then I get there and I

1696
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:54,310
just was not in a place where I could
perform. I was just so nervous. Seriously.

1697
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:57,070
Yeah. And I was like please
not first. And they were like,

1698
01:49:57,130 --> 01:50:01,510
first up is Kyle done again? God.
And then they are miking man,

1699
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:03,520
I could tell I was,
I didn't have my a fist.

1700
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:06,370
They can't get to your
facilities when you're nervous,

1701
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,360
when you're really nervous.

1702
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:12,361
You couldn't even see the guy counting
me in was this the camera and goes,

1703
01:50:12,911 --> 01:50:15,730
I'll count you in three, two,
one you'll write in your stuff.

1704
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,100
It was really intense. Three
to one. So I go out there,

1705
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:21,730
I'm really hanging onto this and I
walk out there and like Lorne Michaels,

1706
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:25,230
everyone's on a table over here to
the left. And I just walked down.

1707
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:29,050
I kind of stood there like
waiting and nothing was happening.

1708
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:33,670
And then Lauren goes, hello, like hello?
Like say hi to us. I was like, oh hi, hi.

1709
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:37,060
Sorry. And I just kept staring,
waiting for that, count it.

1710
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:40,540
And the guy told me it was coming, it
wasn't coming. And then Lauren goes,

1711
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:45,280
are you okay? Which is like the
auditions now over the not started.

1712
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:49,800
So then I started to explain that, well
that guy and that guy goes three, two,

1713
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:53,630
you didn't wanna get in trouble. And I
couldn't, like I was trying to do, build,

1714
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:58,300
the voices weren't coming out of my mouth.
I was just too nervous.

1715
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,930
I'm scared. But they, in
their defense, they have to,

1716
01:51:04,931 --> 01:51:08,140
you gotta be able to perform live and
yeah, it should be a nerve wracking,

1717
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:10,960
a addition, whole law. He's nice.

1718
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:16,480
And that's a nice thing to
encourage young. The uh,

1719
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,490
I was talking to one of the Africa,

1720
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,930
one of the big comedy casting directors
here in town and I just for something

1721
01:51:22,931 --> 01:51:25,980
with her and I was like, you
know, every time you're the best,

1722
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:29,620
like she's always super sweet. Um, makes,

1723
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:34,500
makes the situation, Juliet,
Juliet might be great.

1724
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:40,040
It makes you feel really engaged and you
know what I mean? Like if she goes like,

1725
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,980
do you have any questions? If you're like,
I dunno. Do you have anything to add to?

1726
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:46,150
Yeah, we, the thing is I
think they're really looking
for it to be read like this.

1727
01:51:46,151 --> 01:51:50,200
You're like, I've had, I have, uh,
I was still used to her a few times.

1728
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:55,450
She cast me in something and then I went
to another one where I asked the same

1729
01:51:55,451 --> 01:51:59,320
way where I was like, uh,
is there anything that you
want to tell me about it?

1730
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:03,730
And she's like, that's for you to decide.
Oh, I was like, oh, so the answer is no.

1731
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,520
You're going to have anything to share.
Like you just,

1732
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:09,640
you don't have to be a dick about
it. Like, yeah, there's like a,

1733
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:12,880
I stopped going to auditions.
I don't know why I have an agent.

1734
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:16,360
I write the checks and
I go, wow, what's this?

1735
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:22,330
You got me zero things.
Yeah. In like a decade. No,

1736
01:52:22,331 --> 01:52:26,380
auditions even. I went on an
audition a year and a half ago.

1737
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:28,780
That's the last audition. Yeah, I got it.

1738
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:32,710
And then never got another audition for
you now I may got it. I should leave.

1739
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:35,400
That was just one of those
things where it's on your to
do list. Oh yeah, yeah. No,

1740
01:52:35,401 --> 01:52:39,310
I usually leave today. Yeah, send the
email on the way out. Okay, cool. I mean,

1741
01:52:39,311 --> 01:52:43,270
seriously. Yeah, but then he
gives you, you know, you go, well,

1742
01:52:43,271 --> 01:52:46,040
what if something comes up? But
no, but you get another agent

1743
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,510
though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No,
you're, you're not wrong. Yeah. Yeah.

1744
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:56,120
Um, all right, so we got Dr Phil,
we got Bill Maher and we have,

1745
01:52:56,290 --> 01:53:00,560
that's what I can do. I can be alone,
not auditioning. You just make something.

1746
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:03,260
It's hilarious. Right? That's
the thing is that you found this,

1747
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:07,430
I'm always so amazed at people that
take what's given to them in technology.

1748
01:53:07,431 --> 01:53:10,490
Like what you've done with face
swapping and then how are you,

1749
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:14,480
I don't know what you're using to even,
I can't give away my seat.

1750
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:18,280
Oh, how do I build it? Yeah.

1751
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,700
I'll just do the one who talks the most
first and I'll, I'll make like a script.

1752
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:26,360
So when I'm talking I'll
be talking in my mouth.

1753
01:53:26,361 --> 01:53:30,170
So at times out when I have to do
the other ones, I'll say their lines.

1754
01:53:31,330 --> 01:53:36,120
I love this DIY entertainment
purposes just for silly, but people,

1755
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:38,100
this is what comedians are so great at it.

1756
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:39,830
It's like he's taking what's available.

1757
01:53:39,831 --> 01:53:41,990
We've taken what's available
to you in this time and space,

1758
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:46,520
the technology and then making it work
for what you do and making it work in

1759
01:53:46,521 --> 01:53:49,190
your favor. Like it's, I just think it's
so great. I have a lot of free time.

1760
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:50,660
Such a great era we live in.
Yeah,

1761
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:54,620
it is cool how open it is and the things
that are going to be coming or going to

1762
01:53:54,621 --> 01:53:57,770
be surprising. I'm not sure what
to make it. If you want to make it,

1763
01:53:57,771 --> 01:54:00,950
you're fucking making this show is fucking
Megan. Just make it all right here.

1764
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:04,430
Here's the latest and greatest,
the newest version,

1765
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,490
a from Kyle done against Instagram page.

1766
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,420
It's at Kyle Dunnigan one.
Here we go.

1767
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:16,060
Okay guys. I got someone to fill out
a person for the golf game tomorrow,

1768
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:18,340
but it's a girl. Okay. Oh good.

1769
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:23,410
Is she a hot piece of ass clothes?
She's older and use to have a penis.

1770
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh,
not Caitlyn again,

1771
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:29,990
if she hits from the ladies tees this time
I'm not fucking playing. Okay. No, no,

1772
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:34,300

time now big. Get her on the horn. Oh,

1773
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:38,290
Haribo eyes. I'm going to wear my
Vera Wang Miniskirt tomorrow. Yap.

1774
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:42,730
Or as I like to call it,
my Vira no ag Gabay man.

1775
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:46,690
Caitlin, we respect you as a woman.
So we want to be delicate here.

1776
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:50,740
You're going from the men's
tees. You've got dude DNA. Sorry.

1777
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:55,480
Watch your mouth. Ash. How well you were
the number one male athlete in the world.

1778
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:58,960
You're not starting 40 fucking
yards ahead of us. Okay.

1779
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:01,030
Why are you pushing his
head from the ladies tees?

1780
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:04,420
And I'll hit from the pros and still kick
your panty. Asher's we, I don't know.

1781
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,470
Is it weird that just gave me a boner

1782
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:13,820
doctor Phil. Oh Great. I love it.

1783
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:17,270
It's so fucking funny, man.
Thank you. Will you, uh,

1784
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:20,810
you started my uh,
uh,

1785
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:23,180
W I don't wanna call explosion cause
people have a lot more followers.

1786
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:26,300
But you got over 400,000,

1787
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:30,800
I think I had 19,000 when you've
posted a no, I have like 407.

1788
01:55:30,801 --> 01:55:33,950
So that's was wild. Then you
start posting seven. My Shit.

1789
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:38,990
Do you feel like I owe you? Yeah, of
course. Of course. Yeah, absolutely.

1790
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:42,020
Especially like after what
you put me through and, um,

1791
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:43,980
where are we did odd
together and you made me

1792
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,130
go in your dressing room and like,
why should you do all this stuff?

1793
01:55:47,131 --> 01:55:51,480
That was a bad time. That's lifetime.
That's what you owe me for. Um,

1794
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:57,210
I'll tell you later off my, I don't want
to get her showing up for a lady's ears.

1795
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:00,420
Um,
but the bill Maher one is just,

1796
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:05,220
I don't think sometimes there's
public figures who you realize, oh,

1797
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,530
I've never heard an impression of
that person. And then when you do it,

1798
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,660
that's the one that's, that's what,
what stands out about Bill Maher?

1799
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:11,490
I don't think I've ever heard
someone do an impression.

1800
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:15,290
And when you do the impression I have
to double check. It's not him talking.

1801
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,500
You paypal, I went on a
trip with him. You did.

1802
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,310
This is so random, but like
military, well I was going,

1803
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,970
I was going to Hawaii
with my girlfriend and uh,

1804
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:28,770
she missed a plane and it broad,

1805
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:33,610
so she a bitch. It was Sarah
Silverman. You Fendler God,

1806
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:37,990
Bill Marras good friends with her and he's
like, just come on our plane. You know,

1807
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:42,690
he had his own private jet so he went on
there and it clearly like he was bummed

1808
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:47,610
I was a tag along. Ah,
Timmy. He was anyway. Yeah,

1809
01:56:47,611 --> 01:56:48,930
he really was.

1810
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:53,040
He made no effort to make
me feel at all comfortable.

1811
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:57,480
But look, by the way, Ron, huge shocker.

1812
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:00,930
I mean bill seems like the kind of guy
that would go out of his way to make

1813
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:04,470
everybody feel comfortable. He had never
heard a story where it was like, oh,

1814
01:57:04,471 --> 01:57:08,700
and then build it this.
I did a standup show with him ages ago,

1815
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:10,230
over a decade ago,

1816
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:14,550
and I was on the same lineup as him and
he kept asking me to bring him drinks

1817
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:19,080
and I was like, I'm a comic. And
I did tell him like two times.

1818
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:23,850
I'm not a waitress here, bro.
Like I can't even remember.

1819
01:57:23,851 --> 01:57:26,220
It was so long ago was
it was at a restaurant.

1820
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:29,010
We don't want all fair and
bringing me a drink. Yeah. Yeah.

1821
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:33,350
How would you say you bring me a drink?
Sweethearts.

1822
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,790
Sweeter.
I was in a,

1823
01:57:35,791 --> 01:57:40,791
he was in a dressing room
and at the Pasadena Club was
ice house and it's packed

1824
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:44,130
and there's nowhere to let go hang like
all the comedians have to be and he

1825
01:57:44,131 --> 01:57:46,820
kicked everyone out of the dressing
room or I'll just stand there like he,

1826
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:51,540
he did, we're not, we weren't allowed
her own in the green room. You know,

1827
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:55,410
it's weird. We're all standing in the
hallway because bill needs the green room.

1828
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:57,030
Bill needs his space

1829
01:57:58,690 --> 01:58:03,000
so it needs a space to read over what
the riders told him to say tonight. Okay,

1830
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,060
fine. Yeah. Um, you know,

1831
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:08,970
it's always amazing to me when people
are like that because it's so much easier

1832
01:58:08,971 --> 01:58:13,080
just to be nice to people. But then
you learn their store and you'll, oh,

1833
01:58:13,081 --> 01:58:14,430
they make sense.
I get that.

1834
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:17,790
I didn't learn too much about someone
because you always end up liking them,

1835
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:20,420
you know, you go, oh, that's why
they're like that. Why is he like that?

1836
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,610
It's probably a combination of stuff maybe
ignored by girls and he's younger and

1837
01:58:24,611 --> 01:58:25,530
maybe a,
I don't know.

1838
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:30,540
His Dad did something and we saw being
tough is a way of getting respect.

1839
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:34,560
Sure.
He looks at people who are nice as weak.

1840
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:36,240
That's what Trump is like a little bit,

1841
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:41,350
but that's big in my culture
and Hungarian stuff. Yeah.

1842
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:42,100
If you're like,

1843
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,950
Americans are like donkeys to them.
Kind of like my step mom.

1844
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:48,400
Like if we go to a restaurant
and the waiter will be
super nice, like, Hey folks,

1845
01:58:48,401 --> 01:58:52,510
how you doing? It was met with
contempt. You calling goes folks,

1846
01:58:52,511 --> 01:58:56,280
we got to fight and like it's seen
as total weakness. Yeah. Interesting.

1847
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:59,400
Yeah. Well that Rooskie culture
too. You know the, you know the,

1848
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:04,300
if you see the like Putin a photo ops,

1849
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:09,400
it's always oh yeah. Oh yeah. Because
they think were goofballs. If we go like,

1850
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:13,900
yeah, smile, joy. Oh yeah.
Like what are you a fucking
clown? Yeah. Like soft smiling.

1851
01:59:13,901 --> 01:59:17,590
Why are you smiling? So say, yeah.
Who's that? That's cultural. Yeah.

1852
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:22,120
These are always not smiling photos.
Yeah. It started like, oh, right.

1853
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:25,660
Like if you look at early photography,
I guess they just stand there for so long.

1854
01:59:25,661 --> 01:59:28,930
That's why. Yeah, that's true.

1855
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:33,280
But it's every photo like early
twenties thirties everyone's like,

1856
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:37,450
yeah. And that's, that's the
lovely photo of the person.

1857
01:59:37,451 --> 01:59:41,260
Just a marriage, like my grandparents
marriage photo. They're just like,

1858
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:43,390
it looks like on a terrible time.
Yeah.

1859
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:46,750
Yeah. So if I, I try because I want to
look cool. You know how some people,

1860
01:59:46,751 --> 01:59:50,290
comedians can take pictures with fans
and they keep a straight face and they

1861
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:53,680
look really interesting.
Like it's like they're making a choice.

1862
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:57,880
I look so unfriendly when I don't smile.
You always look on friendly. Really? Well,

1863
01:59:57,881 --> 02:00:02,560
you didn't want to, oh, it's the worst.
Like I just looked so depressed and like,

1864
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:03,523
what does he look?

1865
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:07,650
Let me see. Well, it's very slight,

1866
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:11,430
really. It feels very like
eastern blocky and shitty.

1867
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:16,080
Some people have got formed around
a frowny, oh, I don't have a frowny,

1868
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:20,160
but you carry, you look like
you care to be look cool and no,

1869
02:00:20,161 --> 02:00:22,140
that's the thing is I want to look cool.
Yeah.

1870
02:00:22,141 --> 02:00:24,750
And then every time someone wants
to take a photograph with me,

1871
02:00:24,751 --> 02:00:29,220
I'm so amazed that anybody wants to, yeah.
But I'm like, I'm like, oh, yeah, sure.

1872
02:00:29,221 --> 02:00:31,590
Okay. Yeah, no, I got to
do it like I'm too excited.

1873
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:33,870
[inaudible] song on too long mirror,

1874
02:00:33,870 --> 02:00:38,590
like ready to go. I want to
be good looking and I was
still hanging on to that.

1875
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:41,850
I didn't,
I've maybe peaked at a six and I'll try.

1876
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:46,290
It's just getting uglier every day today.
Jane. Yeah. Yeah. We look in the mirror.

1877
02:00:46,291 --> 02:00:50,790
I think I'm tired. Yeah. And then
I go, no, you're dying. Yeah,

1878
02:00:50,791 --> 02:00:54,840
you are. Yeah, totally. Yeah. You know
what's nice is that we have some like,

1879
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:57,280
so that we're able to do things like this,
we have some help,

1880
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:58,810
like a nanny at the house.
Yeah.

1881
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:02,200
And a lot of times she'll tell me
how tired I look. Yeah. And um,

1882
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:06,720
it's something that's new that like
sometimes it was a thought of mine where I

1883
02:01:06,721 --> 02:01:09,540
look in the mirror and you think they
look tired, but then you're like,

1884
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:12,480
don't beat yourself up. And then
I'll see her and she's like, dumb.

1885
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:17,190
You look very tired today. And I'm like,
I feel okay. Yeah. I'm glad I look tired.

1886
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:20,400
And is it, you're always, you always
look like that? Yeah, I did notice.

1887
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:23,700
I think I was looking like that.
No one was telling me that,

1888
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:27,350
but now I get to hear it all the time.
That's true. It's nice. I want to Ne,

1889
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:31,150
I want like a night nanny just for me.
Like when you're typing or the couch,

1890
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:34,470
you gotta get to bed and Floss,
pick you up.

1891
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:39,090
They floss your teeth and lay it
out or your bum. That'd be awesome.

1892
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:40,070
How do your bum,

1893
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,610
yes.

1894
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:44,540
Maybe we could start this other thing
about like falling apart as we age is that

1895
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:45,410
because I,

1896
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:50,650
I was really even really fat at 1718 you
realize that a lot of your friends that

1897
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:56,630
weren't, they get fat as they get in
their forties and then you're like, oh,

1898
02:01:56,631 --> 02:02:01,080
you look bad now you got fat. But because
I was fat then. Oh, that's cool. I'm like,

1899
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:05,210
I either look better than I did or
I maintained. Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

1900
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:07,880
It was a silver lining for us.
So if you're like young and fat,

1901
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:12,140
you have that to look forward to.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry,

1902
02:02:12,141 --> 02:02:16,190
I forgot what I was going to fucking, God
damn it. I bet it was going to be good.

1903
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:20,510
Here's the thing,
as long as you can stay skinny as you age,

1904
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:24,050
I feel like that's the key.
You don't want to be fat and old.

1905
02:02:24,051 --> 02:02:25,760
If you can maintain your weight.

1906
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:28,680
Does it give away the,
for me from my body,

1907
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:31,260
I have an unusual body
but I can very thin,

1908
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:34,680
but my gut will just come
straight out like a pregnant man.

1909
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:39,450
You ever thought about just like skipping
food altogether? Yeah, there's a family.

1910
02:02:39,451 --> 02:02:43,230
They just eat off the universe and light
and you see that article last week,

1911
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,620
it's gotta be a lie.

1912
02:02:44,621 --> 02:02:48,510
But they have kids and they say they just
like stare at the sun and you take the

1913
02:02:48,511 --> 02:02:51,360
universe of energy and they
don't eat food. They're called.

1914
02:02:51,361 --> 02:02:55,670
There's also a group of
people called breadth Ariens
where they breathe in. Yeah,

1915
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:59,380
yeah, yeah. Hey, that's
pretty cool. I do that too.

1916
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:05,220
Are you a food guy though? I mean, is that
your indulgence? No, I, I love food. But,

1917
02:03:05,221 --> 02:03:10,050
uh, I mean they had a lot of chocolate
too much, but, uh, but now I'm not a fool.

1918
02:03:11,130 --> 02:03:12,900
I, yeah. I'm like, Nah,

1919
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:17,820
I have tiny bones in guy,
but like my BMI,

1920
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:21,930
BMI is bad. Like my, my
hips are really smart bike,

1921
02:03:21,931 --> 02:03:26,070
which goes from like hip, stomach
ratios. Good. Yeah. I'm an illusion.

1922
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:30,420
There's something very, uh, lives, a
lot of weird things about my body. Like,

1923
02:03:30,421 --> 02:03:34,080
don't look right now, but
like, I hurt my neck one time.

1924
02:03:34,650 --> 02:03:36,840
This is actually a weird story,
but I was having a dream.

1925
02:03:36,841 --> 02:03:39,270
I was twisting off the top
to a giant coke bottle,

1926
02:03:39,271 --> 02:03:43,410
can like a seven foot thing
and I'm twisting it and I
woke up in agonizing pain

1927
02:03:43,411 --> 02:03:45,540
with my hands wrapped around my head.

1928
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:48,000
Yeah.
Twisted my own head.

1929
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:53,450
So then I know that sounds
almost unbelievable. Yeah.
And never happened again.

1930
02:03:53,451 --> 02:03:56,670
Just one time weird thing. And
you're like, ah, my fucking neck.

1931
02:03:56,730 --> 02:03:59,010
I woke up just staring
at the ceiling and pain.

1932
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:03,010
Aren't those dreams the most
unbelievable. When you, when you are,

1933
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:06,420
it's so vivid and you get
up and you're like, oh,

1934
02:04:06,430 --> 02:04:09,390
and you realize you're not there. Yeah.
Yeah. I feel like I want those more.

1935
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:12,240
I don't have it then. They're
good. They're good. Yeah.

1936
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:14,670
You know what I used to do
when I had head gear as a kid,

1937
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:19,500
I would rip off the head gear in my
slack. Throw it across the world. Yeah,

1938
02:04:19,501 --> 02:04:22,900
you too. Yeah. Yeah. And I wake up
in the morning, I'm like, oh my God,

1939
02:04:22,901 --> 02:04:24,960
I am not wearing my head gear.
And it was like in the closet.

1940
02:04:24,961 --> 02:04:29,180
I'd thrown it across to hop out.
And the kit your cheek, did your,

1941
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:32,550
did your head turning thing actually
resulted in neck injury? Yeah,

1942
02:04:32,551 --> 02:04:37,230
I had a neck brace on my Instagram. That
picture you can see a neck brace. Yeah.

1943
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:37,980
And I had

1944
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,060
it on for almost a year, but the
reason I could have had it on the last,

1945
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,190
what I realized is I,

1946
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:47,010
the muscles go around the injury and they
like tighten around it. And I didn't,

1947
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:50,760
I didn't, uh, I kept tweaking
it, thinking it was still hurt,

1948
02:04:50,761 --> 02:04:53,070
but it was to the muscles that
needed to be stretched out.

1949
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:54,871
But I went to the doctor,

1950
02:04:54,871 --> 02:04:59,100
I've got an extra eye and the doctor was
looking at my extra way for a while and

1951
02:04:59,101 --> 02:05:02,960
uh, then he calls it another
dogs. Hey John, come in
here. Cause another doctrine,

1952
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:06,980
another staring at Max. Right. You don't
want your doctor to look at your ex.

1953
02:05:06,981 --> 02:05:11,340
Right. Like he's never seen. So I was
like, what am I dying? Like what's up?

1954
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:16,910
And he goes, you have the neck
of a seven foot man. Why? Yeah,

1955
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,230
lot. That's what they
told me. And that was,

1956
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:23,200
that had anything to do with the injury
or there now? Oh, just in general? Yeah.

1957
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:26,260
Like your neck. Like uh, let me see that.

1958
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:30,870
Oh yeah. I know. I don't
think it was seven feet,

1959
02:05:30,871 --> 02:05:35,690
but I think it looks like a graceful
neck. It's very regal. But my,

1960
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:39,100
I'm five nine so I have the
legs of a 12 year old girls.

1961
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,970
It's crazy that you did that to yourself
and your sleep because don't they say

1962
02:05:41,971 --> 02:05:45,480
you can't actually physically like punch
yourself or harm yourself because the

1963
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:50,120
body won't, your brain won't allow,
but I guess when you're, yeah, you can,

1964
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:54,180
you can do it too. And if you're asleep
you could do some bad things, I'm sure.

1965
02:05:54,370 --> 02:05:57,240
Cause you're, you don't have that
awareness. Oh my God, that's terrifying.

1966
02:05:57,241 --> 02:05:58,860
I feel like I've grown out of,

1967
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:02,940
I was always like doing like
things were like a dream.

1968
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:07,020
I had some treme issues, not sleep
walking, but like moving around.

1969
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:11,460
A lot of really active sleeper
just kind of went away.

1970
02:06:11,790 --> 02:06:16,020
That's good. Yeah. But uh, yeah,

1971
02:06:16,021 --> 02:06:20,220
I grew up in a, I'm just gonna
start talking about myself. So, uh,

1972
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:24,600
my name's Kyle and Kyle.
What's your middle name?
Anthony. Oh, it's good to eat.

1973
02:06:24,601 --> 02:06:28,830
Galliano um,
I didn't mean to hijack this show.

1974
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,940
We're talking to do it. No, we want to
know more about you. I was just like,

1975
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:34,650
thinking about myself and started talking
about something we love your commeddia.

1976
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:37,890
Um, yeah. What do you
want to know about me?

1977
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:41,490
Give you a question and only child,
no.

1978
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:46,170
Last baby of how many?
Three total. Three total.

1979
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:49,590
Yeah.
And those two older brother cop.

1980
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,190
And a hardest job by the way.
Not hardest may have,

1981
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:58,200
but I mean he just goes, you go where
people are being assholes all day long,

1982
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,040
all day. It's called racist
stuff. He just tested,

1983
02:07:02,041 --> 02:07:05,160
keep taking it and you go on with the
turn on the TV and the TV kind of tells

1984
02:07:05,161 --> 02:07:08,670
you you're a racist cop.
He said to take it to take everything.

1985
02:07:09,650 --> 02:07:14,340
Is He east coast guy? Good guy though.
Yeah. Good guy. There's some good cops.

1986
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:15,350
I mean cops do.
There's,

1987
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:18,990
you know what happens is we highlight
the bad cops cause there's bad people in

1988
02:07:18,991 --> 02:07:20,490
there. Their stories. Yeah. Well yeah.

1989
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:24,600
So you know the stories about the bad
ones are so bad that that becomes kind of

1990
02:07:24,601 --> 02:07:29,090
the narrative for cats. But there's
obviously good cops. The cops,

1991
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:31,320
especially the older I get
and I'm kids and stuff,

1992
02:07:31,321 --> 02:07:34,410
mortgaged property and a lot
of them come over, come over.

1993
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:38,230
They got a lot of pressure
on them and it's just a bear.

1994
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:41,650
You have to have a really strong sense
of yourself and patients because even you

1995
02:07:41,651 --> 02:07:42,700
go back to the precinct,

1996
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:45,460
everyone's kind of being an asshole
because they're bringing in, they're like,

1997
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:46,870
we're done ride alongs.
Yeah.

1998
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:52,030
I've done a few in different cities and
it's always an entertaining and learning

1999
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:55,990
experience. I've done it in North
Carolina. I went out with a cop,

2000
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:58,630
I went out with a black cop. We wanted
to go different experiences, you know.

2001
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,600
Then I went out in Tacoma with a cop.
We,

2002
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:05,090
you studying it for a role or are
you doing this the first time I,

2003
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:09,730
I knew the guy from another job I had to
because he worked part time at cops can

2004
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:13,330
have sometimes multiple jobs.
Yeah. Which is kind of wild.

2005
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:18,650
At one time was a fan of this show and
one time it was for a research thing for

2006
02:08:19,361 --> 02:08:21,430
a role and that,
but that was here in Hollywood.

2007
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:27,350
And what I found was that most in
all three different areas, the um,

2008
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:31,600
the cops dealt the most with just
mental illness all the time. Yeah. Yeah.

2009
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:35,200
Just all day. I was like, how much
of your like day is mental illness?

2010
02:08:35,201 --> 02:08:35,601
And they're like,

2011
02:08:35,601 --> 02:08:40,601
like 85% of these people were either
drunk drugs or mental illnesses and then

2012
02:08:41,141 --> 02:08:43,300
like they're like fucked up
things like the drop off.

2013
02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:47,710
So somebody who's just mentally ill
at a hospital and then they're like,

2014
02:08:47,711 --> 02:08:49,990
he's like,
I'll pick them up tomorrow somewhere else.

2015
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:53,280
I'm dropping off at a different
hospital. Oh Wow. And that, that's there.

2016
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:58,060
You see the Ron Coleman documentary on
Netflix, the Ron Coleman. Ronnie Coleman.

2017
02:08:58,061 --> 02:09:02,590
The bodybuilder? No. And Mr,
I've heard from multiple people.

2018
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:04,630
Unbelievable.
He had a fulltime cop.

2019
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:09,040
He's a cop fulltime and mystery
at the same time. Which no,

2020
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,250
he was a cop as he was Mister Olympia.

2021
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:16,830
No one has ever had a full time job and
been Mr Lindhout move and be like with

2022
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:18,430
that.
You know what I mean?

2023
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:22,960
Like how did he run after somebody
with that just giant such a monster?

2024
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:25,600
Well now he's supposed to be in a
wheelchair. The doctors are like,

2025
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:28,930
you should be in a wheelchair. His back
is so screwed up, but he's so strong.

2026
02:09:28,931 --> 02:09:33,280
He's like willing himself around on these
like crutches and he still gets up at

2027
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:37,540
4:30 AM every morning and goes to the gym.
The doctors are like,

2028
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:41,050
don't do that. Go. And he just
keeps going. It's pretty impressive.

2029
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,280
I'm like trying to be wild
and a lot like that guy.

2030
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:47,170
So you have this pig brother
and then your other sibling,

2031
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:52,470
she is a, uh, pig mum.
She is, yeah. She said,

2032
02:09:52,471 --> 02:09:57,470
mom, mom, she picked mom, but
she's not a cop. Oh, thank God.

2033
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:02,280
Just too two kids.

2034
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:05,440
I always wonder because
like you have this quirky,

2035
02:10:05,441 --> 02:10:07,630
it's a very defined sense of humor.
Right.

2036
02:10:07,631 --> 02:10:11,830
And then it's the kind of thing where
to me, like the way I would phrase it,

2037
02:10:11,831 --> 02:10:14,770
all these things are subjective and
the way, but I would still check,

2038
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:19,870
I would describe it like,
people who I think are funny
would find you funny. They,

2039
02:10:19,871 --> 02:10:23,800
you know what I mean? And
are your siblings, are they
like, he's fucking weird?

2040
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:24,850
Or do they,
it was,

2041
02:10:24,851 --> 02:10:28,580
I felt very alone and like what I thought
was funny when I was younger. Yeah.

2042
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,930
My brother's cool. And, uh, he,

2043
02:10:31,931 --> 02:10:35,960
he makes suggestions are always about
like farting or something. Sure.

2044
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:39,620
So we like him already. Yeah. He's
cool. Yeah. But your big sister,

2045
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:43,430
my big sister does not understand me.
We love her. We love each other. Right.

2046
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:46,990
I mean I always, I was an
odd child too, you know,

2047
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,040
they didn't test for things back then,

2048
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:53,850
but I would apply a kite for hours and
just pee my pants and just keep flying.

2049
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:57,470
I was that kind of kid focused and
once you were on something, yeah,

2050
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:01,730
I would get hyper. I think it's a burger
types. Your videos. It's my videos.

2051
02:11:01,731 --> 02:11:05,510
Your videos are hyper focused. You'd
get distracted for hours. Yeah.

2052
02:11:05,511 --> 02:11:08,690
I didn't make that just to
show people kind of do that.

2053
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:13,280
And I think it's uh, I don't
know. It hurts me in some ways.

2054
02:11:13,281 --> 02:11:16,660
Like I leave my car door
or open the other day,

2055
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:19,880
just I'll just leave my car running.
Stuff like that happens.

2056
02:11:19,881 --> 02:11:22,070
If I'm thinking about something else,
it's dangerous.

2057
02:11:22,071 --> 02:11:24,690
I probably shouldn't have
a kid talking about before.

2058
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:29,690
It's dangerous. That's
interesting. Are Our boys,

2059
02:11:29,691 --> 02:11:33,470
like Ellis has kinda hyperfocused where
he can do an activity from the time he

2060
02:11:33,471 --> 02:11:35,870
was, I don't know, 15 months old,

2061
02:11:35,871 --> 02:11:39,740
like he'll just play with water in
the sink for literally the first time.

2062
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:42,260
It was two and a half hours
and I just let him, yeah.

2063
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:45,720
What about on the love cycle?
Are you a Tinder?

2064
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:50,120
The love I just got on some
apps. It's going terribly.
Yeah. But you just started,

2065
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:51,690
oh,
Don,

2066
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:55,490
will you please tell us what kind of
picture are you leading with and what type

2067
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:58,160
of bio are you putting up there?
It's very important.

2068
02:11:58,190 --> 02:12:02,060
I don't have that many pictures of myself.
You putting up a good big picture of,

2069
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:06,770
yeah, I'm the first profile pic. I guess
they'll click a nine, nine and a half.

2070
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,510
Okay. Oh Wow. Um,

2071
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:13,000
second one's probably a
little less than that then.

2072
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:15,890
They're not great picks. I didn't
think a lot about it, but they're fine.

2073
02:12:15,891 --> 02:12:18,700
I look fine. But you're not
doing jokey pictures go? No,

2074
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:21,980
just like straight up whatever.
But I had a breakup, uh,

2075
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:25,790
in early September and it was,

2076
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:28,240
we were long distance
for a couple of years.

2077
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:32,590
Then she moved in and five days
later we broke up. Why, you know,

2078
02:12:32,591 --> 02:12:36,140
how it is to move an entire person's
life into your, wait a minute.

2079
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:38,870
How long were you together?
Long Distance. Like two years.

2080
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:43,970
And we're talking like another coast?
No, Las Vegas. Okay. That's not too far.

2081
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:45,020
And I thought there was a,

2082
02:12:45,021 --> 02:12:49,130
there was a little bit of jealousy and
going through my things breaking into my

2083
02:12:49,131 --> 02:12:53,360
emails stuff. Which is not
accepted after you moved in? No,

2084
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:55,880
this is before I justified like,
oh,

2085
02:12:55,881 --> 02:12:59,940
once she moves in because everything
else was great. She'll see, I don't know,

2086
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:03,380
do anything and she'll like,
um, not be jealous or something.

2087
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:05,300
But when she moved in I realized,

2088
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:09,650
Oh this is just how it's going to always
be if my whole life maybe worse and

2089
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:11,750
five days later,
yeah,

2090
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:16,190
this was five days later and it hit me
at Starbucks and Whitney Cummings walked

2091
02:13:16,191 --> 02:13:20,670
in in that moment oddly
that sees you like that.

2092
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:24,440
Actually, she has a picture of me
with like my hands and my head,

2093
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:29,570
but she gave me good advice.
Should go back to the house,
break up and then leave.

2094
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:34,320
Don't get to negotiation is good advice
because I went back as a really bad,

2095
02:13:34,321 --> 02:13:38,160
but I was like, you know, you stay
here and you know I'm going to go. And,

2096
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:42,300
but then she didn't leave.
Like I was homeless for like nine hours.

2097
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:46,080
She didn't leave the house. She didn't
leave. And then she texted me, okay,

2098
02:13:46,081 --> 02:13:50,340
I'm gone. You can cut back. I go back,
it's dark now. Lights are off. Cars gone.

2099
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:55,330
She's not gone. She's in
the house hiding in my, no,

2100
02:13:55,870 --> 02:14:00,630
no. You know, like a
murderer. What sounds good.

2101
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:05,590
John Molina is like a murderer.
You chair.

2102
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:07,300
Um, so I, yeah,

2103
02:14:07,301 --> 02:14:11,860
I went in my house and my dog came up
to me who I talked to like an insane

2104
02:14:11,861 --> 02:14:16,300
person and I was, this just came out
of me. I go tough night to my dog,

2105
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:20,090
which she must've heard
here. Oh God. Yeah.

2106
02:14:20,620 --> 02:14:23,530
And I turned the corner.
It's like a hey,

2107
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:28,030
but wait a week.
So she's a nightmare.

2108
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:32,890
And then tough night to my dog and
then I turned the corner. I was like,

2109
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:35,300
oh look, I made a, another um,

2110
02:14:35,590 --> 02:14:40,590
feminine sound and then she kinda got
up and got our stuff and didn't like,

2111
02:14:40,691 --> 02:14:43,120
she tried to like join it a
whole hog for a little bit.

2112
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:46,270
Like how did you initially
realize that someone's,

2113
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:48,140
that you feel the energy or you hurt?
Oh,

2114
02:14:48,141 --> 02:14:51,640
I will turn the corner and
I was terrified. You saw
her? Yes. And you're like,

2115
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:56,470
fuck yeah. I was like, Huh? Like that. Did
you go, like you said you were gone? No,

2116
02:14:56,471 --> 02:14:58,870
cause she immediately started
like trying to pull me down.

2117
02:14:58,871 --> 02:15:02,370
They just hold may kind of stuff. I
wanted to maybe have, you see Kay,

2118
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:03,540
maybe makeup,

2119
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:08,410
but I think top night and he made
her feel like not that attractive.

2120
02:15:08,411 --> 02:15:12,400
So she left. But anyway,
since went on bumble,

2121
02:15:12,401 --> 02:15:16,600
went on hinge and a, I've
had, I try to smash dog,

2122
02:15:16,601 --> 02:15:21,100
but why don't you get on Tinder? I, I'm
actually want a relationship. Really?

2123
02:15:21,130 --> 02:15:25,870
Yeah. I mean I'm all forced mansion. Maybe
I should say that. That's cool. Yeah.

2124
02:15:25,871 --> 02:15:29,750
I like just banging. Yeah, Bro. Why don't
you do a, why don't you do a bang to get,

2125
02:15:30,050 --> 02:15:33,620
cause you got to get the relationship
out of your system. Get a fresh bang,

2126
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:37,670
then go into looking for the relief.
You know what I mean? Bang. Bang.

2127
02:15:37,671 --> 02:15:40,670
My way to love. Well, I'm saying
just get a bang out of the way. Yeah.

2128
02:15:40,671 --> 02:15:43,790
You got to bus the first
post relationship. You got
to clean those pipes out.

2129
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:47,000
Yeah. You got to meet some Tinder
chicks. You know Tinder chicks are cool.

2130
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:51,830
I have come all over my face, so just go
on Tinder. Yeah. All right. Sounds way.

2131
02:15:51,831 --> 02:15:53,630
Cray cray though. Yeah, she was.

2132
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:58,010
I'm what's up with your picker as a
Patti Stanger but she was great in every

2133
02:15:58,011 --> 02:16:02,030
other aspect of stalking and
that kind of being, yeah,

2134
02:16:02,031 --> 02:16:05,180
by allying. Sure. Just two bars.

2135
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:08,430
He's hiding in the home as that.
That was it.

2136
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:10,430
Everything else funny that
you should taste the regs.

2137
02:16:10,431 --> 02:16:14,140
I mean she can do the sunny side up
going through. You're going, man,

2138
02:16:14,150 --> 02:16:17,870
I ask you this because I want an a day
and I think this is inappropriate with

2139
02:16:17,871 --> 02:16:21,980
this girl. Oh boy. I inappropriate
like bad at this stuff.

2140
02:16:22,130 --> 02:16:25,970
So I try to be a good guy and like
I plan the date and I do this thing.

2141
02:16:25,971 --> 02:16:28,370
So you know you're here. You're
supposed to do, that's enough.

2142
02:16:28,371 --> 02:16:30,760
Let's see what it says.
Yo Joe Mother fucker. Yo.

2143
02:16:31,410 --> 02:16:34,930
It's kind of inappropriate isn't
it? Yeah. I thought it was just me.

2144
02:16:35,170 --> 02:16:38,980
So I plan this data at a paint and
sip, you know, that is paint and

2145
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:42,640
drink wine.
That's kind of a cute idea.

2146
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:47,470
That correct the date one date two.
Okay. And we have a little bit,

2147
02:16:47,471 --> 02:16:52,090
uh, okay. So I go, uh,
it's texts ends with like,

2148
02:16:52,210 --> 02:16:57,190
great, see you there. See you then. Great.
You know, and so the day of I write,

2149
02:16:57,250 --> 02:17:01,570
Hey, do you wanna meet there at
some, uh, six 45? And she writes, um,

2150
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:06,660
are we still going? Yeah, that's a
weird answer. Like, why would we,

2151
02:17:06,690 --> 02:17:10,230
yeah, see. And I said, what do you mean?
And she did, I haven't heard from you.

2152
02:17:10,410 --> 02:17:14,340
So I assume we just weren't
having a read for how long,

2153
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:18,930
exactly two days. We'd shored up
the day and the day of, I was like,

2154
02:17:18,931 --> 02:17:23,790
how about this time? That's it. Hmm. So
anyway, then this whole thing blew up. We,

2155
02:17:23,850 --> 02:17:28,500
we, uh, saw each other
again. Wait a minute. Yeah.

2156
02:17:28,650 --> 02:17:33,120
So the date was fine. Like what did you
end up going? Yeah. And it was okay.

2157
02:17:33,121 --> 02:17:38,040
It just was, that was a weird thing. She
was just being really insecure. I, yeah,

2158
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:41,850
I think no filter.
And she felt insulted that I,

2159
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:46,410
that you didn't call or the day before
all saying there's rules and I did so

2160
02:17:46,411 --> 02:17:48,300
many things right.
I think I planned the thing,

2161
02:17:48,301 --> 02:17:50,270
I bought that there's like a
hundred bucks. I mean I'm a okay.

2162
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:55,330
You gotta check in though.
You got to confirm the date.
24 hours. I would confirm,

2163
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:59,440
but it was confirmed it two days prior,
but then the day before be like, Hey,

2164
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:02,940
are we still good? Was the
day or maybe the day of, okay,

2165
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:06,400
are we still good for tonight? Cause
that's what he did. He come up. Oh.

2166
02:18:06,401 --> 02:18:09,460
And then she, yeah, I kind of,
I might, sorry, I misunderstood.

2167
02:18:09,461 --> 02:18:11,770
So I think you're getting two
days before he's like, hey,

2168
02:18:11,771 --> 02:18:14,770
we'll meet up on a couple of days. That's
fine. And then the day of, he's like,

2169
02:18:14,771 --> 02:18:17,070
we're still good. Normally
that's where the inbounds, yeah,

2170
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:21,640
I fought mixed suddenly there's
like months ago and by, yeah,

2171
02:18:21,730 --> 02:18:22,563
that's silly.

2172
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,760
So we had as followup day.

2173
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:28,420
Is this an interesting story because
you guys can just cut this out.

2174
02:18:28,421 --> 02:18:32,650
I don't know. No, no, no, no. Um,
all right. So then we had this, uh,

2175
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:37,810
this is, this is my first foray
into dating. I love it after this.

2176
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:40,510
This is what happens. So, um,

2177
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:45,980
yeah, I'm getting too distracted to crazy
girls. I could tell you right now. Yeah,

2178
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:47,570
yeah, yeah. Your pickers

2179
02:18:47,810 --> 02:18:50,780
fucked up. Yeah. Well, this is the
only person that I've matched with,

2180
02:18:50,781 --> 02:18:54,280
so it's really bumbled pictures. Wait,
so this is the same girl though? No, yes.

2181
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:57,950
That I like. Are we still meeting up?
It's been a fucking eight minutes.

2182
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:00,290
We're still going. Okay. I probably
should have said right there. Okay.

2183
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:04,970
Cancel this day. And then we had a good
time. And so then you had a good time.

2184
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:08,600
Had a good time. Okay. And
then that data ends. Yeah.

2185
02:19:08,601 --> 02:19:13,190
And then we had plans and uh,
I wasn't feeling great, so I,

2186
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:16,180
you know, told her I wasn't
feeling great and uh, I was like,

2187
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:20,090
why don't I give you 1%, uh,
uh, are you free Tuesday,

2188
02:19:20,091 --> 02:19:24,620
which is the next day, you
know, the next available we had,

2189
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:28,220
we had a Monday date, two
could, how about Tuesday?

2190
02:19:28,221 --> 02:19:31,910
Cause I wanted to make sure I was
100% or are you getting Sunday?

2191
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:33,140
Where are you getting sick?
Yes.

2192
02:19:33,141 --> 02:19:37,970
Wasn't feeling Sundays when you went to
paint and drink? No. When did you go?

2193
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:41,270
A week earlier. Okay. And then
Sunday you hit her up like, yeah,

2194
02:19:41,271 --> 02:19:46,110
we'd been texting and it was cool.
And then, um, we decided Monday we'd,

2195
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:48,200
we'd see each other again.
But when Sunday came around,

2196
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:50,480
I knew she was sensitive up day of stuff.
So I said,

2197
02:19:50,481 --> 02:19:54,440
let me tell her now just in case I'm not,
I'm feeling worse tomorrow.

2198
02:19:54,441 --> 02:19:56,990
I don't want to cancel on her that day.
It'll ruin everything.

2199
02:19:56,991 --> 02:20:01,820
I'll tell her today, hey, I'm not
feeling 100% well how about Tuesday?

2200
02:20:01,821 --> 02:20:06,770
Just so I have enough extra day. I
thought that was okay. She wrote to that.

2201
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:08,031
To be honest,

2202
02:20:08,031 --> 02:20:12,450
I'm kind of feeling unsure about you
and the things you tell me anyways.

2203
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:17,300
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Good luck on your bumble dates. He's sign

2204
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:21,010
what's going.
So she thought that you were okay,

2205
02:20:21,011 --> 02:20:24,830
so I'm also not wrong and that she's,
she's wildly insecure,

2206
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:28,820
which is at a certain, especially at a
certain age, you just really shouldn't.

2207
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:30,980
You don't have time for it anymore.
You don't have the energy for it.

2208
02:20:30,981 --> 02:20:34,490
You know what mean to insecurity,
but she's also,

2209
02:20:34,510 --> 02:20:37,520
that's heightened by a bit of loca.
She's kind of crazy.

2210
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:41,990
[inaudible] she thinks that he's
lying to her. That's what I'm saying.

2211
02:20:42,530 --> 02:20:43,850
She's so insecure.

2212
02:20:44,110 --> 02:20:48,680
Like I don't get get she needs reassurance
every day and she feels like you were

2213
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:52,670
alone or off by telling her, hey, tomorrow
is not good. How about the next day?

2214
02:20:52,671 --> 02:20:56,630
That's normal. Okay. See, I mean,

2215
02:20:56,631 --> 02:21:00,770
this story isn't over, even though
we all want it to be, it's not,

2216
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:06,080
she texted me the next day, Hey, I just
re-read your texts from last night.

2217
02:21:06,081 --> 02:21:09,970
I think I misinterpreted the whole
thing. She said this. I thought,

2218
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:12,800
I thought it sounded like
something else until I reread it.

2219
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:16,410
I worked 36 hours and didn't sleep much.
I just wanted to talk to,

2220
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:19,970
I'm sure I'm reading it wrong.
Oh my God, I might be an idiot.

2221
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:23,000
And then she called me, I didn't pick
up and then she said, please call off.

2222
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:26,450
You didn't already, uh,
block my number. Um,

2223
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:31,100
and then today she texted, now I'm
sick. Karmas real. This all sucks.

2224
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:37,040
Is it me? No, I, now I have to give her
some credit. Okay. I give her credit.

2225
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:41,900
She went back. She may be
reacted emotionally. She
worked a lot. It sounded like.

2226
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:46,760
Yeah. She had the self awareness to
read it and go like, oh, I fucked up.

2227
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:51,140
That's a sign of actual
emotional intelligence. Yes. And,

2228
02:21:51,290 --> 02:21:54,950
and also being a big enough person to
admit it, which is kind of embarrassing.

2229
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:58,670
So you know, if you, if you
were to be like, man, I really,

2230
02:21:58,671 --> 02:21:59,660
really liked her and be like,

2231
02:21:59,661 --> 02:22:03,680
well then that's obviously an indication
that maybe worth exploring again.

2232
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:07,640
But if you don't or if you're like, I
don't have, you know, she's just not,

2233
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:11,790
it was also the last time, but
the paint and sip, that text,

2234
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:17,130
I didn't text her early enough at drink
the paint. She was a drink the pain. Yeah.

2235
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:21,350
She um,
apologize for her texts there too.

2236
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:23,930
So this is a path that is a
path to like just live on.

2237
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:26,310
You're going to deal with this a
lot. Yeah. I'm not dating anymore.

2238
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:28,510
Yeah.
And can I tell what an awful thing?

2239
02:22:28,511 --> 02:22:32,280
I think what's also happening
too is that in text message,

2240
02:22:32,281 --> 02:22:34,890
when you don't know somebody well,
it's misinterpreted.

2241
02:22:34,891 --> 02:22:38,250
So you may want to consider
actually calling and talking
to someone so that they

2242
02:22:38,251 --> 02:22:39,410
can hear your voice.

2243
02:22:39,411 --> 02:22:43,950
It seems so intimate when you call
them baseline now it's like, hey,

2244
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:47,780
we, we misread each other's
texts. Absolutely. Yeah.

2245
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:52,200
Really sometimes. No, we've
read, we've read text.

2246
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:56,310
You've read text where you're like, you
think I'm being serious about something,

2247
02:22:58,270 --> 02:23:03,250
I have to call Matt mad or
whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2248
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:06,690
That's the thing is that you don't
have a connection established.

2249
02:23:06,691 --> 02:23:09,330
So when you're trying to establish a
connection, that's probably why she's,

2250
02:23:09,570 --> 02:23:12,690
but for her to fly off the
handle and then come back again,

2251
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:16,050
that is going to be her
pattern, not, not for me.

2252
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:20,990
I know the kind of girl
she's,

2253
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:24,840
she's weird swearing.
They light very light.

2254
02:23:24,841 --> 02:23:29,580
Laughy girls' night and
not like too insecure.

2255
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:34,500
You need the smash first dog.
This is what you need to do it.

2256
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:38,040
Do it. I forgot. All right,
go on Tinder. Yeah. Wait,

2257
02:23:38,041 --> 02:23:42,330
I'm too old to be on 70 no tender. Let
me have worked with my man for a second.

2258
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,340
So go on Tinder.

2259
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:52,920
Throw up a couple like good pics.
Okay. Shirtless. No, no, no.

2260
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:56,730
Nothing to nothing ridiculous with
joke. You just like good picks up. Okay.

2261
02:23:57,330 --> 02:24:01,290
Bio Line can be charming.
Funny,

2262
02:24:01,291 --> 02:24:05,370
but not like we're not doing a bit
here. Right? So you just like, whatever.

2263
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:07,890
You keep it loose this way.
It's like you're not, don't put,

2264
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:10,680
I'm looking for a relationship.
Just like whatever you like to do for,

2265
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:13,160
I like to drink, paint and
I like to blah, blah, blah,

2266
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:17,550
but you put that in there and then let
it ride. Man. Just see what kind of

2267
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,890
work with my friend is bro.

2268
02:24:26,970 --> 02:24:30,930
You get out there around a little bit,
chuck it around,

2269
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:35,010
clean the system.
Now you forget about the bed stalker.

2270
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:36,630
You forget about drink the paint.

2271
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:40,500
You get a few nuts out and
then we clean the system.

2272
02:24:40,501 --> 02:24:44,940
Then we delete Tinder and we
go on more of a serious match.

2273
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:49,080
Last relationship thing, classes.
You need to bust those nuts first.

2274
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:53,820
Get your swagger. Yeah, that's exactly
what I lost it. I had to get it back.

2275
02:24:54,030 --> 02:24:57,450
Why don't we get it back? All right, I'll
go on Tinder. Here's a scenario though.

2276
02:24:57,451 --> 02:24:59,100
No one.
I get no matches.

2277
02:24:59,101 --> 02:25:02,850
I mean I'm running bumble and hinge
and I'm not matching with anybody.

2278
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:07,080
Let's look at your photos. I got
it right here. I'm not a chef.

2279
02:25:07,081 --> 02:25:10,470
She's great at the profile
that I see the profile,

2280
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:12,180
my profile

2281
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:17,970
comedian and a known comedian like,
here's the thing,

2282
02:25:17,971 --> 02:25:20,640
girls always do like the funny guys.
That's what they say.

2283
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:23,790
You should exploit your celebrity
for this tender. Absolutely

2284
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:26,410
exploit your celebrity.
I'm serious.

2285
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:31,540
Just fix what's your bio line
and then.dot. Like 400,000
followers on Instagram.

2286
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:36,490
Anyway. Make it like, oh,

2287
02:25:36,491 --> 02:25:40,840
okay. Here's my profile
profile pic. I first of all
this first picture is douchey.

2288
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:43,610
That's fine,
but it's like

2289
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,760
some slots or texting you talking
about what is all for fuck's sake,

2290
02:25:51,311 --> 02:25:55,720
man. Oh my God, Kyle. This
is how your dates are going.

2291
02:25:55,721 --> 02:25:59,740
This is how my life is,
bro. You know Bro, that's

2292
02:26:01,590 --> 02:26:06,190
why you're not matching.
This is why it's too jokey.

2293
02:26:06,250 --> 02:26:10,990
Let's see, and the girls, the girls
who want to just get laid are like,

2294
02:26:10,991 --> 02:26:14,430
this guy's too much of a
client. I know. Take a photo.

2295
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:18,480
It looks like it's two. Jen's
a little jokey. It's all great.

2296
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:23,050
I'm not saying you don't look
good, you look amazing. It's just,

2297
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:25,100
it's too jokey. Joe and Rick,
are there other pictures?

2298
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:31,530
Let's do the follow up. I'm not even sure
I do that. Okay, hold on. I'm opening.

2299
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:36,730
I'm looking forward pussy and
I am trying to, all right,

2300
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,400
there's a real photo, but that's, you
can't even see his face look like.

2301
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:45,510
That's another problem. Well, what's
the last one? Let me see what Bro.

2302
02:26:45,511 --> 02:26:48,180
I look back that. Oh my God.
Deb. Chef. See you can't see.

2303
02:26:48,181 --> 02:26:51,460
You can't see very cool tree. No. Okay,

2304
02:26:51,461 --> 02:26:55,140
so you were your profile games wrong?
Yes.

2305
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:59,110
It's good to know the first picture of,
he's kind of too jokey.

2306
02:26:59,111 --> 02:27:00,880
So the girl was like,
Nah, he's not serious.

2307
02:27:01,170 --> 02:27:04,710
And then you have a picture of a tree and
then your face is dark and by shadows.

2308
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:09,970
Let's just go three tree real.

2309
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:14,830
Let's use your three real pictures. Not
a pro picture. I literally don't have,

2310
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:19,270
can we? But let me tell you,
here's how you going to get legs.

2311
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:20,710
Here's how you're going to get laid.

2312
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:24,760
You're going to have one with you
standing behind a microphone on the stage.

2313
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:28,870
Girl love comedian. Now how
do you know the shit? No,

2314
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:33,570
let's turn this [inaudible] all this
shit because I'm friends with your slip.

2315
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:36,690
Make sure
he's got all wet when you talk,

2316
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:41,010
cause I talked to girls who are dating
at the comedy store and normal girl

2317
02:27:41,860 --> 02:27:45,310
holding a microphone.
Oh my God. He's funny.

2318
02:27:45,311 --> 02:27:47,260
I love funny guys.

2319
02:27:48,310 --> 02:27:52,240
I'm saying like second, third
picture, but not your lead.

2320
02:27:52,241 --> 02:27:55,000
Your lead is just like
a normal guy staring at

2321
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:00,340
I don't think.
I don't think you lead with the mic.

2322
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:05,420
I didn't say he said the second or
third is I love comedy with that one you

2323
02:28:06,401 --> 02:28:10,450
should use if you do the mic.
The mic one.

2324
02:28:10,451 --> 02:28:14,480
Do you have a Pro Mike? That's
professional. Oh this is what he prefers.

2325
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:16,300
I got this one just now.

2326
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:21,310
You guys that good smiling and I
got a mic. Pretty good. Natural.

2327
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:22,310
Pretty good.

2328
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,080
Yeah, I like it. Yeah, we need you.
We're going to do a complete review.

2329
02:28:25,510 --> 02:28:29,900
I don't like online dating.
I think I'm just going to co a break.

2330
02:28:30,350 --> 02:28:33,170
Yeah, but I will check. I'll
take those pictures down now.

2331
02:28:33,171 --> 02:28:36,530
I felt very self conscious or just
switch them around. Yeah. Yeah.

2332
02:28:36,580 --> 02:28:41,520
Do you have any head shots that are like,
just aren't those headshot?

2333
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:46,210
It's worse. Smash, smash city, Bro. Dude,

2334
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:50,810
I don't put a picture of you
with somebody else. Like, Hey,

2335
02:28:50,811 --> 02:28:52,750
it's me and this other guy,
because then people go, well,

2336
02:28:52,751 --> 02:28:55,240
which guys that I know that's silly.

2337
02:28:55,270 --> 02:28:57,500
Don't do you want to have a
picture with some friends?

2338
02:28:57,501 --> 02:29:01,160
They'll just get friends because then
the girl goes, well I just want to,

2339
02:29:02,390 --> 02:29:06,020
if you just have, if you crop
arms out. So in other words,

2340
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:07,560
if it was friends

2341
02:29:09,130 --> 02:29:11,480
with his friends and
an Arrow off the thing,

2342
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:15,680
there's friends over their friends over
there. Okay. Now I will say the dog.

2343
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:19,680
Very appealing. Absolutely.
Take care of something.

2344
02:29:19,681 --> 02:29:22,100
You can take care of something
that you are capable of love.

2345
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:23,600
Here's the thing though,

2346
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:28,660
we don't want to make your smash
profile the same as your cause.

2347
02:29:28,671 --> 02:29:33,650
There's the relationship profile. Get
my Dick web profile should be different.

2348
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:37,130
Definitely different than I think my
bros. Right on that, but smash profiles.

2349
02:29:37,131 --> 02:29:40,850
Then the dumb chick's got, am I god, I
love doggy here. That's what I'm saying,

2350
02:29:40,851 --> 02:29:45,310
but it's good the dog.
It's the honey honey.

2351
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:49,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2352
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,060
We're going to help you with this.
I'll keep you guys up to date.

2353
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:56,180
You really will want to know.
I want to know. I want to know.

2354
02:29:56,780 --> 02:30:01,040
I'll let you guys know when I smash.
Dude, you got to smash. It's so gross,

2355
02:30:01,041 --> 02:30:04,280
isn't it? I mean, I think it's
beautiful. This'll be you in a week.

2356
02:30:06,610 --> 02:30:10,290
Pictures are going to profile pleasures.
It's going to be hot, aren't you?

2357
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:13,910
When you're done, just like, oh, well
what did we do after you smash? Yeah.

2358
02:30:13,911 --> 02:30:18,080
It's weird thing, right? She would a
stranger. Who are we now? What was that?

2359
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:22,100
I'm never done it, but that's why
he needs, he needs that cleanse.

2360
02:30:22,690 --> 02:30:25,390
I've gone to a party Saturday
meal. Just smash out there. It did.

2361
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:28,490
Probably party is a good place to do it,
man. Maybe you can get out of the way.

2362
02:30:28,491 --> 02:30:31,310
Skipped the whole Tinder thing. I
think he'd be a good wing man. For me.

2363
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:35,360
It'd be like, oh great. My broke Kyle, you
mean my bro. Oh, I would bet right there.

2364
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:38,660
Now I'm looking good. I would come
up with stories. That would be,

2365
02:30:38,661 --> 02:30:43,010
I would be telling his Dick,
he fucking, there's this IPO.

2366
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:47,840
You know what that is introduced me
to like 25 million than you. Anyways.

2367
02:30:47,841 --> 02:30:48,674
What do you guys,
uh,

2368
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:51,560
are you guys going out to a diner
afterwards or what kind of hungry?

2369
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:55,550
Suddenly they're like, wait,
what's an IPO? I'll be like, ah,

2370
02:30:55,570 --> 02:30:59,300
fuck you know what your game is by
the way. Yeah. What is his game?

2371
02:30:59,500 --> 02:31:04,110
This is a perfect game. Your
game. When we were dating. Oh,

2372
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,390
contemptuous and difference.

2373
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:09,500
A little bit of silent indifference.

2374
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:17,480
When I met Tom,
he was 23 and he was just kind of quiet,

2375
02:31:17,481 --> 02:31:21,540
but like a quiet, you
know what I mean? Like,

2376
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:26,220
like not like a puppy dog, like excited
to meet you, like kind of like whatever.

2377
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:28,230
I don't give a shit. Like,
his whole vibe was like,

2378
02:31:28,231 --> 02:31:32,420
I don't care whether or not any of this
fucking happens in your life. Yeah.

2379
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:37,170
It takes the, it takes the ease. There's
no desperation there. So you're like, oh,

2380
02:31:37,171 --> 02:31:40,010
what's going on with, what's he
all about? I bet he's excited.

2381
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:43,910
He's in the waterfalls to fed,

2382
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:47,220
but then you go to his house and you're
like, oh, this guy's like no game.

2383
02:31:47,221 --> 02:31:49,890
Because he sleeps on a mattress on
the floor and he doesn't use soap.

2384
02:31:50,090 --> 02:31:54,720
You could sell that. I was not
yet a little bit of contempt.

2385
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,360
I do the whole thing. I still do. I know

2386
02:31:59,380 --> 02:32:00,780
I bought a Tesla so

2387
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:07,180
I'm going to have a serious car game.
Really. I got Honda Civic. You bought it.

2388
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:11,220
You need a Tesla.
I should maybe return it.

2389
02:32:11,570 --> 02:32:15,110
Why was really expensive,
but you bought it. Yeah,

2390
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:19,790
it's going to help. It's going to help
the smash game for sure. Let's just do it.

2391
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:25,530
Chicks loved dogs and Nice cars
get more dogs, more Teslas.

2392
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:31,350
My game is like, like yours except
add the crippling insecurity.

2393
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:33,600
We all are insecure.
That's the thing.

2394
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,490
That's the thing you
realize as you get older,

2395
02:32:35,491 --> 02:32:38,130
once you're in a secure
relationship and everything,

2396
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:42,900
you see more how insecure you were
and you realize that everybody is,

2397
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:46,110
and then that, that's what happens
is like once you're not in the hunt,

2398
02:32:46,111 --> 02:32:48,660
you're like, oh, why is everybody
so fucking insecure? You know?

2399
02:32:48,730 --> 02:32:52,710
But you need to be like locked
down to dating. So brutal.

2400
02:32:52,711 --> 02:32:56,730
I mean put yourself out there every
single time you meet somebody and then

2401
02:32:56,940 --> 02:33:01,410
people who date without booze I'm
impressed with does first couple of days

2402
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:05,910
during that first kiss without
being drunk. Magic trick.

2403
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:08,940
I don't know how people do their
first kiss. I've been talking,

2404
02:33:08,941 --> 02:33:13,380
I talk about it on stage now.
The level of tension for for an opening,

2405
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:16,500
that first kiss,
I mean it is like,

2406
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:20,790
it's nauseating just to like weather.
Like when you go like I got a coach,

2407
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:22,860
if you're, especially if
you're the guy, he's the guy,

2408
02:33:22,861 --> 02:33:26,150
you're supposed to be the initiator,
you know, you can't do it. Like,

2409
02:33:26,350 --> 02:33:30,680
like I had women who had said
like, don't ask. That's the worst.

2410
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:35,100
That makes me crazy as,
and it's growing like don't ask,

2411
02:33:35,101 --> 02:33:38,040
but now you have to ask you,
you don't ask.

2412
02:33:38,041 --> 02:33:41,820
It's never asked you gotta you gotta
you gotta be very clear though.

2413
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:43,950
In this day and age you
got to have a lot of cures.

2414
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:47,130
The thing you get the
clues and then like look,

2415
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:51,620
the absolute worst thing. I mean,
yeah. Someone being like, oh no,

2416
02:33:51,630 --> 02:33:54,750
but like where you really that misled.
You know what I mean?

2417
02:33:54,751 --> 02:33:57,720
Like I don't feel like I was
ever that misled terms of like,

2418
02:33:57,740 --> 02:34:02,340
I never went for a kiss
and had someone go like,

2419
02:34:02,341 --> 02:34:04,680
what the fuck he had the,

2420
02:34:04,710 --> 02:34:09,490
I've had it happen to me when I'm saying
read cues and he went for it and I was

2421
02:34:09,491 --> 02:34:14,250
like, I did throw him off. Yeah. But how
often does that happen? I was drunk too.

2422
02:34:14,251 --> 02:34:17,980
It's weird that that's why you
must read this guy. Yeah. But

2423
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,130
that's why you misread you were drunk.
It was like if you're not drunk,

2424
02:34:21,131 --> 02:34:24,610
let's say you're sober or
you have a glass of wine,

2425
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:29,050
you're in a situation where that kids
can happen mean there's like a woman is

2426
02:34:29,051 --> 02:34:32,260
going to give you all kinds
of body Hughes look. Yeah,

2427
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,300
I mean like you're kind of pick up on it.

2428
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:38,620
I know it's whether you have the
confidence to go for it, but it's like,

2429
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:42,190
are you really this whole thing of like,
can I kiss you?

2430
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:46,490
Aw Man. I see it in reality
shows and I'm like, oh,

2431
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:48,970
how many first kisses have
you had since we'd had ours?

2432
02:34:49,150 --> 02:34:52,420
I think she was from our first
one when we had our first kiss.

2433
02:34:52,421 --> 02:34:57,040
That was probably oh five and
probably not more than 10 since then.

2434
02:34:57,070 --> 02:35:00,910
Of like where I went out with a girl and
I wasn't sure whether you guys swing.

2435
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:03,690
Oh yeah. That's cool. Okay. Yeah.

2436
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:08,950
We're poly and by he buys. Yeah,
we're probably probably by SIS.

2437
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:13,690
Yeah. Well you got everything going.
Yeah, we got to do this real quick.

2438
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:17,690
One second, Kyle. Let's make some
money. Let's make some cheese.

2439
02:35:18,730 --> 02:35:22,690
Kyle, one thing that's going
to help wherever that smile.

2440
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:27,400
Let's see what we always do. Be Honest.
Don't be like, but really smile for us.

2441
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:30,540
Let us really see a smile.
Genuine smile.

2442
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:37,420
You have nice teeth, really good
teas. Are Those yours? Are Those,

2443
02:35:38,290 --> 02:35:43,120
wait, no, I do have good teeth.
You profile. Realize braces.

2444
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:48,430
Oof. I do. Sometimes you do the
home strips or do you go to like,

2445
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:51,880
there's like this thing you paint on.
It's not like a paintbrush.

2446
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:56,140
What is it that come was put
the cum all over your face. Wow.

2447
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:57,100
On the cheeks and then,

2448
02:35:57,490 --> 02:36:01,450
and then I have this a retainer where
like once a week and I'll just seriously,

2449
02:36:01,470 --> 02:36:03,220
now let's put it in that.
That's enough.

2450
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:07,420
This is from the dentist or
you just buy this dentist?

2451
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:09,550
I would say, yeah. Yeah. Again,

2452
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:13,470
we do dental updates quite often and
we have a lot of guests come in here.

2453
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:16,300
They show his teeth. Sometimes we
have to be a little nicer to them.

2454
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:18,550
I would say those are top
three teeth we've ever seen.

2455
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:22,090
That straight man clean.

2456
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:25,660
Now you could tell me those are veneers
as this really what's going on? Hey,

2457
02:36:25,661 --> 02:36:28,540
I think we have a new profile pic.
That's what I'm thinking. Yeah.

2458
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:30,160
Close up of the teeth.
Yes.

2459
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:34,100
Actually don't you feel like when you
see someone's teeth it really toe? Oh,

2460
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:38,500
it tells the whole story and it makes
you attracted, you know, so much.

2461
02:36:38,501 --> 02:36:42,520
I mean there's like someone especially
who's young and has like already yellow

2462
02:36:42,521 --> 02:36:46,720
in between. There's just, they're
just going to bed with a s, you know,

2463
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:49,870
when I don't like, by the way, I know
that we all have, you know, we're,

2464
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:53,110
there's different stages of life where
different levels of income and what you

2465
02:36:53,111 --> 02:36:56,370
can spend on it.
I hate someone telling me like,

2466
02:36:56,660 --> 02:37:00,500
like especially if they're employed,
they have a decent job and it's like, ah,

2467
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:02,560
it just fuck this part. Like, no,

2468
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:07,240
you need to direct your
funds into this region.

2469
02:37:07,630 --> 02:37:11,470
If you have a job that
gives you any resources,

2470
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:15,950
put down the plastic, rack up the
debt and you take care of the mouth.

2471
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,030
Yup. Don't let that shit slide. It's hard
to go. You know, you go to the dentist,

2472
02:37:20,031 --> 02:37:23,420
get teeth cleaned every six months.
They say every three months. How often?

2473
02:37:23,810 --> 02:37:27,680
Every six too.
Who's got time for that?

2474
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:32,690
But they said the plaque and your gums
deal and your life quicker to, absolutely.

2475
02:37:33,170 --> 02:37:36,560
I mean these are basically bones
in your face that other people see.

2476
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:39,830
Although I have a theory that it's not
the, you don't take care of your teeth.

2477
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:42,800
It just if you build up
plaque easily on your teeth,

2478
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:46,280
maybe you build up plaque
easily in your arteries theory.

2479
02:37:46,281 --> 02:37:50,270
I have but I haven't heard
that and I don't know much
so uh, that might be wrong.

2480
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:52,430
I got to get my teeth cleaned.
Actually I'm going to make an appointment.

2481
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:56,670
I had an appointment and then
those fires happened. Fires. Fuck.

2482
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:59,360
Are we kind of move
Dennis to out here though?

2483
02:37:59,390 --> 02:38:02,380
Well then we have to go in and
get the x rays and do the console.

2484
02:38:02,390 --> 02:38:04,530
We're going to go back to the other one.
I it depends.

2485
02:38:04,531 --> 02:38:07,690
Do you want to go start with a new guy
out here and then we got to go to this is

2486
02:38:07,691 --> 02:38:10,360
the whole thing and shit.
Fuck yeah.

2487
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:13,760
Cause right now we have more
so much transfer the x rays,

2488
02:38:16,510 --> 02:38:20,080
too many extras. No, that your thyroid
cancer. This is linked to that.

2489
02:38:20,081 --> 02:38:22,410
Dr. Ross just said that you
have to wear a thyroid guard,

2490
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:25,900
will send us all kinds of clips. I don't
know if you know this or not. I do.

2491
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:29,030
You always watch things that people send.
Somebody sent this.

2492
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:33,890
Let me see what it says about her.
This lady. Okay, so the light was red.

2493
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:38,180
She was reading a piece of paper. The
light turned green. She continued to read,

2494
02:38:38,181 --> 02:38:41,570
so I pressed the horn quickly.
Then she continue reading,

2495
02:38:41,571 --> 02:38:44,120
so I pressed it longer until
the light changed to red again.

2496
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:47,780
She got out of her car and argue with me
that she was reading the paper because

2497
02:38:47,781 --> 02:38:52,070
she felt dizzy and wanted to know if
she could turn around to go back to cvs.

2498
02:38:52,910 --> 02:38:57,080
I tried backing up to around her and
then she walked into the other lane and

2499
02:38:57,081 --> 02:39:01,480
then I started recording. So this guy
had dinner with a woman. Just being real.

2500
02:39:03,990 --> 02:39:05,310
You're blocking the road.

2501
02:39:06,510 --> 02:39:11,280
[inaudible]
if the card,

2502
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,120
it's simple, just move it to
the side of the road. Really?

2503
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:21,440
[inaudible]

2504
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:29,520
oh, sandals. These are
definitely the I give up.

2505
02:39:30,890 --> 02:39:34,430
That's what I'm saying. And that
shirt lady at my phone. Yeah.

2506
02:39:34,530 --> 02:39:35,940
She could swipe which way?

2507
02:39:37,070 --> 02:39:41,570
It was the hot, the light was red.
The light was red. It turned green.

2508
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:46,550
You still sat there reading a
piece of paper, turn red again.

2509
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:53,260
You
can't just sit here.

2510
02:39:55,660 --> 02:39:56,493
Okay,

2511
02:40:03,830 --> 02:40:04,663

2513
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:15,203

2514
02:40:16,330 --> 02:40:19,660
I'm always on the side of the
Fedex drivers. Yo, fucking hard.

2515
02:40:19,661 --> 02:40:24,400
That job is and this dumb
bitch just get out of traffic.

2517
02:40:30,790 --> 02:40:33,450

2518
02:40:34,210 --> 02:40:36,300
And then this fucking dope dumb shit.

2519
02:40:36,340 --> 02:40:40,780
Just have a problem every day of
her life and makes it a problem.

2520
02:40:41,050 --> 02:40:43,900
Not a problem. Yeah, she's one
of those, right? Always a victim.

2521
02:40:43,930 --> 02:40:48,460
I just did this for three seconds.
Change cause she was reading,

2522
02:40:52,690 --> 02:40:56,910
you know the numbers
on the side of the truck.

2523
02:40:57,510 --> 02:41:00,000
Simple call.
You

2524
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:02,873

2525
02:41:11,660 --> 02:41:15,170
for being so now she got what she
wanted. She got her, got her apology.

2526
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:18,200
You're sitting at a green light

2527
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:23,093
over.
Yeah.

2528
02:41:25,210 --> 02:41:27,790
I could see through your window
you were reading a piece of paper.

2529
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:34,900
Pull over.

2530
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,160
Right.

2531
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:40,500
Waste of everybody's Day.
You're not aware of late.

2532
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:43,980
When I picked the morning,

2533
02:41:48,090 --> 02:41:50,480
Christine,
I'm not giving it

2534
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:55,100
to this woman. Go right ahead. Much

2535
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:56,450
money and be serious.
Like,

2536
02:41:56,451 --> 02:41:59,080
what's the lowest you would
take to make love this woman?

2537
02:41:59,090 --> 02:42:02,780
You have to be very nice. Whisper
nice things or air. She's the lowest.

2538
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:08,690
Absolute lowest you would
take. [inaudible] okay,
let's really be realistic.

2539
02:42:08,900 --> 02:42:12,890
Yeah. Christina doesn't find out about
it or I'll give you full consent.

2540
02:42:13,700 --> 02:42:15,710
I'm totally on board cause
I want the money now.

2541
02:42:15,711 --> 02:42:18,410
You know it's getting sloppy
that things aren't going great.

2542
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:22,460
She looks like a mess. She's,
it's smells bad, Emily.

2543
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,690
Her feet are horrendous. They've wouldn't
wearing those Birkenstock sandals.

2544
02:42:29,020 --> 02:42:32,960
You gotta I contact her
mouth to mouth.

2545
02:42:32,961 --> 02:42:36,140
You can't turn her on her stomach.
You have to do a missionary.

2546
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:40,010
You have to look her in the eye
when he's first gotta get her going.

2547
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:44,950
He gotta do some work downstairs. Be
Realistic and I'm, I want a real number.

2548
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:49,610
Don't be like your lighting. Yeah.
Yeah. The lowest. Think about your life.

2549
02:42:49,611 --> 02:42:52,560
Do you mean you got to finish
right and eye contact. Eye contact.

2550
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:55,910
Not Looking at her in the eye and say,
I'm not a

2551
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:03,290
last second will I was the Fedex guy.

2552
02:43:06,350 --> 02:43:10,700
Spirit animals.
I think be realistic.

2553
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:11,853
I don't want you to

2554
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:17,950
$20,000 $20,000 a lot of are you?

2555
02:43:19,130 --> 02:43:21,340
Why would people pollute
me? Do you know? You know,

2556
02:43:21,341 --> 02:43:24,490
honestly what I was thinking for real
before you said that, I swear to you,

2557
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:27,400
when I was thinking like I was
trying to figure out the number,

2558
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:32,670
the first number hand to God on our
children in my mind was $5 million.

2559
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:38,710
What I was thinking, it's the lowest.
That's what I was like. If someone say,

2560
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:42,730
here's 4 million can say running
through in my head and was like, okay,

2561
02:43:42,731 --> 02:43:47,580
and I was like, should I say five? Oh,
stop. Be Realistic now let's think about,

2562
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:49,870
I was being real.
Let's bring it down.

2563
02:43:49,871 --> 02:43:54,730
Rockefeller talking about coming in this
lady after sweet kisses and eating her

2564
02:43:54,731 --> 02:43:58,450
box. Yeah, you did. You take
a look what I'm dealing with.

2565
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:06,640
You want me to, she sat there in her
face. She's got some good qualities. Good.

2566
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:10,950
That hair, her skin looks
soft. She's very white. She,

2567
02:44:10,951 --> 02:44:12,190
you're like 20 grand.

2568
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:16,390
Maybe you would do it for 20 grand
and if you can't finish, you don't.

2569
02:44:16,391 --> 02:44:19,660
You don't get anything like you've
gone through the whole thing and that's

2570
02:44:19,661 --> 02:44:22,900
pressure on you that you may not
be able to. Okay, so let's go.

2571
02:44:22,901 --> 02:44:27,280
Let's work in reverse. You had made a good
point. You said someone said 4 million.

2572
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:32,350
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, absolutely.
3 million. Let's be real.

2573
02:44:32,351 --> 02:44:37,030
I'm like, you lie, you million dollar.
Let me work. You ruined this line.

2574
02:44:37,031 --> 02:44:40,480
Million. You're ruining this. We're
ruining this. You're ruining this.

2575
02:44:40,630 --> 02:44:42,210
Why are you ruining this?
Ruining what?

2576
02:44:42,550 --> 02:44:45,750
I'm working through it and you're like
jumping your care fears. I don't leave.

2577
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:50,770
Christina knows how serious it doesn't
understand. It's too preposterous.

2578
02:44:50,771 --> 02:44:51,640
4 million.

2579
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:56,770
Tom's taking this really seriously and
I'm trying to figure this out and you're

2580
02:44:56,771 --> 02:45:00,060
real. You're like 20 grand. Like I
would even spit on her for 20 minutes.

2581
02:45:00,880 --> 02:45:03,460
I would spit on her for 20
grand. I wouldn't, I'd be
like, it's not enough money.

2582
02:45:03,550 --> 02:45:07,540
Okay. It might, it might throw up
on her for 20 grand. If I had vomit,

2583
02:45:07,541 --> 02:45:10,030
like backed up,
I might puke on it for 20 minutes.

2584
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:15,180
Max Funding that you puking on this woman.

2585
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:20,230
I'm saying 1 million.
Think about cash tax free.

2586
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:23,140
I give you a suitcase of $1 million,

2587
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:27,130
you're not going to do this for one.
I don't think it's enough. Really.

2588
02:45:27,131 --> 02:45:30,220
I don't think it's enough. I really don't.
I don't think you that's impressive.

2589
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:35,290
I'm way below that. Yeah. I think, I
think, I think on, if I'm being honest,

2590
02:45:35,291 --> 02:45:37,330
I would say like two,

2591
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:41,740
two and a half would be like
the bottom wow. To do it.

2592
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:45,100
You definitely have more money than
I do. Kyle, what's your bottom?

2593
02:45:45,900 --> 02:45:50,770
I'm like in the teens. Come on to
you got to eat or box for a while.

2594
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:54,700
Got a banger and you got to
look in her eyes as you finish.

2595
02:45:56,180 --> 02:46:00,550
I'm definitely under a hundred grand.
I'll tell you that right out of the box.

2596
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:05,650
Um, you have to, you have
to eat her ass for a while.

2597
02:46:05,651 --> 02:46:10,580
Way Her ass. Yeah. You added that. No,

2598
02:46:10,581 --> 02:46:14,330
that's always there. I played. He's right.

2599
02:46:14,570 --> 02:46:18,280
It is always there.
Well,

2600
02:46:18,281 --> 02:46:22,140
we didn't say that with you. I just
threw it in there. I had through it.

2601
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:24,900
How am I,

2602
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:31,370
what kind of ass is it licking you?
Getting in there deep.

2603
02:46:31,371 --> 02:46:36,000
Is it how long? Yeah. Liggett,
one rim, and I'm back to,

2604
02:46:36,001 --> 02:46:40,100
uh, her lady parts. Poke it a little
bit with your tongue. All right.

2605
02:46:40,101 --> 02:46:43,580
A couple of pokes, rim and then,
okay, well let me ask you though.

2606
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:46,640
You got to jump into,
you need to have,

2607
02:46:46,641 --> 02:46:50,840
you got a 69 being realistic
here. Oh, are you serious?

2608
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,280
And she's wearing that

2609
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:53,273
outfit.

2610
02:46:54,700 --> 02:46:57,420
That's awesome. I love
that. That's a real factor.

2611
02:46:57,460 --> 02:47:01,030
She keeps telling you about this FedEx
guy that annoyed her the whole time.

2612
02:47:03,530 --> 02:47:07,790
Okay, sorry. So I have to 69 and if you
have to succeed her butthole, I will not,

2613
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:09,870
I will not going to lick her butthole.

2614
02:47:11,570 --> 02:47:14,900
How about we go to your $1 million
cash bag? You're like, nope,

2615
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:19,850

Here's saying I would do it for a million.

2616
02:47:19,851 --> 02:47:21,620
Yeah.
Cash tax free.

2617
02:47:22,130 --> 02:47:25,040
The IRS never say no to 900,000

2618
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:31,520
cash. It has to be a million in
my mind for it to be worthwhile.

2619
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:34,270
I have to have that amount.
So now I don't seem so preposterous to,

2620
02:47:34,271 --> 02:47:38,970
you have a one millions less
preposterous and five to two and a half.

2621
02:47:39,610 --> 02:47:43,990
Christina, you don't get any of the money.
It's harder for a woman. So work. Hey,

2622
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:49,000
that's way harder for me. I Dunno. I mean,
do I have to come or does she have to?

2623
02:47:49,590 --> 02:47:54,430
Everybody is at a party. She
has to come. Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

2624
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:57,160
You said I had to come and look at it.
We don't know her biology.

2625
02:47:57,161 --> 02:48:01,670
She may not be able to. Okay.
Let's say, let's say she can,

2626
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:05,020
no, not different game. Different story.

2627
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:08,010
We have to make her sick.

2628
02:48:08,050 --> 02:48:11,700
There's no way I'd spend the
time. You have money. That's
been the time. They know.

2629
02:48:11,710 --> 02:48:16,210
Wait a minute. Does that change your
fee though? So what's your fee now?

2630
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:19,930
$400,000 and you'll make her come.

2631
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:24,010
I will make that woman and
have the greatest night of
her life. I believed you.

2632
02:48:24,730 --> 02:48:28,810
And that's your Tinder game.
You need to go into your status came up.

2633
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:31,550
I want you to think about her.
Every time you're on,

2634
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:37,870
you're going to do it. I'm not doing
Tinder is too for the kids. Do it, man.

2635
02:48:37,871 --> 02:48:41,590
I'm 47 so what? 47 on Tinder, bro.

2636
02:48:41,591 --> 02:48:44,410
We're just trying to clear the
pipes little bit. That's true. See,

2637
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:48,030
Christina is what says is embarrassing.
I mean grow up.

2638
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:54,460
You have to give her an orgasm and you
have to do by any means necessary mouth

2639
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:58,660
if to use your mouth, your hands,
your painter. I think six is fine.

2640
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:04,700
Six Mil. Yeah. I know you
guys have a good life.

2641
02:49:04,701 --> 02:49:08,430
Do you know that? Like
do you, do you recognize

2642
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:11,970
that like we have a really good life
because most people get used to their life

2643
02:49:12,630 --> 02:49:15,150
and they go, oh my life. It's fine.

2644
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:18,810
Are you like that or do you know that
you just come down here and talk about

2645
02:49:18,811 --> 02:49:19,644
this and I need,

2646
02:49:22,170 --> 02:49:26,960
we appreciate it greatly.
Cool. We get to do this.

2647
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:29,580
I got paid $6 million to make.

2648
02:49:29,581 --> 02:49:33,780
This lady can realize how good my life is.
Pretty sweet.

2649
02:49:33,781 --> 02:49:36,830
6 million.
See what I mean by the way?

2650
02:49:37,490 --> 02:49:42,490
I framed it like that to me and you
show me the bags and then you're like,

2651
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,590
it's, she's right through there.
I would go in there with these,

2652
02:49:44,591 --> 02:49:48,060
this attitude of like,
daddy going to make you calm.

2653
02:49:48,390 --> 02:49:51,180
So like do whatever you want. You want
to Fart in my face and get started.

2654
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:55,590
I would just absolutely
mental state a really like,

2655
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:57,030
I think I would leave
there and she'd be like,

2656
02:49:57,031 --> 02:50:00,450
it needs to get a bonus because I
came like 16 times. Oh you know,

2657
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:03,660
I think I would go in there
like let's up the ante.

2658
02:50:03,810 --> 02:50:07,740
There's bonus checks you do a whole night
with her and you got to do it as many

2659
02:50:07,741 --> 02:50:12,480
times as she, as many times as she wants.
And you have to do whatever she wants.

2660
02:50:12,481 --> 02:50:14,070
She's not in good shape.
She would. She wouldn't,

2661
02:50:14,490 --> 02:50:16,230
she wouldn't be like more
and more and more and more.

2662
02:50:16,660 --> 02:50:21,200
You've got to nut three times in 12 hours,
12 hours,

2663
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:23,490
12 hours. I think it's doable.
I don't think I can do it.

2664
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:26,430
I think you can eat a diet nuts and then
you'll get any money cause you could,

2665
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:27,700
couldn't do your third nut.
Oh,

2666
02:50:30,610 --> 02:50:33,820
key is you want, you want those
first two as fast as you can. I,

2667
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:38,900
you can [inaudible] period's going to
really dwell after that second one and

2668
02:50:40,801 --> 02:50:43,740
then when it's like, hey man, we got
two hours left. You'd be like, hey,

2669
02:50:43,741 --> 02:50:47,010
why don't you fucking smack them
around a little bit to get going here,

2670
02:50:47,700 --> 02:50:51,660
but can you brought up a great point is
that you're going to have her like butt

2671
02:50:51,661 --> 02:50:55,310
juices and all her juices like,
oh, you're just smell to be.

2672
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:58,600
I was just thinking about
those millions though.

2673
02:50:59,250 --> 02:51:03,420
I can't believe you thought I was going
to do this for $20,000. I'm serious.

2674
02:51:03,421 --> 02:51:05,350
I might do it for 20 grand.
Really?

2675
02:51:05,590 --> 02:51:08,510
I'm going to get 20 grand tax free.

2676
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:12,880
Make a woman feel good for a little while.
It's beautiful thing.

2677
02:51:14,430 --> 02:51:18,420
She's a good night. Good night.
It's tax free. Can we regroup?

2678
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:23,870
Will you tell me for real what
you would need to eat her box?

2679
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:29,010
I'm being be real. Look at
her. No, she's disgusting.

2680
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:33,910
I would say this is what the Moose
suit lady looks like. Muscle building.

2681
02:51:33,930 --> 02:51:37,890
We actually saw her. It looks much
better. She does. Most of it looks better.

2682
02:51:37,891 --> 02:51:40,530
I'm serious. I'm serious. She does.

2683
02:51:40,630 --> 02:51:44,550
Seriously is my nightmare.
If I were to go gay,

2684
02:51:44,551 --> 02:51:49,000
this is not my
voice.

2685
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:53,760
Like that's who I am. So you imagine?
Yeah, and I'm being honest and sincere.

2686
02:51:53,761 --> 02:51:57,930
When I say $1 million cash
and nobody finds out about it.

2687
02:51:58,320 --> 02:51:59,071
That's another thing.

2688
02:51:59,071 --> 02:52:01,870
You can't be on the Internet and
you'd have to make her come. Yeah.

2689
02:52:03,370 --> 02:52:06,010
And I'm being serious. So you'd
want a lot of effort into it, right?

2690
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:09,700
For a million cash. Cash. Like if you
came out of there, she didn't come.

2691
02:52:09,701 --> 02:52:11,040
You'd be like,
I really tried.

2692
02:52:11,190 --> 02:52:13,500
Yeah.
Was $1 million a ton.

2693
02:52:13,880 --> 02:52:16,250
Mike. Let's say you just walked
out right now and she didn't come.

2694
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:19,790
Would you be like, I'd be so
bomb. Do Cause I want that
money. But you'd be like,

2695
02:52:19,791 --> 02:52:23,670
I really ate as much as I got fucked
up. I would make it happen. Yeah.

2696
02:52:23,810 --> 02:52:25,820
I'm going to flip the script on you,
Tom.

2697
02:52:26,450 --> 02:52:31,210
She straps on a Dildo. Okay.
You've got to take it. Okay.

2698
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:35,330
For five minutes as she is yelling at
you as you makes you wear a FedEx outfit.

2699
02:52:35,450 --> 02:52:38,930
Yeah. Easy. Five minutes. Oh, okay.

2700
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:42,200
Now we can start talking to that
bullshit money. Okay. What is it,

2701
02:52:42,201 --> 02:52:46,290
50 grand and bulldozed by her? Yeah. Yeah.

2702
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:48,730
The strap on. Yeah. No,

2703
02:52:48,920 --> 02:52:52,640
but I might do it for like six figures
or something because I feel like there's

2704
02:52:52,641 --> 02:52:56,180
no, like that I'm facing a wall, you know,

2705
02:52:56,510 --> 02:52:59,810
I'm looking away and the
things being done to me. See,

2706
02:52:59,811 --> 02:53:02,080
I find that much more
violating. Oh No. See that.

2707
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:06,350
I could check out of that and look, I
could check out. Yeah, I agree with Tom.

2708
02:53:06,410 --> 02:53:09,530
You can check out, you'd go, I
would check out and she'd be like,

2709
02:53:09,560 --> 02:53:12,330
I fucking ups is better. And
I'd be like, Eh, all right.

2710
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:16,340
And then she just rails me and I would
just kind like, just be like, that's fine.

2711
02:53:16,730 --> 02:53:19,700
I've never had that done to me.
So it also is a scary,

2712
02:53:20,290 --> 02:53:24,140
but peg is one. I neither have. I
neither is he right? Tom [inaudible].

2713
02:53:24,170 --> 02:53:28,690
He seems pretty cavalier about it. I just
feel like, yeah, I just feel like, uh,

2714
02:53:29,890 --> 02:53:30,860
that,
that one's not,

2715
02:53:30,890 --> 02:53:35,240
I feel like doing things to her would
require much more out of me. Okay. Yeah,

2716
02:53:35,430 --> 02:53:40,220
I think it was. I'm glad we
figured out. Yeah, that's her.

2717
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:44,820
That's her. That's the elk. That's
who you're dealing with. Dirty bic.

2718
02:53:45,070 --> 02:53:49,970
Aoun. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2719
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:52,240
Oh,
dirty son of a

2720
02:53:52,450 --> 02:53:57,190
Kyle. Have you ever smoked meth? No.
Yeah. What is your drug history like?

2721
02:53:57,430 --> 02:54:02,430
I was pretty much a square and then
I've recently done a lot of marijuana at

2722
02:54:03,191 --> 02:54:06,040
night to sleep. That's
nice. Do jellies. And uh,

2723
02:54:06,550 --> 02:54:09,990
I used to take those a diazo
Pam's or whatever that, those uh,

2724
02:54:10,010 --> 02:54:13,660
or Lunesta and I'd find
the marijuana is not as,

2725
02:54:13,661 --> 02:54:16,750
I don't get as hung over and it seems
like it doesn't affect me in a negative

2726
02:54:16,751 --> 02:54:20,740
way. I hope. It seems like it's okay
though. Cool. What do you guys do?

2727
02:54:21,720 --> 02:54:25,640
Wine Party? No, little bit of Mary Jane.

2728
02:54:25,641 --> 02:54:29,570
Sometimes I want to try mushrooms.
Never done it. I haven't either.

2729
02:54:29,580 --> 02:54:33,190
I want to try that. Should do it.
What if you were to, by the way,

2730
02:54:33,191 --> 02:54:35,600
since you know how he's singing and
we're trying to hook him up. Hmm.

2731
02:54:35,830 --> 02:54:39,850
What if he went into like a new
facet, like a new genre, a new,

2732
02:54:39,851 --> 02:54:42,840
a new lane instead of like traditional.
Okay.

2733
02:54:42,880 --> 02:54:46,990
What if you step out of the box a little
bit, you know in terms of in what way?

2734
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:49,990
Well, what if you did something
like that? You forgive him for that

2735
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:51,720
thinking.
This is a meal with the red point,

2736
02:54:52,050 --> 02:54:55,610
but the cost is actually contained blood.
Leah,

2737
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:57,230
now I want your average couple.

2738
02:54:57,330 --> 02:55:01,260
They're actually real life vampires
living in the sleepy town of Haven hills

2739
02:55:01,261 --> 02:55:04,520
suffered the taste of
the blood on the person.

2740
02:55:05,340 --> 02:55:08,780
Maybe that's your lady. All right. Right.
How much do you make her come for? Fuck.

2741
02:55:08,810 --> 02:55:09,930
Is this our new game?

2742
02:55:12,990 --> 02:55:17,520
I would have an easier time with her
because she's got a real look that I could

2743
02:55:17,521 --> 02:55:18,000
get into.

2744
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:22,080
Can I tell you something right away that
I feel like already what she would like.

2745
02:55:22,110 --> 02:55:24,390
Even if you weren't attracted
or like she knows what's up,

2746
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:27,840
she knows how to do things. She could
hurt you though. She could hurt you,

2747
02:55:27,841 --> 02:55:31,050
but she'd also be like,
I know what feels good.

2748
02:55:31,080 --> 02:55:34,180
She's worked her way around a nut sack
for sure. That's what I'm saying guys.

2749
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:37,230
You're frying to golf checks,
which I'm an expert in. Yeah.

2750
02:55:37,320 --> 02:55:40,460
There's two kinds of God chicks. You
got your skinny goth chick. Yeah.

2751
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:45,330
And then your heavier goth chick who
wears like a lot of latex and very not

2752
02:55:45,331 --> 02:55:48,980
porous materials around their blue jeans.
Uh, I get, I know what you're gonna do.

2753
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:51,660
You know what I'm saying? So it's
not the best. That's what I've heard.

2754
02:55:51,810 --> 02:55:54,840
So I would take that into
consideration cause she's,

2755
02:55:54,990 --> 02:55:58,110
she's wearing leather
and stuff in that area.

2756
02:55:58,830 --> 02:56:02,400
It was love at first bite all the time.
Vampire Arrow,

2757
02:56:02,750 --> 02:56:07,650
often Mitera dating website on Valentine's
Day when I first saw that he was a

2758
02:56:07,651 --> 02:56:10,550
vampire is very interesting.
I was like, okay,

2759
02:56:10,620 --> 02:56:14,000
didn't know that was actually a
proper real vampires out though.

2760
02:56:14,070 --> 02:56:15,690
You always hope there was.

2761
02:56:15,870 --> 02:56:20,640
I hope to have children. She, he looks
terrifying. Yeah. I mean she's like,

2762
02:56:20,641 --> 02:56:20,881
you know,

2763
02:56:20,881 --> 02:56:25,000
it looks like kind of like almost looks
I'm going to hate hosting parties.

2764
02:56:26,070 --> 02:56:27,000
No,
but I'm saying,

2765
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:32,460
I feel like I see that she tried
to put this together with him.

2766
02:56:32,461 --> 02:56:36,110
I see like a genuine scary fucking guy,
right?

2767
02:56:36,111 --> 02:56:40,530
Like this is how he naturally look
like there's no effort, vampires,

2768
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:45,270
murder people. So he's gotta be at least
entertaining those thoughts in his head.

2769
02:56:47,070 --> 02:56:48,860
Yeah. Even as a fantasy, that's

2770
02:56:49,780 --> 02:56:50,930
a part of the lifestyle.

2771
02:56:51,210 --> 02:56:55,040
The blood always had cravings
for pledge since the first day.

2772
02:56:55,110 --> 02:56:58,850
I can remember anytime someone cut
their self, if they cut their finger,

2773
02:56:58,851 --> 02:57:03,670
I'd put their finger in my mouth. If
they're all odd, clap my mouth over it.

2774
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:06,450
Right.
He's

2775
02:57:06,450 --> 02:57:07,860
Gary.
Oh yeah.

2776
02:57:07,861 --> 02:57:12,180
The teeth aren't good to any black
lipstick highlights yellow teeth.

2777
02:57:12,181 --> 02:57:14,640
This is what your boyfriend's looked
like back then. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

2778
02:57:14,641 --> 02:57:18,750
not like him, but like the saying, the
black lipstick eyeliner. Pretty much.

2779
02:57:18,751 --> 02:57:21,240
Same as the old dude, that big book. Duplo

2780
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:27,480
but we didn't drink blood were lunatics,
uh, when she has her period. Right.

2781
02:57:27,560 --> 02:57:32,160
All right. Ask. Keep it going.
And most shockingly level,

2782
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:36,850
they drink each other's blood.
Hello.

2783
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:40,560
Are All my saw come wild
covered? No, the laptop.

2784
02:57:40,561 --> 02:57:45,561
Couple of set to get married on the
spookiest there for year Halloween coding.

2785
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:51,200
Uh, God, it's eerie. So
unsure of how her family was,

2786
02:57:51,201 --> 02:57:53,430
take the news of her unusual lifestyle.

2787
02:57:53,640 --> 02:57:57,420
She hasn't yet told them it's
actually happy with the relationship.

2788
02:57:57,660 --> 02:58:02,130
They don't look healthy. Yeah.
A great way to get. Yeah,

2789
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:06,960
it happened. You know, I was convinced
I had aids in 1990, like not even,

2790
02:58:07,020 --> 02:58:09,690
I think I might have.
It was like I knew I had aids,

2791
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:13,800
how I had never had sex with a girl
before and I came home from this party,

2792
02:58:13,801 --> 02:58:18,360
it was a college and she's like,
Kyle done, I get to get up here.

2793
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:19,380
She's drunk.

2794
02:58:19,410 --> 02:58:24,410
And we had sex really fast and she
was 21 which seemed sold to me.

2795
02:58:24,990 --> 02:58:28,610
And if she had sex with me, like
she's probably, as you know, very, uh,

2796
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:33,860
so this is 1990 [inaudible]
you had unprotected sex,

2797
02:58:34,171 --> 02:58:38,460
you got a, that was like what they
were saying. Right. So I was couldn't,

2798
02:58:38,820 --> 02:58:40,890
Vince and I left there and I was,

2799
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:45,180
I was really upset and I
ran into my roommate at the
time who was like this jock

2800
02:58:45,181 --> 02:58:48,480
guy and I, and I, I embarrassed myself.

2801
02:58:48,481 --> 02:58:51,600
I was like crying and I was
like, yeah, I was crying.

2802
02:58:52,550 --> 02:58:54,930
I was like that.
Like we get like one word out,

2803
02:58:54,931 --> 02:58:59,790
like just got aids and then, um, anyway,

2804
02:58:59,791 --> 02:59:04,260
but it actually helped out because
later on I never got tested because you

2805
02:59:04,261 --> 02:59:07,440
couldn't get tested on campus. And then
I was going to this Billy Joel concert,

2806
02:59:07,441 --> 02:59:11,160
right. This all gets back
to AIDS. Okay. And, um,

2807
02:59:11,250 --> 02:59:14,740
in the back and I'm so far
away at Yankee stadium, you're,

2808
02:59:15,390 --> 02:59:19,320
he's playing piano, man. You're,
you're hearing uptown girl this sound.

2809
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:23,220
So we sneak down, I get to the front
row and I'm going to jump on stage.

2810
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:27,330
You know what? You know, it
was a huge Billy Joel Fan.
Like I'm gonna die anyways.

2811
02:59:27,331 --> 02:59:31,650
I got aids. That's what I thought. Really?
I wasn't going to do it. I chicken doubt.

2812
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:33,390
And then I remembered, oh, I have a,

2813
02:59:33,391 --> 02:59:37,190
I'm gonna own Dynamic and the
power of aids propels you,

2814
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:40,860
jumped on stage and they
filmed it that night. And, uh,

2815
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:44,700
I have the film of me jumping on
stage. Are you being serious? Yeah,

2816
02:59:44,701 --> 02:59:48,000
it's on my Instagram. And then I
can pull up your Instagram. Yeah.

2817
02:59:48,001 --> 02:59:52,440
It's like one of the first videos
I posted and then, um, yeah,

2818
02:59:52,441 --> 02:59:55,960
and then years later, 25 years
later, almost to the day I,

2819
02:59:56,090 --> 02:59:59,250
I was on stage with Billy Joel randomly.
Uh,

2820
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:02,110
like how you're casually like yeah,
I was going say we'll,

2821
03:00:02,250 --> 03:00:06,000
Amy Schumer had his songs in
her movie and she basically up,

2822
03:00:06,001 --> 03:00:08,400
cause she knew I liked Billy Joel and
she just put them in now you know,

2823
03:00:08,401 --> 03:00:10,680
for the other character is way down here.

2824
03:00:10,710 --> 03:00:14,920
It's like one of the first guys
I posted. Okay. So Amy Hill,

2825
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:19,560
so she was invited on stage. Is it cause
uh, to like dance during uptown girl.

2826
03:00:19,561 --> 03:00:20,640
And so she invited me.

2827
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:25,140
So I went and met him during rehearsal
and it was so eerie because it was the

2828
03:00:25,141 --> 03:00:28,560
same like outdoor stadium.
He was in the same spot.

2829
03:00:28,590 --> 03:00:33,030
I was in the same spot and like I went
up the same way. It just was very eerie.

2830
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:38,310
Cool. How long ago, by the way, is your
neck twisting injury? Was that from uh,

2831
03:00:38,580 --> 03:00:41,650
think I was like 24.
Okay.

2832
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:47,280
So we're running the limo
driver at all these photos.

2833
03:00:47,310 --> 03:00:50,220
Look at all these photos, trying to figure
out how to do Instagram at that point.

2834
03:00:50,610 --> 03:00:54,300
That's a character though. Lost cause
did you tell Billy Joel your aid story?

2835
03:00:54,450 --> 03:00:57,810
I did. I didn't say aids, but told him
the story. I'd be jumping on stage.

2836
03:00:57,811 --> 03:01:01,210
I showed him the video and I have the
video one is really cool. He was cool.

2837
03:01:01,270 --> 03:01:04,960
But I mean I, you know Jennifer Lawrence
was there too and he's probably, if I,

2838
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:07,150
if they weren't there, he would have
been like at the get away from me,

2839
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:10,680
get away from me dude. The
fuck are you? He's like,

2840
03:01:11,620 --> 03:01:16,210
oh there it is. It is where they would
go up. Oh that's no, sorry. Go down

2841
03:01:17,310 --> 03:01:21,520
to the right is like the
rehearsal for the one. Yeah. Yeah.

2842
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:23,020
That'd be showing them,
yes.

2843
03:01:23,030 --> 03:01:25,620
You showing him the video video
of me jumping on stage with AIDS.

2844
03:01:25,830 --> 03:01:28,560
Let's see how I want to see how
much disdain he has for you in this.

2845
03:01:28,561 --> 03:01:30,350
He doesn't like me. Let's
see, let's see if he,

2846
03:01:30,410 --> 03:01:33,160
cause I,

2847
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:43,860
I think it was nice. Cool
is very cool. Yeah. Yeah.

2848
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:45,050
I didn't know.

2849
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:48,610
I can't imagine being that famous is
Billy Joel and people just freak out every

2850
03:01:48,611 --> 03:01:51,400
time they see you or he was doing,
he might be still be doing it.

2851
03:01:51,430 --> 03:01:56,320
You know some places you get a residency,
they have a residency in Vegas.

2852
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:59,350
He had or maybe still has a residency.

2853
03:01:59,380 --> 03:02:03,550
He does Madisonville cheese
and his commute to work.

2854
03:02:03,551 --> 03:02:08,140
A helicopter lands in his lawn and
the flies. It's like Garth level,

2855
03:02:08,580 --> 03:02:13,120
they gas arena. I like your golf posts.
What the hell is going on in here?

2856
03:02:13,270 --> 03:02:15,280
That's a topless book.
I was trying to make

2857
03:02:15,610 --> 03:02:18,670
Tinder.
That's a good Tinder shot course.

2858
03:02:19,570 --> 03:02:23,050
You're going to get laid on that. You
are a man, Bro. We're trying to get,

2859
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:24,670
thank you. No, that's cool. I didn't,

2860
03:02:24,680 --> 03:02:27,550
I thought that was like the opposite of
a something that would turn women on.

2861
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:32,980
How about the upper right
for Tinder? Nope. Nope, nope,

2862
03:02:33,220 --> 03:02:37,990
nope. Oh boy. Oh yeah. There it
is. Dire. She is. This is it here?

2863
03:02:38,310 --> 03:02:42,880
Is this you? Yeah, that's me. That's me.

2864
03:02:42,881 --> 03:02:44,040
This girl.
She was okay.

2865
03:02:44,370 --> 03:02:47,510
Jumping on the stage here to jump
out of that. That was like, Oh,

2866
03:02:47,520 --> 03:02:50,190
I'm narrating this. Sorry.
Give me the courage.

2867
03:02:51,150 --> 03:02:55,650
You pat them on the path as you said. It's
good job. Answer this guy. I'm like, Hey,

2868
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:59,520
watch out. Don't touch. Is this the end
of the show that he's doing this? Yeah,

2869
03:02:59,521 --> 03:03:03,010
it was right at the end to jump up then.
It was cool.

2870
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:08,700
Good job. He just looks at you. It's kind
of fun. He's like, it's kind of cool.

2871
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:13,470
He's like that guy. I
know. That's my ability,

2872
03:03:13,471 --> 03:03:17,030
Joel Freak out at all. He
was like, guys on stage.

2873
03:03:17,940 --> 03:03:19,880
It's awesome. Alright. Uh, anywhere,

2874
03:03:19,890 --> 03:03:21,810
do you have coming up any tour
dates or anything like that?

2875
03:03:23,070 --> 03:03:23,903
Yeah.

2876
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:27,160
You got where you come? I'm going
to be at the Largo Theater, uh,

2877
03:03:27,161 --> 03:03:32,161
December 18th in Los Angeles and then

Instagram is co at Kyle going to get one.

2881
03:03:44,650 --> 03:03:46,810
If you could refer to me
as the king of Instagram,

2882
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:51,460
that would help me out that I have no
problem with that goal. Um, and then,

let's see, we have a, you

Anything else to throw in there?
The Christina on Instagram.

2885
03:03:57,080 --> 03:03:59,240

all the other Christina piece.
