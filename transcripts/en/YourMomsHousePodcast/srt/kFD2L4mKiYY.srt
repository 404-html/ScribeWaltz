1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,290
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,040
Christina.
Instances.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,220
They're

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,220
loud. Yeah, I know. I
just told you that. Told.

5
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:28,020
Did you turn it down for me
please, please, please, please.

6
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,490
All right, we're good. Thanks.
Yeah, thanks Jean. Need
cry about that. All right.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,260
And now your diaper would be
exceptionally photo exaggeration. Why?

8
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:41,820
It's the truth. All right. You
got to turn your bell tones down.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,850
Oh Man. It'll ridiculous. Rich. Um,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,880
we did it episode 400 crazy.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,390
I can't believe we've found a way to
talk about a farting poop pooping.

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,070
You sound like one of the critics.
It's the only thing we do here.

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,870
It's amazing though, isn't it? I mean,
yeah, there's a lot of stuff that goes on

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,100
for a four.
I remember that happy 400th anniversary.

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,450
That'd be 400 a smurf or re before
hundred. I can't believe it.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,960
When we started this silly show in
our house in silver lakes. Yeah.

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,890
I remember we sat at the kitchen table,
I'll never forget this,

18
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,600
and we had the discussion over
what to name our new podcast.

19
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,280
Yeah. And we, I forget the other
candidates, but it was basically,

20
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,090
what's the dumbest thing we could
call a podcast? And we were like, oh,

21
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,130
that's your mom's house.
Where are you going to your mom's house?

22
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,900
Your Mom's house? Yeah.
Yeah. Isn't that silly?

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,910
It's so silly. It's so silly. I remember
writing down in a, an old joke book,

24
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,110
um,

25
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,110
some dumb line about opening a restaurant
called your mom's house so that you

26
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,060
could say that there's somebody like,
just for the purpose of that. Yeah.

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,200
It's mom's house. It's your mom's
house. But here we are, 400 episodes.

28
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,300
I can't believe I'm living in the house.
That Brown Bill Brown talk bill.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,430
The guy that used to

30
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,630
work in this space made beautiful music.

31
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,420
We make, we make different
types of music here. Yeah. Yep.

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,910
Different stuff. Same strokes, different
say for everyone. Everyone's the same.

33
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,710
So excited though.
Yeah.

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,590
What's your favorite thing we've ever
done on the show or you think it's for

35
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:38,430
after the break here? After we,
oh yeah. You know what though?

36
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,490
I'm still caught up on their brown story
because you started to tell me a brown

37
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,920
story and then I was like,
wait, save it, save it.

38
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,050
And now I'm still thinking about
courses. What happened? Yeah,

39
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,970
they're going about it.
You ready to do this? Yeah.

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,720
Cause I have a good story for you
to. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Can't wait.

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
There you go. Let's get it
started. Episode Mute my mom.

42
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,810
Episode 400 of your mom's house muted.

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,430
Why is he gay?
Full of feed me.

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,500
We are for a man to be okay with his feet.

45
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,780
May licking his AA during sex.

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,100
Yeah,

47
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,670
she fuck. What's your
herd? Beach. I'm as local

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,520
is Randy.
Don't bring anyone loving to live.

49
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,330
Well,
go to your mom's house with Tom.

50
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,603
Christina.

51
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,813
Wow.

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,420
400 episodes of that opening song.
It never gets old to me.

53
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,710
I still like it on songs. You get
tired. I don't want to, I mean,

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,810
you're tired of it. Great. Sound at your
mom's house. Intro music. I like it.

55
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,110
I should have beta. I love the, I love the
intro. Yeah, the sweet guitar licks like,

56
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,210
Oh yeah, it's absurd. Every, oh
my God, I almost just my uncle.

57
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,033
Okay.

58
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,210
Toilet paper. No, I can use this. Uh,
no, probably. Go ahead and do the paper.

59
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,450
You get it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
could see where this is going to go. Okay.

60
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,440
Fan for a minute.

61
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,180
Okay. So yeah, I love, I can,

62
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,270
I think I've told it on
another podcast before,

63
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:55,980
but Ryan match the match man down
in breast balls, beach, Florida.

64
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,490
He created that opening song and a
bunch of like the segment intros and I

65
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:07,170
remember sending him clips and being like,
here's Mr t right,

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,780
here's coach ice and but you know,
left it to him to be creative with it.

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,070
Yeah.
And he came up with that.

68
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,310
Well, cause we at the time we're playing
that Mr t clip, that was a silly one.

69
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:23,110
Like everyone, anything that said,
mom, your mom yeah. Treats your mother.

70
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,490
Right. Your mother, right.

71
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,190
Oh he came on his mind because there were
like your mama's so fat. And he's like,

72
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,430
Whoa, whoa. Don't get anybody's
mother into this. The stupid video.

73
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,740
And then it went to your mom
and the fuck is stands. Yeah.

74
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,880
And then there was, uh, who was Randy
that had nothing that looks like,

75
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,600
you know what that looks like.
That's your coffee.

76
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,350
But the, uh, uh,

77
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,230
Randy was Randy,

78
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,780
that was hall of fame.
Tight end for the Baltimore Colts.

79
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,500
Yeah. Um, okay. Name. I can't,
I just drew a blank on his name.

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,370
Um, but he had dementia and, um,
let me look, let me look it up.

81
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:04,660
Who it is so I can,
I can tie it in

82
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,150
kind of a gay name for a position and
foosball, isn't it? Yeah, the tight end.

83
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,480
Yeah. John Mackey, that's how it works.

84
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,250
John Mackey and he had dementia
and then his wife and he,

85
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,110
he were being interviewed. Yeah. And
then, uh, and then the guy was like, well,

86
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,520
what's it like living with him
and isn't she? And then she, yeah,

87
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,660
it's really sad actually. It's one of the
saddest things, right? Because she goes,

88
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:32,610
you know, we repeat the conversations
and when he asked me like, you know,

89
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,640
when are we leaving?
I tell him, uh, Randy,

90
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,540
who's a made up name of a mechanic,
he's working on the car.

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,410
And then, you know, that puts them off
for a while and then he asks again like,

92
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:44,244
are you ready to go?

93
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,150
And then they cut to the interviewer
and the interviewer goes, John,

94
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,210
is Randy working on the car right now?
I could try to like get in on the thing.

95
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,160
And then John Goes, Ooh, is Randy?

96
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,560
That's another hilarious scene.
Just like Stevie's hilarious. Right?

97
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,450
Well you think that's hilarious to,

98
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,420
and he's really funny and they
are making fun of me really dark.

99
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,420
You're making fun of me. It is dark,
but Stevie doesn't have dementia.

100
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:15,410
He's moderately touched, but
he's tired. Yeah, Stevie special.

101
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,770
But he's not retarded. Yeah,
Stevie's got a promise with you.

102
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,550
He's got a lot of problems and we really,
I really liked that one.

103
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:27,050
And then I really liked the Todd
Phillips. He enjoying? Yeah,

104
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,760
no, she's the smartest one
in the whole documentary.

105
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,830
She's the Yoda.
She's like,

106
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:37,350
you shouldn't be with someone
that abuses you and you're like,

107
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,880
how does this bitch? No, she's the only
one that says anything remotely normal

108
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,180
that's in the bed and is even
more disabled than her. Right.

109
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,480
Has even greater insight. Remember?
No, I don't remember what she said,

110
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:50,310
but I do remember her friend was like,

111
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,050
oh, right, right. The he
needs a piece of shit. Right.

112
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,050
She's the only one that's flat out
like, look, see, he's a shit head. Yeah.

113
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,670
That guy's a real shit bird. You need
to get out, man. He smoked. He gets mad.

114
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,420
They get over it.
I was like real life stuff.

115
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,600
Later on down the road
near the road gets mad.

116
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,530
He always pluralizes is the wrong word.

117
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
They were changes.
People change it.

118
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,920
See, he always gets the plural
round. Yeah. I like when he's all,

119
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,340
people call me snake cause I ain't
afraid of them and nobody calls. Yeah.

120
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,670
When you woke up to a rattlesnake,
do you stand there?

121
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,450
Do you run like hell, Fintech
a chance again, better not run.

122
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,620
I was like,
do I take a chance?

123
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:38,580
Then people in take a chance again stabbed
in the back again. Oh, well. All right,

124
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,030
well I guess that's not
the people call me snake,

125
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,050
but we'll see you get the
point. Hello problems. Oh,
here we go. Here we go. Yeah.

126
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,010
That's why I get my name's snake for him.
I ain't afraid of him.

127
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,740
Never has been except whereas a kid.
Right.

128
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,190
That'd be a big part of when you, that
would negate your first statement. Right.

129
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,070
Never been afraid of him set for the first
12 years of my life philosophy. Yeah.

130
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,640
Yeah.
Cause you never implies never either.

131
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:13,380
Never or it has been symbolic logic does.
You don't even need to take it.

132
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,920
He's wrote that fucking bug, right? Yeah.

133
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,380
Suck the Venn diagrams that those
types of things are a big part of, uh,

134
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,060
the culture these days. The statements
that don't make sense. Untruth.

135
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,230
Yeah.
They're a big part of the news.

136
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,100
I think we're all kind of
becoming experts on things.

137
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,620
It makes sense and no
nonsense. It is, can I,

138
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,760
and I know everyone's buying
1984 the George Orwell bug,

139
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,550
but it is double plus good. It's called
new speak in that book. And it's,

140
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
there's totally an,

141
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:44,130
an entirely new lexicon and its new
speak and it's jibberish and it's double

142
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:48,720
plus good. I'd rather focus on whether
eating ass is gay or not. Agreed.

143
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,060
And we get to the important stuff.

144
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,760
This lady makes a great
point and it's something I,

145
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,600
I really wanted to highlight this.
Everyone was like,

146
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,360
what's special about episode
400? What's going to go on? Well,

147
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,360
this clip was sent in and
it made me think of what,

148
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,980
what would be a better,
um,

149
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,680
celebration of this podcast?

150
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,270
Then if legitimately in episode 400,

151
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,710
we can get you to open up your eyes,
open up your heart, open up your mind,

152
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,430
and ultimately open up your mouth to lick
my rear end. It's never going to have,

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,020
can you just, but can you just
for this episode, for the episode,

154
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:32,910
can you entertain the idea just for this
podcast? Entertain the idea. I mean,

155
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,780
I guess I owe it to the listeners.
There we go for 400.

156
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,820
And I see just for you doing that,
I think that, uh, there's like, uh,

157
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,140
a need to celebrate that you just,
you just scared.

158
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,000
Just that you're entertaining the idea.

159
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,470
[inaudible]

160
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,570
those are celebration horns and explosions
in the morning crew.

161
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,420
I didn't even see that. But listen, first
of all, can I ask you a real question?

162
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,650
Is this woman going to threaten our
marriage? Swipey number two, right here.

163
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,680
Am I looking down the barrel of
the next Mrs [inaudible] Gora uh,

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,690
this is just, you know what?
Somebody that I want you to mirror,

165
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,620
it's not going to expose us to grow up,
but I want you to be like, oh, I could,

166
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,000
I could be just like this. Just
listen. I know you're big on logic.

167
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:25,500
You're big on philosophy. Just knows. She
has to say. Okay. That's all I'm asking.

168
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,980
I tell you what I'm afraid of. What your
asshole pacifically what? It's the heat.

169
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,420
Yeah. So hot down there, the
heat and the sweat and the hair.

170
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,640
That's more than one thing. And the
smells. Jeez. Why here? Your dumps?

171
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:44,440
They don't sound good. I can only
deduce that the smells aren't good.

172
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,760
I, I've heard you shit.
I can't, I can't unknow

173
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,300
it is,
it's a nice man.

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,950
But do you think you could get it sterile
enough that I won't contract some kind

175
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:04,690
of, um, and ultimately disease?
Absolutely sterile. Let's,

176
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,300
let's jump on this journey together.
I'm holding your hand.

177
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,150
Let's go through this
whole thing and see if, uh,

178
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,640
this lady couldn't convince you otherwise.

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,740
Why is he gay?
Full of fee meal for a,

180
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,850
for a man to be okay with his
female licking his ass during sex.

181
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,070
She fuck with your herbage I'm as local

182
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,610
liquor. So right away she's
saying that that's what she does.

183
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:33,750
Now let's see why she does it.

184
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,510
Yeah.
My Nigga,

185
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,250
we let me lick his ass
the shit out of his ass.

186
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,810
Like niggas eat pizza.

187
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,130
Okay,

188
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,130
so right away you know that there's
ladies out there that go really hardcore

189
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,060
into it.
He's not saying like that.

190
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,650
She goes right to those
women are mentally unstable.

191
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,330
She seems fine.
She seems really sweet.

192
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:59,670
I actually really enjoy her
demeanor and I like her.

193
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,690
I'm just not convinced she's right in
the head. I don't know her well enough,

194
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,470
but I don't think that's normal.
There's an interesting statement.

195
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,230
Not that I had this fear anyways,
but just I'm saying she has,

196
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,470
how long think is gay horse not a between
a man and a fee meall right to go home

197
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,080
because it's between a man and a female.
I agree that's

198
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,870
big toe and that, and that was
never an issue. Obviously for us.

199
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,920
We didn't say this was gay,

200
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,540
but that speaks to a certain segment
of the population that does have that

201
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,290
apprehension.

202
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,700
So I just think that's a very soon
offended personally the use of pronouns.

203
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,660
Like she didn't, she wasn't inclusive
of all the different binary genders.

204
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,040
So yeah, I mean what is a female? What
does mail, what is she talking about?

205
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,860
So it's a,
it's disrespectful firstly,

206
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,720
but doing it is, it's just like
the gate. It's just like, but yes,

207
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:55,554
to your point,

208
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,370
I don't think she's right and I have never
heard it actually expressed that way.

209
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,910
She said it perfectly. She's speaking
actually to something different.

210
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,530
She speaking, telling men who don't want
to try it, she's not speaking to me.

211
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:11,730
Obviously I'm back. I'm on my hands
and knees. I'm praying the rosary.

212
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm making dedications to it,

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,760
but their rosary speaking to
you sound like your mother

214
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,660
told me, well, what's in it for me?
What's in it for me? Let's go there.

215
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:28,370
Remember the dog food ring? Yeah.
What's in it? Well, what do you need?

216
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,710
What do you want? Some material
thing. I mean absolutely.

217
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,940
I thought just knowing that you're
blowing your husband's mind and giving him

218
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,490
great pleasure to be enough.
Not only works when you're dating,

219
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,310
that's not the same. There's married
kid. It doesn't work that way.

220
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,070
Really disappointing on,
let me just think about it.

221
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,890
I mean I want to go to Tahiti.
That's a bucket list thing. Yeah,

222
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,420
but we're not going to do that right now.
Well,

223
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,460
when Ellis is a little older
and we're in the overlooking

224
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,860
the water, the one that
I want to stay in. Yeah.

225
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,080
That's when the ass lick will take place,

226
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,610
so I got to put off an ass lick
for possibly a decade. Come on.

227
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,710
It's hot.
Are there and to eat.

228
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:07,220
That's the problem is that I'm actually
making more problems for myself just to,

229
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:11,180
come on, let me just think here. All
right. What I would like, let's be real.

230
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:15,740
Let's be real. Let's be price tag
on this, uh, on this sexual act.

231
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,830
Let me think about what I really
want in life. I mean, I, like I said,

232
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,750
I want to go on trips. I like trips
and I'm not terribly. All right.

233
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,510
What about a materialistic?
I mean, and also by the way,

234
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,070
if you agree to terms on this, you can't
just go, Huh? That'd be like, I did it.

235
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,070
I did it. I did it. Map so scared.
You got a barrier, you know?

236
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,550
Good. What'd you wax it? Yeah.
You promise. Hairless. Hairless.

237
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:45,110
I'm afraid. Honestly. I'm afraid of
the hair and the smell that hair traps.

238
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,480
Let's keep it honest and,
and the heat,

239
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,020
there's a lot of heat because I put my
finger in there. Playfully. Not In there,

240
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:55,340
but are in the area. Yeah. Pretend
spread your cheeks and it's hot.

241
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,290
It's so sweaty. It's
like a jungle. Um, okay.

242
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,110
I'll get it waxed while
you're gone this weekend.

243
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,870
You're going to come back to a
hairless ass on stuff for my birthday.

244
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,170
It a birthday treat, June 18th.
Oh, it's my special birthday. Yeah.

245
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,770
I get to lick your ass. How did
that happen? It's also father's day.

246
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,790
That's how that happened.

247
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,220
That's what's going on. Let
me think. What do you think?

248
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,260
It's waxed.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,350
Okay, so that's out of the car.
That's fine. Mm. Signed off on that.

250
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,130
What do you really want to Haiti?
I mean,

251
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,800
come on Fiji or weekend to loom.

252
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,830
I want to go stairwells on the beach and
stare at Shit. It's gotta be somewhere.

253
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,400
We're going to bring the boy right now.
Oh God. It's no vacation at all. Is it?

254
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,323
I know.

255
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,690
How about a day where you watch the kid
and I go stare at the beach. Yeah, fine.

256
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,950
I want to a Malibu or something.
Yeah. Check in some nice
place alone. She's fine.

257
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,630
But I mean, we're talking like
squat over your face squat

258
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,540
and you just, and you do just
uh, yeah. Tongues, worlds.

259
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,690
I didn't agree to that
first part of the deal. No,

260
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,000
but I don't trust that your thighs can,

261
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,000
I think you're going to smother
me if you do it that way.

262
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,780
Hold my asshole's going to but not,

263
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,820
I don't trust that you will.
You will respect me enough to not smoke.

264
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,810
You're your joker. You're mean
mean you'll smother me. No,

265
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,810
I'll just, I'll just
no, no. Stand over you.

266
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,060
I'll just kind of ease into it.

267
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,170
No, my ass. My ass. Yeah,

268
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,050
no singing. Do you like what about I,
we do the, we do the Dai Dai change.

269
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,650
That's the only way I would do it.
The spread. Oh okay. Yeah. The pan.

270
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:46,010
While your rebate, remember laying
on my back. I pulled my legs up.

271
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:50,940
You changed my diet and
you got to town. Yeah,

272
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,060
I go to town. Let me listen to what she
has. I'm just not an end to this dude.

273
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,040
I'm really not into that.
I'm trying. I'm really,

274
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,930
I'm really trying to wrap my brain.
Yes,

275
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,400
you got to be honest fellows.
It feel good to hear your a sleep.

276
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,260
Cause I had my [inaudible] bad
few in shit feel real good to me.

277
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:13,261
So I know that she feel good to y'all
and y'all just uncomfortable because she

278
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:17,920
feel good and he seen your Aas
and you know that's a gay spot.

279
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,813
You know what I'm saying?

280
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,970
I'm not worried about the gay stuff.
Yeah. I don't think anything between man,

281
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,940
I who cares. Even if it
were, I'm just honestly,

282
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,410
I'm honestly afraid of bacteria
and you know that I am,

283
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,810
I'm afraid of vomiting. No, no.

284
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,310
I'm talking about ingesting
fecal matter. I'm a very, uh,

285
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,600
you know, against poopy in
my mouth. Full inspection.

286
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,590
If you can't get that on an eyeball
and there's just germs, bacteria,

287
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,820
let's have fucking doctors write in and
tell us how many fecal to oral cases

288
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,470
they've seen. You'd get worms, parasites.
So that's the major concern. Yes.

289
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,710
Honestly, it's sickness that
terrifies me. I mean, Shit, man.

290
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,220
That's how you get like hepatitis,
when you go to other countries, it's,

291
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,690
it's fecal matter in food.
He's going to let me live with this

292
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,390
request.
Burning too

293
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,270
bubbly. Just say, ah, yeah, I'm afraid
we're just going to have to not.

294
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,750
You just almost signed up for, I
didn't sign it. I'm afraid. Listen,

295
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,040
if we have doctors write in,

296
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,870
if somebody can assure me in the medical
community listening that it would not

297
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,610
result in me getting hepatitis or
some horrific disease, then yeah,

298
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:40,180
go ahead. Courses. If he
tell me it's not possible.

299
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:44,490
So it's dirty fecal. It is. Yours
is, no, I'm saying after a shower,

300
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,560
stop saying like you're like dirty.
It's not, it's not finishing it.

301
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,050
That's what I don't care is why? Because
I get leaky, but all the time I shit,

302
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,690
this is why I started brown to shower
because I make a brown and then I wipe,

303
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:58,110
wipe, wipe and the Brown keeps
coming and that's when I had

304
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,620
good to hear your ASD

305
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,550
speaking as somebody whose finger
doesn't close after childbirth. Alright.

306
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,170
This is just dumb at this point.
It's not done. It's a valid point.

307
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:13,860
It's bacteria that you shouldn't put
in your mouth. All right. I mean,

308
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,080
aren't you afraid of that?
No. No. I think you're,

309
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,740
the whole thing is nonsense. I think
you should lick fiefs. Buttle no,

310
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:26,520
I'm going to have him look mine.
Cause can we talk about the Brown story?

311
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm dying to hear the end
of it. All right. All right.

312
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,650
Episode 400.

313
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,950
I love this intro.
Really talent.

314
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,130
Talent. Yeah, of course.
I didn't production plop

315
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,960
sounds and the audio cut out. Yeah,
sure. Um, okay. So let's start.

316
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,660
Walk me through the beginning.
So, oh well first of all,

317
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,990
I just had an amazing weekend.
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

318
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,490
I started in Tux in Arizona,

319
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,320
805 and they were like guys just
getting started as a springtime.

320
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,720
And uh, but uh, son Pusan
Yeah. Pusan Arizona,

321
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,090
uh, brought Josh Potter with
me. Very funny. Super Funny Guy.

322
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,550
Sweet guy too. Yeah. Really great guy.

323
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,890
He, he, he killed it. Great
shows. So we started there.

324
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,300
We did the reality theater. So much
fun. Thank you everybody that came out.

325
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,760
I had an absolute fucking blast there.

326
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,090
Then the next day we went to Reno.

327
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,030
You know,

328
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm feeling like you're kind of glazing
over the important points of the story.

329
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:41,170
What were you eating?
How frequently we went to El Charro.

330
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,560
Mexican steakhouse. Sounded like
your recipe for El bub blasting.

331
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:51,010
Yeah. Yeah, but no, I mean
it was delicious. You know,
I just had meat and veggies.

332
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,420
That's what I, that's how I get down.
Yeah. Um, and then I see, by the way,

333
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,890
I worked out before every
single show. Okay, good.

334
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,180
That's what I do as part of my routine.
I mean, the hotel shows him three hours.

335
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,230
Cool. I'm going to go to the gym. I spend
about an hour there, then come back,

336
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,980
shower, get ready for the show. So
that exhausts me. It doesn't, it,

337
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:14,140
that makes me more tired. I
add the ad, make me angrier.

338
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,770
It makes me awake and alert
and I feel like, Oh yeah,

339
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,230
I drank coffee around five.
I get jacked.

340
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,110
I take a couple of doubts and I
watch a Netflix. Oh, see I can't,

341
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,500
I can't do it that way. I can't lay down
and do a show I don't like, Oh yeah,

342
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:33,970
I can lay down in the green room and
then get up on stage. I go from zero.

343
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:36,850
It makes me feel more tired. It's
just the way I am. Like if I'm,

344
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,330
if I'm laying around, I feel more
tired. If I'm active, I feel more alert.

345
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,170
I always feel like when we're done
making fitness, I'd have to take a nap.

346
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,330
I'm just tired. Interesting.
Now the only time yeah,

347
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,490
that I would feel that way is if it's
like balls to the wall, you know,

348
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,160
blow out workout. But I
don't do that. I try to do,

349
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,230
do moderate so that like, oh,
heart rates up, I'm sweating,

350
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:01,970
but I don't try to go like, um,
you know, super high intensity.

351
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,580
Yeah. Anyway, um,

352
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,590
so after that a reno, which I think I'd
been to reno, but I don't even remember,

353
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,620
but we went to Reno to
the Grand Sierra resort.

354
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,850
Such a beautiful, beautiful
theater. The Grand Theater,

355
00:23:16,851 --> 00:23:20,390
they remodeled it. Unbelievable. I mean,

356
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:23,510
just such a gorgeous venue.
Amazing history.

357
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,190
They had I guess as this is one of the
old school reno casinos that has been

358
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,080
remodeled. Sinatra had
your favorite. Yeah.

359
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,490
The greatest singer of all time

360
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,870
up, up, up, up. Look at that
time at the bar, hooked up, up.

361
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,540
Uh,
those legs are going on for days,

362
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,860
so, Oh God, he

363
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,640
scaled the Bup, bup, not thinking anyway.

364
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,330
He didn't want it has the biggest stage,

365
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,660
like actual physical square
footage of stage in the world.

366
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,430
Yeah.
And they said it that stage.

367
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,720
Well the stage that you're on has
the curtain dropped and is enormous.

368
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,160
If you go behind the curtain,
there's a plane, there's Nana's, um,

369
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,080
just they land a plane on,

370
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,470
no, no, it's a pro. It's a prop for
a, for a play that ran for 35 years,

371
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,350
but it's a full size plane.

372
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,530
It looks like a bike parked in someone's
backyard because that's how big

373
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:27,130
backstage, it's not even, it doesn't
even stand out. Like whoa. It's just,

374
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,310
it goes on and on and on.
It's an enormous backstage.

375
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,500
It's like an airfield hanger.
It's just huge. See they
have like, they're like, oh,

376
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:38,620
that was part of a play that
stopped running 10 years ago,

377
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,850
but we just left it here and
it's this enormous like fountain,

378
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:45,770
like structure and they're like, we
just don't know where to put it anyways.

379
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,970
Then you see like a shed,
it looks like a, um,

380
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,620
like a storage unit and
it's all locked up and you,

381
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,700
you don't even pay attention to
it. I'm like, you want to see this?

382
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,120
And they open it. They're like, this
was Frank Sinatra's room. And I'm like,

383
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,890
what do you mean his room?
And they go,

384
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:03,610
well he didn't want to stay in the
hotel and have to walk over here.

385
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,290
So they built him

386
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,350
a room,
Jeez.

387
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,890
Backstage so that he could eat,

388
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,220
sleep congregate.
Right.

389
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,240
And then walk out and be like
basically on state. Crazy.

390
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,420
I mean I can get that.

391
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:22,890
Imagine being Frank Sinatra famous and
walking through the hotel every night.

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,590
Well I thought it was because
people would, as I said, Oh yeah,

393
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,390
cause he doesn't want people to see
them. And they were like, no, no,

394
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,600
because he didn't want to walk
that far. Huh? Oh, I, yeah,

395
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,660
I thought it was the same thing.
Yeah.

396
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,940
Him being so famous that people would
stop him. But yeah, I guess not. Yeah,

397
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,650
it was just a lazy piece of Shit. Yeah.
They didn't phrase it that way. But yeah,

398
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,140
I think he just wanted the convenience
of it. Like, when's the show? Cool.

399
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:49,800
I'll be here. I'll tell you that.
That gives me so much anxiety. I,

400
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,320
there's one club and I won't say
where because I don't want to

401
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,440
let everybody know where the comic sleeps,

402
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:58,710
but there's one club where
they put you up in the hotel.

403
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:03,030
The club is in the hotel, and then
your room is right behind the stage.

404
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,030
There's a few of those terrible,
really weird. Emotionally,

405
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,990
mentally you need a break. They
Cooper's not bad. The comedy mix,

406
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,560
because that's in the basement
of the hotel, but it's a
nice hotel, you know? Oh,

407
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:15,840
so we, yeah, but it's not,
I'm talking about this club.

408
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,620
They literally put you in the room that
if you open the back door to the stage,

409
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,980
there's your room. Oh No, I don't like
that. I don't know. I did that one. Yeah,

410
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:23,770
you have.

411
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,000
I have. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now I remember too. Yeah.

412
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:31,600
I did that once and then they
asked me back and I go, guess what?

413
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,940
I'm not saying there though. Not saying
they're able to revise that deal. Well,

414
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,030
and what's crazy is that like really
famous people have done that room and have

415
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:43,980
stayed in that room and you're like,
wait,

416
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,840
how is that possible that that room
is also the green room? They're like,

417
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,674
just go to your room.

418
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,970
Yeah. Cause there isn't
an agreement. It's right.

419
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:56,210
There's like a steps to the
stage and then it's weird.

420
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,710
Like this is not how show business
works at all. Yeah. Pretty funny.

421
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,620
But let's get to the importance
that, I mean we'll, hold on,

422
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,770
let me finish telling you the story man.
And now I'm chomping at the bad

423
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,050
amazing crowd in Reno.
I mean fucking crazy.

424
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,770
It was 2,600 people in Reno.
Yeah.

425
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,650
I didn't know that many people
lived in Reno. It was crazy.

426
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,020
And then last night the Chenga,

427
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,510
I did a Spanish word for pussy.
That's right. We, let me, let me look.

428
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:29,870
Your partner, what is Penecci
Che? Yeah, that's different.

429
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:33,970
But it sounds like by Chang is actually
in the tribal name of that trial.

430
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,100
In other words,
they are something,

431
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,960
the Chang is the Harry
Pachangas. Yeah. So,

432
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,880
but again,
another beautiful place.

433
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:45,640
They really have poured a
ton of money into that place.

434
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,400
I've seen the commercials, I've never been
there really nice. It's really nice. Um,

435
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,730
and uh, in a really, really great
crowd. And uh, among, uh, Maria came,

436
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,880
she was that last night. I made fun
of her from the stage, you know,

437
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,870
third, my show. First thing when
I see up, she was like, oh, I saw,

438
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,270
yeah, talk like I talk like that and I go,
well, you do as you're doing right now.

439
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,090
She's like, I don't go like,
aw, aw, you kind of do,

440
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,940
it looks like really fast, like
really fast. But I don't go like, ah,

441
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,860
she says I do it, but then I point
out, I don't just say, you go,

442
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,290
ah, I just said, you're like, ah,
I'll have to try to smoke a wet.

443
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,450
Which she's like, I didn't say it.
Like, ah. Anyway, she was there.

444
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,000
My cousin Janette was there, both of
their spouses. We had a great night.

445
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,860
Uh,
then we went out for dinner afterwards and

446
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,240
had a great time. So anyways,
this morning, normally if, if, uh,

447
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:51,400
if they hadn't been there
right after the show,

448
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,170
I would've gotten my car and be like,
I'm just gonna go back home. Right.

449
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:56,650
Because it's about a two hour drive,
maybe a little more.

450
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,750
But since my sister's in town, which is
rare, I go, well, we should have dinner.

451
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,970
It's like I'm going to spend the night
because then, then it gets too late.

452
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,610
So I get up this morning and I'm like,
I got to get back.

453
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,830
We got to do the podcast, you
know, there's things to do.

454
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,050
So I'm in the room and I'm like, when
is this shit going to come? Hold on man.

455
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,210
I'm finally, finally get to the part
of the story that I care about. Okay.

456
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,480
You said you had hotel coffee now is
this, no, no, no. You're jumping ahead.

457
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,350
Jumping ahead. Before I get there
and you're saying let's go back.

458
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,530
I haven't even gotten there yet.
So

459
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,400
I'm sitting there and I'm
thinking, stupid. Huh?

460
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,160
I'm thinking I got to get
in my car and get back home.

461
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,090
When is this dump going
to? I know it's a, I go,

462
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:46,210
is it going to come during this drive
and ruined this drive from worse to is?

463
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,630
Yeah. So then I go, should I try
to like, it's not ready to come.

464
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:53,290
Should I try to force a dump out? You
know, like, no, I know what I'll do.

465
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,800
I'll make a little hotel room coffee
and see if I can get the engine started.

466
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,450
You know? So I brew it. I'm putting stuff
in my bag and packing. I'm Kinda like,

467
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,450
and then you know, you're thinking like,
ah, how long is this drive going to take?

468
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,340
Right. I have a sip and I'm like, you
know, I could sit here for 15 minutes,

469
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,500
drink this coffee and probably do this,

470
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,240
but I don't want to wait 15 minutes
right now and it's not ready.

471
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,730
No Ma marriage. Before we continue,
may I give you my travel tip?

472
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,180
And this is for the listeners,
whenever you're traveling,

473
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,990
go buy the Starbucks instant coffee.

474
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,010
Go to Starbucks before your trip
or aren't Amazon using our banner,

475
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,000
your mom's House podcast out and you buy
the instant packets. I'm telling you,

476
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,250
that shit is white.
It's brown lightning,

477
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,150
you'll drink that and you're going to
shit that shit that doesn't make you shit.

478
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:43,090
Nothing. Well, and that's great
for travel but, but continue.

479
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,800
I should've given you some,
that's what I was trying to say.

480
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,940
I feel badly that did not.
So anyway,

481
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,680
so you're like, do I stay, sit
here, finish this cup. Yeah.

482
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,250
Now did you finish the whole no, no, no.

483
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,240
Is, that's what I'm saying. So I
have a sip and I go, oh my God.

484
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:02,080
Like I can feel the beginning
like the oil getting grease,

485
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,790
but it's not ready or do I go cause I
want to go, I want to get back. Right.

486
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:10,180
So I just go, fuck it. I'm
leaving. I go downstairs,

487
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,460
get the car and here's a big decision.
I wasn't even a decision.

488
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:19,240
It's actually kind of made for me.
I got to put gas in the car and I go,

489
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:24,010
is there a Starbucks or a coffee bean
or someplace to get coffee for my drive

490
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:24,844
back?

491
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,140
I don't see one for the
first half hour of the drive,

492
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,911
which is really annoying.

493
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:35,911
But then I realize that's actually doing
me a favor because if I were drinking

494
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,330
it,
I would have to dump.

495
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,030
So I actually right now I'm like,
I don't know,

496
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,860
10 minutes from the house, two hours
plus into this drive. And I realize, oh,

497
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:52,280
it's a good thing I didn't find coffee.
So I do find someone, I'm like uh,

498
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,190
right around the corner from the house
and as soon as I get in the house I say

499
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,680
hi to you.
Um,

500
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,030
I have a couple sips of coffee and then
boom, ready to go. And it was like a

501
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,080
nice for,
that's interesting.

502
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,310
What's interesting is that when I travel
and I go to Barre stocks and I get a

503
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:16,510
double tall a soy latte. Yeah.
It doesn't make me shit anymore.

504
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,310
It's not strong enough. Oh
yeah. Cause that's, that's
mostly soy milk. Double Tall.

505
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It
doesn't make me Brown. You got to,

506
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:29,470
you got to go for the fire man.
You've got to get some of this s espresso.

507
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,890
Espresso. Yeah. Interesting.
Interesting. Um, can I,

508
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,100
can I share my story with you
please? Sure. I mean you just go, oh,

509
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,890
I'm moving like no,

510
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,940
nobody else has a brown story to share
as long as no one else is talking. Yeah.

511
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,940
Oh well, okay. So anyways,

512
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,500
last night I made eggplant and I ate
a whole almost the whole egg plant to

513
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,334
myself.
Yeah.

514
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,630
And then I went to sleep and I
didn't have any farts all night,

515
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,640
which for sure is like

516
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,230
excellent. Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,130
Eggplants make me Fart so bad.
Yeah, I know that for sure.

518
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,670
And I didn't hit any kind of Florence
and I was like concerned a little like

519
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:14,450
what does that mean? It doesn't mean
that like can you make your body immune?

520
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,910
I don't think so. The farts? Yeah. No,

521
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,000
cause I eat Brussel sprouts now and I
don't really get as many fights as I used

522
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:24,200
to in the beginning. So
anyways, no, I'm serious.

523
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,350
I think you can build a resistance to
the food that gives you the farts and you

524
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,830
get less parts over time. Yeah.
So I'm having like no farts.

525
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,860
And then this morning I drank my coffee
and I took the biggest shit of my life.

526
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,820
I mean it was so much and I thought,

527
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,650
isn't that weird though that I didn't
have any like very good, very good. Yay.

528
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,190
But I didn't have any warning
shots like there was not nothing.

529
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,700
What's your theory on this?
Cause it sounds really interesting so far.

530
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,520
That's your, uh, my theory
is that I've grown it.

531
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,120
You can build an immunity to flu.
You're not having,

532
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,660
you're not having that every
day. Eggplant. So not every day,

533
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:09,410
but I've had it enough to
build an immunity. You know,

534
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,050
it's like when you take a little
bit of the poison every day,

535
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:15,800
your body builds an immunity
to it. Interesting. I don't
know if I believe that,

536
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:19,040
but I do know,
I believe that in theory,

537
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,010
I still believe that that theory applies
here cause it's not like you're like

538
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:26,540
constantly eating this stuff for you
to build the immunity. I did enough.

539
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,470
You think? So I do a Brussels
sprouts to aunt dried apricot.

540
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:33,500
It's those main used to make me feel
really bad and they really don't do that

541
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:34,334
anymore.

542
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,570
Okay. I'm in the shed. Okay.
Yeah, there's a reason.

543
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,440
Well,
I think I found out her reason.

544
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,440
That's why she's in the shed cheese thing.

545
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,820
I have a bunch of girls here.
If you see my writing other sites,

546
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:03,750
you'll see there's suddenly
all kinds of pictures of,

547
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:07,930
of me and other girls and video's going
to be showing up very short. Other girls.

548
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,570
Yeah, we're taking videos
and problems. Yeah.

549
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,260
Hear the rooster crowing.
Um,

550
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,510
what would it have taken for you to go
down this path you think? Not a lot.

551
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,400
Like how close could you
have been to like, oh,

552
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:27,090
there's videos on my site and you're
just like, they're going to be up soon.

553
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,940
It would be in some other girls.
I have gas and then you turn it on,

554
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:33,360
you fart into a camera.
2009 could have happened.

555
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,180
He thinks that like had nothing
picked out for us. Yeah.

556
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:39,480
I mean we were looking at us. I wouldn't
be with you if this was going on.

557
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:43,920
I'm saying you're alone for
sure. He wouldn't support
me and my business venture.

558
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,200
Definitely not. No, no, no. Well, I mean
2008 where we were at our brokenness,

559
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,140
we have no money. Nearly married.
I mean, this is easy money, dude.

560
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:56,400
As far as I'm concerned,
no, I think, no dude, easy

561
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,350
not married to this.
My mock this on our podcast.

562
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,290
I'm not married to it.

563
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,490
You know how fucking I could do this
and let's say 2007 instead of getting

564
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:12,690
engaged,
we break up a year later.

565
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,030
Are you in a shed farting in my camera?
Yes.

566
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,080
Possibly. Because look,
when I married you,

567
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:22,880
I mean I had just transitioned
into being a fulltime fee track.

568
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,220
I had no money and I leaned
in on you and you know, we,

569
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,390
because of you, it been
like, hey, pretty girl.

570
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,210
You're thinking about other ways to make
money and you're like, oh my God, no.

571
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:37,050
Would you ever come by my shed this week?
And uh,

572
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,890
he,
he's,

573
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,930
he plenty of eggplant before you go over
there where your Pajama bottoms too.

574
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,930
That's a weird choice. The
Pajama bottoms, she eats veggies.

575
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,943
Yeah,

576
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,320
that was all swollen. So
yesterday I thought vegetables,

577
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,040
some rooster
is the best idea.

578
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,120
She's a Christian, at least.
Did you see her cross? Yeah.

579
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,300
Ah, it's such just mailing
$100 to that far. I know.

580
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,501
How much do you think she can,

581
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:10,090
but she's in the veggies just
like you blonde big cans. Yeah.

582
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,640
Just like you healthy diet guys.

583
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,970
I could do. I could so do
it. It's really not a big,

584
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,320
okay.

585
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,090
I'm going to go try to go
back to the party and put
half that and pictures of it.

586
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,020
Yeah. I might be back though
because I don't think this is real.

587
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,260
All of the cheeks got up on her tippy toes
for that one. She got up. She was like,

588
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,900
oh,

589
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,130
I wouldn't do it that way.

590
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,910
I would make mine more playful
the way king ass rapper does.

591
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:40,580
I create more scenarios,
more oopsies,

592
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,470
different locations.
The shed is not exciting to the viewer.

593
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,250
I don't like to shed that. She's
out there making that like this. Uh,

594
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,800
yeah.
I don't like the shed aspect of it.

595
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,083
I know.

596
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,423
I like that.

597
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,350
That would be a little more fun about it.

598
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,460
Oh my [inaudible].

599
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,173
Yeah,

600
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,190
I know this. Can you
believe it? Oh my gosh.

601
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:16,390
I'm so embarrassed

602
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,070
now and a response. We came up with
a very serious topic discussion.

603
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:26,920
We normally don't get the
serious on the show. Uh,

604
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:30,010
but we were wondering what do you
call it when you have to dump,

605
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,390
but only a fart comes out and we,
how's that

606
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,280
big,
big conversation started last week.

607
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,250
Um, a number of them
came in here. Oh wait,

608
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,100
can I glean from Twitter?
Sure, sure. Okay.

609
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,890
At Real Big Kong writes a no shit.

610
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:52,360
But a fart should be called a
Chanel shit and nope. Combo.

611
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,040
All right, so again, just to make
people clear on this shore, uh,

612
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,670
we've said that when you think you're
going to fart and you and you should,

613
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:05,170
it's a shark. What about when you think
you're going to shit and you only fart?

614
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,550
Why isn't there a word for it?
Right, right, right. Okay. Uh,

615
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:13,830
this one is from at Garel be dumped.

616
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,440
Fake Ghost Shit.
Counter Shit.

617
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,990
Charlatan. I like that one. That one
a lot. Or imposter. That's funny.

618
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,650
I'll strong suggestions.
I like counter shit or charlatan.

619
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,220
I'm kind of leaning towards short 10.

620
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:34,360
Booster boosters are funny. Uh, okay.

621
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,380
Just watch the latest episode. Mommy's,
this is from at secret moves MMA.

622
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,080
What if the opposite of sharp was far,

623
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,450
which also sounds like farce.
Yeah, I mean, that's a suggestion.

624
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,320
A food. I heard that
one. That's not bad. Um,

625
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,450
someone said there's a, uh,
seduce a pseudo deuce. I said

626
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,430
yes. At Chase Leopard rights. Uh,

627
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,020
when you think you're going to shit
and you only Fart, it's a Charlotte.

628
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,830
It was pretty good. Yeah. Somebody
said there's no word combos for this.

629
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:13,810
It's just simply a solid fart.
I just a disappointment.

630
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,370
A Brown downer. Oh, I like a brick.
Came in Rachel from Portland. Okay.

631
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,390
When range. Yeah. Somebody
calls it a Macbeth.

632
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm like that.
Yeah.

633
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,300
It is a tale told by an idiot full
of sound and fury signifying nothing.

634
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,080
Very good like that. Uh, moms,

635
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,260
when you go to take your shit only turns
out to be a tutor. It's called a shoot.

636
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,660
Ah. Um, ah, uh,

637
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,540
Tibbs said it's a poltergeist.
Wow. I like that one a lot.

638
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,140
Octo poos him spirit poop. Yeah. Uh,

639
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,200
this one said you're not taking
this shit home and you're frowning.

640
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,000
Fart failed was brown frown.
Yeah.

641
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,780
That's Kate and the
resident Fart gentlemen.

642
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,010
Thank you for all your [inaudible]
where I'm leaning. Yeah,

643
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,820
I like pull pools or geist a lot.

644
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,440
Charlatan. And I like
imposter. That's really good.

645
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,540
It's really hot in here too,
cause it's like the 90 outside today.

646
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,960
Yeah. So I'm in a room, it's
fed, closed all day. So yeah.

647
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,230
How much money can she make?

648
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,620
$50 a video to ruin your life.
That's a thing.

649
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,030
Is it really worth it is,

650
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,870
I think she, she might be pushing a
little too hard at this point. I heard,

651
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,420
cause I think she's gotten a few out.
She's like,

652
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:40,940
I gotta get a few more out
in their bodies. Like, um,

653
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,470
it's going to be a little extra on
the end of this one that sounded like

654
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,540
she's all winded.
My work here is done.

655
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,380
Can you hear that
tailbone?

656
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,580
Oh God.

657
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,360
It's like Rodenbach Lee.

658
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,643
Yuck.
Yuck.

659
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,910
I mean, how much could
she make? Seriously?

660
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,890
I don't even $50 a video dude in
this like, well no, because there's,

661
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,190
there's gotta be multiple,
you know, viewers, guys that,

662
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,790
do you think they're paying,
you don't think they're paying $50 each?

663
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,040
It's a subscriber based.
I don't know.

664
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:43,790
I'm trying to guess like to figure out
like if she's putting this up somewhere

665
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,940
and she's obviously
speaking to an audience,

666
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,540
a group of people that are used
to coming there, maybe they pay,

667
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,590
I don't know, $10, $20 each.

668
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,180
The demand to put out content.
I mean,

669
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,320
she's really gotta be farting every day,
every other day.

670
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,580
I'm rethinking being married
to you if you're doing this.

671
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:09,140
Now I'm thinking maybe this is a good
idea. I'm thinking of the potential.

672
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,010
What's the pros? Just the sheer volume.
Yeah. Yeah. As long as we can get a,

673
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,400
you know, a decent, uh,
cause you're just the, uh,

674
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,770
the upfront costs are just
the food to make the fart. No,

675
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,280
what makes me far too, so there's
the thing is no trial and error.

676
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,280
40 years of doing this. I mean,
I've been in this game long enough.

677
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:33,230
I know it works for me. What are you
want to call the site fart mistress.

678
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,900
Oh, that's probably taken.
I'm sure I wanted to look

679
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,201
Fart,
mess,

680
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:43,880
stress 40 cause then then I
combined like the mill genre.

681
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,140
Oh yeah. No, I mean wet

682
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,470
fart mistress.
Did you mean fart mistress?

683
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,070
Mistress fart porn two mistresses,

684
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,410
but there's not fart mistress.com is
what I'm saying. Far Mres 40 yeah,

685
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,240
cause then it combines taken and
the FARC genre together. Right.

686
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,660
I think that's smart marketing
Tris,

687
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,280
the farting MILF.
That's another one

688
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,010
from a marketing standpoint that no,
I typed it in as a URL.

689
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:23,300
No results for fart
mistresses. Yeah. Hello? Yeah.

690
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,840
Buy It up now.
Well now someone's going to buy it.

691
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,620
I believe we hadn't buyers for mistress.

692
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,370
Bart mistress is here

693
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,390
now. How much content do I have to
put out? Is it once a week or daily?

694
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,790
Like how are these porn sites
work? Tell me. I don't know.

695
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,350
I don't know how that stuff works.
Oh sure. I don't know how the

696
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,300
uploading content you ask, you ask our
friend Yoshi, he knows all that stuff.

697
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,690
But I mean to keep my
subscribers engaged and happy,

698
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,640
I would think of at least a couple of week
and then I had a tweet,

699
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:59,790
the videos and, but then you're
just giving it away for free. Right?

700
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,090
All tastes see the whole thing.

701
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,050
Well that's the thing that the teaser
is the whole show pretty much. I mean,

702
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:11,490
a Fart is humble. If we second could be,
the teaser could be like, oh guys, ah,

703
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:16,170
some big ones coming.
That's what I worry about in that genre.

704
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,120
Is it so limited creatively?
Like how many set up?

705
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:21,790
Why don't we get more creative
with it? But I mean, it's like, oh,

706
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,110
I have to Fart so bad.
Ah,

707
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,690
like we need to really think of a way
to reinvent the Fart, Mr Shaundra.

708
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,350
That's true. I mean, what
if it's an accidental thing?

709
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,420
Like we set up these scenarios where like,
I'm at jury duty and then I'm like,

710
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,240
oh my God, Tom, I have to Fart so
bad. I'm, I'm afraid to let it out.

711
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:42,270
And you're like, just let it out
and like I fart in public and stuff.

712
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,360
Could that be a genre? Could be
zone, right? Yeah, of course.

713
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,450
What about the car fart where you,
it's like a hot one and then you leave,

714
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:51,090
you come back. It's still
there. That kind of stuff.

715
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,800
So you're getting more creative about
done this other pole thing is that as

716
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:58,020
you're doing that out there in the world,

717
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,620
you know that a bunch of guys
are enjoying it. You know,

718
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,900
can't look when you squeeze it all guests.

719
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,680
He's so gross. He's still
worst. He is not the way.

720
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,150
He's so gross like a granddad.

721
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,540
Oh my God. Just all guests. I'm coming up.

722
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,000
Duda got some coming up.
Have you been doing your exercise

723
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,100
every day?
I love the way Andy 50 how's it going,

724
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,723
rob?
Rob,

725
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,000
how's your 50 50 50 times

726
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,220
now? You get the penis out. Yeah,
you pull the skin. A lot of people.

727
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:52,221
Then there was certain census circumstance
with the skin and you get the oil in

728
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:56,730
the hand and you're up 10 called
ladies do rob, Rob, rob, rob,

729
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,070
especially on the Klan Penis
rubbed them 50 times. Rus.

730
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,630
Okay, because you met them
strong and not sensitive.

731
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,930
Oh, he's so gross. 50
time. Once one, uh, Rice.

732
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,830
I protect site.

733
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:18,800
If your town from 50 time
bet 50 times dow. Why?

734
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,180
Okay.
How often am I doing this?

735
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,290
You have to do every day until
you can control every day.

736
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,280
Everyday. Just Jack Your Dick. 300
times. That's what he's been doing.

737
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,660
That's why he's the expert.
The Dick Jacket.

738
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,000
When an asshole is the dig.
Jackie, just a poker room.

739
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,870
I love that you call him just a pervert.

740
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:43,810
Well that's what all these clowns
are. No here, like I rubbed my deck.

741
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:45,250
Maybe I can teach to other people.

742
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,783
Yeah,

743
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:51,130
he is so nasty. I hate his hand. Rap, rap,

744
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,910
rap, rap. The rap. Will you try it once?

745
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,530
Just try it. Try it. It's 300 strokes
total, right? Yeah, I'll try it.

746
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,730
You go down and then you
had to pull the it. He says,

747
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:08,700
some people want circumstance. He's
all for it. But I mean, yeah, yeah.

748
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,490
50 50, 50, 50. It's just down, down,

749
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:17,450
down. It's not down back. You know
what I'm saying? Right. So you're just,

750
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,460
he's trying to get your,

751
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:25,060
you're Ding Dong less sensitive
is throw up from coming so hard.

752
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,940
He is so nasty.

753
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,440
I don't know. I seriously, okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. What'd you rather

754
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,720
kiss? Shacks. Tutsis.

755
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,000
And we saw it look like we saw
what shacks, feet look like.

756
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:51,040
Okay, now you've got to bring it up. You
can't do more. And you got to bring it up,

757
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:54,990
man. We did in the last episode, his feet.

758
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,960
If you're listening to
this just on the podcast,

759
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,820
please Google shacks, feet
your foot, you're going to die.

760
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,290
I mean, it doesn't even look human. The
poor guys been playing for his whole life.

761
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:11,880
His feet are just mangled.
A shot

762
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,900
that's been nasty.
Uh,

763
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,710
kiss that,
kiss that policy,

764
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,740
or every time you're masturbating,

765
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:31,060
you got to have the Chinese guy
coaching you and he's like, rub,

766
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,700
rub, rub. And then you
play the audio of him.

767
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,390
Jackie leaning as you ejaculate.

768
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,220
Every time I Jack off
You have him coaching you

769
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,010
and then when you come he goes with you.

770
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:56,440
He comes with you to the hotel rooms.
Like when you're on the road, it rob, rob,

771
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,340
every time you do your 50
50 fifties he's coaching,

772
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,540
he's coaching you from the
cherries. Like Tom, rob, rob,

773
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,503
right.

774
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,570
I think I would deal with it. I think
it was fine. I think I don't mind it.

775
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,840
I don't mind it. I think I liked
that he's an expert and I'd be like,

776
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:14,591
am I doing it right?

777
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:17,860
And I'd like to have like a little
little expert opinion in there.

778
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,960
I think I'd be into it. I like it. You're
sick. I like it. I think, I think he'd be,

779
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,770
he'd be like, you forgot the
left side. I was like, Oh
yeah, I forgot. He's like Tom,

780
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,190
he's rob, Rob, rob. He's like
a trainer that goes, uh hey,

781
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:33,540
I saw you put your knees down, get
back up there. Right. You know,

782
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,700
so you definitely wouldn't come
fast because he know. Yeah.

783
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,470
Like I would have major control.
You know what? Come to think of it.

784
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,270
He should be like a concierge service.
Like he,

785
00:50:45,271 --> 00:50:48,610
you should come to your house and teach
you how to Rob Rob, because I lie,

786
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,060
you won't come. I think it would
be mildly difficult to stay hard

787
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,150
if he's sitting there looking at you
like rob and you're like, um, dude, why?

788
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,500
I can't really get it up right now. I
can't believe you feel that way. Yeah.

789
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:07,350
I think I would have a little bit of
difficulty. Terrible. Yeah. The shot.

790
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,020
I would take checks,
but any day,

791
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:12,750
especially on the penis now,

792
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,500
would you rather have sex with him?

793
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,270
No other option or you have to put shocks,

794
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:24,380
whole foot in your coochie he's
done. I mean, it would hurt,

795
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,430
but I'd find a way why I squeezed
a person out of there. I don't,

796
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,020
why would you do that over that? Because
that guy is so fucking gross. Dude.

797
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,820
The Chinese case. The worst.
That's the worst. Yeah. He's,

798
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,010
he's a nasty pervert. He really
is. Nasty program. You're so,

799
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,190
and that guy at all.
How about Stevens to goal or him?

800
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,110
Steven Seagal. Really?
He's not that repugnant,

801
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:55,400
sweaty, fat, older guy. He's not that
bad. I mean, he's got that silly hair,

802
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:59,060
but that's, you know, that's nothing.
He's probably way more annoying.

803
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,730
I have to listen to him talk
about himself all day soon.

804
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,410
I am the king of Improv for you.

805
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,760
You want to deal with that?
Yeah. So you all about sex.

806
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,970
You think that guy's annoying about
sex the moment you choose to call,

807
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:18,260
he's going to be like, I've made more
girls come in the last hundred and 20

808
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,910
even imagine and then
he'll start doing like,

809
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,850
wait a minute, let me,
hold on. Let me just, uh,

810
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,560
let me talk to you. A pussy
food is nasty. It's both nasty,

811
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:36,830
but I think they're amazing guys.
Much more charming.

812
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,460
Why is he the grossest I just,
I'm not attracted to him at all.

813
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,800
I just think he's Rose Rose.
I don't like his,

814
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,750
I actually can't believe you find
him grosser than say, Oh yeah.

815
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,010
Really know why. I think because the old
Chinese guy could be like my granddad.

816
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:54,440
I feel like he's too old.
He's not that old.

817
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,040
He's like your sweet old Chinese grandad.
I don't like him.

818
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,310
He's too nasty to talking.
My jacket is deg and stuff.

819
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,090
I don't want to hear that dad.
Hey, you got to tell you something.

820
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,730
I'm Pauley and I'm bi.

821
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:15,750
I'm poly and I'm by one of my
favorite moments of the shell.

822
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:18,480
Was that
alright?

823
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,120
Baton from both angles. All right, so

824
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,010
email in Molly

825
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,320
and I'm by audio issue with the podcast.
Hey Hitler.

826
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,980
I've noticed in the past few episodes
that every time you say that you are

827
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,920
playing a clip of someone
puking or farting,

828
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,740
I never actually hear
someone puking or farting,

829
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,210
but I'm even an even more obnoxious sound
that turns out to be Christina's voice.

830
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,540
It's a complete turnoff for me
and I'm sure it is for others.

831
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:52,710
Also after glass and through the Internet
for hours trying to troubleshoot,

832
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,390
I came across a webpage dedicated
to this type of disturbing problem.

833
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,670
It said that this issue is actually stems
from a complete lack of personality is

834
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:06,000
causing the audio interference
in parentheses. Christina.

835
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,890
This makes perfect sense.

836
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:12,950
As Christina's personality is as dry
as an old lady's vaccine in the Mojave

837
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:13,830
desert,

838
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,830
I suggest adding more of Tom's refreshing
and sweet personality as well as his

839

847
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:48,680

Oh No, I'm not going to listen.

850

You push a button again.

851
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,190
I just fucking saw you not listening.

852
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:06,663
All right,

853
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,720
You think I was born yesterday?
We're done. I'm not putting
my headphones on. Why?

854
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,500
Cause I know you got some nasty Shillay
now. No, I don't. I don't. I promise.

855
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,890
I promise.
Let me see your hands.

856
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,470
You just push something cause I'm
setting up the next thing to play.

857
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,230
I have to play something else.
Jean,

858
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:33,160
may I go ahead. Okay. So we had a, Oh,

859
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:36,860
this lady, um, that was in the, the uh,

860
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,150
UK lady who tried to make a trustee yet.

861
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,020
Here I'll show the clip and then I'll,
okay.

862
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,920
Ladies standing there.

863
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:55,370
She uses her hairdryer as
a make believe cause and,

864
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,830
but Mike's going now all
up and down the road.

865
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,110
It hard to stop.

866
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,840
How many cigarettes did you smoke when
you describe her for our listeners?

867
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,700
And um,

868
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,240
this woman I can be related to this is
also very eastern European look. Yeah.

869
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,070
Uh, not good teeth, soggy mushy measures.

870
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,710
And they're mashed into a tube top,

871
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,960
which when you got big hangers
you can not wear a two.

872
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,540
Is that a good look up the table for you?
Yeah,

873
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,460
I mean there's a lot going on though.
You're leaving a lot off. You do it. Well,

874
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:34,390
I mean it's a bit of a weathered look.

875
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:40,010
Haggard full life. I prefer. Um,

876
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,130
yeah, there's, I mean if you were
to just crop out everything else,

877
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:48,910
you could definitely make this a Zim.
Well,

878
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,010
how well do you think she they are?

879
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,980
I think they are much
younger than they look.

880
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,240
I worry that they are like 55.

881
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,430
They don't look good.
They have been

882
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:14,320
zippy Dan to route. She's been
riding it hard. Drinking hard.

883
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,050
So what she does
bikes and costs.

884
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,030
Well I do love shit like this though.

885
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,690
So she holds out a hairdryer.
Hilarious.

886
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,770
And it has the effect of making
these cars slow down. I love it.

887
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,240
You don't on our street but
going all up and down the road.

888
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,140
No. Yeah. And those all up them them the
road. Those chompers are something else.

889
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:46,250
And I'm just listening to the voice.
Cool.

890
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,950
Simply by picking up on it though.

891
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:55,980
I have never seen so many
people's brake lights go on.

892
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,310
And only chase is a hair dryer

893
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,330
lover. I love vigilante shit like
this. What do you think of that?

894
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,760
I think we have l one l two l three and
I'm going to score them. Five, five, five,

895
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:11,560
five, five, five, five,
five, five, five, five

896
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:17,790
goes, Eh, look like artifacts. Yeah.

897
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,370
Those look like if you were in a museum
that you like, we discovered these.

898
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:25,210
They're over 60,000 years old.
Paleolithic woman.

899
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,480
She reminds me of those Gypsies.

900
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:33,160
We used to watch a lot gypsy's age
poorly as well. She might be gypsy. Yeah,

901
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,490
actually. Yeah, that would
make more sense. Definitely.

902
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:41,220
Take a look at here I am calling
her. She over and over. So rude.

903
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,500
The thing is is that you know you're on
television and you think you wouldn't

904
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:51,760
wear or the tube top, mashed your tits
down. No makeup, like just clean up.

905
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,430
All of that could traps her shoulders.

906
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,340
She's got tribes like yours,
dude, hitting the old heck squat.

907
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,140
If they don't like it.
I live here.

908
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,630
My friends live here.

909
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:13,490
My friends children live here and if
we can't be safe in around streets,

910
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,940
how the hell are we going to
be safe in the world? Right?

911
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:22,100
Yeah. Good point. I do like her
method. What about what's what's

912
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,760
happening behind her? The sale rack
there? Yeah. It's like a yard sale.

913
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,710
Oh Man.
She's like 41 years old,

914
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,590
right?
I'm 38 this year.

915
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,840
What if she was that young?
She could be.

916
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:42,720
Sometimes these folks don't age
very well. Yeah. They, they live,

917
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,050
live on a diet of like wonder bread.

918
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:49,790
Real hot Cheetos and
Mario. We'll see. Yeah,

919
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,390
we'll see. Do you prefer basement? Hey,

920
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,590
should I go to take a hot Cheetos and
Takis? And that's what she's eight.

921
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:59,310
Do you want her to here at three or
four? Whatever you want gene. Well,

922
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:02,570
it's 10 after two. So what do you think?
Why I need to take a swim after this,

923
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:06,830
but as long as I can do that.
Okay. Right, sure. Um, okay,

924
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:11,840
so keep talking. Uh, I like her initiative
with doing this with a hairdryer.

925
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,110
I feel like we need to do this on our
street because so many assholes just

926
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,490
whoosh whiz by and we live in the burbs.
Man. You shouldn't be doing that shit.

927
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,620
There's kids on bikes.
Yeah.

928
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,080
You feel me?
You know?

929
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,830
No, I have relatives that
look this bad. Definitely.

930
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:33,240
I got a couple right now that look
like that. That's just hard to have.

931
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:36,300
I have some rough living relatives.
Yeah. But that's hard living.

932
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:38,250
No south of the border.
Right, right. Yeah.

933
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,650
No dentistry or medical
care. No access to it. Yeah.

934
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,150
Yeah. She's not doing Pilati use twice
a week, stick and do primal diet,

935
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:51,970
stuff like that. Yeah. I like
your sounds. I do yet. Yeah.

936
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,870
Wow. Wow. Wow.

937
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,520
Yeah.

938
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,520
You know how it is caused
bikes going by you?

939
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:11,500
My goodness. Yeah. Um, yeah.

940
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,490
One of my favorite

941
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:17,410
things that I saw on Instagram,
I think it was,

942
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:22,510
was it that Scotty Pippin, um, page.

943
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,210
Anyways,
I think that who posted this,

944
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,280
this dude posted this video of,

945
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,470
it's kind of like that. Um,
what's it called when like the,

946
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,430
like the, the court shows, you
know, we're like, they confessed,

947
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:43,120
the let the TV judge decide
everything in Spanish.

948
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:48,810
And this one was just out radius,

949
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:55,030
but it's all in Spanish. But just to
highlight that somebody said this on TV.

950
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,610
Okay.
So

951
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:00,890
you're fine.

952
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:07,170
So this lady with a studio
audience is telling the judge, um,

953
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:12,610
he told us to uncover our backsides
and as we were still wearing those

954
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:17,560
transparent ropes. Okay. Um,
I was the fourth one down,

955
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,020
right? Yeah. Okay. Yes.

956
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,370
[inaudible]

957
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,910
I started hearing heavy breathing.

958
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,710
No, you don't know him.
He will be in Toronto.

959
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,150
Weird moaning behind.
Yeah.

960
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,640
[inaudible]

961
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,090
and then out of nowhere I feel
someone's tongue liking my bud.

962
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:39,730
Bye.
Amy.

963
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,930
I tried to hit him, but he grabbed me
and said I was ruining the ritual. Oh

964
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:48,950
yeah. Basically just put your hand
under the [inaudible] may wow know.

965
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,200
So this guy told me that he
was going to heal me, right?

966
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,500
Oh yeah.
No

967
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,100
bye. [inaudible] se it'll
say, yeah, of course.

968
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
So she's saying that like,

969
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,210
I was supposed to let this guy lick me
on the ass and that was supposed to seal

970
01:03:04,211 --> 01:03:05,500
the deal.
Like on the ritual.

971
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,240
Is there any factors in your practice?

972
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,840
It does it, yeah. So those guys,

973
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:15,740
is that the same saying in Spanish
tossing salad and that this is,

974
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,600
why would they call that?
Is there a route?

975
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,840
Praise. Uh, I think she said
one here. She said it's okay.

976
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:23,893
I think I meant that.

977
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,440
That'd be so negative that the,
I dunno, the, the black kiss,

978
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:32,840
is that what she's saying? I don't
know. I think that's what she said.

979
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,410
That's what it sounds.
He's the guy.

980
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:37,921
Yum.
You know,

981
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:42,921
either yellow [inaudible]
El [inaudible] son.

982
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:46,700
So,
oh my,

983
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:51,550
this guy who looks like a
quirky spiritual guy. Right?

984
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,140
Like you don't see him being like at
the top of a mountain and be like, yeah,

985
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:58,480
let's spend a month here. Don't talk.
So he has this, he's bald, he's older,

986
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:03,220
he's got this weird white
shirt that has like no collar.

987
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,083
Right?
Like,

988
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:09,560
and he's telling that the court now
that dogs and cats heal themselves with

989
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:13,840
their tongues, Jesus cured a
blind man with his saliva. Yeah.

990
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,600
I never read that one, Gary. I know.

991
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,700
Why the anus.
Why?

992
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:28,550
Because all the bad stuff comes from
their true. True. Okay. Don't just,

993
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,030
I get as flat

994
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,540
well, lot. No.

995
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,270
So he spits on their cans.
It, why did you show that?

996
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,890
Is it upsetting?

997
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,620
Yeah. I feel like so many things on
your mom's house. It never phased me.

998
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,560
That's like one of those things

999
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,840
and it cause it's a holy man and he's
taking advantage of people's religion.

1000
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,500
Well, he's not taking advantage of
anyone. He's feeling people. I hate that.

1001
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:03,700
I hate that people trust him. It's so
sad. Yes. Thanks for bumming me out. Well,

1002
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,580
maybe you'd want it to feel a little.

1003
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,610
Okay.

1004
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,160
That's what I feel. All right. I
like that these people were like,

1005
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:18,280
this is charge and they're like, okay,
pull your pants down. Okay, now spread

1006
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,310
your cheeks. Gotcha. Like what
don't you be like, fuck you.

1007
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:23,290
I'm not pulling my pants down.
Crazy train.

1008
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,510
I'm going to lick your ass for a
minute and make you feel better. Right,

1009
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:28,960
but what you wouldn't protest at
that level. Let me ask you this.

1010
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,060
I kind of feel like this is actually a
great evidence for your honor's pace in

1011
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:37,120
getting you to kiss my,
give me the black.

1012
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:42,121
Yes is a holy man's ploy
cleans on the impurity.

1013
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,590
US.
As you can see,

1014
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:50,010
this very spiritual man has cured many
people by spitting in the healthiest of

1015
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:54,940
places.
And I feel

1016
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:56,323
that

1017
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,320
counsel would best serve
me back cleaning my bed.

1018
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,563
Uh,

1019
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,120
dirty evil.
Oh,

1020
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:11,240
I think we should take you to a yoga
class so that you can learn to lick your

1021
01:06:11,241 --> 01:06:15,650
own butt hole. Okay. That is not what I
signed up for. It was not what I want.

1022
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:20,370
Can I just take a rag on a stick and wet
it and then mash it against your butt

1023
01:06:20,371 --> 01:06:24,410
hole? I'd be like, that's my
tongue. No, that's the same
thing. It's the same thing.

1024
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:28,790
It's the same thing. What's, what's
Mario saying? Maria just said,

1025
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:33,020
I challenge you and Bert
to a water challenge.

1026
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:37,730
Okay. I will win. And if
you want a bigger challenge,

1027
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:42,500
we can do a pull up, push up, post
Tito's challenge and I'll still win.

1028
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,630
Love you. Hm. Well first of all, the
water challenge wouldn't be with him.

1029
01:06:47,631 --> 01:06:51,320
It'd be with you and me. That's the,
she's not getting it. She doesn't get,

1030
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:54,710
she doesn't understand that. No. Would
you want to take her up on that challenge?

1031
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:59,270
No, because I've never been a
showboat or like you are, will you?

1032
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,900
You guzzle a gallon and then own the
water champ. It's not about that.

1033
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:06,890
It's about hydrating constantly throughout
the day so that I don't need to binge.

1034
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:11,870
I understand. I'm a consistent, you're,
you're, you're just, you're jumping ahead.

1035
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,140
Would you want to have a
day long water challenge?

1036
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:20,050
I don't need the challenge. I know
exactly who I am and I am the true champ.

1037
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,110
You don't want to compete in this.
Why would I? Okay. To be the wind.

1038
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,440
What's the point to say who
drinks the most or who drinks,

1039
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,120
who drinks the most in a day? Not
a binge moment in a day. Okay,

1040
01:07:32,121 --> 01:07:34,490
but that's the thing. It's like
the, you're going to binge,

1041
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:39,140
you're going to push yourself day than
you normally do. I can drink it all day.

1042
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:44,840
Do you want to prove that you're the water
champ by partaking in the competition

1043
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:48,740
with Maria or with you? With the two
of us. So it's a threeway competition.

1044
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:51,080
What does, but what does she have to,
she doesn't have anything to do with it.

1045
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,730
She's not a part of this thing.

1046
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:57,290
She's saying that she's the water
champion and the and wants to dethrone us.

1047
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:01,310
I don't want to do this now.
Why? Why? Why would I want,

1048
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,560
I don't like doing
contests like you and Bert.

1049
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:08,450
I don't like putting myself through
suffering for the point of what? No,

1050
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:11,240
I don't like it. I know why.
I know in my heart who I am.

1051
01:08:11,241 --> 01:08:14,180
I don't need to fucking compete.
No. In my heart who I am,

1052
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,570
I already know that I am the champion.
Why would I even need to compete?

1053
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:22,190
Demean myself to base myself to
compete with fucking peasants.

1054
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,880
You and Maria are jokes. You guys are
fucking, you're not even in my league.

1055
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:29,540
Why would I compete with a
dilettante drinkers? Okay.

1056
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,720
You guys are fucking Sunday drinkers,
but this thing, I'll know this.

1057
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,160
When you say things like that,
you can back it up with what you do.

1058
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,920
That's the whole point. Yeah.
I've, I've, I know I'm hydrated.

1059
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,650
The doctor says I'm perfect. Everything's
perfect. I've been to a urologist, they,

1060
01:08:43,651 --> 01:08:46,910
the guy told me to stop drinking
so much so you won't take place.

1061
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,160
Take Part in the competition?
No, I don't believe,

1062
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:53,300
I don't like doing stuff like that. That's
a fucking waste of my time. Okay. Um,

1063
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,040
I would like to accept Maria's challenge
for the water drinking competition.

1064
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:02,990
Oh my God. What? When are you going
to do this? Tomorrow. Okay. Okay.

1065
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:08,420
Or I dunno, the next day. Wait, what?
Is that so weird to you? I mean, no,

1066
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:11,840
it just sounds like torture because you
guys are just going to gorge and drink

1067
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,610
too much and it's going to be miserable.

1068
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,490
I don't have that kind of time
right now. I got to do stuff, man.

1069
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,120
You don't have that kind of thing. No,
I'm busy the next two weeks, you know,

1070
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:24,360
shooting my special, go to
San Francisco. All right.

1071
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:27,530
I had to fucking go do shit tomorrow.
I'll have time to, if I can do this. Yeah.

1072
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,330
But you know,
you realize you're not allowed.

1073
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,160
Like when you say that
you won't participate,

1074
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:35,120
you're not allowed to be part
of the conversation. Great.

1075
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,920
But I mean, you're no longer even allowed
to call yourself the water champion.

1076
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,380
That's fine. I know in my heart who
I am. I'm secure with who I am. Yeah.

1077
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:50,090
Big l with what you are. It's
fine. So be it. So be it.

1078
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,230
You guys have, I'm great at this. I
don't need to compete. It's a silly,

1079
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,600
this is childish. I'm, I'm
an adult. Your children.

1080
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,580
Okay. All right. Um,

1081
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,460
speaking of great fun things. My, uh,

1082
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:09,600
two sentences and I'm not
sure it wasn't the same,

1083
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:14,610
but this is a major league baseball
player reading his own mother's jokes

1084
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:19,670
to, uh, to uh, uh,

1085
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:22,380
a teammate of his and

1086
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,390
the teammates reaction
is almost unbelievable.

1087
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,460
It actually feels like
top dog is in the room.

1088
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,950
It's Monday.
We're going to do mom joke,

1089
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,900
Phillips and will Smith
has a lot of corny jokes.

1090
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:37,480
So we're going to tell a few
to Mr Breath. Philip. Sarah,

1091
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:41,580
see if we can't get them to laugh.
So is there his mother's jokes? Okay.

1092
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:46,530
Why did the stadium get hot after
the game? Because it was hot.

1093
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,970
Just like my dance left.

1094
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,420
Look at that guys lap

1095
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,230
because he fucking with him.
I don't know.

1096
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,230
I don't know. I think they're both, I
think they're both, it's pretty funny.

1097
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:12,270
I think this guy is,
is questionable up top,

1098
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:18,090
you know? I don't think he's a
all there. The guy on the left.

1099
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,530
Yeah. I think he's got
real problems. Like maybe,

1100
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,110
maybe he used to play football before
he played baseball and that kind of

1101
01:11:25,111 --> 01:11:25,470
problem.

1102
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,170
Yeah. That's so good. How'd
you make an egg roll there?

1103
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,013
Push it

1104
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,900
like he's really,
he thinks that's really funny.

1105
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:40,210
You think so? I think he knows that one's
corny. I think he does, but he's like,

1106
01:11:40,211 --> 01:11:41,610
oh my gosh,
this is good

1107
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:46,410
money.

1108
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:51,000
No, it's not pleasant. The bicycle fall
over because they didn't have a peg.

1109
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:56,010
I was too tired. Your tires
to get that way. I get it.

1110
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:01,640
I think he's, I think he's
really liked this touched.
Yeah. A little bit. Sweet guy.

1111
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:06,230
But you know, were tarred. He got
all the genes to play a sport.

1112
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then
to think about anything else.

1113
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,800
What are the ducks out of the bars?
Dinner Plaque and put it on my bill.

1114
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:20,490
I'm like, God, I really landed very
good. I like that one. Oh my God,

1115
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:23,220
they're both laughing at that.
Look at him. Look at him.

1116
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,380
Oh my gosh. Oh my God.
What's happening here?

1117
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,540
Oh Man. Oh, he really thinks it's funny.

1118
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,340
Got It. Oh, got

1119
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,680
really thinks it's funny. I like, is it,

1120
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:45,160
it made me that there's so
much more innocent than we are.

1121
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,950
Like they'd probably don't sit
here and talk about, you know,

1122
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:52,900
farting and fist fucking coming
all day long a week segments.

1123
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,710
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1124
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,370
These guys don't talk about
the horrible things we do.

1125
01:12:57,371 --> 01:13:01,660
They must be not as desensitized.
Yeah. Is that what's going on?

1126
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,970
Uh, yeah. I mean this guy is probably
a really sweet guy and uh, yeah,

1127
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:07,804
he's probably,

1128
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:10,770
I think it has a lot to do with the
kindness of his heart is being nice. Yeah.

1129
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:15,800
I remember reading these jokes off a
popsicle sticks when I was a child and I

1130
01:13:15,801 --> 01:13:19,450
was, I still was like Wah, Wah. Like
I never thought they were funny.

1131
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,860
It's an intelligence factor. It
is. You think so? Of course. Yeah,

1132
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:26,500
of course it is. I don't
know. Um, or you know,

1133
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:31,280
intelligence as in the real
world experience. Yeah.
Miss Street savvy. You know,

1134
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,210
he's not super smart.

1135
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,670
He might be,
I mean

1136
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,390
this is for, what does the duck say to the
bartender? Oh my God. Put It on my right

1137
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,770
bill. Right. That's what I mean.

1138
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:45,120
Put It on my bill is

1139
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,940
am I bill? Okay, so you're
like, all right, good laugh.

1140
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:55,000
But then you really, I mean,

1141
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:59,190
come on.
He can't keep it together.

1142
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:05,963
I mean that's,

1143
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:10,970
I wish I were that easily
amused. Dumb. Broad. Yeah. Yeah,

1144
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,550
me too.

1145
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:15,400
Right. That'd be so much
easier. Watch sitcoms everyday.

1146
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,890
We can watch friends and think
it was the best show ever. Amen.

1147
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,530
You see what Ross did?

1148
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,630
It was so funny he did that
hand gesture and saying, okay,

1149
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,240
fund will Smith and the snow will Smith.

1150
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:32,980
That's you put first fresh prince.
He doesn't get it.

1151
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:36,100
He doesn't get it
right.

1152
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,090
He's not that much. Huh? Dude, this guy.

1153
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:48,160
Yeah, he's been hit with a ball in
the head with a bat. Maybe a couple of

1154
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,440
what of his story is like,
uh,

1155
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:58,490
this guy and when he was 15
was beaten relentlessly. Yeah.

1156
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,750
Is that brain damage?

1157
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,850
Somehow he was able to maintain
his ability to play baseball.

1158
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,360
I was in a coma. He's in now
we're shitting on him. Yeah.

1159
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:14,950
How do you know if you're in
front of a Polish firing squad?

1160
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:21,020
That's true. The guns
are faced. If the, uh,

1161
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,180
your Dad die,

1162
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:26,700
Dad, dad, do you not understand
how these folks work?

1163
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:31,940
You're not supposed to actually try
to answer them the best day ever.

1164
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:33,680
It was such a good day.
Yeah.

1165
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,350
And we got them again here when I had
them in studio guy. I loved those blinds.

1166
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,400
It was so weird to me that they
lacked the hard, it's weird to me too,

1167
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:45,450
that she laughed. She laughed that
hard. Well, I think your mom, I mean,

1168
01:15:45,451 --> 01:15:48,630
you have to forgive her because she's
working on a second language thing and

1169
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:52,620
yeah, that's really a
cultural humor. Yeah.

1170
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,020
But I guess this is like
when certain people,

1171
01:15:55,021 --> 01:15:58,520
like certain comedians that you're
like, that is so not on my radar. Yeah.

1172
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,320
Finding and you're like, why do you,
why are people laughing? I don't,

1173
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,820
I don't get it. Jane, you remember
this should be a roll call last week.

1174
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:10,950
I was trying to forget that. My
name is Cindy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,170
I like donuts. Yeah. Sweet. Yeah. Neat.

1176
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,380
Yeah,

1177
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:21,390
so shove my hand in my ass in about it.

1178
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:27,260
I was hired two years ago at a large
biotechnology seed corn company and we had

1179
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,270
a toned down version of the boy,

1180
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,660
a cult chant before taking the job.

1181
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,320
I spent seven months in Afghanistan
getting shot at sometimes shooting back,

1182
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,030
sleeping and jacking off when again,

1183
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:47,500
when it came to my turn in the
Sheboygan ceremonial ceremonial circle,

1184
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:52,380
I was zoning out and I froze and yell,
Hey,

1185
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,800
my name is Andrew. Clap,
clap, and I killed a man.

1186
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:02,020
It gets super quiet and they canceled
the rest of the Ori till lunch.

1187
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:08,220
I do appreciate not having to attend
these dog shit, retard festivals anymore.

1188
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:13,190
I to talk to HR a couple of times
after that. I appreciate it, dude.

1189
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:16,280
I ain't tight. Thanks Mommy. Andrew,

1190
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:21,630
do you realize that that dude's Improv
in that moment ended their entire

1191
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:26,620
orientation that's effective?
And do you realize that? I mean,

1192
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:29,810
cause that's an unconscious thing that
should be [inaudible] experience was so

1193
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:33,440
traumatic that it unconsciously
led him to think of his war days.

1194
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:36,170
Do you know what I mean? When he's like,
there's nothing worse than this. Oh wait,

1195
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:40,160
Afghanistan. And also the fact that
it's, um, chant like, you know,

1196
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:43,010
so you go to the same beat rhythm,

1197
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,240
so your brain goes into that kind
of stream of consciousness. Yeah.

1198
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:52,050
And then he was like, what can I say
about myself? I killed a guy anyway.

1199
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,530
Yeah. They're like, from my
group stops. And then hands drew,

1200
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:00,710
are you guys gonna clap again? And they're
like, oh, because you realize that some,

1201
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:04,400
someone there could have,
could have thought also that,
uh, that was a confession.

1202
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,840
Like he killed a civilian. Oh,
right. Like I killed my roommate.

1203
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:13,620
What? Thank God. His body. Yeah.

1204
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:20,000
Oh, oh. Oh Lord. Yeah. Wow.

1205
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:23,600
I'm sure Afghanistan was better than this
fucking shit. Thanks for your service,

1206
01:18:23,601 --> 01:18:26,690
Andrew. And thanks for writing in.
That is an amazing story. Actually.

1207
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:33,020
This Dad Boehner thing came in that,
um, I actually find it to be more,

1208
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:35,150
it's one of these interesting, you
know, sometimes you're like, yeah,

1209
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:38,120
that's pretty cool. It's, I don't
know if you've seen this yet or not,

1210
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,680
but this is a dad boner.

1211
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:44,210
Wait a minute. This isn't the
right place to skip a rock, dude.

1212
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:48,080
He'll never go in and look at that.
Perfect skipping rocks.

1213
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,113
Wow.

1214
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,590
Oh, that's cool. Shit. Yeah.

1215
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,010
So he went to skip the rock and I guess
there's a bunch of ice on this lake.

1216
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:12,990
Yeah. And then it, the pitch
turned into that. That's crazy.

1217
01:19:12,991 --> 01:19:16,350
I didn't, you know, as possible. Neither
did I. It's really cool. Skipping rocks.

1218
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,630
No,
this is awesome.

1219
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,780
But I understand it.

1220
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:26,640
Wow.

1221
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:35,280
But again, is exciting. I'd feel the
same way. Unwarranted. Beautiful.

1222
01:19:35,281 --> 01:19:37,650
Wherever they are. Yeah.
It looks nice. Yeah.

1223
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:42,770
Yes. You're doing right. Bombs away.

1224
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,113
Big One.

1225
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:55,110
His face is priceless.
I love this.

1226
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,510
This is awesome.
We're getting away to a story out of this.

1227
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,160
I think it's really great actually.
Yeah. That's fun. Yeah. Make Fun of that.

1228
01:20:02,161 --> 01:20:04,770
Boner on that one. No, that
must be a perfect thing.

1229
01:20:04,771 --> 01:20:07,710
Like the acoustics of the
mountains and the ice.

1230
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:12,900
It's special. It's pretty cool, man.
Yeah. I liked his face. Yeah. Little Kid.

1231
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:15,300
Open face. Oh, he was so happy.

1232
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:20,970
Oh. Oh. Oh. 50 Times.

1233
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,480
50 Times. Oh, so excited.

1234
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:27,450
Sometimes there's just
exciting things that happened.

1235
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:29,770
All right,
here we go.

1236
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,660
This one's crazy.
Three years.

1237
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:43,040
See, this doesn't add up. This
doesn't make sense. A mental illness.

1238
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,790
Here we go.
Here we go.

1239
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:11,840
I mean, that's for driving on a
bridge. A little shrouds Canada.

1240
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,980
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

1241
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,820
Ow. Oh, ow.

1242
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:23,670
Yeah.

1243
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:27,480
Oh,
this road towels.

1244
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,560
Oh,
okay.

1245
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:39,130
That's so crazy. That's one of my
favorite things we've ever discovered. Oh.

1246
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:43,230
Oh. Oh. I wonder. I wish I could
know the story. That's one of those.

1247
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:47,500
Thanks. Yeah. I wish I could
know why. Why the excitement?

1248
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:50,890
I just don't get it. It
is mental illness, right?

1249
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,360
It feels like it. Yeah. It's
gotta be craziness. Yeah.

1250
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:00,220
It feels like we're trying to
find this, uh, is this the, um,

1251
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,690
pronouns song I was trying to send them.

1252
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,760
Hey. Hi. How are you? What's
your name? What's Your Pronoun?

1253
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,070
That's a definitely.
Hey,

1254
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,340
hey. Hi. How are you? What's your
name? What's Your Pronoun? How are you?

1255
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,390
Yeah, but since I heard Jen talking
shit about me at the bar last night,

1256
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,880
the one I thought it was here.
Yeah,

1257
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,050
there's so many options.

1258
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:50,820
Then the Thursday through them
in the time jet in there, but

1259
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:59,300
hey. Hi. How are you? What's your
name? What's Your Pronoun? Them.

1260
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:02,170
They just wanted to confirm what's,
what's your pronoun? What's,

1261
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:06,820
what's your Pronoun Ze Zer.

1262
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:07,803
What's your product

1263
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:24,330
man?
Fuck right now.

1264
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,113
Ah.

1265
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:35,180
Oh
Wow.

1266
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,701
This reminds me of,

1267
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:41,701
that's Bj boy butter by a San Francisco
in the 90s this is exactly what we saw.

1268
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:44,920
Some wild shit. You told
me once that you saw. Yes,

1269
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:47,840
there guys fucking in the streets.
Just real crazy,

1270
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,910
but fucking each other all the time.
Any two people fucking in the streets.

1271
01:23:51,911 --> 01:23:52,744
It's crazy,

1272
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:57,930
but back then I feel like SF was way
gay or and and wackier and more fun.

1273
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,180
Yeah. Now it's, yeah, upstairs
like us to Douche bags,

1274
01:24:01,181 --> 01:24:02,530
going to whole foods with their kids.

1275
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,020
It's a little different now that
I don't love San Francisco guys.

1276
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:05,741
I'm not saying that,

1277
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:09,100
but it's just culturally very
different since the dot commerce came.

1278
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,100
There's people like us now.
It's not the Weirdo.

1279
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:17,050
They used to be a real beacon for weird
beards. It was really fucking far out.

1280
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:20,650
It was really fun. Oh, I had the
bed. We had the best time. I mean,

1281
01:24:20,651 --> 01:24:24,780
we just get on those Muni buses,
get high smoke, drink beer,

1282
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:27,610
walk around Haight street.
See fucking weird shit.

1283
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,990
You steers to be a guy that dressed up
like Sherlock Holmes under the freeway

1284
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:34,120
and people would just be like,
what's up Sherlock?

1285
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,430
Like he would just yell hi
Sherlock. And he was, you know,

1286
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:40,720
there was a guy in a pink units hard on
a fucking unicycle that was on Haight

1287
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:45,250
street all the time. Just the pink guy. I
used to see him all the time. Woo Hoo, go,

1288
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:49,790
whew. I mean just, and they're
always there. Just straight, weird,

1289
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:53,860
weird, all kinds of weird shit. Now it's,

1290
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:56,740
I don't know whether the Weirdos
Weirdos are in Portland now, I think.

1291
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:58,600
I think Portland's the New San Francisco.

1292
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,850
See there's a lot of Weirdos in Portland.
Yeah,

1293
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,270
they all kind of went for and there's
a pride about it, which is interesting,

1294
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:08,080
which is awesome. Yeah.
Fucking where they're at.

1295
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,320
I just pulled up this page thinking,
you know,

1296
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:15,340
there's 400 episodes in
neuro and we found this.

1297
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,023
Oh Mom.

1298
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:18,900
Yeah,
that was great.

1299
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:23,640
That's from like a special edition
episode of cops where they did a,

1300
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:28,140
I mean obviously the air on a regular
episode that they put it on like a best of

1301
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:32,560
type of cops tape and it was a
random youtube fine going away.

1302
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:35,190
It's gone. Shut up. Yeah,
it's not there anymore.

1303
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:38,280
I mean we were randomly watching
it and then we were like, wait,

1304
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:42,480
what did that guy just said it doesn't
he sound like say my mom's house and

1305
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:45,010
we're, you know, it's like the
early days of your mom's house.

1306
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,840
Like how perfect is it that it's like a
weird thing cause we like playing weird

1307
01:25:48,841 --> 01:25:50,940
segment audio and this guy's like,

1308
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,263
oh mom,

1309
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:53,823
my mom's house.

1310
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And then our first sponsor of this show
with stamps.com and then this guy says,

1311
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:07,130
so then we would be like, this episode
is brought to you by [inaudible]

1312
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,750
dot com and then if we win,

1315
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,760
I'm Bob,
I'm a Martian

1316
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,740
as the websites ww,

1317
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,633
the best.

1318
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:36,720
It's not in, this is the cops with
him because when they're like,

1319
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,840
how are you doing today, sir? Uh,
what, what you doing out here?

1320
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,833
Um,
mom,

1321
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:45,570
sorry. Okay, go ahead and give me that
license in a registration for you.

1322
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,110
And then he goes, uh, you
have, uh, you have, uh,

1323
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,680
anything to drink today
while you're sitting down.

1324
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:53,520
You're gonna have anything to drink.

1325
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,410
I'm Bob [inaudible], I'm a Marshall. I'd

1326
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,850
go ahead and do me a favor. Turn off
that car. Just step out for a second.

1327
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,530
Like that's the guy stays like,

1328
01:27:02,531 --> 01:27:06,440
so like treats him like he's actually
speaking English back to like a toddler.

1329
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,230
Me a favor.
Go ahead and turn that off.

1330
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:12,910
And the step out for me and they're look
like that this guy is definitely coming

1331
01:27:12,911 --> 01:27:15,970
with, that's gotta be the
hardest part of law enforcement,

1332
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:22,330
which is the majority of law
enforcement. You're just like, sir, sir,

1333
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:24,670
could you step out of the car?
Just be normal.

1334
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:30,000
Like the guy actually said
something. Sure. So battling,

1335
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,770
you have the registration,
the registration on you right now?

1336
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:39,500
Yeah, it's lent. Um,
anyways, it's been crazy.

1337
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:44,050
I tell people this at live shows,
I say it all the time when they go,

1338
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,930
you know, I listen to the podcast,
I love it. And that's, you know,

1339
01:27:46,931 --> 01:27:47,764
that's why they come out.

1340
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:52,830
This is the most fun thing we do is
do this podcast because it's really,

1341
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:56,590
it really is all the stupid shit that
you and I have enjoyed over the years.

1342
01:27:56,591 --> 01:28:00,760
And it's all about silly and it's great
because we come in here and we see all

1343
01:28:00,761 --> 01:28:04,660
the world, everything is sealed off and
it's just talking about stuff we really,

1344
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:08,370
truly care about new way.
Genuinely. I want to say, uh,

1345
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:10,660
we do appreciate everybody
that listens to the show,

1346
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:14,610
downloads the show and
tells us that they enjoy it.

1347
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:19,330
The help site all the time. It sounds
like really goofy to say almost, right?

1348
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,880
But people are like, oh, it
helps me get through my work day,

1349
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:25,330
or it helps us a good distraction
from whatever mundane thing I'm doing.

1350
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:29,950
You know, I never, we never
expected anybody would say
that. And I think it's, uh,

1351
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:32,290
it's very cool that
people enjoy it like that.

1352
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:38,820
It overwhelms me at times when we do
the show live or I go do standup and all

1353
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:43,570
the mommies show up and you're just like,
this is crazy crazy.

1354
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:48,010
This started just out of us talking
about farts and shit like that that we

1355
01:28:48,011 --> 01:28:52,300
normally would talk about and to think
that it's really touched the lives of so

1356
01:28:52,301 --> 01:28:56,100
many people. So silly. The
House that far it's built.

1357
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:02,100
So anyways, we're gonna, you know, there's
no, there's no sign of us down with this.

1358
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,610
Um, we're going to be having, like
I said, we've had guests lately.

1359
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:09,390
We're bringing some, we have guests
lined up coming up, some episodes,

1360
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,430
we'll have them, some won't,
but there's, you know,

1361
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,800
it's one of the most fun things we do.
So there's no way we would slip,

1362
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:19,620
slow down or stop doing this
400 and hopefully 4,000 more.

1363
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,140
Um,
that's it man.

1364
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,540
Oh, um, I don't know.

1365
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:28,020
We were wanting to do a glossary
of terms from your mind.

1366
01:29:28,021 --> 01:29:32,280
Somebody start that already. I don't
know. But if I know the Facebook page,

1367
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:33,120
you guys do that,

1368
01:29:33,121 --> 01:29:38,121
can someone started glossary or maybe a
Wikipedia page of all the terms are some

1369
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:41,220
localized place that fans can go,
you know,

1370
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,620
there's gotta be someone who's
in charge of all of these things.

1371
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:48,560
There you go. And a, I know we said
it at the top, but obviously, uh,

1372
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:53,580
