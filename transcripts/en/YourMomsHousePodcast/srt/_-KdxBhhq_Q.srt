1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,290
Well, well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,413

glasses on. My Dad dies.

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,540
He just took it down dumb.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,280
It was great.
Why are you not sharing this?

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,050
I feel like everything's very tight
lipped about it. I'm not. It's normal.

7
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,430
What do you mean it's not normal? I went
out to take care of business. I'm fine.

8
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,270
I ran the big day for a while and
everything was fine. Was it a clean wipe?

9
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,960
What's their food? Remnants on the
paper. A little bit itchy or know?

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,870
Very nice. It's like a three. Yeah.

11
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,950
That's kind of lumpy,
right? No, it's good.

This dry little dry, right? I mean it's,

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,470
it's in the ideal window.
It's a little drier than it

14
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,290
could be. Not Bad. What I
fit into now, I'm fat in it,

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,310
but I fit into it.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,620
I saw someone wearing this and Mahalia
and that was very jarring to see my

17
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,240
husband's face on someone's.

yeah.

116
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:56,780
And if you sleep on a mattress that's
still dropped off on your front doorstep,

117
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,740
you're dirty and disgusting.

128
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,160
I don't want to announce who it is because

I'm from Nico from the face of the method.

134
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,450
Kayla on Facebook told me
that when she gets stressed,

135
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,040
she grind her teeth at night.
Oh, Kayla, you are not alone.

136
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,180
I do that too. And I know it's
not good for my teeth either.

137
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,470
Well,

138
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,360
in this field I will show you a very
simple face exercise you can do whenever

139
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:30,190
you feel stressed. You can do this
in a shower or in the curse of that.

140
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:33,970
Nobody sees you and hears you.
This is how you do it.

141
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,310
You're very exaggerated.
Minor, open your mouth and say,

142
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,600

breeze out completely.

times. Sure. Ready? Right. No.

144
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,860
Wow. Wow. Wow,

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,150

Okay.

That's really cool, man. Is there a
big cock and balls on? Yeah, that's it.

153
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,800
Really mature. Really,
really mature. Wow. Oh Wow.

Wow. That's her. I don't
like it. Wow. Right.

159
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,370
Wow.

160
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,730
Do you feel like,
wow,

161
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,230
she's got a very natural delivery
on her youtube video too.

162
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,473
Wow.

163
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,690
Look at the size of that mouth open now
you can put the whole dog in the bathtub.

164
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,310
Right?
Are you feeling,

165
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,880
what is that from what Frat boy
committee came up with that,

166
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,590
but when you tell it about the, you could
write, yeah, cock and balls, like all,

167
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,460
all of it. No, I understood
what the dog in the back,

168
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:59,630
but I'm saying thank you
for explaining it to you.

169
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,510
Do you think you could get both
balls in? Yeah. And the cock.

170
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,040
She, she does have a big,
uh, big mouth. Wow. Wow.

171
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,880
How are you doing this?
Oh, it's just on. Oh Man.

172
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm starting to get a little
turned on right now. Ah, yeah.

173
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Ah Jeez. Ah, and then, and then as I,

174
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,240
and then I finished and she goes,

175
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,320
uh,
yeah.

176
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,910
I was just thinking about,

177
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,620
I was playing a song earlier when
you were like slick. You're like,

178
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,380
I'm just looking forward to going like
an eharmony and maybe meeting somebody

179
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:50,940
that like I really
click with and you know,

180
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,940
we can listen to music
together and just have fun.

181
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,400
You mean I got a 15 year old girl.

182
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,970
Why would she be 15 who listens
to that ridiculous music

183
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,270
listening to it. It was really bad. It was
so damn. What are you guys going to do?

184
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:10,040
You and your 15 year old guys can watch
the voice together and we could call it

185
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,220
and vote at the same time. I'd be
like, who we vote for this week?

186
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,030
And we could be like, I could be like the
song. And she's like, yeah, I'm a tall,

187
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,710
my friends,
you're like the best DJ ever.

188
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,110
Panty Jenga party. And she's like,
yeah, we're all coming. It's like slide.

189
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,580
That must be what it's like to really
date like a 20 year old when you're 50 or

190
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:34,210
60 year old. Oh, right. The person.

191
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,070
That must be what it's like right now.
Like I got,

192
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,390
let's go to, what does that festival
calm? I've heard the big scandal,

193
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:44,990
apparently.

194
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,580
Rumor scandal is that this chick that uh,

195
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,533
Johnny Depp

196
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,050
is a big black mailer. Like this is, yeah,

197
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,730
all a conspiracy.
You know,

198
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,650
that she's faking that he's beating her
and all this stuff. I believe, I mean,

199
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:08,651
Doug Stan hub came out and he's a
comedian and we all trust comedians saying

200
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:11,250
that that's not true. And I mean, what do,

201
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,070
have you ever known Johnny Depp
to be a violent guy? Well, he's,

202
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,470
I mean there's all the time that we hung
out. He was always real chill. So yeah.

203
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,460
Well, he's so down to earth. No, I
love Johnny Depp. Can I tell you?

204
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,020
I don't think he beats her.
I don't buy that. It's a
sound. It's not an initiative.

205
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:29,270
It's suspect, right?
It's really like, well,

206
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:32,660
I mean he's had so many other women in
his life. Nobody's ever come forward.

207
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,780
It would have come out by now if he
were a violent guy and it was also

208
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:40,100
interesting that they went to court. The
the, the, the wife amber herd is her name.

209
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,820
She went to court and ask
the court for like, you know,

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,630
all these things immediately. So she got
her restraining order because the grant,

211
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:52,310
those, if you request them then she
requested spousal support denied. She

212
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,670
requested a right. Yeah. This
is an immediate, you know,

213
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,470
it doesn't mean that you're not
going to get it in the divorce.

214
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,950
She had requested, he paid
for her legal fees, denied.

215
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,510
She requested of their vehicle,
denied the court,

216
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:08,360
rejected all those
requests and interesting.

217
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,260
But she is must be a real evil
person to do something with it.

218
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,940
Great. You can look at those eyes. I see
those pictures. She cry. She loquacious.

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,080
Beautiful. But it's just crazy.
It's really, um, but I do,

220
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,980
I love Johnny.
I've always had a crush on Johnny Depp.

221
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,690
I below the two of us are 21 jump street.

222
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,600
I had a life size poster of him
and my room growing up. Yeah.

223
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,020
But he is insufferable when you listen
to him on like the actor studio and he's

224
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,990
like rolling his own black cigarettes,

225
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,460
you know the craft like talking to
craft and all that horse shit. All are,

226
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,880
they all are there for all of the craft,
the craft,

227
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,140
any of them he gave that he gave a speech,

228
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,710
a pretending to be somebody else
for a living. It's such a challenge.

229
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,930
All that stuff is nauseated. He
did a, he got an award recently,

230
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,110
I guess right before this all went down.
Yeah.

231
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,420
Where when he got the award he thanked,
you know,

232
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,730
he's thanking people and he goes,
I want to take my wife, amber,

233
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,390
amber for forgetting her name too,

234
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,940
for dealing with all these
characters I bring home. Uh,

235
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,090
I know it's gotta be difficult on her.
It's hard on me.

236
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,820
So all these people that I'm

237
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,913
inhabiting,

238
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,060
that's why actors are not comics.

239
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:28,600
Cause if you know you can't do
it. No, that mean, how do you,

240
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,670
how do I live with Tom [inaudible] Guerra,

241
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,620
a talented comedian I with all these
are the jokes and amazing things in your

242
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,660
head. I know it's hard
on you. It's got, I mean,

243
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:41,770
it's really hard on me being
so funny and so talented.

244
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,950
And the thing is I liked that there's
no pressure to be on what I'm owed.

245
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,790
I mean, everybody's like Tom, Tom,
make me laugh, make me the lash. Yeah.

246
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,860
And I love giving to those people.
I'm like making people laugh.

247
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,260
It's my greatest joy, spreading
joy. It fills me with a story,

248
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,800
but tell it should show up please.
Tom, please have black Dick joke.

249
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,590
Do you have it still?
Can I hear it? You do.

250
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,730
Imagine if comedians talking about our
process, the way actors talk about layers.

251
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,410
Oh my God. Well I wake up around 1:00
PM I had just come on my stomach.

252
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,500
I thought that's kind of
drawing in a funny way.

253
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,150
I should talk about that tonight.

254
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,720
I wiped and I wiped and I
thought there's a new bit, right?

255
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,870
Yeah.
I mean it's too much.

256
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,580
Yeah, they're so serious.
So serious. But the,

257
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,760
but I guess it needed serious and not
so serious as to live together for,

258
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,690
for the not serious people to thrive.
Really.

259
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,080
It has to be against
all the serious people.

260
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,430
Because if we didn't have the
Johnny Depp's to make fun of you,

261
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,980
it's like I've asked Steven, see gals,
oh my God. I came to realization about,

262
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,040
you know, I can't stand the offended
people. Yeah, but you still need them.

263
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,680
They'll always be there.
Otherwise I wouldn't have a career.

264
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,150
You need someone to go like, Whoa, I can't
believe you said that. That's, thank you.

265
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,920
Yeah, that's true. I was, thank God
there's not an inside the comedian studio.

266
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,330
That would be so funny. Is
there other, I guess mark. Yeah,

267
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,290
I saw him.
He was really fun at the store.

268
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:26,880
He does the seven 30 show usually
with me or sometimes. Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,310
Well that, that is inside the community
is city, but that's all we talk about.

270
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,220
It's like depression or shitty families.

271
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,360
Our process
process.

272
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,330
So this was so fun. I got to get
in. Well, I'll show you this first.

273
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,890
Can we just announced that we're back
on video because blue van, oh my God.

274
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,880
You know what this fucking guy did
last week? So let me pull this up.

275
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,760
He got sick,
he went and got sick.

276
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,310
He went and got sick like a
fucking dumb bird. And uh,

277
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,210
so let me pull up our channel here.

278
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,100
It's been getting bigger and bigger.

279
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,080
Thank you for everybody that's
been prescribing to it. And um,

280
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,240
you know, watching. Yeah. So
last week's episode goes up,

281
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,620
it's episode three 45, I think, right?

282
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,220
We've never ever had this
many thumbs down on a video.

283
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:30,390
And it's because there's no video.
It's just a video of the audio, right?

284
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,070
She's so late, man. Let me,
there are 54 thumbs down.

285
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:37,770
So it never happened before
to one of our episodes.

286
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,180
So blue ban uploads this episode,
right? I send them the file, he flies.

287
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,420
It was nasty. Downloads
it. Here it is here.

288
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,910
And he says,
due to genes being low and loose,

289
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,220
there will be no video component. So like,
of course impulse. That's funny. Yeah.

290
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,500
Well except it's also very misleading.

291
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,740
So I made sure to write here a little
misleading that no video was attributed to

292
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:08,160
low and loose jeans when in fact
it's because blue band got sick,

293
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,030
his nest got infected by some
cardinals and he was doing better,

294
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,870
but he wrote this on this vid,
jeans are loose and not true.

295
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,330
Bird is sick. Oh, okay.

296
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,630
Because it's a very big distinction
distinction. That's true.

297
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,960
So I just wanted to make that clear.
One could argue blue bands,

298
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:28,830
logic being that he got sick and
therefore his jeans became low and Louis,

299
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,750
he should have,
they should have put that in the text.

300
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,360
You don't want to mislead the listeners,
the viewers.

301
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,300
People could just think like,
we don't feel like it.

302
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,480
Our jeans are loose this week.
I want him to be like,

303
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:44,200
I got bird aids, fucking bird
and you know, fucking bird
flu brain's not that bad.

304
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,380
There you go. You feel better now. Okay,

305
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,050
we're back.
We're packing video.

306
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,130
A bird is fat and that has been,
I wasn't going to,

307
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,980
I just wanted to address it before
we forgot because we get it wrong.

308
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,290
You need to forget. First of all,
a big shout out to the people who,

309
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,360
who I think understood the distinction
of just tweeting that to him without

310
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,120
tagging us. Cause that way it's
like, why am I getting these?

311
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,920
Which I thought was great. Now some people
ended up tagging us too, which is fine,

312
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,010
but I really wanted to give a shout out
to not tagging us because that is the

313
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:26,650
idea of him waking up.
Why am I getting this right?

314
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,430
Once you see I as tagged in it, then
he goes like, oh it's from them. Yeah,

315
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,720
the mysteries. It's better. Yeah man,

316
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,470
it went so it was crazier than I
could've ever imagined thing ever.

317
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,890
And then Instagram is
Instagram and here too. Oh,

318
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,290
oh my God. The Instagram is
what I didn't even realize.

319
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,370
So my Instagram,

320
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,750
God, thank you. It was called sex with me.

321
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:09,400
It was amazing. So we
told you last week, right?

322
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,120
Cause I think what happened was I read
a tweet from him where he called me fat.

323
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,950
So I go right.
It was something like,

324
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,530
well we've been doing this kind of for a
long time. I mean, we're years of, well,

325
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,560
I spent a year or so of who's fatter
you are. Yeah. It's always, you know,

326
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,290
it's always the third. It's always bird,
but it's always a thing and it's fun.

327
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,760
So I just last week we go send him
a tweet and say, why are you so fat?

328
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,990
And then, and then it became a
Hashtag. Bert is fat at the end. Dude.

329
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,340
Not only did you guys sent him
maybe over a thousand tweets,

330
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,080
but I got it. Okay. Some of
these are just incredible. So

331
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,640
that's really good for it. So
fat, right Burt and I liked that.

332
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,520
That looks delicious.
You started just every tweet,

333
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:01,070
no matter what it has to do with
anything had been tagging it. Uh,

334
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,900
Burdis fat bird is fast
tag. Bert is fat, right?

335
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,180
So you go all tweets or
Burrito a full charge.

336
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:09,970
And I are fucking up at the comedy store
in La Jolla this weekend. You know,

337
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,670
bird is fat. It's just, I think we should
just all hashtag everything Burdis it,

338
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,650
no matter what. No matter what.
Then, uh, people were doing.

339
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,940
Lot of shops from my
photo shops are amazing.

340
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:26,290
Who Does Vegas?
Vegas seven Oh two crushes.

341
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,910
She crushes the Photoshop stuff.

342
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,900
Here's another one on hers.
I think that's Joe.

343
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,860
Joe.
Joey's body

344
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,320
especially facile,
that stupid grin on his face.

345
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,610
He has the best expressions for fat guy
stuff because his regular expressions

346
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,140
always like, oh so you put that on like
an enormous body. It's really amazing.

347
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,740
Um, well then he wrote, he tweeted,

348
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,600
cause he got after hundreds of them,

349
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:03,440
he goes just when you think
the joke is getting old and he,

350
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,700
it was he tagged,

351
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:09,560
he quoted as somebody who wrote braking
and it shows these scientists looking at

352
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,880
something under a microscope.

353
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,790
The nation's leading scientists are
working around the clock to determine why

354
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:14,720
bird is so fat.

355
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,340
Then you put this up, I had so much fun
the night more about nonbinary friends.

356
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:26,450
Tomorrow night bird is fat and I
also got them all saying a video,

357
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:29,660
why is you're fat?
And I got people at La Jolla,

358
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,160
somebody put the civil war
stand up team time team bird.

359
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,320
Which side are you on? Oh,
that's, and they burnt by the way,

360
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:41,810
I'm the number one fat
shaming person today.

361
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,490
Oh my God. He put, I know
exactly how Amy Schumer feels.

362
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:50,560
I guess cause she had gotten, I
dunno, some hatred or something.

363
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,190
I think she had a picture of her
in a bikini and um, some tablet,

364
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:58,490
but she looked great. She's not fucking,
this is like, no, she looks great.

365
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,910
This is how, uh, let's be,

366
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:05,960
let's be clear between Amy Schumer
and Bert. Bert is legitimately fad.

367
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,390
Oh, Bert parts. Enormous.
Yeah. Amy's not normal.

368
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,740
This is like if you just
looked up his name. Yeah.

369
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,380
He retweeted these. Burt, why are you so
fat? Just curious. Why are you so fast?

370
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,490
So like is it a steroid thing? Thyroid
thing. Why are you so fat? Hey,

371
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,500
Burt Chrysler,
why are you so fat?

372
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,750
Then two accounts
started of Burt Chrysler.

373
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,890
Um, this one says breakfast tip, 600
kids have less calories. Three pancakes.

374
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,700
You're trying to watch your weight. I
put syrup in the Heinekens for it as fat.

375
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,060
Six, I have less calories
in three van gigs. Oh Man,

376
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,320
bear Chrysler is the best too. Yeah, man.

377
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:02,321
So then I'm talking to him on the phone
Saturday and I look at something on,

378
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,160
on, uh, Instagram and I
go, I'll just, you know,

379
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,520
I pulled up his, here's the
comments Bra, all the fat,

380
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:17,840
man, why are you so fat? Why the fuck
are you so fucking fat? Low fat alert?

381
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,850
Why are you so fat? So you guys went
to his institute, Bert Chrysler,

382
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:27,710
why are you so fucking fat? You
are so fat. It's all fatty fat,

383
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:32,390
fat burn. Why you so fat? It's
hundreds of comments on every picture.

384
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,990
And then he goes, he
has to post, of course,

385
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:40,670
a shirtless picture of himself
just asking why so fat? Why so fat?

386
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,220
Huge Fan. But why are you
fat? Why are you so fat?

387
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,080
God, you're fat. It's endless.

388
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,260
And I gotta say my favorite thing I've
been a part of in years is this so much

389
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:57,060
fun. He said that, uh,
one of his daughters,

390
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,590
it was posted on one of
his things. He goes, sure,

391
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:01,290
are a lot of people calling you fat today.
Dot.

392
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,620
Oh my God. So anyways, thank you so
much for, I'm going to work guys.

393
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:14,660
Really outstanding. That really
was outstanding work. I mean,

394
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,391
that one's my favorite.

395
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:18,780
The breaking scientists or the
breaking science thing is great. Yeah.

396
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,060
And the photo shops or maze. Yeah. I
mean, Vegas, it's really, uh, you know,

397
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:28,920
we challenged you and I think you just
leaped over the challenge above and

398
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,430
beyond. It was really a crest dangerous.
Once we get the mommy's on something,

399
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,660
yeah. You Better Watch out. Watch yourself
get on the mommy's bad side. I know.

400
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,670
I mean, that's on the good side.
We'd love, but, but that's, you know,

401
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,690
so you remember a while ago
the, the Trump song, right?

402
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,360
It's China to meat, meat,
meat, meat, meat, meat, meat,

403
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,610
China, China, China,

404
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,880
China,
China,

405
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,270
China,
China.

406
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,470
So it's so good. It's
great. That's by a island.

407
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,890
And then I finally, this week
we got a Hillary song. Oh,

408
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:24,750
now we can go back and forth, check
out this Hillary song. It's by a place,

409
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,470
Boeing, um, really, really great work.

410
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,780
[inaudible] [inaudible]

411
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,920
[inaudible] not a laughing matter.

412
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,610
I take it really seriously

413
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,930
to
me because

414
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,100
on all these mothers

415
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,590
don't. For me because I'm
a or because I'm a woman,

416
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm a woman and all these brothers
Don for me because I'm a woman,

417
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:53,860
because I'm a woman, woman running
to be the first woman president.

418
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,810
Not Imagine anyone being
more of an outsider,

419
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,530
then the first woman can be more of
an outsider than a woman president.

420
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,190
I can't think of anything more of an
outsider than electing the first woman

421
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,690
president,
a woman president.

422
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,820
It's amazing. So good.
I love her laughing.

423
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,230
That's the clap is so horrible.

424
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:18,600
Really Tan. Wow. Good
job. That's placed Boeing.

425
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,410
Who did that one and
then the Trump has had,

426
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:27,860
I didn't realize has various
China, China, China, China,

427
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:33,790
China, China. Now did
you read about his hair?

428
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:37,150
You're telling me some article you
read on why it looks so horrible.

429
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,350
What's the story with him?
It's, it's basically the,

430
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,840
they come to the conclusion is
hair is completely not natural.

431
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:47,560
You know,

432
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,210
obviously people are fixated on it
looks terrible that it's a $60,000.

433
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:57,040
We've,
that he has an elaborate we've,

434
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,610
that he opted for this years ago when
there wasn't an option for him to do and

435
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:06,160
obviously really expensive
surgical one or nonsurgical.

436
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,170
And he opted for the nonsurgical,

437
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,730
which is that fucking dead
dog you see on his head today.

438
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,360
That's terrible. Yeah. So it's
uh, but it's uh, it's a long read.

439
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,360
It's a really funny read
about how elaborate his pro,

440
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,560
let me see if it, but why does he
have to style it like a Douche bag?

441
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,490
That's the weird thing is
the styling of it. Yeah.

442
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,120
It looks like cotton candy. It's
a Gawker piece actually. Um,

443
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,070
so Google that Gawker Trump hair,
Donald Trump hair Gawker and it's a yes.

444
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,640
It's really,
they go into incredible detail.

445
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,390
Oh my God,
it's so horrible.

446
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,130
There's just so there's, so,
there's so much of an investigation.

447
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,860
I mean it really,
really is elaborate cause it looks normal.

448
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:59,800
If this is one of the interesting
parts of the article was it said, um,

449
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,080
look at what happened last August,

450
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,610
part of a time interview when they
had a bald eagle name, Uncle Sam.

451
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,960
But in an act of performance,

452
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:10,720
it was truthfully a bit too
on the nose for my tastes,

453
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,800
the living symbol of American pride.
It's hack the angry orange candidate.

454
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,310
And as Uncle Sam's wings flap frantically
Trump's hair piece of migrated.

455
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:24,160
It was ever so slight in ever so brief,
but migrate.

456
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:27,370
It did end in one impossibly solid piece.

457
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,950
So it was hair removed all together.
They chunky, they made this little,

458
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,543
you can see.

459
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,523
Yeah,

460
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,560
it's not his hair. You know,
here's, here's the, Oh,

461
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,260
they had it all moves together here.
Yep.

462
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,903
Wow.

463
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,200
You can see it. So yeah,
it's so bizarre. Dude.

464
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:05,010
Look at this article
is all about the hair.

465
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,180
Why don't you think that one of
his wives will be like, baby you,

466
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,690
you got to divorce. You look
crazy. The guy that started the,

467
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,720
this particular hair restoration procedure
used to have an office guest where my

468
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:22,790
really helps in Trump tower in New York.
And he has since left there,

469
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,060
but they said that,
you know, that's where,

470
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,670
that's where Trump had this
done. Oh, it's, it is really,

471
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:35,840
really crazy. Micro extension. But he
has to know. It looks like shit. I mean,

472
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:38,090
of course she does, but we all
have our own levels of delusion.

473
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:41,420
You know my little face looks like
shit though. He's orange and he, yeah,

474
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,960
he looks so chapped and dry.
Like that guy in the Americans,

475
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,470
he just looks like a dry hot dog,
you know.

476
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,820
Would you like to like a dry Dick? A
dog deck. What'd you ever kiss him? No.

477
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,680
Like you just mouth smells. It's such
a dad mouth. Yeah. He has a drill.

478
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,990
Charlie.
Margaret.

479
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,760
Just
somebody from shiny shiny.

480
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,370
Am I supposed to dislike?

481
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,540
Let's say
China,

482
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,720
China. China can't be.

483
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,560
Whoa, Beth's got into it. She liked it.

484
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,460
What are you barking about? She hates
Donald Trump. She's not voting for him.

485
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,430
Which she's not going to vote.
What are you doing this?

486
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:50,420
You're just having a time talking to
the voices in her head. Um, anyways,

487
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,240
great music. Great
submissions. Both of them.

488
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,950
I can't wait for you to do some hair
restoration. Are you going to do that? No.

489
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,070
You're just going to let it go. No,
I'm definitely of the, you know,

490
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,340
everyone has the thought as the
hair starts to leave, you're like,

491
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:08,750
what should I do about this? But you
know, it was pretty, I tried for,

492
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:12,710
it was years ago. I tried it for
a month. A pill. Yeah. But um,

493
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,470
my doctor subscribed to me

494
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,610
and uh, for one month I
tried it and wow. Wow.

495
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,720
I did not like the way I felt.
No,

496
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,540
it made you not want to have sex and
it was still depressed also. Yeah,

497
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,590
because testosterone, high testosterone
can lead the hair loss. Right.

498
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,660
Anyways, it was, I didn't
like it. So that was it.

499
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:37,800
I tried that pill and then I was like,
I don't give a shit.

500
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,750
What about the Propecia?
You can rub on, I dunno.

501
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,190
Topical Ointment. I don't,
I'm not that interested. Well,

502
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,190
I would say that you might have a good
chance of keeping your hair because if

503
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,310
you haven't lost it by now, right.
I mean it's thin, it's thinner.

504
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,000
It's been this thin for the last 10 years.
I'm saying no,

505
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,890
it's the not more over the last 10 years
for sure. Oh yeah. It's definitely,

506
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,120
I mean it's on your mother's side is
your mom's dad. He had that widow's peak.

507
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,260
Go what I have and I don't know.

508
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,530
Well, we'll see. We're getting
that 23 and me thing done. Oh yeah.

509
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,950
We'll see what's going on.
I think it tells you all that stuff.

510
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,180
If you're going to go bald and die and
stuff, it says you're going to go bald.

511
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,330
Die. Yeah. What you're going to die of.
Thanks for signing up for 23 and me.

512
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:28,440
You're going to go bald and
die. Probably. Well, okay.

513
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,530
I'm excited for that.
Very exciting.

514
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,860
I'm a little upset. You told me
the news today. A lot of people,

515
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:40,480
this is memorial day as we're recording
this and some people have been

516
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:44,980
supportive of commemorating
the Cincinnati Fart. Yes, yes.

517
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,070
Now you came in the kitchen and you told
me that some people are doubting the

518
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,094
validity.

519
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,160
I, Cincinnati Fart. I can pull up.

520
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,930
I just caught this moments ago.
I mean, I was, I just happened to

521
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,700
I'm, and I'm so upset.
I'm so beside myself.

522
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:08,290
I can't even believe that people would
doubt the authenticity of my Cincinnati.

523
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,420
Well, somebody wrote today, let us
not only remember our fallen soldiers,

524
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:16,610
but let us also remember the
Cincinnati Fart. And, um, they,

525
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,720
they did a salute. All give a round
of applause. This says a fart.

526
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,613
I saw that.

527
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,360
Then Gary Thorne wrote the
Cincinnati Fart is a myth.

528
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,370
There is no documented evidence that
ever existed. Wow. Okay. Pretty.

529
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,260
It's pretty bold, right? Well
then, well, let, let's, let's,

530
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,270
let's continue then. Somebody wrote,

531
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,890
let me guess. The Holocaust never
happened either. Get Real, bro.

532
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,850
Cincinnati fart matters.
Never said that.

533
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,170
Lots of evidence Holocaust happen. Unlike
Cincinnati Fart, which is all hearsay.

534
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,260
Uh, somebody said, well, I
heard if you go to Cincy,

535
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,240
close your eyes and smell deeply, you
could still catch a whiff. Urban legend.

536
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:06,570
He replied, yeah, we can debate this
forever. But none of the change,

537
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,320
none of this changes the fact
that Bert Kreischer is fat.

538
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,970
That's a good point. And then he other
guy wrote, you're right, Marcos wrote,

539
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,050
you're right. Why is burnt so
fat? So it ends, it makes sense.

540
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,610
Well,
allow me to address these please.

541
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,400
Firstly that Cincinnati fart happened.
And uh,

542
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:28,530
in July of last year I was pregnant.

543
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,760
We just gone on a cruise on of what
body of water is that in Cincinnati?

544
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,940
Uh, yeah, it's a forever. Whatever.
Raw water. Anyways, I ate, um,

545
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:44,350
the buffet, I had, uh, several
different things. I had mashed potatoes,

546
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:48,520
chicken, roasted vegetables,
everything. I, yeah.

547
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,100
And Look, the Cincinnati fart
happened. I couldn't prepare for it.

548
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:57,730
It's not as though we could get a camera
ready is just one of those things that

549
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:00,550
happen. Now. Tom was there to
witness it was there and I,

550
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,790
are you suggesting that my husband
Tom is a liar? I'm not a liar.

551
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,130
What did it sound like?
Let's relive it.

552
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,380
Oh,
it was like,

553
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,160
let's relive it.
It's when I got back,

554
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,390
I remember I stayed out later
than you and I was tired.

555
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:17,500
You retired back to the room. I took my
cousins to a restaurant cause right. Um,

556
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,310
yeah, we ate, we had drinks. Yeah.

557
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,940
Um, so we went out, I got back,

558
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,920
I gave you a hug and then
it happened tomorrow.

559
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,990
Oh,

560
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,780
uh Huh.

561
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,800
I mean my eyes almost fell out of my head.
Yeah. I'd never heard anything like it.

562
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,161
And the thing is,

563
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:50,420
I felt that fart building all evening
because I was laying down and I remember

564
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,450
being like, oh, there's a lot
of rumbles in this man guts.

565
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,900
You couldn't believe it either.
I remember. Yeah. That was never,

566
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,300
ever seen anything like it,
you know.

567
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,880
Are we calling the hotel
called the hotel room?

568
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:05,621
Good afternoon.

569
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,850
Thank you for discovering the
renaissance and Cincinnati downtown.

570
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,740
How may I direct your call?

571
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,030
Hi Ya. Um, do you get to,

572
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,980
can someone book a room to commemorate
this Cincinnati Fart that happened last

573
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,813
year?

574
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,340
We'll go around to commemorate what?
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

575
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,940
The Cincinnati Fart
last August.

576
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,750
Has anyone done that or would you like it?

577
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,010
Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean
there's a lot of people.

578
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,870
I have actually quite a few people
that want to, I think it's room three,

579
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,090
1313 is that right? I think so.
Three 31 I forget one of the two

580
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,040
at our hotel.
Yeah.

581
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,430
Yeah.

582
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,810
Or maybe it was eight 13.

583
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,520
Um,
can I put you on a brief hold?

584
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,380
Sure. Yeah. The Cincinnati
Fart. Thank you. Yes.

585
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,890
Okay. All right. So we actually don't
have a real number. Is there any one,

586
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,260
is there a way I can check in which
room I stayed in last time I was there.

587
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,060
Um, I, uh, do you

588
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,960
remember around what time your stay was?

589
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,210
Yes,
I can actually give you the exact dates.

590
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Okay. So we've never actually
had a fire in our hotel.

591
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,280
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no,
I, I didn't mean that.

592
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:27,140
So last August,

593
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,140
1920 21 and 22 I believe.

594
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:37,310
Yes. So last name would be Segura, s e, g,

595
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,720
U, R, a, Tom and, and well,
there was a few cigarettes,

596
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:46,430
so this would be the one with
Christina, c, h R. I. S. T. I, n.

597
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:47,264
A

598
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,490
on on one second. SD, J. U. R. A?

599
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,590
No, no, no. S. E. G. G.
Oh, I apologize. Yes.

600
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,480
And the first name is Christina.
Sure. It was undermining.

601
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,903
Okay.

602
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,100
And this was last year around August.

603
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,380
It's exactly, it was exactly August. Uh,

604
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,060
I think 19 2021 and 20
and 23 we left the 23rd

605
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,450
okay. So was there a different name
for saying that it could be under,

606
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:22,150
uh, yes. Thomas or Tom
and then Christina? Yeah,

607
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,640
we had the same room though.

608
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,520
Okay. So I do see a reservation
that we did have for you in room

609
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,840
18 and your arrival date was August 19th

610
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,990
six 15 1618 six 18 now there was two
Segura is there though with the same name?

611
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:45,830
I just want to make sure I'm not because
it's my dad also stayed there under the

612
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:48,380
name Tom Segura.
So do you see a second?

613
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,930
I do see a second one,
but it has a different date of arrival.

614
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:56,950
That one is August 21st Oh,

615
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,710
okay.
So we have to a cigarette.

616
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,280
No, you know what? I arrived, she
arrived the 21st so that would be,

617
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:08,510
so what's that? That might not be
the correct room. What's that number?

618
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,230
What's that room number? Eight zero
eight eight zero eight that's it.

619
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,490
That's it.
That's the one eight zero eight yeah.

620
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,330
Now can we do group packages for
people wanting to pill? Yeah,

621
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,330
cause I know people that want to
pay extra just to stay in this room.

622
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,820
What was so special about that room?

623
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,250
The Cincinnati Fart.

624
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,140
Yeah.

625
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,430
Could you spell that for me?
Yeah.

626
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,520
F A r t like passing gas.

627
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,580
Okay.

628
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,690
And it was like this elaborate huge deal.

629
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,670
But I know that people
want to like honor it.

630
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,053
I see.

631
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,100
Okay. So they can read, they can
just request the room number then

632
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,543
probably right?

633
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,890
Yes.
And then there was a,

634
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,070
I see something on the Internet.
It says Sidney much room 1618

635
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,580
1618.

636
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,940
So I'm not really sure.

637
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,360
I don't think that's it. Oh, she's
looking enough on the Internet. Yeah.

638
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,370
Since 94 she says 1618 is eight oh eight.

639
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,310
I remember it anyway because
I have the alternative.

640
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,680
There's an industrial band called eight
away state and I remember thinking that

641
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:30,130
it,
okay.

642
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,310
So, um, the two rooms. So Mr Seeger,

643
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:37,311
we had your in room 1618 on August 17th
and August 21st we had you treasure or

644
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:44,010
two reservations. It was a room share
for room eight zero eight okay. Okay.

645
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,750
One of the Bulls.
Figure it out from there.

646
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,130
Thank you so much for your very welcome.
Bye Bye. Sorry, it was a little confused.

647
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,650
Oh No, no, it's great. You're
wonderful. Thank you. All right.

648
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,580
You're very welcome sir.

649
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,190
Wait a minute.
So at 16 eight I don't know.

650
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,660
Here's why I'm saying that we have
to figure out when you arrived.

651
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,470
I rattled later because I got in and I
got out. Remember cause I was so pregnant.

652
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,740
Right. You don't want to stay
long. So I got in and I got out,

653
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,950
which leads me to believe that I'm the
later check it and the 21st and didn't

654
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:16,770
you move rooms?
You started in one room and then we

655
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,720
Matt or something like that.
Which hotels? That's what it was.

656
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,040
I'm thinking eight Oh eight okay.
Okay.

657
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,860
Hmm. Well I mean one other thing we
could do, by the way, what if you,

658
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:38,610
you guys all search online?

659
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,500
Cincinnati renaissance or
Renaissance Hotel. Cincinnati Fart.

660
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:48,300
Then whenever anybody starts typing in
the Renaissance Hotel in Cincinnati.

661
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,253
Okay.

662
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,110
It'll say Cincinnati Fart.

663
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,340
If like a few hundred of you do it,
it'll definitely Google. Well yeah,

664
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:04,840
they'll definitely like why does it say
this is that he fart when people look up

665
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:09,400
our hotel. So here's the
uh, the Cincinnati part.

666
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,850
Oh my gosh. Yeah. So right
now its renaissance hotel,

667
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,180
Cincinnati c and right now the things
say renaissance to toss him steady Ohio,

668
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,190
Cincinnati wedding,
Cincinnati parking.

669
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,020
We can make it say
Cincinnati fart right here.

670
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,600
Besides Hotel Cincinnati Fart.

671
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:31,770
Okay.

672
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,330
Now war room.
Are we going?

673
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,390
I does anyone know the precise location
of this isn't a far as the first result.

674
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,180
She must have looked that up.

675
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,440
[inaudible] 16.

676
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,403
Must've been the room.

677
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,950
That was the route we must have
talked about is we announced those,

678
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:53,840
this is back then. Okay. Oh
it's, that's why she goes 16,

679
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:58,660
18. Yeah, but she said six
18? No, she said 16. 16,

680
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,570
18. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So
then I guess it's 16, 18,

681
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:05,480
cause that's hot off the heels of
the actual events. Spell that for me.

682
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,240
That's, that's what she was
reading. She was reading.

683
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,850
Oh my God. How funny is that?
Yeah. Hilarious. Well good.

684
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:19,350
Now you guys know where to go. Yeah.
Renaissance Hotel. 1618 you know what?

685
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:21,720
Maybe just walked by eight oh
eight and see if anything's there.

686
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,160
Maybe you could still smell
it. Yeah, maybe you do. I
end up staying in that room.

687
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:31,060
Please send us a picture. Uh, I like to
see it, tweet it and be really funny.

688
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,260
And it happened in the doorway and if you
could actually in the doorway in form.

689
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,950
No, it was, it was inside the
room, Babe. Oh really? It wasn't,

690
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:41,350
I didn't know my thought. I went to
hug you and I'd come in the room.

691
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,000
And where was I standing?

692
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,030
We were standing like the bathrooms over
here near the closet were in the room.

693
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,410
And then I farted. Right. The
Renaissance Hotel rooms 1618.

694
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,990
So this girl just pulled this up.

695
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,970
She took it very seriously.
Yeah.

696
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,130
She googled Cincinnati
fire fire. Yeah. She just,

697
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,830
she just realized she was
talking to this fucking face.

698
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,740
So fun. It was amazing.
Yeah. That's so funny.

699
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,720
Do they have a banquet room there?
Oh yeah. They have everything there.

700
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,730
You know, maybe we should do like
some huge, that's what I was thinking.

701
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:27,850
Why don't we do the podcast from like
their banquet room one time and then all

702
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:32,380
walk up to the room. 1618 pilgrimage
to the room and let's see. Yeah,

703
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,750
maybe reenact it.
And maybe you the reenacted,

704
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,570
like civil war reenactment.
What

705
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,970
guys? It was a right here
guys. Everybody gather around.

706
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,250
The longest part of my life happened
and in this hotel and I were,

707
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,190
I'll never forget it.
I will never forget that fart.

708
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,960
That was a powerful long and it can only
happen with a gift of pregnancy. Yeah.

709
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:05,860
I think that was why it was so
special. You're definitely, uh, yeah.

710
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,613
Ooh.

711
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,500
My name is mark.

712
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,840
I'm 20 years old and I'm in a
relationship with 15 inflatable animal.

713
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,700
Okay. What do you think
you want to fuck this guy?

714
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,290
He's not that bad. He's better than
Trump. You'd fuck that guy over Trump?

715
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,280
Of course.

716
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,610
Well,
he's probably not gonna want.

717
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,880
Those are the punish and preachers I
have to hang out with in my life. I know.

718
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,280
I'll eat with him. Boy, you want my phone?

719
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:35,350
Because you're on watch TV together to
find a blender show. You like my base,

720
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:40,190
my blade doubles. That's
good. Short, snappy. If I do
take my levels out swimming,

721
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,340
what do you feel like though as it,
yeah, that's a good face. If, uh,

722
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,820
if you're a parent and this is like, I
was just thinking that if this was Ellis,

723
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,760
yeah, I'd beat the shit out
of him. Really old school.

724
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,670
I'd beat the inflatable shit out
of him. Snipe. Make them going.

725
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,400
What might make them go harder into it
though, right? I, there's some kind of,

726
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,130
what's wrong with this guy? You
know, there's a lot wrong with them,

727
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,830
but how does this happen? That's
what I want to know. How does this,

728
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,100
how can we make sure Ellis doesn't,
cause that didn't start overnight.

729
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,410
That's not like I'm just gonna
fucking play doubles from Nolan.

730
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:12,603
These white marks

731
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,300
and six years ago when he
purchased a whale for cool.

732
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,930
Since then, the 20 year old college
student has added 14 animals too,

733
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:27,860
was inflatable family and even
prefers that he's mentally ill though.

734
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,450
Severely. Right? Well, if you prefer them
over people, then it becomes a problem,

735
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:34,340
right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I think

736
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,250
c'mon inflatable pool toys I love is
that they're soft. They're cuddly.

737
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,720
The bigger they are, the better they
are. Kind of means there's more to love.

738
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,670
It's really nice to have somebody to
talk to him. You don't get eaten my soda.

739
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,513
Okay.

740
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,990
I mean you could also talk to a person
he's not going to get across. Right.

741
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,320
And you can't be separated
from them for more than a day.

742
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:58,443
Oh boy.

743
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,640
At school when I start missing them and
it's almost like if I'm going a little

744
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:07,020
bit crazy once I go home,
basically give him a hug.

745
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:10,720
Give him a kiss. Yeah. It's been
like family time together. Okay.

746
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,120
We can knock them over by you if we want.

747
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,230
Every one of my inflatables
has a different personality.
A little down there.

748
00:51:16,231 --> 00:51:17,064
They don't ya

749
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:21,090
the out for everybody. Yeah, and the food
he's wasting. What are you talking about?

750
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:21,924
They're going to eat it.

751
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,760
Okay.

752
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,920
There's probably just not hungry right
now. You've got to give him a minute.

753
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,800
Do you think when this airs
that school gets better or no?

754
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,280
What'd you guys do this weekend?
Well, we were watching TLC.

755
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,980
Plain bowls has a different personality.

756
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,580
They don't sound like
different types of music.

757
00:51:42,581 --> 00:51:45,940
Some don't like to just
be lazy and sleep all day.

758
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:47,270
Okay.

759
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:52,010
Different types of music like me and my
girlfriend. Me Harmony. What's her name?

760
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,410
Your 15 year old? Yeah, January
Courtney. Courtney Retina,

761
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,600
but Brett was covered a wise,
my boyfriend [inaudible].

762
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,570
You guys want to cover or not? I like to
just be lazy and sleep all day and yeah.

763
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,830
I won't say they get along together.

764
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,770
I would say they all like to sleep all
day from what I can see forever. Yeah.

765
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,980
God so troubling. Yeah. Now I look
at that. Every time I see a Weirdo.

766
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:20,930
Now I got a, what are the parents feel
like somebody's changed. Yeah, I know.

767
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,990
I go that that somebody
signed. Of course. Oh my God.

768
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:27,950
Somebody loved and nurtured and
took care of you. Is it any fucking,

769
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,430
you're a fucking retard.
Cool toys now, asshole. Yeah.

770
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,600
Now he's so dependent on gene is inflated.

771
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:37,500
This appointment can be separated
from them for more than a day damage.

772
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:42,500
But I'm at school. When I started
missing, we already covered that.

773
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,580
My mother really wasn't there for me
when I was a child. Mom's fallen mom,

774
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:48,690
mom,

775
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,040
double whale actually started feeling
all that love and compassion and I never

776
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:53,874
go,

777
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,630
I'm never leaving you Alice. What? She
would give him a hug right now. I know.

778
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,580
Can we pause this extra sun?
No. 11 no, I'd never do that.

779
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:07,510
That's what it is. Mom was never around
and play double animals were, you know,

780
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:10,900
he's lucky and fightable animals were
around and not some creepy guy. Neighbor,

781
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:14,050
Huh? Yeah. Kids like
him get preyed on. Yeah.

782
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,490
Hmm.

783
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,920
That is terrible. Well now I feel like I
should have for making fun of that guy.

784
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,970
He had a bad mom.

785
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,430
Yeah.

786
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:26,820
That's what happens. They can all fuck a
toy if you're not a good mom, like a toy.

787
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,640
Yup. Uh, by the way, we've been getting
a lot of people on Twitter as well, uh,

788
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,070
wondering when they're going to
have a double pipe. Classic one.

789
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,520
What happened for me? When
will it happen guys? You know,

790
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,230
when will I see a shooting star?
When will I win the Lotto? You know,

791
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,510
you gotta wait, you gotta be patient?
Yeah. Give it some time. Let life happen.

792
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,540
Live your life and it'll
just happen. Yeah. Like love.

793
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,410
Do you think I'll just stumble into
a foursome today, right? Um, no,

794
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,470
maybe, but probably not a forced some,
Huh? Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

795
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:05,190
That the equal of it.
It's the same. Yeah. Okay.

796
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,990
Are you thinking of another
couple? Pacifically a foursome
know three other like,

797
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,080
Oh, if you're a guy, like three chicks
are going to bang me today all together,

798
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,870
you know? Oh, you weren't thinking
like another married couple,

799
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,460
no kids swing or something. I think I
know what you're thinking about, but no,

800
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,100
it wasn't, I didn't even think it what
I'm trying to give people real world,

801
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:24,643
you know,

802
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,050
positions like, ways of thinking
of this. Yeah. Okay. Um,

803
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:33,420
I want to thank you for your, uh,
dismissive wave the other day.

804
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:37,410
We can have it. I did not
do that. You're exaggerate.

805
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:41,010
You're lying about how that
went. I'm always like, you are,

806
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,050
you're like amber heard and
I'm Johnny Depp. However,

807
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,330
I'm just trying to bring my
character's home. All those characters.

808
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,810
I was looking at you lovingly
out the kitchen window. Yeah. Uh,

809
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,870
the kitchen overlooks the backyard
and I am lovingly looking out and my

810
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:02,070
husband's playing with the two
dogs and the baby's asleep.

811
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:03,630
It was like the end of a perfect day.

812
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,000
And I look through and I did lightly
tap on the glass. I go, hey sweetie, hi.

813
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,890
And then you go,

814
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,173
wait,
what was that?

815
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,000
That's not how that
went. Oh, how did it go?

816
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,530
You stood in the window and you went like,
like that.

817
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:24,364
And I just went,

818
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,050
okay.

819
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:31,000
Like, hi, I see you. But, but did you
see the shittiness? It was like, yeah,

820
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:33,190
dummy. Hi, dumb con. Yeah,

821
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:39,880
I see you retard. Like I was a retarded
kid. Like I was licking the glass.

822
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,350
That's a slight exaggeration.

823
00:55:46,351 --> 00:55:49,980
Someone's goes to live school
day when they get back home.

824
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,433
Oh,
what happened?

825
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,720
Yeah, I like that. No. Yeah, no shit.
It was the same. It was like a no shit.

826
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,540
But for your hand you to get her
a push present. Yeah. No Shit.

827
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,310
Same weekend as the Cincinnati Fart.
Yeah,

828
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,830
no shit was the same week.
It's room 1618 yeah it is.

829
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:15,700
Oh no confusion now cause we must have
set it on the air when it happened.

830
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,690
Now that I'm remembering it was we
were up higher. It was 16th floor.

831
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,780
Where are we? Yeah. I'm trying
to remember the view and I just,

832
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:23,740
I know I see them in my head but I,

833
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,670
I know cause then Jane came over with
Eric and they open the window and he was

834
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:34,390
smoking out the window and I remember we
were high enough to do that whenever he

835
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:39,050
was smoking cigarettes out the window of
our room. Yeah. You don't remember that?

836
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,620
No, I don't remember that.
Maybe you weren't in there.

837
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,270
It was just pregnant me like hey,
thanks for putting that out the window.

838
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,640
Oh fuck man.
Yeah.

839
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,590
I remember when they came here and
smoke and we were like, no, we weren't.

840
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:55,400
So again, did they? I don't
remember. You weren't here.

841
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:59,050
You were either out or in bed already.
Yeah.

842
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,830
And they went on a walk and you
guys just go smoke. She goes, no,

843
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,880
I go, are you ha do you have a
breath mint? She's like, yeah, just,

844
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,170
just breath man after a walk. Yeah. Yeah.

845
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:15,990
Your sister also feels that liberty to
just rummage through our pantry too.

846
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:20,520
She studies, I have real sweat till thrive
now. And she was just rummaging. Yeah.

847
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,460
You got,

848
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,810
why do you got like
starts opening cabinets.

849
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:30,280
Refrigerator. But do you have
hair is you don't have shit. Huh?

850
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,050
Um,

851
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,960
I can't look at my fucking brother.

852
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,960
Yeah.
Okay.

853
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,410
Can families a little worst? Isn't
it just like whatever dude? No.

854
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,380
This morning we are talking
about a childhood stuff and uh,

855
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:55,890
you asked me, you're like, were your
parents super affectionate with you?

856
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:00,660
And I was like,
and I thought they were,

857
00:58:00,661 --> 00:58:01,494
apparently

858
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,610
I'm learning all this great
stuff about my childhood.

859
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,240
We were raised in basically a work camp.

860
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,530
See, my therapist says,
she's like, you grew up with
extreme deprivation. I'm like,

861
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,500
it wasn't that bad. Come on.
Like I, I even am like we were,

862
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:23,070
cause we smother our son with so much.
Yeah.

863
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,560
Physically to the point where
he's like, yeah, he's like,

864
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,910
cause I'm just all day hugging
them, kissing and hugging
or kissing, kiss, kiss,

865
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:32,220
kiss, kiss till he's like,
sometimes I'll kiss him,

866
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:36,660
he's happy and I'll keep kissing him
until he cried and he'll be like, stop it.

867
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:41,850
He does this. It's too much affection.
I can't stop. So I go, Huh? I go, yeah.

868
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:46,280
I was talking about my family,
super affectionate to Latin,

869
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,340
very effusive. And even my dad, my dad
hugs, kisses all the time and I go,

870
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:56,000
was it like this for you too? And
you basically were like, like your,

871
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,430
your brain basically stopped working
for a second and you're like, excuse me.

872
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,170
And I go,
yeah.

873
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:05,520
So like do your dad didn't
hug you and kiss you go,

874
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:10,140
well he would do things
like grab my shoulder and go
like, Hey, I love you. Okay.

875
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,430
Like what?

876
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:20,840
Yeah, my dad grabbed your shoulder and
squeezes it and he goes, I love you.

877
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:25,090
Okay, I love you. And then
he pats you. I swear to God.

878
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:29,180
And you wouldn't get all over yourself?
No.

879
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,250
If my parents said that to me, I'd
lose my mind. I know. Really? No.

880
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,020
Now my mother would hug me, but I
didn't like it cause I didn't like her.

881
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:41,690
I didn't like her. Everything, you know,

882
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,760
shoots every now and then
she would hug me. It was,

883
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:48,050
it was too hard and she smelled too
perfumy and her hair was always like a

884
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,790
helmet. So it was just like, ah. It was
like, I didn't like it. We'll see that.

885
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:55,790
I think about that. I understand
that your dad's thing must be,

886
00:59:55,791 --> 01:00:00,770
because he also just didn't come up
in it and affectionate household,

887
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,550
you know, people usually duplicate
what they're used to. You know,

888
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:07,130
and I don't know if you noticed
last time I think he was here,

889
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:11,330
he went to shake your hand. No, didn't I
went to shake his hand. He gave me a hug.

890
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,800
Okay, so he hugs, he hugs. Hello?
Yeah. Now, yeah, that's after it being,

891
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:20,330
you know, training him.
Yeah. But no, he never,

892
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:24,620
I don't remember him, you know, hugging
me as a kid. You hugged me that day twice.

893
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,760
And then when we went to his place,
he hugged me again. Yeah, so he's,

894
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,970
he's become more affectionate.

895
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,360
It's an older person but happens to
have some older people too, but not at,

896
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:36,980
not in my youth. No, not really. No,
it is. I love you. Okay. I love you,

897
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,430
but like good morning kiss
and stuff like that. No.

898
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:47,180
What really? I Good Morning
Kiss. Yeah. No. Oh God.

899
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,600
You got home from school. Hey, good big
kiss. You're hilarious. First of all,

900
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:53,300
my parents were nowhere to be
found when I got home from school,

901
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,740
but like when they go home and relax,
kiss you, you're out of your mind. Really?

902
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:59,523
No,

903
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,320
no. My mother would come home and
I would hear her and I would hide,

904
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,750
but he doesn't sound that crazy to you.
If you think of it in this terms,

905
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:10,670
imagine a Ellis getting home. Oh, I will.
I'm going to go nuts. I mean, I go nuts.

906
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:13,940
Just I haven't seen him in like a day and
I'm going, no, no. It wasn't like that.

907
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:18,480
My Dad or my mom would come home and
they would say high or low or whatever.

908
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:22,700
Treating you. They screaming in
the hall law and then you go, hey,

909
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:27,740
and that was it. But I don't recall ever
being like, I'm so happy to see my folks,

910
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,340
you know,
that wouldn't be disappointed them down.

911
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,960
You're going to eat or I'm gonna fucking
make you shit. Yeah. So in Hungarian,

912
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:40,430
I heard a few sayings. Okay. There's,
there's one occur on buff on the cubs,

913
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:43,910
which best sauce. That's, I'm
going to hit your head so hard.

914
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:45,470
You're going to shit in your pants.

915
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,730
Yeah.

916
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:52,710
All [inaudible] is, I'm
on a hedge. You so hard.

917
01:01:52,711 --> 01:01:55,260
Your head's gonna fall off.
That's another nice one.

918
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:59,220
And get a sub on the buzz
mag that's come and eat.

919
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,410
Fucking come and eat basically.

920
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:08,520
Yeah,
yeah,

921
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,330
yeah. Welcome. Surreal.
Welcome to America. Now.

922
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,940
I know I now and I,
now we're watching.

923
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:19,830
The Americans were such a
good show. I love show, Dude.

924
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:24,560
If you're not into the Americans, great
show to dive into and lose yourself for,

925
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,340
we're in the second season. Yeah. Um,

926
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,500
it takes place in the early
eighties, so, you know, Cold War,

927
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:36,270
they're KGB agents living in America
under deep cover. Keri Russell,

928
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,330
which is great. It reminds me a lot
of you. Thank you. She's just so cold.

929
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:45,750
Or you can see the coldness in her eyes.
Yeah. And then, uh, what's the guy's name?

930
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:48,840
Who plays her husband? I don't know,
but I like him too. Eyes. Right.

931
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:53,180
So like something like that. He's
tremendous actor. They both are. She's,

932
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,820
she's amazed, but they're, the
writing is just phenomenal.

933
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,540
I also knew there reminds me of you, cause
she gives it up immediately in a lot.

934
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,220
So she reminds me of you.
Yeah. Uh, blood farts his back.

935
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:08,670
We got to start watching. We haven't
even, don't you even, we have to start.

936
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,810
We have to watch. I can't wait to see if
that idiot, uh, the Daryl, oh no, he's,

937
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:17,490
he's gone. Yeah. But then it's the
son of, yeah. Yeah. Derelict Pos.

938
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,600
Pos is back. I owe him a pos. Danny.
Danny was such a piece of shit.

939
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,000
I just, I love that Florida trash
though. Are you feeling today?

940
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,140
Oh,
well,

941
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:32,460
let's see what's on the chart today for
how we feel about our gender. Let's see.

942
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,530
Um,
I feel I like this one.

943
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,770
Arrow gender agenda that is
influenced by your surroundings.

944
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,600
I kind of feel like that right now.
Okay. A little arrow. January. Oh hmm.

945
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,040
Okay. What about affect,
affect, do gender,

946
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:53,400
a gender that is effected by mood swings.
That's pretty good too.

947
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:59,400
Let me see that. How about I just hit the
scroll. See where we land, right? Yeah.

948
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,050
Look,
we're still in the A's right now.

949
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,040
Okay, hold on. Okay. See transgendered,

950
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:12,230
we know that once legit cause people
about cut their stuff off to be that,

951
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:14,160
that you got a real bio gender,

952
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,940
a gender that feels connected
to nature in some way.

953
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:22,360
I'm definitely biogen. Oh wait, is
there a dog gender cause I love my dog.

954
01:04:22,361 --> 01:04:24,810
So it's funny you mentioned that.
Um,

955
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,750
not only is there that there's a,

956
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:31,590
there's actually this what,
how did I know that?

957
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,650
I swear I didn't know this was coming
from a role model and I'm not running

958
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:39,450
around on the falls are looking country.

959
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,480
I can totally understand why people
would think it's strange to identify as

960
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:49,150
being a dog.
It's so well relax after a long day.

961
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:53,690
I'm not having to cope with
normal human life. Sure, sure.

962
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,710
I get it.
I'm

963
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:01,010
not having to deal with
normal human car moves.

964
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,400
Uh Yeah.

965
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:08,450
Did they go number two outside like
dogs and number money that you mentioned

966
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:11,400
that no, I don't know actually.
I know that that was so bizarre.

967
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:16,220
It was you just feeling you're feeling
very um, a canine gender today.

968
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,410
Yeah. And connected to your
bio, gender wow. Status.

969
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Which the two come together from
your astral gender non binary.

970
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:31,150
I can't be non-binary but then
identify dog gendered. Right.

971
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:35,290
I think you can, can I be, I
am non binary and dark. Gender.

972
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,900
Okay. I can't wait to meet
the president and tell him.

973
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:46,500
And what Pronoun would you or should
you be referring to me as because I am a

974
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:50,980
dog gendered. Am I, it's
a great question. A,

975
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,300
I'm not a he she cause I'm on binary.
Yeah. How would you refer to a dog?

976
01:05:56,290 --> 01:06:00,140
Well, it's a him or her, but
they're non binary dogs. Maybe the,

977
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:04,810
then you go back to the and then they
and them preferred pronoun. Okay. Yeah.

978
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,490
Okay. That's a great point. It was
really good that you mentioned it.

979
01:06:08,491 --> 01:06:13,000
You have to say the right
pronouns, pronouns, or not.

980
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,460
Any preference. We show that.
Do we have that on deck?

981
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:20,320
Sorry to that guy because I
feel like last week, oh right.

982
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:24,940
To see him and he really needs to be seen
and heard and validated and everybody

983
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:28,710
needs to know the proper pronouns
for that guy. Interesting.

984
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:30,761
Color,

985
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:35,761
gender agenda associated with one
or more colors and the feelings.

986
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:38,890
Hughes. I can't read it. It's too small.

987
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:41,470
Emotions and and or objects
associated with that color.

988
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:45,910
Maybe use like pink gender, blue gender,
yellow jet. That is such horse shit.

989
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,810
Color, color, gendered.
They've, I mean listen,

990
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,430
I think this isn't a front to people
that really have gender identity issues.

991
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,670
You know, if you're like I'm a man
trapped in a woman's body, vice versa.

992
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:02,660
This stuff, this has to be
an embarrassment to people
that are, have like Ge,

993
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,750
like genuine gender problem
or gender identity things,

994
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:10,900
you know, I don't know what makes you say
that? So this is, this is, I'm offended.

995
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,450
I am a fan. Yeah. Let me see.

996
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:17,920
I think like here's one burst gender
agenda that comes and intense bursts of

997
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:21,370
feeling and quickly fades
back to the original state.

998
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:26,440
Now this is under, where did you find
gender fluid? support.tumblr.com guys,

999
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:32,070
look at the site and figure out which
gender you are and make sure to tell us

1000
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:35,050
and let everybody know your
proper pronouns this week.

1001
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,360
It's really important
that you let us know.

1002
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,830
We would definitely want everybody to
get their proper pronouns in their,

1003
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:46,180
so astral gender colored gendered.

1004
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,970
I can,
I think we could.

1005
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,950
Oh yeah. I think people
need to see this guy, right?

1006
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,460
We didn't really show him before,

1007
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:58,200
so let's see if I can get into play.

1008
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:03,140
Don't you feel like this is totally
offensive to people that really have like

1009
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,220
gender identity?
We get her fucking,

1010
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:13,950
this is the newest video on my Oscar
gender terrorist playlists on my channel,

1011
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,400
Dakota, all my playlist because
I posted anything in a long time.

1012
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,930
If you would like to know why,

1013
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,770
check out my ass Dakota life
update coming out video there.

1014
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:27,980
You just want to make a video
that I can link people to me.

1015
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:33,250
There's a lot of homage to
everyone in the world to bear.

1016
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,830
My pronouns are not preferred.
They're not a preference.

1017
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:42,650
They are mandatory for
interaction with me. Um,

1018
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,240
you know what's crazy? I don't want
to interact with you all you've met.

1019
01:08:46,241 --> 01:08:51,040
You've made us a lot of points. Yes, he's
got, she shaved his eyes. Yes. Sorry.

1020
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:56,130
They shaved their eyebrows and sanity
have their beard going and total insanity.

1021
01:08:57,070 --> 01:09:00,310
But the eyebrow shaving is
almost universally. Yeah.

1022
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:05,920
It remember the movie mental illness, the
movie, the wall, Pink Floyd, the wall.

1023
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:09,190
There's a scene where he breaks down.
He has a mental breakdown and he,

1024
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:12,190
I believe he shaves his eyebrows
off and his hair and everything.

1025
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:14,660
And that's a sign of mental illness.
Uh,

1026
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,840
royal Tenenbaums Richie Tenenbaum
tries to kill himself. Yeah.

1027
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:21,850
He shaves everything off. It's a, it's
a metaphor of some kind for losing.

1028
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,190
You're not,
or just out of your fucking mind.

1029
01:09:24,191 --> 01:09:27,570
You and I have eyebrows or walk the
streets of downtown Los Angeles. And, um,

1030
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,240
every time you see somebody with a shaved
eyebrows, just know that it should.

1031
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:36,220
It's really about to go down with them.
Yeah. Shit's gone. And, and I love the,

1032
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,570
the Old Lady Turban. This
is, I got out of the shower,

1033
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:43,270
my hair is wet and then the
various Wicca Jars, you know,

1034
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:46,990
full of warlock things.

1035
01:09:46,991 --> 01:09:51,850
And here's a apples and boy he has a
little shrine. I chart for the DMV.

1036
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,910
I mean there's a low cut,
low cut.

1037
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,340
So much happening for you. You know what?
This guy is so fucking confused guys.

1038
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,780
I'm shit.
I mean

1039
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:06,690
expect everyone in the world's
who understands. Yeah. Asia,

1040
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:08,190
you don't have anything to stand on.

1041
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:11,700
This is what you're going to abide by
if you're going to be in our lives.

1042
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:14,310
And that's all there is to it.
So anyway,

1043
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,800
I hope you guys are doing well.
My Non Binary folks. I love you.

1044
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:23,600
I hope that you're having a
fantastic time. I hope you
have a good Halloween. Um,

1045
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:27,180
if you choose not to go out and you
want to stay in and thank you for taking

1046
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,510
care of yourself. This is not something
that you're obligated to deal with.

1047
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,420
I know it's hard for us at this
time of year because you know,

1048
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:36,240
everybody thinks are
fucking gender identity and
expression and the whole thing

1049
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:38,940
isn't it?
It's a fucking costume in the first place.

1050
01:10:38,941 --> 01:10:42,960
So costume day is amateur night oftentimes
is a little bit hard for us to deal

1051
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:43,794
with,
so,

1052
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:47,240
all right. How does he take, so
he takes Halloween personally.

1053
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:52,040
Now it's a personal offense guys.
Got You got so many problems.

1054
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,830
I'd say the gender identity
is the last on the list.

1055
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:58,910
This guy's Super Jesus
Christ. Fuck you. Come,

1056
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:03,520
come out Outta Camo gender. What's that?
Well, you know you aren't cisgender,

1057
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,590
but you settled with your assigned
gender for the time being.

1058
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:13,530
Okay. How about Delis? DALYSIA gender?
What's that from the the Latin word.

1059
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:14,610
Delete him.
Any favorite?

1060
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:17,700
Meaning that feeling of having
more than one simultaneous gender,

1061
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,330
you are preferring one that fits better.
I don't even understand that.

1062
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,890
While you shouldn't, I don't
even understand this. Do you do?

1063
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:29,610
Are they teaching kids this Horse
Shit in school? They better not be.

1064
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:30,920
I'll pull my phone.
Okay.

1065
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:35,540
Where can we send Ellis that he won't
hear about this dumb shit. Yeah, this is,

1066
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,830
I mean what such an asshole? Yeah, I
think it's an attention. I'm sub gender,

1067
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,850
mostly a gender with a bit of
another gender. Fuck you man.

1068
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:49,350
May mostly age,
gender with a bit of another gender.

1069
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:53,340
So I mean I don't even understand.
How about surge gender?

1070
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,820
How's that having a gender
that is 100% one gender,

1071
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:00,060
but with more of another
gender added on top of that.

1072
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:04,590
You can't be more than a
hundred percent that's so crazy.

1073
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,030
That's not even logically possible.
Try Agenda,

1074
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,790
not listen to this shit.
Try Gender.

1075
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:16,140
The feeling of having three simultaneous
or fluctuating genders. You don't,

1076
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:20,400
they don't exist. There's
only two genders. What do you
mean three? There's a, yeah.

1077
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:24,480
Okay. You fucking square bug.

1078
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,420
It is a fucking, hey, wait a minute.

1079
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,720
Doris over here thinks
there's two genders.

1080
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:35,520
Fucking retard.
Andrea,

1081
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,270
what is it? You know what
it is? People are bored.

1082
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:43,320
There's nothing happening though.
Life is so easy in America.

1083
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:47,420
We're looking for things to get
all fired up about. Yeah, it does.

1084
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:50,610
It have to invent things to get
offended about this fucking kid.

1085
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:54,240
If there's a war going on in his ass was
about to be drafted into a war and you

1086
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:57,840
think there'd be time for him to paint
his fucking nails and do his tats and

1087
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:01,500
fill his weird, which is actually like to
see a video where they sent him choose.

1088
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:06,180
Yes. Less developed countries have
him explain his situation. Yeah.

1089
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,690
Why don't you go to Kabul, Afghanistan
and explain your gender problems.

1090
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:13,130
Don't announce to people
I'm neither gender watch.

1091
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:20,010
And then they just go, he's a witch.
Let's kill him. Alright, set him on fire.

1092
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:24,930
Um, our Budapest go to Hungary.
My modern, amazing. Let's discuss.

1093
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:29,170
Great. What about an hour later
when I smell bacon I could eat.

1094
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:33,340
So at one point do you shut
out the window? You ever do
that for old time's sake?

1095
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,450
No,

1096
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:39,450
I in tubs because I just couldn't take
it no more walls up while I was taking a

1097
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:43,870
shower. Why get out? No, let me tell
you something. For some reason on, no,

1098
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:48,220
listen to me jasmine. If for some
reason though for about two years,

1099
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,060
every time I hate going and I like
shooting before I go in the shower,

1100
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,910
but I liked shooting before
I go into the shower.

1101
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,640
I don't want to take a shot of him
walking around with a dirty ass all day

1102
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,690
because at least you got a better,

1103
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:03,210
you got to stop every hallway and clean
and then it gets hot out. I don't like,

1104
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,860
I like taking this shit
before I go on the show.

1105
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:09,640
But that like that day system don't
work according to your fucking pussy

1106
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:12,360
schedule. Yep. Wash and then you come out.

1107
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,360
Some days I was taking a shower and
sometimes the water would hit my back.

1108
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,800
I have to take a shit and he had some
words. Let me tell you something.

1109
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:22,240
Would you want to dry off and to
take the shit? And it does suck.

1110
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,870
It makes you have to go to the
bathroom as soon as the water hit you.

1111
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:29,130
So sometimes you do something,
a wet toilet and it's a horrible feel,

1112
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:33,730
worse feeling. It's a horrible feeling.
So for awhile there I was just saying,

1113
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:37,390
fuck it. Let me just shit
while I'm taking a shower. You

1114
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,050
know?
I would either unscrew that thing.

1115
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:43,120
Sometimes I pick it up my
hand and just draw it. Right.

1116
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:51,370
That's how disgusting I am.
Sometimes I would just shit in Vegas.

1117
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:54,850
Sometimes I was eating pills and doing
blow and I would just sit in the thing

1118
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:58,240
with my legs open like a Chinese guy.
You know how they shouldn't try them,

1119
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:01,530
but only with water hitting
my boss at the same time.

1120
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:07,040
He's saying he would squat down into
the drain and shit in the shower.

1121
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,080
Do you guys think I'm nasty?
Oh No. This is a whole this,

1122
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:13,460
this is your Mother Teresa. Yes. Yes.

1123
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,550
Guy's profile and watch the shit
come out with all the barnacles. Oh,

1124
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:21,380
and then I get like the salt and
push it down the hole. Yes, I would.

1125
01:15:21,381 --> 01:15:23,690
I'm disgusting.
I got to admit to it right now.

1126
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,270
Anybody who's ever taken a shower at
Joey Diaz is out. No, not this outcome.

1127
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,320
I wouldn't do it in the
hotel. Oh, okay. Oh Jesus.

1128
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:33,550
We should down the peanuts would
get stuck to the thing drain.

1129
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,210
Couldn't go back down.
Oh no,

1130
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:41,070
we're speechless. Just when
you think you know, Joey Diaz,

1131
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,310
we thought him shitting
on the tree was cray cray.

1132
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,360
He has such a crazy story
that I want him to, uh,

1133
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,950
to tell that I heard,
uh,

1134
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,930
from somebody else in the whole story is
the kind of story I have to check first.

1135
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:59,730
We were like, I can't just bring it
up, you know? Yeah. That's not say no.

1136
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,760
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm still
processing what I've just heard.

1137
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,760
Like I can't move on just yet.
I need to process it. Hold on.

1138
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:11,870
He said he moves the drain thing and then
he squats like a Chinese guy and shit

1139
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,220
in the shower in a way,
you know,

1140
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:21,590
like as far as like addressing
your workflow, it's,

1141
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,780
it makes sense. Like I have to sanitize
my hands, but I want to also feel dirty.

1142
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:28,560
Just hearing. Yeah. I want to,
I know it's so weird, right?

1143
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,820
I don't know why this makes me feel.

1144
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:34,710
I think I'm going to take
a shower and just not shit
right after this. Um, but he,

1145
01:16:34,711 --> 01:16:37,950
uh,
he's such a savage Charlie.

1146
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,470
Okay.

1147
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,810
Does it makes sense to do,
except it says no sense. No,

1148
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:47,020
it makes sense to do if you go to,
to just shit where you're standing.

1149
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,790
It doesn't make any sense.

1150
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:51,700
Of course it does because that's
because of the water cleans it.

1151
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:55,990
Know what I'm saying? It's so filthy
and repulsive that nobody does it.

1152
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,470
If you were to be like, Hey, where
should I? Shit, you just share wherever,

1153
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:03,940
like where the water's flowing right now.
But you're shitting in the, yeah, no, you,

1154
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:06,400
you gave me so much crap.
It's not,

1155
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,950
I'm saying showering and you're
letting Joey get a pass on

1156
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:13,850
squatting in the drain or I'm not
explaining, well, what I'm trying to say,

1157
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,030
but I'm trying to say is on some level,

1158
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:21,740
the act of shitting where
water is flowing makes sense.

1159
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:26,390
Except doing it where you're
bathing is just so disgusting.

1160
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,650
You know what I mean?
Like,

1161
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,010
it's like you're pissing in the river
because it's right. The, you know,

1162
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:36,050
you don't have to get out and not find
the spy. So you're saying, but it's so,

1163
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,320
it's so good. Disgusting that he above
and beyond anything I could do or Ari.

1164
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:47,430
Ari and I are both straight shed the
shower people shower people. This Joey,

1165
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:51,070
this is okay. I'm speechless. Yeah,

1166
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:54,880
it's a Joey Diaz has a wife.
Doesn't that blow your mind?

1167
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:59,610
Some woman. I love him. I love you Joey.

1168
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,570
It's just so great.
Gnarly.

1169
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:29,260
Okay. Alright, so it's over.
It's over. It's over. Okay.

1170
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:33,310
What is wrong with you?
It's in my dealing.

1171
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,330
He just made himself on his eating stuff.
That's disgusting.

1172
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:42,410
You're going to fucking throw
up there. It's gone. It's gone.

1173
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:47,900
I thought it was appropriate to
play after shitting in the shower.

1174
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,413
Okay.

1175
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:54,480
Are we done? Yeah, we're done.
Y'all finished. Wow. We're done.

1176
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,690
We're finished and we're done.
We're finished. And we'd done it.

1177
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:04,260
I hate that. I don't know what
I'm going to do on Ellis bars.

1178
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:07,620
You're going to have to take care of him
if he's sick. You know? What do you mean?

1179
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,980
I don't know if I can stomach. Yes, you
will have a hard time. It's different.

1180
01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:14,460
It's your boy.
I know it's your boy guy and I'll be fine.

1181
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:20,350
Um,
how bad do you feel like that is?

1182
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,890
What, what'd he did?
What was going on there,

1183
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,420
Joey or the gagging a Joey.
Uh,

1184
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,390
I just don't know how his
wife handles that. It's a lot.

1185
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,380
You know what I mean?

1186
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:43,650
What do you use? I'm looking for
what is this sphincter relaxation?

1187
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:46,870
What does that, I dunno, man. Must
have been, it could be my mom.

1188
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,620
You can fucking tribe called quest.

1189
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:55,060
That's not a song. Is it? Sphincter
relaxation. That's what it's called.

1190
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:56,690
Yeah.

1191
01:19:56,690 --> 01:20:00,990
All right. Anyways. Anyways, any ever,

1192
01:20:00,991 --> 01:20:05,010
any way. I know a big shout out to all
the mommies who came out to La Jolla.

1193
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:09,060
So many mommy's. Thank you. So
for coming, it was the best.

1194
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:13,080
It was so fun to walk upstage,
walk on stage and just hear a litany of,

1195
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:17,570
Hey Hitlers and uh,
know all the sayings.

1196
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,930
It was so funny. It was so much
fun. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for coming.

1197
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:25,800
It was really good. And you were there
with, uh, the full Fart, the full,

1198
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:30,420
full charge, full charge. Crushed
it. He had some killer sets.

1199
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,450
We, uh, weighed some
talks down the streets.

1200
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,540
Breeds big shout out to
Ryan down the street.

1201
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:41,070
Who opened his a Taco shop
for us. Oh yeah. He also, um,

1202
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,700
is that your name? I hope so. What was it,
Ryan? All right. I'm trying to remember.

1203
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:49,590
I have no memory, but yeah, and it gave
you a late night talks, late night talks.

1204
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:54,150
Thank you for that. I've never been
to La Jolla. It's fancy San Diego.

1205
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:57,810
It's nice. Okay. You've never been
there at all or just to the comedy store

1206
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,720
have never been to to La Jolla San Diego.

1207
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:04,110
Yeah, it's, you know,
it's like the nice part.

1208
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:08,580
It's like the Beverly Hills of
San Diego. Okay, cool. Yeah. Um,

1209
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:12,030
hold on one second. Okay. Okay.
Let me find out this guy's Tacos.

1210
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,740
We're back forwards. Uh,
the name of the Taco Shop,

1211
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:19,480
Don Carlos Taco shop right down the
street from the La Jolla comedy store.

1212
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:23,200
Thank you for hooking us up with late
night talks. Nice Polish, Ron and myself.

1213
01:21:23,201 --> 01:21:26,800
Thank you dude. That was really cool.
Yeah, I was almost going to eat some, uh,

1214
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:27,610
you know,

1215
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:31,780
protein bars from where you got real food
and liquor store because of that guy.

1216
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:36,740
Very nice. You Sir. Um, let's
get into some two fees, right?

1217
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,110
No.
Okay.

1218
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:48,950
Oh
Wow.

1219
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,000
Cyber Dental update. Oh, I love
these. How are your teeth doing?

1220
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,710
Are still yellow.
Did you use the whitening size?

1221
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,070
How many times have you tried the
white name? Once. Just one. Yeah.

1222
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:19,020
Did it burn a lot? Yeah. It hurts for
the next couple of days too. That's good.

1223
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,300
That means it's working. I'm
going to do it again. Yeah,

1224
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,200
I'm going to do it again.
Yeah, you got to repeat it.

1225
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:26,380
Are they going to do it
tonight? Okay. Been a while.

1226
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,160
Uh, but I'm going to do it more
often because you're not, you're not,

1227
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:32,490
I saw how much we're putting in, so it
was too hot. You got to just put like A.

1228
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:36,150
Dot. I thought it wasn't dark.
You are like, like a glop.

1229
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,960
There's a way to minimize the pain.
That's definitely it.

1230
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:42,850
Here's the deal. I'll update from
some listeners. Uh, Tom and Christina,

1231
01:22:42,851 --> 01:22:45,700
I just wanted to share my appreciation
for the dental updates segment and your

1232
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:48,180
overall awareness of dental
hygiene and care. You got it.

1233
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:51,310
The reason I shared the love of dental
care is because I am a dental hygienist

1234
01:22:51,311 --> 01:22:55,060
and it's my job to stop people from doing
the stupid shit that people write in

1235
01:22:55,061 --> 01:22:56,050
about.
Fortunately,

1236
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,590
I rarely see that crazy shit because I
work in a military dental clinic. Oh.

1237
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:04,750
And we are required to have a dental
exam cleaning once a year no matter what.

1238
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,790
I just wish that people would understand.

1239
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,720
They get one set of set of teeth that
last a lifetime and once those are gone,

1240
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,580
that's it.
If you fucked that up,

1241
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,570
you're stuck with a lifetime of not
biting into an apple and you're stuck with

1242
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,790
denture cream.
Keep up the great work.

1243
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:24,340
I hope to make it to a live show
one day. Remember, floss them shits,

1244
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:29,330
peace out. Fuckboys tray the
floss boss. Thank you. Tray.

1245
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,100
That thing got kicked.
That moved. Came. Okay.

1246
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,870
Um, I would like to ask the professionals
out there and dental industry. Yeah,

1247
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:43,050
I have a cap that's kind of wonky.
Let's a back tooth.

1248
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:46,400
It's Kinda wonkily placed. I'm going
to have to replace it eventually.

1249
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:51,110
Crown Sarno. Cap a crown your own. Yeah.
Um, thank you. And when I floss it,

1250
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:53,280
I feel like it's tender Rony like it's,

1251
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:57,440
it's just precarious and I'm just
wondering, is there a way I can floss?

1252
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:58,880
Is there a technique I can use it?

1253
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:03,830
Maybe I'm just afraid of flipping up that
crown if that's possible for flossing,

1254
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:08,000
you could do that whole thing of
uh, going to a dentist or, yeah.

1255
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:13,760
I mean I was kind of waiting until I was
a little recover from childbirth. Oh,

1256
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,320
you and your fucking son, Huh? Before I
started messing with me. Wait, they can,

1257
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:21,620
did you give birth again or something?
How learned six months go.

1258
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:23,420
You can't go to the dentist.
They have your teeth checked.

1259
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,660
I had them cleans after I had Ellis.
What?

1260
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,390
I have to have this crown replaced
and I really put in that off.

1261
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:31,910
I've got to tell you I needed to do
the new dentist because we moved.

1262
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,020
I don't have one yet.

1263
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:37,530
I know we should call 'em oh, the
doc and ask him. Oh, for real?

1264
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:38,420
Yeah,

1265
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:42,180
we'll do that cause I don't want to go
to one of these like showbizzy Dennis

1266
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,490
down here in La and the,

1267
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:47,620
you know they had jack you so
fucking hard on these prices

1268
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:50,470
and they do the whole thing
where something happens
to me and then you say it

1269
01:24:50,471 --> 01:24:52,180
happened to you. Remember? That's the one

1270
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:58,580
that's so funny. Oh my God. Did I swear?
That's why I don't have dental insurance.

1271
01:24:58,581 --> 01:25:00,700
Did they?
Did it did.

1272
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,810
It happened that way to me.

1273
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:09,500
Maybe we could go to a dentist and find
out why your teeth are so yellow candy.

1274
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,200
All right,
look like candy corn.

1275
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:14,470
Somebody else wrote in.
Hey Mom and dad mouth.

1276
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,410
I just wanted to let you know you're
talking about getting your teeth fixed.

1277
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,750
Don't mind the cost finally inspired me.

1278
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:23,310
Good to get the work I've been
avoiding for a year. Good for you.

1279
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,380
It includes 24 months of nonbinary
braces or gender fluid extractions,

1280
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:34,840
including a top front that needs
an implant. As I've failed,

1281
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:38,290
I have a failed root
canal with a huge abscess,

1282
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:43,180
which requires a cow bone graft.
Fuck. Finally, jaw surgery.

1283
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:48,360
It's the final step to polyamorous to
extend my bottom jaw forward to correct my

1284
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:49,360
bike,

1285
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:54,160
which has been the root of all these
problems about six months and I'm so happy

1286
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:57,820
with the progress. Every time I see
myself in the mirror I ask, Hey Hitler,

1287
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:58,860
where's the com?
Yeah,

1288
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:04,220
it feels like my browns
are all fours and I finally

1289
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:08,330
got my life. Good for you.
Weirdest thing is my front tooth,

1290
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,260
which is essentially a flipper. Oh,
except it's connected to braces. Wire.

1291
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,610
Okay. All right, so he's saying that the
fake to this connected to the braces.

1292
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,520
Okay.
Yeah.

1293
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:22,490
Love from New Zealand where the
gender pronouns are not optional.

1294
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,360
Fantastic. I wish I knew who wrote
that. I don't know who wrote that one.

1295
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:31,100
Doesn't say ah, but yeah, New Zealand.
Shout out to all the Kiwis, man.

1296
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:35,240
Good. Good for you, Mommy. Yeah.
Gotcha. Take care of your teeth.

1297
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:39,440
You'll feel so much better when they look
good for sure. Oh yeah, man. You know,

1298
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:43,100
sometimes I look at pictures of me and
everything else can look all fucked up,

1299
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:46,610
you know? But if your teeth
look nice, it totally look,

1300
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:51,530
makes you look so much nicer. Really does.
Um, do you want to read some Fan Mail?

1301
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,760
I don't have it in front of me. I have
it in front of me. Like do you want Oh,

1302
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:59,940
okay. Yeah. Put it up here.
Sure. Here we go. The top.

1303
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:05,600
Yes. Hi Mommy. Just
wanted to say fuck you.

1304
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,340
I wear a condom on my tongue.
Love Danielle.

1305
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:13,140
That's from last week, right? It was
last week's episode. Who said that? Uh,

1306
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:16,440
the Cruzee arm Muslim guy. Oh,
that's right. I'll fucking wear it.

1307
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:18,880
Kind of where my tongue. Yeah.
Yeah. That guy was really nice.

1308
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:22,380
People are looking for that video. We
got to put it on our site. All right.

1309
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:23,680
We've been rebuilding the site.
If you,

1310
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:27,790
if some of you guys noticed
lastic immediately. Oh shit man.

1311
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,460
We had a,
a problem with our old site,

1312
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:34,960
so we got a new site built
kind of a as much as we could.

1313
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:40,150
And what did we use? Squarespace.
Squarespace. So it's a Squarespace site.

1314
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,260
And um, that's your mom's
house. podcast.com. We're
working on getting the clips.

1315
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:47,440
You got the Info on how to get those
up there, right? So, all right, cool.

1316
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:50,140
We'll add those up. Um,
here's another email.

1317
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,370
Hey, Hitler's. Yeah,

1318
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:57,170
I had an experience today that I am not
sure qualifies as a double pipe classic.

1319
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:59,150
Here we go.
While at work,

1320
01:27:59,151 --> 01:28:02,840
I went to the bathroom cause I stood in
front of the toilet just about to pee.

1321
01:28:02,841 --> 01:28:06,020
I felt the sneeze coming on and
wouldn't you know it. I farted,

1322
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:07,520
sneeze and Pete at the same time,

1323
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,540
all three bodily functions shot
out of me simultaneously. Oh Wow.

1324
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:14,540
I'm not sure if this is as good as a
double pipe classic or even better.

1325
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:18,680
Please let me know your thoughts.
Are you out of your Goddamn mind? No,

1326
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:22,730
it's not better. No, it doesn't count. I
keep getting this fucking question. Hey,

1327
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:26,200
if I sneeze and far, is that a double
pipe? It's not the same. You know,

1328
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:29,780
you just have a little extra
turbo boost on your fart.

1329
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:35,180
Yeah. You have that night trope and you
just add a little extra juice to it.

1330
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:40,030
The rules of a double pipe are
burping and farting. Same time they,

1331
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:44,930
it doesn't happen often. It's not going
to happen to you every Wednesday. God,

1332
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:48,950
you just have to relish it when it
does happen. Just stop. You sit down,

1333
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:51,800
you say a prayer,
you thank y'all way for,

1334
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:54,530
of course it doesn't happen a lot.

1335
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:59,860
No last week you to shout out to the
bear community and you requested some gay

1336
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:02,400
bears to clarify some shit,

1337
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:07,410
so here I am as a burly gay
dude to set you to straight.

1338
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,540
Here's how it works
within the gay community,

1339
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:13,970
especially when it comes to
the sub genre of bears, a bear,

1340
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,770
simply an overweight guy
that is covered in body here.

1341
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,490
It's literally that simple,
Aka Tommie Hines or Chewbacca.

1342
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,190
With that said,

1343
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,950
there are sub classes within the
gay community in regards to bear.

1344
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:32,070
When I get interested in now this is what
I'm talking about here and odder is a

1345
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:36,570
hair fit and slim guy
and otter is not fat.

1346
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,040
No Dad Bod?
No,

1347
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:41,250
nothing in auto is just simply a
regular fit dude that just happens to be

1348
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:44,670
hearing my friend. John's
definitely an honor. All

1349
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:52,010
generally otters are very fit and have
a six pack or less and they do lots of

1350
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:55,260
labs and an Olympic size swimming pool.
Okay,

1351
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,780
but that said you have the fake bears,
Aka smooth skins.

1352
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:05,310
These are just fat guys that try
to identify themselves as bears,

1353
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:07,660
but they are not bears
because they're not what?

1354
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:11,610
Well what that said they are the chubs.
It's just big bears are smooth skins.

1355
01:30:11,611 --> 01:30:14,160
You have to be Harry in order to be there.
That's what he's saying.

1356
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,880
If you're fat and hairless,
you're just fat. Like

1357
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,580
Burt.
His chest isn't very hairy.

1358
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:29,510
They probably would be like, why is
this guy so fat, fat Ed herring. Ah.

1359
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:32,490
These guys are just straight up
heavy dudes. Like 500 pounds,

1360
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,140
500 pound types of dudes.

1361
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:38,340
The type of guys where the smells come
out of the roles of their fat. Yeah.

1362
01:30:38,341 --> 01:30:42,300
They try to come within the bear
community and then you have the muscle.

1363
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:45,180
There's these guys are straight
up. Jack. I've seen these guys,

1364
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:46,140
it's like Mac as that.

1365
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:52,020
These are your typical muscle gym
freaks and they have body hair.

1366
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:54,870
They don't have the typical beer
belly or anything like that.

1367
01:30:54,871 --> 01:30:59,871
What they are are just pure gym jocks
and are jacked to the tits with whatever

1368
01:31:00,391 --> 01:31:04,320
supplements they are using. Either
way they are kind of fucking hot. Wow.

1369
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:08,250
So basically those are three typical
sub genres of bears within the gay

1370
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:09,570
community.
Cope.

1371
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:13,140
My experience with the Dick has helped
you to and understanding the mystical

1372
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:16,250
bare sub genre,
Keith and jeans high and tight cognac

1373
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:21,540
explaining to us we appreciate it.
That's really interesting. Yeah,

1374
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:25,640
that's a lot of sub genre. Mac SF will
be considered a muscle there for sure.

1375
01:31:25,641 --> 01:31:29,400
Yeah. I don't know what
episodes those are awhile ago.

1376
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:34,130
I love Mac and then we had his partner
at the time was listening to the show and

1377
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:36,790
he um, he's like, we'll
answer your question. Also,

1378
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:40,020
his partner was I think
an editor and it was like,

1379
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:45,120
hey thought you might enjoy this.
A edit of some sort of Mac stuff.

1380
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:47,990
I just worked on it for Gore.
Shit,

1381
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:55,050
it's hard. Is is real be
spin. He's a real animal.

1382
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,830
Only one Mac, SF, Google, m a C K,

1383
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:04,240
s f or just download a hair suit.
Pursuits of their albums,

1384
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,460
but don't look at work. All
right. It's intense. Real intense.

1385
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:14,110
Um, I think that said jeans. Yup.
You got anything else? No. Good.

1386
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,400
Tom Treats me like a frat brother.
Oh, maybe that's on the next step is,

1387
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:23,530
excuse me. I'm I telling you that
career ago. Fart. I got to shit.

1388
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,350
I'm like, am I a Frat Bro? I'm your wife.

1389
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:31,180
Then you got to say that
we sit down for breakfast.

1390
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,260
We're eating breakfast. I'm sitting
right next to you. Lift your leg up.

1391
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:38,020
Fart at me.
You don't lift the other way.

1392
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:41,680
You lift towards me as I'm
eating and you're like,

1393
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:46,150
hey,
you're calling me the fucking Frat guy.

1394
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,270
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I
love you though. I love you too.

1395
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:56,110
Um, okay, so we want to address this.

1396
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,590
This is a really a big deal.
You know,

1397
01:32:58,591 --> 01:33:03,591
in this episode we called the hotel in
Cincinnati to get people the exact room

1398
01:33:05,771 --> 01:33:10,030
number where the Cincinnati fart
occurred. And there's, there was a little,

1399
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:13,360
you know,
misunderstanding as far as a,

1400
01:33:13,361 --> 01:33:15,850
what I heard and what was repeated back.
And we're,

1401
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:20,410
we're not yet at the exact room number.
We need to figure it out.

1402
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,720
Right. And I want to be, I'm going
to come clean on little something.

1403
01:33:23,721 --> 01:33:26,640
So when we went to Cincinnati for,

1404
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:29,650
it happened and we recorded
that episode August, 2015

1405
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:36,130
and we said, oh, it's room 1618
and I remember in my head going,

1406
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:41,100
wait, that's not the right room. That
was I think your parents room now. Yeah.

1407
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:44,140
And I'm like, what? Because I know
at the time I go, that's not right.

1408
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,220
I said that in my head.

1409
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,270
So either at six 18 or eight oh eight or
eight oh eight and we're not giving up.

1410
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,950
That's the thing. We just
want people to know, like,

1411
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:55,750
we're gunna find out the
correct room number. We're just,

1412
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,170
we're just not there yet.
We don't want to mislead anyone.

1413
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:02,290
And we don't want you to think that
we're just going to quit on the room.

1414
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:06,870
We don't want you to plan your summer
vacations around this information. Look,

1415
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,160
it is the Renaissance Hotel in downtown
Cincinnati and it is either eight oh

1416
01:34:12,161 --> 01:34:16,210
eight or six 18 I'm almost
inclined to believe,

1417
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,330
but not 1618 right? That
one of the numbers, right?

1418
01:34:19,331 --> 01:34:23,230
Because she said we listened
back and she's clearly said six.

1419
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:28,060
I thought you said 16 I want to say
it's eight oh eight because of the band

1420
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:29,050
eight Oh eight state.

1421
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:32,770
It's an industrial plant and I remember
being like eight Oh eight state in my

1422
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:35,650
head at the time.
You know when you make dumb association,

1423
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,990
maybe you could check in and say,
can I get two keys,

1424
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:42,790
one for eight oh run for six 18 and just
walk around both for a moment and see

1425
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:46,240
if you smell anything or just stand there.
Close your eyes.

1426
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:49,390
And if you feel a little extra movement,
you're in the right room. You know,

1427
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,410
we're going to do a little more research
and figure out the correct room.

1428
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:58,310
We'll make sure you guys do the
right, go, go to the right room,

1429
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,530
the right things. Um, yeah.
Yeah. This is a big deal.

1430
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:07,400
Yeah, this is a big deal. Well I
know and we're commemorating it.

1431
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:08,370
It's very important stuff.

1432
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:12,440
Figure out the correct room by looking
back at our flights and figuring out

1433
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:13,880
exactly who checked in first.

1434
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:16,880
You checked in first and I
flew in as late as I could.

1435
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:20,150
We went to the wedding and
then I left the next day.

1436
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,430
And you stayed on a day after my,
no,

1437
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:23,860
but I don't know that I
checked into that hook.

1438
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:27,830
Did I check into that hotel first?
You came from another room? He and I,

1439
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,290
we started fresh together in
that room and the room stop.

1440
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:36,290
So I don't know if you were, if you
were in a different hotel. I was.

1441
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:40,570
That's what I'm trying to tell you. Okay.
I wasn't a different hotel. And you want,

1442
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:45,110
what day was the wedding?
The wedding was on a Friday.

1443
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:46,130
I think we'll,

1444
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:48,830
all we have to do is look at the calendar
and we can look at the calendar and

1445
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:52,550
figure it out. Yeah, because
I came as late as possible.

1446
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:57,230
I came in the night before
the wedding, I believe. No,
no, no. I came for the dinner.

1447
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:02,043
Yup.

1448
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:07,360
Okay. Mystery. We're going to
ask too. It's a bit of a mystery.

1449
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:12,340
Let's look right now. August it
was what day? Saturday of August.

1450
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:15,970
22nd of 2015 is a Saturday.
Okay.

1451
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,700
Yeah. Look here. Flight.

1452
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:23,730
I flew from CVG to lax
on the 22nd on Saturday,

1453
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,840
on Saturday from CVG,

1454
01:36:25,841 --> 01:36:30,841
so I flew in from lax to CBG on the 19th
so I checked into the hotel on the 19th

1455
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:37,630
you wouldn't have checked it on the 19th
let the record show unless this is your

1456
01:36:37,631 --> 01:36:42,490
flight. Why would I have that in my phone?
That let's me confirmation crowed. Look,

1457
01:36:42,491 --> 01:36:45,790
it's all here. Christina flew in
was the, oh, that makes sense.

1458
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:49,030
Cause the rehearsals Thursday,
the wedding's Friday, Saturday,

1459
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:53,320
which means it was the first room number
she gave us the 19 which I think was

1460
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,780
eight oh eight state
guys.

1461
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:59,750
The Cincinnati fart happened in a,

1462
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:02,990
it's eight oh eight and I know I
make a correction to the episode.

1463
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,160
It's a very nice title.

1464
01:37:04,161 --> 01:37:08,600
It correctly because I know the day we
recorded it on the show, we set it wrong.

1465
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:11,600
And in my head I went, should I say the
right number? And I was like, who cares?

1466
01:37:11,601 --> 01:37:14,840
You know, under the episode title, this

1467
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:20,230
Cincinnati Farts.
Right?

1468
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:25,950
Can we tag this audio onto the episode?
Maybe eight oh eight this is important.

1469
01:37:25,951 --> 01:37:29,760
This is really, really
vital information. Um, Gosh,

1470
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:32,190
I'm really happy we were able
to resolve this. If you want,

1471
01:37:32,191 --> 01:37:35,490
you could address the fact that there's
a diaper in front of you on the table.

1472
01:37:35,491 --> 01:37:40,340
I don't know if went that'd people,
what's going on there?

1473
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:43,860
This is a dog diaper. I got an Amazon
using our banner. Your mom's house.

1474
01:37:43,861 --> 01:37:44,850
podcast.com.

1475
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,990
Deter the dog from urinating
on our staircase cause there's,

1476
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:53,490
it's carpeted for people that are
curious too. She doesn't pee in it.

1477
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:58,290
No, she just doesn't until
she goes outside. And where
are we taking off? Right?

1478
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,800
It's part of potty training and yes,
when she's house broken for the most part,

1479
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:05,010
she's just young. Yeah,
she's stupid. Sit on.

1480
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:07,080
Or are you guys Cincinnati fart roommate.
Oh wait,

1481
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:09,690
it's eight oh eight eight oh eight.
It's eight oh eight. All right.

1482
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:14,610
We should get out of here. This, oh,
this says, what is this gaping dad.

1483
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:18,990
Yeah. Is that good? Yeah. Yeah, it's good.

1484
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:23,010
It's really good guys. You
really going to love it. Okay.

1485
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:27,600
I don't know why this is a, having a lot
of, uh, Internet problems at the house.

1486
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:32,170
Last couple of bad problems is really
cool cause dad doesn't know how to do

1487
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:36,690
things. I don't know why I'm dad's never
know how to use technology. That's,

1488
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:44,080
thanks dad. Was that a lot? So, all right.

1489
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:48,090
I gotta go. This is a
bye. Bye. Gaping Dad.

1490
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:50,190
It's called vocal fry jam.
Oh good.

1491
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:53,150
Okay.
