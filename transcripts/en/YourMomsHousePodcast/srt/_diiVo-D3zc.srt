1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,170
Well. Well, well go to your mom's house,

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,413
Christina,

3
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,540
your mom's house podcast.
Come for the moose soup.

4
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,810
Stay for Christina's sour dry personality.

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,090
There you go. That was very
rude. Uh, welcome. Created that.

6
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,410
That is Jake Glazer. He's a
voiceover artist. Certainly is.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,240
I have a few. I have a great
bunch of submissions of his good.

8
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,000
They're good. Well, he's
outstandingly talented,

9
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,220
but I'm not sure I approve of the message.
Why not?

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,940
It's a bunch of has coming in here.
You're going to be impressed by it.

11
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,430
I'll give you, I'll give you
a taste of one more. Okay.

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,550
Your mom's house podcast with a black
people yell louder and the White People

13
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:06,300
fart harder. Oh, I like that. Yeah.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,460
What an astute observation
too. It's funny, I never
would have like written that,

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,750
but you know. Hmm. Well there
you go. Pretty funny. Yeah,

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,610
the whites do for it harder
here. They do. Hey, speaking of,

17
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:23,000
did you hear my fart last night
at two in the morning? No, Bay by,

18
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,060
I didn't know it was asleep.
Two o'clock. No warning.

19
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,180
I know you didn't hear the baby crying.
It's weird how men don't seem to hear, uh,

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,290
infant crying,
but

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,400
maybe was howling and I went down there,

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,380
I came back and I let
out such a huge fart.

23
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,150
And it was really hoping to wake you
up at that point. Well, did I? No,

24
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:45,860
of course not. I'm not that I can
tell. I don't just ignore that cries.

25
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,780
I honestly don't hear the farts either.
So,

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,870
and I thought I had to shit last
night at two in the morning, which I,

27
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,820
that's your move. Yeah. That is my move.

28
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:57,821
It's also a good story because
this morning I woke up to,

29
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,130
you know, last night I thought I was
going to shit at two in the morning,

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,320
but I didn't. It was like, okay,

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,760
why do you want me to hold my stories
from you? I thought were married.

32
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,360
That's the whole point is that we share.
No, you're right. We are. We're worried.

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,220
We're two mommies. One gene. Yeah. I
don't forget. We're definitely one thing.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,080
Yeah, that's what, that's
why we share a pair. Yeah,
absolutely. Wait, so how's our,

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,093
how's our dogs?

36
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,500
Our dog's butt hole. Yeah. The others,
they're running the test that they,

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
that they run for for itchy
butt holes. Is that right? Yeah,

38
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,330
they do a urine analysis because they,
they,

39
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:37,280
they think that it could be that her
badge is bothered and it looks like it's

40
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,530
her butthole. Okay. So they're doing that.

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,390
They have a fecal sample now they test
for like parasites and see if that's

42
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:46,160
what's what's bugging it.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,280
And then they already did the actual anal
expression in the exam to see if there

44
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:56,390
was something that stood out. They
ask you to lick it and taste it. Yeah,

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,040
they said a funny, that
vet goes, I also to examine

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,090
you at the same time. And I was
like, that's weird why? He goes,

47
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:08,350
well a lot of times the owner and the pad,
it's like super advanced theory,

48
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,800
but they could be, you
know, mimicking each other.

49
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,480
And I said that's above my pay
grade, so go for it man. So he did,

50
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,450
he that he fingered me.
He expressed your anal glands.

51
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,680
So how'd that feel?
Felt great. Felt great.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,940
Was it now the vet that you saw today,
was it,

53
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,310
was it the Zim zero one or was
it the no, no, no, it was a dude.

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,280
Are you presuming or straight up
why? I'm presuming, but it is, yeah,

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,380
he identified as male. Yeah.
I think I know. Is he like,
yeah, Kinda Kinda sloppy,

56
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:45,700
goofy kind of sweet guy. Yeah. I
guess is he crazy about Brussels?

57
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,470
Griffon I mean he,
he,

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,770
he didn't specify that and
he was definitely really
sweet with her. What Betsy?

59
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:51,640
Yeah. Yeah. Cause I,

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,880
when I brought her in there to get her
anal glands expressed about a month ago,

61
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,380
there was like a sloppy, floppy,
endearing that he was really into her.

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,340
He's like, oh my God, I
never see the Brussels. I'm
like, I know they're special.

63
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,280
Rare like me, my personality.
Hello. Hello? Hello? Um,

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,990
did he tell you what she was thinking?
No, that is my pet peeve though. Hell,

65
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,500
that is one of my,
like my ultimate pet peeves.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,970
I can't believe I haven't taken it on
stage yet. I need to, I think I'm gonna,

67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,493
I'm gonna,

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm gonna shoot this special in a few
weeks and then my next hour is going to be

69
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,110
called what your dog is thinking

70
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,410
or what she's thinking. What do you
think Betsy is thinking? Well, you know,

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,700
um,
your dog is feeling a little sad,

72
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,360
a little anxious, but
also hopeful. Uh, Ben,

73
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:44,080
this is something we've observed in
dogs for years. I was like hopeful.

74
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,450
And then did your dog, did the dog
report that to you when it did the uh,

75
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,950
the list, the check off list? Well
she's a Gemini. Did she tell you that?

76
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,280
The birth month, but yeah, so
dancer leaning, uh, you know,

77
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,610
it was great about Fifo.

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,780
So you took bitsy separately to the vet
and fefe was left behind and I thought

79
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,520
for sure fief would be like really upset.
You know,

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,500
why does busy didn't give a shit
was like, oh you're gone. Great.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,890
And just that surprise,
he didn't feel a lick of anxiety.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,190
Usually he's got major anxiety.
Yeah, he's such a mental case.

83
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,510
Fifo but didn't give one shit the busy,
it was

84
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,230
just pulled that one.
Cause I really,

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,300
I think that's my favorite part of the
whole thing. I think so. I think it's,

86
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,720
you guys are doing good and she says
it twice. It's grammatically incorrect.

87
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,640
Yeah.
Well I believe is the relative.

88
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,990
It makes me crazy. She's
really integrate. Yeah.

89
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,200
There's,

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,080
there's all kinds of great stuff
when she goes dirty bitch. Yeah.

91
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,480
Is that what she says? Dirty. Dirty. Yes.

92
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,730
That's weird. Oh yeah.

93
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,430
And

94
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,280
Gee,
you guys are doing good.

95
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,270
Yeah, she's awesome. Don't forget
your moose soup shirts are now

96
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
are,

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,250
well, the shirt actually have
a big announcement start.

98
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,780
You don't normally do this,
but I'll save it for during the show.

99
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:31,780
Let's get this show started
normally and then we,

100
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,920
I guess shitty later. All right,
let's start our show. Let's go here.

101
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,520
Oh, and g, welcome to another
episode of Your Mom's house.

102
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,343
Here we go.

103
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,310
Hi Melanie. Stadio carts. Tantra.

104
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,800
I was just wanting to share that
there are many ways to orgasm.

105
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,280
You don't actually have to be
having sex orgasm just from hugging.

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,320
Ah, ah. Ah,

107
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,763
okay.

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,300
How old is Ryan?
Don't bring anyone loving.

109
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,640
Well,
we'll go to your mom's house.

110
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,760
Christina. Pledges. It's interesting.

111
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,910
You guys are doing good.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,650
You love him. She's your, your
first grade teacher. Oh my God.

113
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,770
Can I tell you how much I hate anybody
that engages in any form of Tantra?

114
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,980
Oh my God,
this shit really gets under my skin.

115
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,320
I hate how happy they are.

116
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,540
I hate how expressive they're
fucking misguided faces. Look,

117
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,890
uh, and I, I really
hated the fucking orgasm.

118
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,620
It was so stupid. There wasn't an
orgasm. Faker shaking. And he's like,

119
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,880
oh my God, that hug. Fuck you man.

120
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,880
Fuck You X. Right? Yeah.
Why? I feel like I hated it.

121
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:48,190
And look by that they
look like tantra practice.

122
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,350
That's the thing is that there's
always, oh look, yeah. Doing that thing.

123
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,780
Like it's so sensual.

124
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,040
That's the new I like.
I like, I like fucking,

125
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,120
I think, what are you doing? You're
putting your tongue over your teeth.

126
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,210
That's like the Maria Omg Maria phase.
That's like,

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,810
I feel like that's the
version now of like a, like a

128
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,540
mouth, a little open. It's
always the same dough. I,

129
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,150
you know, pie to kind of dopey.
Like they just need something.

130
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:28,270
That was like eight years, something like
that. Yeah. He's a rapper. He's right.

131
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Who Do you think introduced hurts?
Is US amazing now.

132
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,270
Well that's a thank come when you
hug. These are, these are lost souls.

133
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,580
People who haven't found Christ,

134
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,180
but they find the tantric horse shit.
You know what I mean?

135
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,920
Like they're one seminar away from giving
20% of their income to Scientology.

136
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,100
Like they're just, they're right. If they
just took a different door, you know,

137
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,930
but they're, they're
finding tantra. Tantra,

138
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,620
I guess is the contrast.

139
00:09:55,621 --> 00:10:00,621
People who sign up for come hugging
don't get what they signed up for.

140
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,610
I bet most people are like, I dunno, I
keep hugging but I'm still not coming.

141
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,430
And then they're like, he's
just, he's got to let it go more.

142
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:12,630
And then it's basically like speaking
in tongues in these, you know,

143
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,530
Pentecostal churches or it's like, how'd
that happen? And they're like, well,

144
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,410
that guy's kind of throwing
a little extra spice on that.

145
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,430
There's a little hot sauce on there
that you might not know about.

146
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:27,960
And it's called faking it. Schizophrenia.
Yeah. You got to buy in to the Koolaid,

147
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,060
you have to drink it all.
Get on board.

148
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,310
Especially when you start

149
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,660
to see everything can be

150
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,780
touching your body all over eating.

151
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,660
All I do is come on this woman all day,
every day.

152
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,660
Do you think they have small children
at home? These types? No. Look,

153
00:10:56,661 --> 00:11:01,180
I know these people have nothing
in their lives then hold them down.

154
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,440
You have so much free time. How much
free time to be able to engage in Tantra?

155
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,010
Nothing but time. Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,473
Ah,

157
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,740
but do you think he's really nutting
and his shorts? No, of course. Sure.

158
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,650
Is it a dry rub? Like the Rub
Rub guy? Well that's, that
is there. That would help.

159
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,510
But I don't think that's what's happening.

160
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,400
But he says you can have an orgasm inside
the rub rub. Well, I've got, yeah, he,

161
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,380
you can and I don't, I
don't doubt that, but

162
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,340
I don't doubt that. But Rob,

163
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,800
Rob,
rob,

164
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,860
you know what's the problem with
all this stuff is, you know what?

165
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,830
I am happy when people find happiness in,

166
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:56,410
in horse shit like this. Yeah. But if
they're paying money to go to a seminar,

167
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,430
100% and it's like a thousand dollars
a day to learn how to come hug. Yeah.

168
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,680
It's like,
oh fuck.

169
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,310
Don't stop taking advantage of these
poor souls who just need Jesus.

170
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,630
That's how they make their money.
Taking advantage of hate it.

171
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,600
It'd be great to come when I hug.

172
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,990
If only there were a seminar, I could
pay $1,000 I'm all alone when I come.

173
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,580
I could come in public on it.
I probably my day way better.

174
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,370
I mean honestly,
I was thinking about that too.

175
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,990
That would be great if I'd be like,
you mean I can just start giving hugs?

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,290
Towns are coming. Yeah, that'd be great.

177
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,310
But of course there's the part of my
brain that goes, oh, that's not happening.

178
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,700
You're not going to do
that. Of course. Well,

179
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,180
and also don't you
think it's really messy?

180
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,520
You could have come in your pants all day.
Oh yeah.

181
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,483
It's not.

182
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,180
That happens every time you hug,
you can out of your mom. Aww.

183
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,240
How your mom, your dad like
that. Okay. Okay. Well,

184
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:56,070
what if that's the gift is that you
can come hug, but it's everybody.

185
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,700
It's indiscriminate. Come hugging. So you
hug your mother. Hello. You're coming.

186
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:03,950
You're dad, you're coming. Now you
can also hug. You know Josh Potter.

187
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,180
You're retarded.
I'd rather be retarded.

188
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,880
I think his phrasing is just,
I go retarded. Get amazing.

189
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,580
I ride. Okay, but, but listen,

190
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,750
you like the feature of the come hug,
but it has to be indiscriminate.

191
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,210
That's a thing. That's a problem.
That's a real problem. Yeah.

192
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,390
It's why I'm going to keep not coming
when I hug because I do want it to be

193
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:37,950
descriptive. But you like the
come hug is what I'm saying.

194
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,880
I do like the concept of a comma,
right? Yeah. So would you rather

195
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,120
have the chem hug but it's indiscriminate?
Yeah. Whoever, whatever. Uh,

196
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,030
all my friends like,
come on Ryan. I come on.

197
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,360
Are you full charge Joe? Yeah. All of
them. How are we talking about hugging my,

198
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,170
come on. Yeah. You say hi
to alley the comedy store

199
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,100
or be retarded. I mean,
it's a real simple,

200
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,860
I go retarded.
I'd be retarded for sure.

201
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,840
What would you do?
Oh,

202
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,470
well a woman's orgasm is a little more
discreet and I won't have a load in my

203
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,540
pants. Yeah, but you'd have,

204
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,060
I don't see my role to do that
thing where people would be like,

205
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,880
what's you'd have to deal with? Every
time we go on, like, what's going on?

206
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,610
You have to be like,
can we second?

207
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,460
You have to finish coming as they go.
Like, oh no, your hands would go like,

208
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,540
all right, all right in the hands,
kind of back off of you. Then you go,

209
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,180
so, um, good to see you. And then
they're going to like, I dunno. Cause,

210
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,140
and everybody would feel
like they'd be like,

211
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,170
it's a little presumptuous to
think she just came in my arms,

212
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,620
but they would think wrong with you.
Right.

213
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,110
But I could lie and tell them that I'm
having seizures and it's induced by

214
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
touch. It's a touch seizure.
They won't, nobody will know.

215
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,880
Now here's the one problem, because
I don't seem family. Who Cares?

216
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:09,380
My Mom's dead on the, her hug her,
but hugging my son does the problem.

217
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,290
Oh yeah. That'll, that's a lifetime of
calm hugs with our boy. I can't do that.

218
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,370
That's not cool. That's true. That's
the one reason I choose retarded.

219
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,740
Just for that. Yeah. Otherwise I would
come hug. I don't care. God Damn.

220
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,020
I just want to hug people as much, I
guess. Yeah, I guess so, right? Yeah.

221
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,180
Hey, can you move my camera up a little?
Can I move your camera up a little?

222
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,020
I feel like my, the top of my heads
being cut off. Oh, it moved? Yeah,

223
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,930
I didn't do that. When does
that happen? I have no idea.

224
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,900
Yeah, right. Yeah. Cause my head
looks like it's being cut off.

225
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,750
It's odd. I didn't touch that camera and
maybe accidentally it was moved. Bumped.

226
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,040
Hello? Yeah, right. Yeah.

227
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,080
O and g

228
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,760
it doing good.
You done real good?

229
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,433
Uh

230
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,190
Oh yeah. Oh, it's way better.
God, that was weird. No,

231
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,070
O m g clue. Oh, that one.
I moved for that Steve Pro.

232
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:21,070
So make sure that that's
framed right. O n. G

233
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,010
no, that's about right. That's cool. Yeah.

234
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,170
Okay. I want to get your moose
suit. It's really weird, man.

235
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,630
I mean, unless I was was in here
and now we're back. Now we're here.

236
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,200
All right. You guys are doing good. Okay.

237
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,240
Aren't you glad?
I mean,

238
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:49,100
of all the stations in life to be
born into that, that that wasn't your,

239
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,280
your mom, you know. Oh my
God, that's such a crap shoot.

240
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,260
It's such a crapshoot who,

241
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,980
who you're born to and where
I want to think about that.

242
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:01,420
When I think about how blessed I am that
I was born in like I was in what was,

243
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,410
you know, close enough to
America. Yeah. It could have been,

244
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,090
it could have been fucking really nuts.

245
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,380
But you would also think that
that's normal for a long time. No,

246
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,160
I was reading something on the Internet
about people in Hong Kong who live in

247
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,270
coffin apartments. Have you seen this
shit? No. It's like, it's like, you know,

248
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,930
people that drive cabs are our security
guards and can't afford the cost of

249
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:24,370
living in Hong Kong.
Yeah.

250
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,500
They pay something like $300 a month
and they live in what are basically like

251
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:33,010
125 square feet. Coffins. It's terrible.

252
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,550
And their TV there, you know,
toilet, their kitchen sink,

253
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:39,310
everything is in one narrow
rectangle and they sleep in it.

254
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,700
They do everything so horrible. And
then you start thinking yourself. Yeah,

255
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:45,190
but why don't you just live
somewhere else? Why worry?

256
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,290
Why don't you move to not Hong Kong and
go live where there's more space and

257
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,270
cost of living's cheaper. Dude, people
just love those. You know what the,

258
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,210
that's the same thing that people do in a,

259
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,440
and I feel like in New York especially.
Yeah, that's true. It's just like they go,

260
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,400
I don't care. I will live.
I will pay to live here.

261
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,560
I don't care what's inside of this.
Yeah.

262
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,560
Well the hope being that
you'll improve your, you know,

263
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,700
your income level and you'll eventually
not have four roommates or the whole

264
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:16,680
thing for you is that the value is based
on living in, in that area. It is. Yeah.

265
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,950
Again, but you're, you're in
New York City. Well that's
true. Maybe in Hong Kong.

266
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,560
It's the same here. Like I'm going to
move on up like the fucking Jefferson.

267
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,810
So this is, um, from the description
on this video, by the way,

268
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:30,280
we were watching a study revealed that
one in three women have trouble reaching

269
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,870
orgasm during sex,

270
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,970
or the research reveal that eight out of
10 women fake it meet the lucky couple

271
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:41,860
who have an orgasm from hugging husband
and wife can orgasm through anything

272
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,480
from lovemaking, breathing, dancing to the
weather conditions. They're from Texas.

273
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,310
They have full body orgasms
that lasts as long as 18 hours.

274
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,930
They're so connected.

275
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,570
If one of them has an orgasm in
the same room without touching,

276
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:57,710
the other automatically does as well.
Okay.

277
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,480
And the married couple of eight years
believes that anyone can learn to do this

278
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:02,314
thing. Okay. All right.

279
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,230
Has there been scientific tests? So, no,

280
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,990
I live in like experiments verifying
these bands. I don't think so.

281
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:12,010
I think there's, this is a lot of
acting lice. Yeah. Lies acting.

282
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,930
It's just like the gays. Yeah. I
wish you and I were that connected.

283
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:21,580
Why don't we have no, I'm good. That's
too much connection. Todd. Todd Tra?

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Or is it Tantra?
Tantra.

285
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:28,480
Tantra is how much is it Taro
readings or Taro? Great question.

286
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,770
Well, I listened to these, you know,

287
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,410
nut bags on Hay House radio sometimes
and they have people that talk to angels

288
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:38,260
and people that talk to dogs and
stab pet psychics. I love it.

289
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,380
And sometimes they do say it that way.
They're like,

290
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,720
the Taro is calling your name $5
a minute and you're like, okay,

291
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,320
I know it's not true.
A,

292
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,900
by the way, born George [inaudible]
I have to say thank you Mel.

293
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,670
C Two Montreal.
I was in Montreal this week.

294
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,040
Did you have poutines I had a little
bite or two. Yeah, I should. It's delish.

295
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:05,060
Did you have a waffle? Like I told
you too, I did not have a waffle. Huh?

296
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,820
But I had, um, no, I had delicious food.
I had a great, great show at Olympia.

297
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,780
And then I also went to a Hampton Beach,

298
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,070
which the fun thing about a tour like
this where I've gone extensively touring

299
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:22,840
to so many places is hitting cities where
you're like, you have no expectations.

300
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,870
You have low expectations because you're
like, I've never even heard of this.

301
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,760
I was so confused by Hampton Beach,
New Hampshire. I thought I was going to

302
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,970
Hamptons. That's what I would have
thought. Yeah. All I know is not la.

303
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,830
I know.
That's what you think.

304
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,100
I still don't wear show was crazy there
then Wilmington Delaware had no, I know.

305
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,070
Or Delaware has no idea where the original
colonies didn't have a clue where it

306
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,130
was. I mean, I knew was
the northeast, that was all

307
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,850
I knew. Yeah, I've heard of it. And
then balls and whores, Maryland. Yeah.

308
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,420
Went fucking off man.
Just so you know, uh,

309
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,690
I mean if you were at that show in my
estimation for just as far as like fun and

310
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:06,460
reaction from the crowd, that had
to be a top five show on this tour.

311
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,830
That's awesome. And Ryan was there, sickle
cell went up there. He did his thing.

312
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,710
Josh Potter. Yeah. They, um,
that yet. They were great.

313
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,260
They were fantastic. But the crowd
was so fucking hyped, you know?

314
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:27,280
And that's honestly,
that's all comics are ever looking for.

315
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,310
Like when they get time, I loved it. And
you're like, why did you love that show?

316
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,790
Because the, the fucking show was great.
Yeah, because the crowd was great. Yeah.

317
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,420
They're on board. They get it. There's
no judgment. There's no, you know,

318
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,160
booing moment.

319
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,660
You know what it's like from the moment
you walk out, you know? Yeah. Yeah. If an,

320
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,690
if, if two seconds in you're like, Oh
God, this is going to be crazy. I know.

321
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,670
It was like that. So anyways, thank
God. What a blessing in the skies. Nice.

322
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,350
Yeah,
because sometimes like I don't,

323
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,340
I mean I can't look at this
tour and be like, that show was,

324
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,040
well actually there's a couple
of hours like oof. And I don't,

325
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,550
I feel like they didn't know how bad
I thought the show was, which is good.

326
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:08,210
You don't want to tell him
that this was terrible. Yeah.

327
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,050
But there was a couple where I was like,
Jesus,

328
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,150
but there's some that were
really fucking crazy. Yeah.

329
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:16,950
Like there was Montclair,
New Jersey.

330
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:20,360
I never thought I'd never heard of that
place. I didn't think that would I,

331
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,770
that was another one where I was like,
I've never even heard of this place.

332
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,480
And that is your jam jam in Seattle,
which I've heard of and I think it

333
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,620
towns, those shows were fucking
dare always jamming on the one.

334
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:34,790
They were pretty crazy. Always
jamming on the one I got really lucky.

335
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,240
Chicago always jamming
on the one. Yeah. Uh,

336
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,330
am I special taping that first cry was
fucking bananas. What a what a luck.

337
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,990
I'm watching because I'm editing
it all now and you're like big.

338
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:47,120
Those fuckers stood up the
minute I got out there.

339
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:50,090
Like they gave me a standing ovation.
Went just standing there. It was crazy.

340
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:54,290
It was so lucky. What if, what
a fortune fortuitous event,

341
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,800
if that's the right word. I don't know.
You know, it never goes down like that.

342
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,640
Stand up. You get a show like
that once every, that's what I'm,

343
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,650
that's what I'm saying, right? Like, and
when you have one of those at a taping.

344
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,870
Yeah. Like come on, you're
fucking like, oh my God.

345
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:08,790
Lightening in a mother
fucking tantric bottle. Yup.

346
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,760
You just want to keep getting coming

347
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,780
all you want to do it again and come man,

348
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,460
can I tell you what our toddler son
did today? Yeah. Quick rundown. Yeah.

349
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,750
So this morning,
uh,

350
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:25,250
you were running around doing stuff
and I was taking care of our son by

351
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:26,630
ourselves because our nanny,

352
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:31,010
our beloved amazed nanny's visiting
relatives in Guatemala. So we,

353
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,890
our nanny less. It's just
the two of us. Real people.

354
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,340
How can we survive? Oh, working
stiffs and uh, I mean, look,

355
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:45,020
we're up at the crack of six. Yeah, we're
at the playground. I'm chasing this kid.

356
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,260
He runs off into fields. We come home. Uh,

357
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,080
he's flipped over the dog water bowl.
There's water everywhere.

358
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:55,820
He sloshing around dog water hands. He
takes at any strips down. He's in his die,

359
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:58,710
die, rips his diet for off,
pisses in the playroom.

360
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,690
Just pisses on one of his toys like that
walker toy, like he's hiding behind it.

361
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,120
And then all of a sudden I see all
this water. I'm like, are you peeing?

362
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,400
And they did. And then he
does it again. Come back.

363
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:10,160
And they like 10 minutes later he's
like pulling down that died, died.

364
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,070
Pisses right on the tiles. Like he wants
to Piss into something, right? Yeah,

365
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:15,050
he does.
So I think that's what the sign is.

366
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,510
So I showed him the toilet and
I explained to him like, Hey,

367
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,180
you need to tell her
one more fucking time.

368
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,100
I will crack your fucking jaw if you
ever yeah. You do that or no? Yeah.

369
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,060
And your penis isn't dirty and
wrong. Yup. It's disgusting rule.

370
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,350
That's how I've heard to do it. You
telling me do this one more fucking time?

371
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:38,380
You're going to catch the back of my
hand. Yup. Yup. You know my Nana, uh,

372
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,291
in Hungary,

373
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:43,700
my Hungarian Nana used to
time my uncle to the toilet.

374
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,290
Like tie him with a rope to toilet,
train him. Do you think that's cool?

375
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,500
No.
He might have bathroom issues today.

376
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,950
She also dressed him up like a
girl until he was five. Yeah.

377
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,510
Yeah. I'm sure he's fine. They were
really good at child development.

378
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:05,020
It sounds like in the old world.
Yeah. Can, isn't that nuts. So that,

379
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,100
that's kind of what that is.
What they assume,

380
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:11,270
like you're born with an adult brain in
a baby body. Yeah. It doesn't make like,

381
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,010
how can they even assume that?

382
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,020
And I think that for the most part it
seems like every generation does way

383
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:21,470
better. Right then the last
one, well, theoretically, yeah,

384
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:26,471
but like our parents generation
there was good and bad in it,

385
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,060
but they're way better than
the generation. My Nana,

386
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,010
who's a total barbarian,
my dad said that

387
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,580
he had a pretty, like they had a good
relationship, you know, the parents,

388
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,680
but it was also like pretty formal.
Hmm. You know, it was like, you know,

389
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,040
he said like they would, if they would
show affection, but he would also,

390
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:48,460
I think he would say
like, yes sir. And um,

391
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,240
he said one time in college it
was, you know, there's senior week,

392
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,410
so seniors go to a beach
town, let's say, to,

393
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,210
to celebrate essentially that
they're going to graduate.

394
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,490
He wanted to go as junior year and
he said, I want to go to, I dunno,

395
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,030
whatever beach it was, Wilmington beach
to sell, you know, for senior week.

396
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,130
And His dad said,
I wish you wouldn't do that.

397
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,960
And that was the end of the company.

398
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,540
Big Fight, Huh? Well, he said
like argument. There was no
such thing as being like,

399
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:20,520
what the Fuck Dad? Of course it was
just understood that that means no, no.

400
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,700
That's how he just was like,
okay, you respect your elders.

401
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:25,590
Children should be seen and not heard,

402
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,120
which I mean the formality you see now
in top dog because his idea of lounge

403
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:34,200
wear his khakis on a Sunday
and loafers like he doesn't,

404
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,210
he has zero chill button. Yeah. Isn't
that wild? Yeah. That is chill for him.

405
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:43,440
He thinks that's super chill. Yeah.
Khakis, loafers, belt. What'd you wear?

406
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:45,840
Some comfortable button. Damn
comfortable. I am comfortable.

407
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,650
It blows me away every time when he's
over at the house on a Sunday and you're

408
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,670
like, dude, even at home at his own
house, he would wear that a button down,

409
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,030
tucked in Khakis and you're like,

410
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,180
why don't you want to wear sweat
pants or something? You know?

411
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,190
Like something real loud. I
like that. That's so weird.

412
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,960
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Like it. Our kiddos
on full tilt, but he was laughing.

413
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,980
That's what they're supposed to do,
right. They're supposed to be a little,

414
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,360
you know, naughty puppy. That's the point.
Yeah. He's having a blast. Yeah. He's,

415
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,360
he's doing when he's supposed to be
doing it just makes, makes a mess.

416
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:22,200
Our kitchen is a fucking

417
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,080
your mom's house park.
What's that? A fart.

418

old trusty hands time for some funnel

cake.
Yeah.

420
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,590
That's amazing. It's great.
It's good. That was so good.

421
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,560
Yeah. God, I really dazzled by that.

422
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,330

They're so big though.

428
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,370

437
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
They got moose suit and everything.
Okay,

438
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,560
good Stinger. Here's this one.
This one's one of my favorites.

439
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,740
Your mom's house podcast.

440
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,010
Do you mind sleeve you
wishing you were retarded

441
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,540
magic. That was good. Jake. Thanks
very much. Drink laser. Thank you Jake.

442
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,400
That was great. Oh, nice nose picking.
Jesus. Our Son has picked it out to, okay,

443
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,720
what am I supposed to do
that it's so aggressive, Ben.

444
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,410
There's a lot of stuff on there.
I got to get it out.

445
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,420
You know how you enjoy your body functions
like you're the only person I know

446
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,620
that's like, oh don't you love a
good sneeze? Like, no, not really.

447
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,590
Like you really relish your
body functions like, oh,

448
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:43,870
I just took the best p or I just like
the biggest shit or I just, I don't,

449
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,620
the only thing I really, excuse
me, like I like taking a dump,

450
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,870
but that's more about relieving discomfort
for me. I don't really enjoy it. Yeah.

451
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,080
But I like picking my nose. Like
that's my one thing and I'm like, oh,

452
00:29:56,081 --> 00:30:00,550
I love everybody picks. You know
everybody picks. They do. Everybody picks.

453
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,660
Yeah, I think so. I think everyone's
lying that says that they're not,

454
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,750
who doesn't pick their nose at some
point they might do it discretely.

455
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:11,700
They might do it really privately, but no
one doesn't clean their nose out. Yeah,

456
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,360
half deal. You have to of course. Yeah.
You're a little more of a savage about it.

457
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,470
I am. You know, at one
point my stepsister,

458
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,540
we were driving around and she was like,

459
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:25,220
stop picking your nose when we
were like 17 she's like, she goes,

460
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,360
this is too much, too much picking.
I'm like, I can't stop it. I know you.

461
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,630
I've seen you at the times where I'm
like, fuck man, that's, that's a lot.

462
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,720
I know it is, but I
enjoy myself. Welcome to

463
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,830
mom's house podcast.

464
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,890
Your favorite place to see Tom Segura
laugh at a man getting his legs crossed by

465
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,580
a moving vehicle.

466
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,890
Speaking of that, there's a this,
have you seen this one? This came in.

467
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,300
This is a video someone submitted.

468
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,883
Oh,

469
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,813
hi.

470
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,180
Did you call from the hospital?

471
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,113
Yeah.

472
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,370
I don't know, but she's screaming
really loud at the beginning.

473
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:20,460
She's in a hospital again on a moped with,

474
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,560
I don't know if that's a
neck brace on or something.

475
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,203
Oh,

476
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,450
Groucho phase

477
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:33,963
Facebook.

478
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,340
They're being

479
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,173
so nice to her

480
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,133
that Amy severe.

481
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,800
My Dad

482
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,383
does.

483
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,310
She screams as she does.
Not sound like Amy said.

484
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:11,740
Doris does like a character she would
do, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing.

485
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:13,240
The world is so fucked up,
man.

486
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,330
No,
I'm telling you,

487
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,080
and I know this because now that I go to
the playground and I see other parents

488
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,960
with their kids, then you go, oh,
that's why you chase is everything.

489
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:28,920
You guys are fucking idiots and you're
raising idiots and there's more fucking

490
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,020
idiots and everybody's all worried about,

491
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,440
you know which kindergarten you send
your kid to and which preschool to get a

492
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:38,070
leg up. It doesn't matter because
most of people are are retards. Yeah.

493
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,010
Most of the world is full of idiots.
There's a

494
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,670
lot of stuff gets out there. Yeah. Would,
if you're a decent human, you're above.

495
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,200
You don't need to send them to a fucking

496
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,640
Montessori school.

497
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,350
So do you find it funny when she's
screaming like that or no, I'm more,

498
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,240
it makes me sad for humanity.
Like I don't, I don't,

499
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,520
I get real bummed out when she's
screaming like that. Yes. Why?

500
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,930
Because she should know better.

501
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:04,450
Like I get upset with humanity
because you shouldn't have,

502
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,000
she shouldn't be on her
mo. Yeah. Clearly. Clearly

503
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,093
hospitals.

504
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,700
But I like her screen really.
It was pretty fun. Yeah, it
is pretty funny. Yeah. No,

505
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:19,390
I like it. Yeah. Ah, yeah. That's great.

506
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,350
I'm really got a bad dates.

507
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,033
Gotcha.

508
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,950
That's a good scream. We're
damned. That's a good screen.

509
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,843
Okay.

510
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,860
And you know, she's just doing it for
attention. You think so? Yeah. I mean,

511
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,010
yeah.
Um,

512
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,310
here's the email we got. Can
you spit on tp? Is it okay to,

513
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,260
to spit on toilet paper
then wipe your be whole? No,

514
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,530
I am in the Denver airport bathroom
waiting for your response. Are you,

515
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,330
are you still there now wait,
waiting. Uh, I'm 100% yes on that.

516
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,560
I thousand percent. No, on, in a public
setting. I mean, obviously not at home,

517
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,300
but here's a simple workaround.
I mean,

518
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:09,020
it's just kind of grody to spit and
then wipe your ass with your own spit.

519
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,250
It's just, it's gross.
But I'm saying it's a,

520
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:17,050
if you're sitting in a public bathroom
where you don't have a sink near you,

521
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,010
you don't have a beverage with you.
Oh,

522
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,850
well here's what I'm telling you is that
bring in you've, you've mentioned this,

523
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,780
yeah. Bring the water bottle
in. Well, I'm, I'm saying,
I'm saying you don't have it.

524
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:31,310
Like you just didn't have it. Yeah.
And you're feeling dirty. No. Yeah.

525
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:34,140
You need something to clean
up, man. I'm 100% fine.

526
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,090
I would rather dry rub it a
thousand times, then spit.

527
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,140
It's just why I'm just opposed to spitting
and toilet paper and rubbing it on my

528
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:46,790
ass hole. I just, I would rather dry
rub it and you know, I, I so gross.

529
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,390
You can loosen some of that
dry mess up man with the,

530
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:54,830
with the spirit and on your own
spit it. I just, I don't know.

531
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:59,510
Sure if I've done it many times. I
didn't, I didn't, you know, nasty.

532
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,930
I started doing it a year or two ago
because your dad taught you though.

533
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,730
It was my, uh, uh,

534
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,050
brother-in-law one of the mentioned
that and I was like, oh, gross.

535
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,170
And then I was like, oh yeah, that
makes a lot of sense. Started doing it.

536
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,160
It's really so thankful for her
husband fucking, Hey Hitler's,

537
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,460
I just listened to four oh six decided
to pull him high and tight and drop a

538
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:22,550
note. I've been married to
my first cousin for 23 years.

539
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:27,290
We have three normal offspring with
all the normal bits and pieces.

540
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,740
I wouldn't date my mom, but I would
marry my mom's sister's daughter.

541
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,020
Just like the gays.
Before breeding,

542
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:37,320
we had all the testing done to make
sure we weren't going to have any tards.

543
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,230
All the families supported us.

544
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:43,110
I can't imagine sharing
my trip with anybody else.

545
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:47,070
Thanks for making an unbearable job.
Slightly less unbearable.

546
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,990
Mouth kisses all around. Jason, I told
you cousin fucking is. It's genetically.

547
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,600
No, it's no. That is incorrect.

548
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,860
Does that sound correct? You got to move
it to the, can I move it? It's going on.

549
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,910
It's just not working. Maybe it's a moving
because look, I'm out of frame again.

550
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,280
Isn't that weird? Oh my. Oh Em gee,

551
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,490
let's hop on lane. Not the, Oh,

552
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:18,870
it's trying to focus or it's,
it's, oh, oh my gosh. No,

553
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:22,860
I zoomed out right.
I think when we play clips,

554
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,810
it's trying to focus on this or something.
It's just not as,

555
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,620
oh my gosh.
Oh mg.

556
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,060
Sorry about that. Back to
cousin. Fucking completely wrong.

557
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:40,020
When you say it's okay.

558
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,780
He's telling me he has children
that are genetically fine.

559
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:47,760
You've got all the testing done because
like most people don't have to have all

560
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,960
the testing when before they
decided to start breeding. Sure.

561
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,400
So he's at a much higher risk for having
those genetic abnormalities and I would

562
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,600
say this guy is in the smallest
percentage of people who go,

563
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,020
we should do that before we reproduce
when they are first cousins. Okay.

564
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,920
It definitely causes abnormalities.

565
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,170
Oh yeah. I mean I don't know. I
don't know. I heard somewhere,

566
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,970
especially in relation to royal
marriages that they are married cousins

567
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:19,930
frequently in royal families,
like way back in the days they do.

568
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:20,890
What I'm saying is that,

569
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,980
but they don't have a lot of
tardies in in a the royal fam.

570
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,870
They have more genetic issues,

571
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:31,871
health problems than those who do not
reproduce within the same genetic family.

572
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,930
But it's not, it's not a for sure tar
towel. It's not for sure toward town,

573
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,920
but it's also not,

574
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:41,921
it's your higher probability for having
some type of health problems like dog

575
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:45,190
breeding. Of course. You
want to vary the genetic

576
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,380
pull. I, I clearly I understand that,

577
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,860
but I'm saying it's not necessarily a
tar town sentence. You're not necessarily

578
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,420
insulatard town.
And,

579
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,990
and what this guy had mentioned that they
had testing done beforehand I think is

580
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,100
probably really smart.

581
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah. It is smart, quick deal,
cousins look, call me, whatever.

582
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,350
I don't think marrying your
cousins that big of a deal.

583
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,130
I don't think it's that. I don't think
it's that sacrilege. The cousin, I didn't,

584
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:16,240
I don't have you think, I mean, I
wouldn't fuck my female cousins,

585
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:21,370
so I'm opposed to marrying and having
sex with any of my first cousins.

586
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,170
Um, like that one was
hot. Yeah. It doesn't,

587
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:31,430
it doesn't register on the thing
to me at all as a possibility,

588
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,050
but I know that it's also a very, very
common in a lot of cultures. So yes.

589
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,630
I'm just saying that I think,

590
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,300
I think more people should be
doing what he's doing and get,

591
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,410
I'm getting more tests again to make sure
it's our town isn't inevitable. Yeah.

592
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,750
Um, kick twins. Oh, sorry. I don't know
if you wanted to see this one. Okay. Yeah,

593
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,450
I was listening to

594
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,090
latest podcast with

595
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,510
no, she didn't say what that
Burp was so feeble. It was like,

596
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,930
why do it into the mic if you're
not even going to follow up?

597
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,050
It was week. I'll give you
the, oh, why would you do that?

598
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,850
I want to send some says a light on
this topic of identical twins having

599
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:10,430
identical penises.
I am a twin.

600
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,440
I can tell you that my brother and I
do in fact have different size penis on

601
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:18,620
vacation and my brother had too much to
drink and passed out on the couch in his

602
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:19,454
underwear.

603
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,060
My ex girlfriend who was on vacation
with us went into the living room and was

604
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:28,050
straight glass and at his apple bag
later on when I discussed it with her,

605
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:33,410
she described my brother's situation as
a large head shorter shaft hanging above

606
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,090
two coconuts.
However,

607
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:41,150
my setup is a normal head average
shaft and two regular size balls.

608
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:47,240
I hope this information helps you with
your debate next time and you're in,

609
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:51,960
you're in New York. Come by for
some moose soup. Sincerely, Mike,

610
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,830
Tom, and is the personality champs. Sorry.

611
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,063
No,

612
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,050
it's fine. Oh, it's already

613
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,000
happening. I don't know. It's the
camera or just wants to get close to me.

614
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:17,290
I'm so beautiful today, but this is crazy,
right? Yeah. We're not that blue band.

615
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:22,000
Fix it. Fucking hey man, wait. So
these twins are identical, correct?

616
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,810
Not, oh my OMG not fraternal. Right.

617
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,180
So they're dicks. Now here's my, my
question with this Dick Detection.

618
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
Dibs.
Go ahead.

619
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,440
Is,
uh,

620
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,160
he's talking about a flacid
drunk penis versus an erect,

621
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,040
you know, and I understand the, the
head of the penis, that's a big,

622
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,460
that is a difference and
aesthetic thing, you know? Yeah.

623
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,290
But I wonder if the size one when erect.

624
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:54,050
Well, this guy, um, we did, he didn't,
he said they don't have, you know,

625
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,660
when the question being at the
twins have identical penises,

626
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,360
he didn't say whether they were
fraternal or identical twins.

627
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,880
See, that's what I need. I need
identical twins. And I'm, I'm looking at,

628
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,280
cause I asked, I asked fraternal
twin Ryan sickler different penises.

629
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,230
Okay. He's a twin. [inaudible] different,
but we haven't asked identical twins yet.

630
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,540
I really love the scientific leanings.
Our show is taken lately.

631
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,720
I know it's pretty crazy,
right? How to blind people. Why

632
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,090
it's really, we're really
doing a lot of great work, man.

633
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,120
I don't know a lot of great work.
Um,

634
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,370
wait, can I share with you my
thought? Of course. So I, I, uh,

635
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,550
I found Chaz Bono on Twitter the other
day and I was looking at his whatever

636
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:44,360
feed and I noticed that like,
he's fully transitioned now.

637
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:48,680
I think he has a penis. Like he's fully,
fully, he's on board and he's on the team.

638
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,210
Yeah. I gotta tell Ya. And I mean
this, I'm not being a shithead. Yeah.

639
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,000
I think he's fucking hot,
really. I, you know what I mean?

640
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:59,030
Where did you see this image?
Just Google, Google image.

641
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:03,770
Chaz Bono 2017. Okay. Wait, is
it cha cha's that's his name now.

642
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,850
And I gotta tell you that, uh, you
know me, I like bears are like, um,

643
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,200
I like to big guys stocky and he looks,

644
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,820
I think he's hot. I think he did a
great job. Whoever did whatever work,

645
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,870
he looks great. Him. Yeah, he looks great.

646
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,810
I know. I like, no, that's too, I like
him with facial hair. Yeah. See there.

647
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,010
He's cute. Yeah. Well he's got
a good face. Looks good man.

648
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,250
And a lot of times when women see this,
like he's cute.

649
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,620
When women transition,

650
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,660
they don't always look masculine
enough. Yeah. But he's lucky.

651
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:44,930
I think the weight actually makes him
look more. Oh, I like that picture.

652
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:49,550
That was cute. Yeah. See he's cute.
Yeah. It looks like a regular dude. Yeah,

653
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,790
it looks really good.
It's just face is really good for a man.

654
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,820
This transition is like quite impressive
action. Oh my gosh. I mean, you know,

655
00:42:56,821 --> 00:43:01,680
they're always like, you're always, or
at least, you know, generally speaking,

656
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,970
um, it's usually about women. They're
like, that looks like, oh my God,

657
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:08,220
she can fool you, right? Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,870
You don't really see that as much with
the other way. Like when a woman training,

659
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,581
that's what I'm saying.

660
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:17,500
It's so hard for us to get
bulkier to get to look masculine,

661
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,830
but his features are really,
really,

662
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,120
yeah. There's no way if you ran
into this dude, you'd be like, Hey,

663
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,500
were you a woman before?
You would never think.

664
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,910
And the weight helps, I
think. Yeah. Fela Mau and,

665
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,440
oh see there's a picture
of him with his shirt off,

666
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:37,020
like sitting in shorts and
stuff. Yeah. It looks great.

667
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,180
Or that you would never know
that that was a woman dude.

668
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:43,240
He looks fantastic than it used
to be. A woman. Sorry. Yes. Yeah.

669
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,380
That's what that he was a woman before.
I mean, yeah, it looks great. It's true.

670
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,790
True. So anyway, I just had
already changed. I don't
understand what's going on.

671
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,470
Know what's happened.

672
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,210
Okay. Um, I gotta tell you this because
normally we don't do this. Okay.

673
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:01,130
Normally when, when we have, um,

674
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,560
like a sh a shirt launch, uh,
we've had a few in recent weeks,

675
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,780
completely normal came back to Netflix.
So we did,

676
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,810
we re leased a new version of sub cane
as like a celebration where I partnered

677
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:22,580
with dos Brac, I think, I don't know
how to say his name right on, um, on,

678
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,730
on Instagram. He's a
great artist. And then I,

679
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,120
we did Moose suit cause it was so timely,

680
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,750
but then we got this unbelievable
submission for a shirt design.

681
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,490
And I have to uh,
make sure I,

682
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,950
I say correctly the credit for it.

683
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,530
So this shirt design was so
funny that I was like, yeah, we,

684
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,810
we absolutely have to, to
do that. And the guy's name,

685
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:56,310
here we go is a Mark Glass.

686
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,290
So He's, he's totally glass and
mark last, um, he has, let's see,

687
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:05,820
designed by humans.com he did rob,
rob,

688
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,780
rob, the rub, rub, rub shirt.

689
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:11,760
I've seen,

690
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,230
I laughed so hard at this
design that I was like,

691
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:19,230
we were just going to put it up.
So it's up there.

692
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,990
If you go to merchant method.com

693
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,810
are you serious? We made this shirt.
Yeah. Immediately. Oh my God. Yeah.

694
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:32,800
And how would you describe it? I'd
prefer not to come on. No, you go ahead.

695
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,300
Well, it says, it says,
of course, the great

696
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,960
phrase. I'm rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, rob, rob,

697
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,340
and then as my face and it looks like
my eyes are struggling to stay open

698
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,610
because I'm in ecstasy. And, uh,

699
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,740
it looks like something
is dripping off of,

700
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,780
of the face there. Yeah, that's good.

701
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,210
Hey, it's your call. I mean
if you want the shirt around,

702
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,450
of course I wandered around. Come dripping
from your beard. Be My guess babe.

703
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,180
That's what it is. More appreciative.
I am. I think it's really neat.

704
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:18,770
Thank you mark.

705
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,140
Thanks mark. I just wanted to give you
a shout out to the size of our sun,

706
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,510
babe.
You got a kid wants to wear that

707
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,470
rob. Rob, can I tell you
something else had happened? Um,

708
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,040
we actually had the rub rub
guy cut together with Kim in

709
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,530
great [inaudible] man
for a little audio fun.

710
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,060
Do you want to hear what the two of them?
Something like that.

711
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,970
Uh, Kim Man, of course if you don't
know is uh, one of the great um,

712
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,490
performers of all time

713
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,620
and she and the Rub Rub guy,
uh,

714
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,830
are both Asian and we decided
they're both sexual people.

715
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,610
What would happen if we threw
them together whenever we do what?

716
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,660
Go ahead. I was going to say
that we've been working on that.

717
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:12,020
Blue bands been working on this,
cause we had the idea a few weeks ago,

718
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:13,700
you and I were sitting
down and we thought,

719
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,750
wouldn't it be a power couple if you will?
The two of them,

720
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,670
two of them are perfect. Yeah.
Yeah. Two, two of the great.

721
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,600
This is like what it would be like if
the two of them met and did some work

722
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:26,120
together. It's a blue
band. Put this together.

723
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,010
We do the scene.
Always fuck

724
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,690
hard on way ancient sex.

725
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,760
And you get the oil in the head
and Europe, ruff, ruff, ruff,

726
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,780
ruff.

727
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,780
And what you need to do is
be mindful about your spine,

728
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,660
especially in the vagina,

729
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,730
especially on the wrap them.

730
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,940
You need to stop judgment
from right or wrong.

731
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,870
The time, once, one side,

732
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,800
50 times left side phone,

733
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,630
50 time that people come down.
This cop,

734
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,140
my tight Asian Pussy.

735
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,633
Mm,

736
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:33,070
there you go. That was beautiful. It
was really good. Better than I expected.

737
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,170
So that's a great man.
Waiting for that

738
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,020
really special. What's his
name? Um, I looked it up. It's,

739
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:47,050
uh, it's not Kyle. I'll tell
you that. It's different.

740
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:54,430
I forgot. I forgot. I don't want to
look it up again, but it's, it's,

741
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:59,350
it's a good name, special name. Um, then,

742
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:04,120
uh, somebody put this, this
is you. I guess this is,

743
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:04,954
you

744
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,280
could press pause right now.

745
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,370
I want to take care of something for that
little jeans. Okay. I'll be right back.

746
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,600
All right, hold on. Turn up
the thermostat. Um, yeah.

747
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:19,900
So you did that.
I change the setting on this.

748
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,100
I don't know who does autos. Zoom.
Why that's even an option. Hey,

749
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:26,470
could you set this thing to
zoom whenever it feels like it,

750
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,620
it was this video of you,
um,

751
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,620
I guess you did this while you
were driving or something. Okay.

752
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:36,583
I see.

753
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,221
At the end of the day,

754
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:48,570
I'm still going to go home to my
Nigga fuck him and get my pussy ate.

755
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,520
Wow. Wow. Big words. Hmm. That's, um,

756
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,160
if you're just listening as
most of the audience does,

757
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:03,550
that's a white lady who was
real comfortable throwing
things around. That's,

758
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,520
those are big words.
Real big.

759
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,760
Oh,
fuck bitch.

760
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,940
Why would you tell somebody
you don't know this?

761
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,790
Real sad and obviously you pissy,

762
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,650
I'm not ugly bitch in my head go down

763
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:27,810
in her defense and I hear
is just a theory. Uh,

764
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,930
she could be a mixed, you know what
I mean? Like she could be okay.

765
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,610
I'm just trying,
I'm just trying to help her out.

766
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,043
Yeah.

767
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,060
There are black people that are really
super light. Oh No, you're totally right.

768
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,580
100% right. She's not,
yeah. Well Hey. Yeah.

769
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,350
But I mean she's putting it out
there and Caribbean, you know,

770
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:54,940
she's got those nice eyes. Pretty eyes
like Rihanna is kind of light skinned.

771
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:00,390
Yeah. This is, this is quite a few shades
lighter. Okay. This is, uh, I dunno.

772
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:05,020
I would say she's Kinda like me. Well, no,

773
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:09,360
she's not like a blonde blue. I
know, I know, but I'll just stop

774
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,810
Sanjay and I don't see nasty bitch ass.

775
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,070
I forgot her name. You ever heard of
it anyway, but I still can't find you.

776
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:23,570
I'm way know everybody that was talking
shit to comment. The black bitches,

777
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:28,460
white bitches. Niggas don't
know them. I'm still waiting.

778
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,250
No. Where do you think, uh, what do you
think she's from? South Atlanta. Yeah,

779
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,410
it's the south, but now is
Atlanta, not the deep south.

780
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:41,170
We're talking like Atlanta south.
What'd he call? Okay. What I'm saying?

781
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,870
Cause like when you're Alabama's
different accent than like Atlanta.

782
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:50,310
That's what I'm saying. Are you thinking
from Bama or something negative?

783
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:52,590
I'm saying she's from Atlanta.
Oh,

784
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,330
see I think she's from a
smaller populated area. Oh.

785
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,820
My guess would be that she's maybe,

786
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,490
maybe she's in the outskirts of like
Norfolk or something. Yeah. Okay.

787
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,360
Oh Hey, that's another one. Yeah.
Yeah, because Virginia is super weird.

788
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,570
Yeah. That's a real
weird next. Yeah. Yeah.

789
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,970
But like she doesn't live in Norfolk
like she lives trysting theory 30 minutes

790
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:20,720
from it and yeah.
You know,

791
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,240
there's some country has shit
going on where she lives for sure.

792
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,360
Now she's responding to the haters
in her comment feed. Is that,

793
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,900
I think she must have like
posted something. I mean,
I'm sure there's a more,

794
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,150
this girl was upset on Facebook.

795
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,240
She's not afraid to use big words and
all we got on it, but interesting. Yeah.

796
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,160
I don't care what race you are, Babe.
I'm not racist. Bitch got me fucked up.

797
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,660
But it's just the back bitches that's out.
So that's why I said black bitches.

798
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,890
Is She driving? Yeah. I always
wonder how people do that. Yeah.

799
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,390
Cause I think to get out that much
anger while you're driving is not even,

800
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,930
it's not good for your driving.
I wish you would pull over.

801
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,943
Yeah.

802
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:13,920
I think it's weird.

803
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,990
Maybe it's different to brag about how
good you are at writing Dick. Well,

804
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:22,200
you know, as Margaret Thatcher said, if
you have to tell people you're a lady,

805
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,710
right.
It's the talkers that Eh,

806
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,190
it's always the quiet
ones that are doing shit.

807
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,630
You got to top dog face
while I'm thinking about how,

808
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:36,930
I bet she's just really aggressive.
Like I could,

809
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,920
I could see her busting like
breaking. You're Dong Open. Yeah.

810
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:45,420
I think she probably miss mistakes
and through Z. Asm for good.

811
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:50,290
For good. Yeah. There's a lot
of enthusiasm there. A lot
of anger, energy, you know,

812
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,600
it's not the same negative.
It's not the same as as doing good.

813
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:59,010
You guys are doing good. Yeah.
It's different in iron. Okay,

814
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,063
motherfucker

815
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,610
ain't got no career then
now I'm taking care of Yaki.

816
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,840
Well we should put the phone down.

817
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:22,130
Nigga would say Nigga too.

818
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,890
I Dunno. I think there's some people, you
know what I'm curious of. Go ahead. Um,

819
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,270
how many,
uh,

820
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:33,330
black people would prefer somebody
to be this open with their big words?

821
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,200
Right. You know what I mean?
Like I remember one time, um,

822
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:42,040
it was a Clayton Peter's Russell Peters
brother told me when he had a corporate

823
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:46,690
job, he worked with a guy that he
knew was racist, but the guy, he goes,

824
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:50,610
he was open about it and that's what I
respected about him, that he liked ladies.

825
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,920
I do think she's probably right
and that she's probably not racist.

826
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,870
I definitely don't think she actually,

827
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,160
I think she's somebody who
thinks that she has a hall pass.

828
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,810
She thinks she has a hall pass because
she's got black inner meaning it black by

829
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:08,620
injection. So she's thinking like,
well do to have sex with a black guy.

830
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:13,120
Like I clearly am down. Most of her
friends are probably below culturally,

831
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,510
you know, she does obviously
spend time in that community.

832
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,300
There's a certain level of
comfortability with that.

833
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,840
I wonder if like if most people are cool,
I think she's cool or,

834
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,630
or if people are like, no, I
don't prefer that you do this.

835
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,340
I don't know. I can only speculate, but I,

836
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:35,680
I can't imagine that anybody would be
like, that's okay. You can say that.

837
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:38,500
I think some people would. Yeah,
it wouldn't be a boy. I know.

838
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,260
That's what I'm talking about.
It's not a blanket vote.

839
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:46,380
I think it wouldn't be 100% I just wonder
if it's 90% or whether it's more 50 50

840
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,010
that's what you're taking.
Unofficial poll. Yeah, sure.

841
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,200
I would love to take on official bowl.

842
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:58,590
If you're black and you're listening to
this and post on the Facebook page or

843
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,750
send an email to your mom's
podcast@gmail.com it's not
your mom's house podcast.

844
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:09,340
It's your mom's podcast and let us
know if you go, actually, I don't mind.

845
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,560
The thing is,
this is fine.

846
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,770
As long as you're hanging out with a
lot of black people having sex with him,

847
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,460
I guess it's okay. Well she, I mean,

848
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,960
I'm sure the guys that have sexual
her all the time, we're probably like,

849
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:24,840
this is fine. That's me. That's
point of view. All right.

850
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,160
Anybody that would willing to,
like if you were like,

851
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:29,770
I'm going to call you names or whatever,
I'd be like, okay, well here's the,

852
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,040
here's a story. So you know,
I talk about this in my,

853
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,940
my hour that's going to come out soon
as having an Indian stuff family.

854
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:39,550
I had an Indian Stepdad and
three Indian step sisters.

855
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:44,440
We were very politically incorrect
round the house. Oh. It was a joke.

856
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:47,590
Like we'd call him, my mother would
call him a towel head and why don't you,

857
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,630
why don't you put fucking
laundry on your head?

858
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,740
And then he would call her Goulash
tits or whatever lake and there's,

859
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,490
it was just silliness. But
see, like that's, you know,

860
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:00,610
that's still different from this though,
because that to me is affection.

861
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:05,611
Like all my friends that are of any
marginalized group or ethnic group that

862
00:57:08,111 --> 00:57:12,100
aren't white. I, if I really care
for it, if I really liked him,

863
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,230
I would tease them. I have my whole
life. Yeah. About whatever it is.

864
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,380
Right? Yeah. But that to me is like
you're showing that's like a way,

865
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,310
a sign of affection for gun.
Well,

866
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,720
it's also an old school way of showing
affection. Like this is different.

867
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,610
Like was so, so loaded. It's
such a, it's such a harsh,

868
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,600
I mean like to,
I have black friends that I say,

869
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:43,030
um, you know, inappropriate things too,
but I don't drop and bombs on them.

870
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,880
Um, I have a, I mean,
you know, like Ari, I,

871
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:53,560
I would buy would feel weird not saying
something to you about his Jewish. Yeah.

872
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,120
But that's like, because I like if I
didn't like him, I would never say, okay,

873
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:02,860
so let's, well, let's do this conversation
because I did have an word in my act,

874
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,880
uh, prior, not that I'm saying
it, I say as Dick Clark,

875
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,300
assuming that he was a racist
piece of shit. So now I did that.

876
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:14,470
I've done that bit in front of Black
Comedians for a while now and I've gotten

877
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:15,011
an,
you know,

878
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:20,011
and people that were pretty close with
and I've never gotten anything negative

879
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:21,520
feedback and they'll fucking tell you.

880
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,100
I feel like I'm close enough
to people that they'll be like,

881
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:28,500
that's really fucked up.
Anyway, I guess it's context,

882
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:30,190
dude contract.
It's an interesting,

883
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:34,180
it's an interesting cultural debates is
more like the Rachel Dole is all thing.

884
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,450
She's where she's like,
I can say whatever I want.

885
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,160
Not that that's wrong because that
lady didn't say that. That I'm,

886
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:43,660
what I'm saying is that, that
that lady was like, I'm black.

887
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,620
She's clearly a white lady. She's
like, yeah, but I identify as black,

888
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,330
which is crazy.
But I think that this,

889
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,950
this person right now basically thinks,

890
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,690
I mean without saying it,
I think she thinks that she's in the club.

891
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,430
It's called cultural appropriation
happening a lot here. Yeah,

892
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:04,420
of course.
Yeah.

893
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,010
No,
no bitch.

894
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,860
Bitch thinks she can beat my ass.

895
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:15,260
I will wait on it cause I would stay if
they Nigga to anybody. That's up to me.

896
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:20,100
Whether you white, black, Mexican,
he don't care. I don't care. Black,

897
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,980
white,
Chinese or candy.

898
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,430
Stripe. I don't give a fuck.
Yeah. I don't know man.

899
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,330
She has that thing where she goes,
I don't care.

900
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,283
Rick Ross,

901
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:38,290
my mom and Laura, my
sister, my sister does.

902
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,370
Sweet southern. Yeah. She's
Super Sad. Yeah, it does

903
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:47,350
get spoke. Her name. Monica hot. You
want to look up? Yeah, it sounds good.

904
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:50,390
I know bitch trying to play me. I
don't care. What color do we use?

905
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:54,820
Yeah. Yeah. Different strokes. Same,
same strokes for everybody. Yeah,

906
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,970
that's fine. Cause I white bitch
spoke up to Galle is cheese.

907
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:00,580
Yeah.

908
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:05,230
I never had a child but that's
why boot you found the right one.

909
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,880
She's really, I mean if she's
auditioning and she's got the part, yeah,

910
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,930
I'd be like, yeah, your dad, you did it
right. Did that. He definitely got it.

911
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,131
Well she feels,

912
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:17,420
I mean that's the question too with
Rachel Doughlas all in with this kind of,

913
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:22,580
with this girl. It's like what does it
mean? Like, if you feel a certain culture,

914
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,151
you know,

915
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:26,960
you feel like that's your culture and
you're raised in that environment.

916
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:31,490
Like who's to say, you know, I don't
fucking know. I don't know. I don't know.

917
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,420
I feel like she's bought a lot of guys
sneakers at the mall for them before,

918
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:39,830
but I dunno. Is that all it takes
to win a man's heart? I mean,

919
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:44,540
so snakes, I think she's,
she knows exactly. He's like
everyone's one 13. Yeah,

920
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:49,370
I got you. I got you. Okay. I
got you. I think I do blue, blue.

921
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:54,110
Wow. Yeah, she's um, she's
something I'm trying to think of.

922
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,270
Well, yeah, I dunno dude, whatever.

923
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,380
Thank [inaudible] everybody.

924
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,990
I'm going to ball Sacramento,
California punchline.

925
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,880
I think the, uh, the two
early shows are sold out.

926
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,360
I think there might be tickets left to
the late show August 12th and maybe,

927
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,480
maybe August 11th to,
um, check it out. Tom.

928

skirt.com/tour Thompson grow.com/tour.

929
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,620
And what else? Uh, if you go to my,

930
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:37,710
that same page I am hearing up to shoot
a special September 6th in Denver.

931
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,740
They released an extra couple of hundred
tickets that were withheld because of

932
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:49,330
the shooting. So the early show has
less than a hundred tickets left.

933
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,470
That's September 16th late
show has maybe a few more,

934
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:56,170
but they're going to be gone sooner.

01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,720
Thanks Ross. Dude, this is blood Danza

962
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,300
last week I talk about Bukowski's.
Don't try,

963
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:50,250
if you ever heard of that
on his tombstone is written.

964
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:54,390
Don't try to talk about that quote,
man. Isn't that the funniest thing ever?

965
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,240
I really, it's very meaningful. So
I get deep on that. That's great.

966
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:02,550
I really liked that. Hmm. Hmm.

967
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,660
Hmm. Oh, okay.

968
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,243
Okay.

969
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:09,663
Fucking

970
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,750
she gas it. Fucking sheep.

971
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,860
He's fired up though. Ah, speaking of UK.

972
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,480
So last week we were
talking about why on earth,

973
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:31,630
why on earth would a man choose to be a
gynecologist and how it was interesting

974
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:34,040
fucking weird.
That is.

975
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:38,990
And you've clearly got to be a pervert
of some sort and women, uh, Dick Doctors.

976
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,300
Yeah. Well I can't, we
can't speak on that, but,

977
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,680
so this gent gentlemen
in from the UK and um,

978
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,590
okay, so he says he works with a
number of male consultant gynecologist.

979
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,450
They vastly outweigh the women,

980
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,920
which is definitely an unusual seeing
as medical school is roughly 60,

981
01:04:57,921 --> 01:05:01,490
40 women to men. So anyways,
he thinks the big attraction,

982
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,930
why men choose gynecology. Uh, he writes,

983
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,650
you're able to separate
yourself from what you see.

984
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:13,130
So although the issue around
sex is definitely there,

985
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,590
that is a relatively small price to pay
to know that nothing you see can happen

986
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:22,090
to you. And also not having a frame of
reference on how it would actually feel,

987
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,390
which is good. So meaning if it's
a total train wreck down there,

988
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,240
you can look at it impartially
as an outsider and go,

989
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:32,330
well I guess I'd better stitch this back
on and get on with it instead of like,

990
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,610
if you're looking at a dick, it's like
cut. You're, you're too empathetic almost.

991
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:39,310
Yeah. Interesting. So it's
actually, if you're full of empathy,

992
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:43,840
it's great to remove yourself from your
sec. Totally. And that makes sense.

993
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:46,150
Like you don't want,
you want a divorce completely.

994
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:50,170
I never thought of that either.
And secondly, he says that the, um,

995
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:51,730
it's a real macho field,

996
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,820
gynecology and doing
gynecological procedures and
surgeries and it's very macho

997
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:02,200
and Hari is also much easier to track
than that. I don't remember. I don't know.

998
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,860
I can't think it was in the email that
it's easier to get into gynecology. Yeah,

999
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,450
I dunno then then if you were to be
like a fucking heart surgeon. Oh, right.

1000
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:14,960
But the, but the glamor is high.
So meaning like there's, uh, it's,

1001
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,700
it's just more prestigious
to do, I guess, you know,

1002
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,150
women's stuff really. It's
difficult. Yeah. Yeah.

1003
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:26,560
He says it's very macho
cause you're, you're really,
you're playing God, you know,

1004
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:29,860
with women's innards and big
fibroids and shit like that.

1005
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,980
Like his wife comes out.
Yeah.

1006
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:36,820
So it's a high reward and guessing.
Anyways, I thought that was fascinating.

1007
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,300
That is, that's interesting. Yeah.

1008
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,360
Oh yeah.
Still yelling at a sheep.

1009
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,690
Fucking hell.
Mine

1010
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,460
fucking move. Yeah. Five days.

1011
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,420
So mad at an innocent cheap.
Can you do his accent?

1012
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,860
A fucking movie.
That's pretty good.

1013
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,900
You're fucking shit. You're fucked.
And it's Scotland Scottish. He's,

1014
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:10,300
he calls him a fat Dick. Fat Dick.
Yeah, that's what he said there

1015
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,310
all your content.

1016
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,480
Fucking hell.
Mine Cuna El Mundo

1017
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,770
can move. Yeah, no, it sounds like

1018
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,440
all right.
Francis Begbie train spot.

1019
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:31,600
I watched the second one you did on the
flight. Did you love it? That was great,

1020
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:36,070
dude. I fucking love that movie.
I mean, it can't live up to par.

1021
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:41,230
It's like when it, I think when
the movie really moves into the,

1022
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:45,730
whatever, the third act, I
was not as invested in it.

1023
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:48,390
It's kind of like, Oh, this
is movie making. This is, uh,

1024
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:52,240
making this story come together. But it's
fun to see the characters again. Yes.

1025
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:54,270
That's the part. I enjoy
it, Sandra. Then. Yeah,

1026
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:58,460
seeing them back and getting
in trouble was cool. Yeah,
it was fun. It's cool. It's,

1027
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:03,280
it's a fucking great movie. Trainspotting
dude. Fuck deck. Yeah. If Fat Dick,

1028
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:04,863
that

1029
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,990
cupid cut.
Fuck Shit.

1030
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,480
Fucking hell fucking hey,
fuck off.

1031
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,790
I'm just glad I didn't hurt the sheep.
I was scared when I first saw he doesn't,

1032
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,910
I mean,
he just drives away,

1033
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,610
but he's just angry as shit that
he can't drive down the street.

1034
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:29,690
I kind of don't like when they spray paint
sheep. I feel like it's really silly.

1035
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,430
Don't spray paint. Nice wool. Yeah.
He's, he's very, this guy's real aggro.

1036
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:39,120
Yep. Yeah. I enjoyed him though. I

1037
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,210
fucking code. Yeah, he's a lot.
He's got a lot of things. That's

1038
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,780
what oil middle road.
Oh my God.

1039
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:54,440
So of course there's no such thing.

1040
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:59,410
Nothing can compare to the,
the greatest dad Boehner of all time.

1041
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,340
Oh yeah.

1042
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,503
We know who that is.

1043
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:11,890
Canada highway. It's the Canadian
Dad boner for the Canadian. He,

1044
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,620
he definitely wears the crown.

1045
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:19,030
Oh,
the story that this road towels.

1046
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,800
Nobody. Oh, oh, oh,

1047
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:29,530
oh, oh, oh. See now,

1048
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:31,610
and I'm listening to him.
Does he, is he joking?

1049
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,660
He just loves highways.

1050
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,250
So we've had different
ones. We've had, you know,

1051
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:46,660
dad boners that love whatever it
is. Solar eclipse, the trains,

1052
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:51,360
right train boners are pretty big.
This is our first plane boner.

1053
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:57,680
This guy parks in a fast food parking lot
and watch his planes on their approach

1054
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:03,750
at an airport and I'm willing and gets
really fucking excited about it. I mean,

1055
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:08,160
it's, he, he's in the running. I
mean, he can't eclipse Canadian Dad,

1056
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:12,960
but this is pretty excitable
for fucking commercial airlines.

1057
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,500
Oh, it's not like special,
no planes landing.

1058
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,510
It's like Sesnas and
shit. No. Hmm. Oh yeah.

1059
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,460
That's an Airbus three one nine

1060
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:27,820
there's one, three, three,
yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,623
Okay.

1062
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,910
Oh,
Boeing seven 37

1063
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:38,370
it's like a southwest plane, Bro. Relax
this guy. Is this excited for this? Oh,

1064
01:10:38,371 --> 01:10:42,760
my word. Oh my word. Oh my word. I'm 37 so

1065
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,620
you notice that also,
by the way,

1066
01:10:46,621 --> 01:10:49,920
that these guys are all these dad boners
are real clean. Like they don't curse.

1067
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:54,270
Yeah, that's it. Oh my word. Oh
my God. Heavens and stars. Yeah.

1068
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:59,000
Cheese and rice. They don't go fucking
Bowleys shit. Yeah, yeah. That's true.

1069
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:03,060
Train guy too. He was
like, Oh, this is, oh no.

1070
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,160
I think it's because you're sublimating
everything else in your life for that.

1071
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:10,960
Like you're repressing something
else somewhere else maturing.

1072
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,730
You're not allowing your brain to mature.
You're not using your Dick. You're not.

1073
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,120
You're not having come gazumped. What if
the guy took you on a day and he goes,

1074
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:22,060
we're going to park at this white castle.
Oh, watch planes, land and feeling.

1075
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,860
Are we five?
Ours are a little toddler likes playing.

1076
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:29,580
He loves a point up with them by, by
the waves. The waves. Bye Bye to them.

1077
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:34,380
Are you one and a half? Yeah. That's kind
of what this guy should be doing. Yeah.

1078
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:38,430
His, his development is stunted
somewhere. Right? It's not normal.

1079
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,200
These are not commercial.
Okay. These are planes there.

1080
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:45,190
Thousands of them land every day.
Every year. If you've ever flown, yeah.

1081
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,110
You're like, okay, that's sucked. Unless
he's putting it on like putting us all on,

1082
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:51,960
you know, these are just
giant fart bubbles in the sky.

1083
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:54,300
It's like they're so gross thing.
Exciting about this.

1084
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,970
No, I can't believe it. A Boeing
seven 37 come from Los Angeles.

1085
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:10,090
Maybe he's touched. Yeah, he might
be special. He could be very special.

1086
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:13,990
Wait, we haven't even thought
of that. What if he's just
tarted? He's not retarded.

1087
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,810
I you sure he parked?
No,

1088
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:22,180
no. Someone drove him there. No,
I don't think. I don't think so.

1089
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,240
I think he's retarded.
I don't think he's retarded that.

1090
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,890
I think that he's just really,

1091
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,550
it's just misguided energy.
You know?

1092
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,100
It's like you shouldn't be like this. No,
you should have orgasms. It's done. Yeah.

1093
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:39,040
You should feel like just for
like tits. Right? Right. What if,

1094
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:43,510
but what if they are on the spectrum
of some kind of behavioral? I guess so.

1095
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:47,950
I guess that's possible. It's do.
It's weird though, for sure. Super.

1096
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,030
We're saying we could see there

1097
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:02,060
now. It could be that this guy's doing
a bit. No, no, no. The genuine. Yeah.

1098
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:07,160
That's real. Enthusiasm is too
real. Coming from Los Angeles.

1099
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,460
That's like, he's so stoked.
That's how little kids are.

1100
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:14,720
How did you know that was from la?
See it? What about the following?

1101
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:18,290
The flight patterns? I mean there's
like apps, like flight deck.

1102
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:19,490
You can see what time?

1103
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,320
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1104
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,363
Come on.

1105
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,330
It's a fun character to play it.
Yeah. Oh, Boeing seven three seven

1106
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,590
Oh my word so far. And to
deferred. Did it pick it up?

1107
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:49,000
Maybe subtly. Yes. So exciting.

1108
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:52,760
It's not exciting to me. Now
I remember why it's not. Oh,

1109
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:57,340
it doesn't smell very good. Oh God.
Yeah. I'm still in it. It's my own hello.

1110
01:13:57,341 --> 01:14:01,390
Help mommies. In the last few years I've
killed a relationship with my own mom.

1111
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,990
She wasn't in my life for years
because of addiction and other factors.

1112
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:08,230
As we have hung out more often, things
are back to normal and we part ways.

1113
01:14:08,231 --> 01:14:11,800
She tries to plan a smooch
right on my mouth. Personally,

1114
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,250
I wouldn't marry my mom and try
to turn a cheek before it lands.

1115
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,360
What's the best way to duck out of these
mouth kisses with my mom without being

1116
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:24,010
a, how you say asshole Tim. Oh wait,

1117
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:29,200
okay, so you're a dude and she's your
mom. Yeah. And they put, they had,

1118
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:32,230
you know, many years apart.
Things are better now,

1119
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:35,620
but she tries to do mouth kisses.
Cause I tell you,

1120
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:39,910
there's somebody in my life who con and
for years it goes to say goodbye to me

1121
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:43,810
and mount and tries to mouth kiss.
What you do is go for the cheek.

1122
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:48,320
You just bypass the mouth and go
cheek and the act like that's that.

1123
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,700
That's what you was just establish.
You just establish that.

1124
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,710
I think you could start, you could start
leading kisses. That's maybe the way,

1125
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,480
in other words, when you say
hello, give her a hug and like,

1126
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:04,660
just go right. Go right for
that cheek. You know? So it's,

1127
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,230
it's not really, you're not
responding. You're not playing defense.

1128
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,840
You're being playing offense.
That's what I do with this.

1129
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,350
That's a good way to do it. Yeah. Who does
that? I'll tell you off Mike. All right.

1130
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:20,230
It's a friend that I've had for,
you know, 17 years. Oh really?

1131
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:22,660
God,
it's weird.

1132
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:26,950
I know how blind people know
when they're done wiping mommy's.

1133
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,810
I can't believe no one has
written the real answer. People,

1134
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:32,920
black people full the teepee when
they think they are done. If the,

1135
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,780
this is a fucking goof, I
don't know. This is nothing.

1136
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:43,570
Sorry guys. Um, how many
head scratches equal one Bj?

1137
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,290
Boy, my boyfriend and I had been listening
to the podcast since we started dating

1138
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,280
four years ago.

1139
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:53,310
We recently bet on John Jones versus
Daniel Cormier fight number two.

1140
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:57,730
If Jon Jones wins,
I get five head scratches.

1141
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:02,140
If DC wins, my boyfriend gets one. Bj,

1142
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,130
we were wondering if this is the proper
exchange rate for head scratch. BJ's.

1143
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:11,470
Well, first of all, Justine,
thanks Hitler's. She writes.
Justine, first of all,

1144
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,600
congratulations on your head.

1145
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:17,560
Scratchies because Jon Jones did
indeed win this past weekend.

1146
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,610
Five head scratchers for one. Bj. Yeah.

1147
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,670
Now that sounds about right.
That sounds right to you. Well,

1148
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:28,510
it depends because I would say you
owe me dozens of Bj's at this point,

1149
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:33,100
I think. But here's the thing, the
head scratches for me has to be,

1150
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,690
I go to sleep with them.

1151
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,740
So you need to do the scratchies
until I'm asleep more than you think.

1152
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:43,120
That's five that I give you five.
Well,

1153
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:47,990
how many is that? You probably
get 40 to 60 oh no, no,
she's saying five. I'm sorry,

1154
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,690
I understood this to mean five,
five sessions of Scott show.

1155
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,570
I think you need to be clear about that
and a lot of people are like, you know,

1156
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:59,800
one, two, three, four, five
scratches. That's bullshit.

1157
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:00,910
That's not even a head scratch.

1158
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,480
You're saying do five hedge
scratchy sessions equal a Bj?

1159
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,010
I think that's about right.
If it's a session five sessions full,

1160
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,210
which means we're laying in bed,

1161
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,320
I'm ready to go to sleep and then I go
give me scratchies and then I get the

1162
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,870
scratches until I fall asleep.
Yeah.

1163
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:20,180
I've been trying to ask for the
Bj in return for those scratches,

1164
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,870
but we're just marking
up your debt by the way.

1165
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:27,740
You totally just blew
off your helicopter Bj's.

1166
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:32,150
Those are supposed to be an agreed upon.
We've gotten distracted. Life took over.

1167
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:33,710
We didn't get back to the discussion.

1168
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,710
If you don't want to see
me in a by by pretty soon,

1169
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:41,711
but by better start I've had my eye on
so how much dog food will I need to eat

1170
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:44,180
for that man? No, I'm serious.

1171
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:48,380
I want a new updated wedding ring
because ours was so, I can't wear it.

1172
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,640
I'm allergic.

1173
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:53,450
But how many cans of dog food will I
have to eat for a new wedding band?

1174
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,550
We can we switch it up?

1175
01:17:55,551 --> 01:18:00,551
Why don't we switch it up to Bj's and
dog food or just don't have any more dog

1176
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:05,510
food. Okay. Yeah. I felt bad when you ate
that last time. It was worth it though.

1177
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:09,250
This rings are all nice.
It's a nice ring to waste.

1178
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,760
The other one now it's this
one. Oh yeah, that's right.

1179
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:17,540
That's the food ring. This you gave me for
my special, which is very sweet of you.

1180
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,260
Yeah,

1181
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,180
I do need a proper wedding band cause the
other one I can't wear skin breaks out.

1182
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,890
We've talked about this. You're supposed
to give me some things to take in

1183
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,760
and I got this.
These balls are all full.

1184
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,370
I need those kind of
just got home last night.

1185
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,010
You came home all tired
and you took shifts.

1186
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:37,160
Remember last night we were going to
sleep and you're like, I'll go to shit.

1187
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,860
And I'm like, thanks. You've
been shitting since you got home.

1188
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:42,710
We haven't had a chance to get
in there. Hey Mommy, I'm an AIDS.

1189
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:47,590
Lana Mommy right into needs.
Lana about people facetiming. Ah,

1190
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,820
I'm currently getting my car worked on.

1191
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:53,770
I'm in the lobby and these low end loose
assholes or facetiming with someone

1192
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:57,950
singing happy birthday twice. Stop
once in Spanish. Once an English,

1193
01:18:57,951 --> 01:19:02,150
Jesus Christ Christo.
After they finished singing,

1194
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,530
they continue to have their conversation
with the person with the vault all the

1195
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:10,640
way up to over 15 minutes. I go outside,
but it's nine degrees and humid.

1196
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:15,470
This is a low and loose situation. Stay
high and tight. Caesar or [inaudible].

1197
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,700
I don't know how you say it,
but that is some fucking bullshit.

1198
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:24,440
I really feel like we, you know,
it's time to start telling people,

1199
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,670
hey, are you fucking out
of your mind right now?

1200
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,410
Where were we when that old guy's
phone went off? And I was like,

1201
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:37,910
did I say something to him?
I was like, oh, no, no, no.
Hell No. Hell No. I didn't.

1202
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:42,270
I say that to him. I don't
remember. I remember that I, dude,

1203
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:48,050
I bet it was just ringing
and ringing and ringing.

1204
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:49,810
Then that's the worst one.
All people swarming,

1205
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:50,840
and I don't even fucking pick it up.

1206
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:55,870
I was in a doctor's office where a
patient had words with another patient,

1207
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,300
which doctor Dix off. No,
no, no different doctor.

1208
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,590
The witch doctory just don't worry about
it. I'm just kidding. So the person,

1209
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:10,920
the person was the phone and it
says there's a big sign there,

1210
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:15,930
no cell phones allowed. And so another
patient in the doctor's office goes,

1211
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:21,000
excuse me, good. And that person on the
phone was like, like, what? She's like,

1212
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,960
you're not supposed to be on your phone
in here. And she was like, oh. She's like,

1213
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,670
um, I, and she was like, I
got to go. Someone's saying,
and it's like, well, yeah,

1214
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:31,590
but there's a huge sign that says it.

1215
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:34,530
No one wants to hear your
fucking conversation.

1216
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,520
That's the worst part about this is
that it's really an intrusion on other

1217
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:42,210
people's audit. That's the whole
issue. Yeah. And you don't even,

1218
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:44,520
you don't even fucking think about it.
Like that's the thing.

1219
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:47,920
There's people who just don't, they
don't think about it. That to me,

1220
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:52,140
an auditory assault me, it
makes me, I hate Whistler's.

1221
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,710
I had people that talk on their fucking
speaker phone or watch a movie full

1222
01:20:55,711 --> 01:21:00,270
volume, why we're married. These
are like, these are actually,

1223
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,160
these are core values or core values.

1224
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:04,230
The tenants of our marriage
or really that were like,

1225
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,710
don't abuse my ears in public.
Well,

1226
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,280
you and I are not yellers and
we never yell across the house.

1227
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:15,840
That's fucking not happening. No. Yeah.
And we don't like loud sounds or public.

1228
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:20,270
Yeah. Stop being so fucking loud, man.
Yeah. Why are you so fucking loud? Yeah.

1229
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:24,100
Very rude. It's super rude. It's
just obliviousness, you know.

1230
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:29,690
Hey Jane. Hi Jeans with G. N.
E. S. It's a new one. Yeah.

1231
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:33,360
You've talked about workers coming over
and taking a shit in your house. Yup. Yup,

1232
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:33,600
Yup.

1233
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,740
My mom has people working on her roof
who came over and immediately dropped hot

1234
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:41,300
sevens in her bathroom. She called
me at the end of the day. I say,

1235
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:45,050
told me that not only was there a
worker brown sprayed all over the toe,

1236
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:49,500
but that her dog went in the trash and
shredded toilet paper all over the house.

1237
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,920
She cleaned it up.
She realized there was Brown on the paper.

1238
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:57,300
These workers shit in her house and
through the poo paper in the trashcan.

1239
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,870
Oh dear. What the fuck? I
guess it's just like the gays.

1240
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:04,560
I know a few people that aren't going
to be invited over for moose soup.

1241
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:06,630
No questions here.
Just sharing.

1242
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,090
One of the worst things I've
ever heard of happening. Well,

1243
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:12,840
there's a good chance that those are
from Latin America. Those guys, you know,

1244
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:16,030
so they are used to throw
in their poop paper in the,

1245
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:19,260
in the trash because of the plumbing
down there or it could be they're working

1246
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:20,094
on the plumbing.

1247
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:24,620
Maybe she didn't say what type of workers
they are and maybe the plumbing roof.

1248
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:28,110
She said, no, I bet it's that. Because my,

1249
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:33,060
one of my buddies who's married to
a Mexican woman said that, you know,

1250
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,570
when the family visited, he was
like, I had to keep, I'm like,

1251
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,220
do not put your shit paper in the toilet.
And they,

1252
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:44,150
and they don't put it in the trash.
Yeah.

1253
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,590
To a habit. So he puts signs in the
bathroom. Good. Yeah. Flesh side.

1254
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:52,080
We flush it down, dude. If it's brown,
it goes down. All of it. All of it.

1255
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:55,260
Anything Brown. Even if you have a
brown shirt on, he put it in the toilet.

1256
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:59,640
You flush it away. Americans do not.
We don't want to see it. Smell it.

1257
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,970
Just go away. Yeah. It goes go August.

1258
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:05,240
Horrifying to a god that Nancy,

1259
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,590
it's such a weird,
oh,

1260
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,830
she's so weird about it.

1261
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:20,330
I would've crashed my car if I was at
that red light and that lady on a moped

1262
01:23:20,331 --> 01:23:25,310
was like, I gotta go, Ah, ah. I like that.

1263
01:23:25,311 --> 01:23:29,700
She drives away like this.
You need to go back.

1264
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,183
Yeah,
it is.

1265
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,240
Okay.
Go.

1266
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,350
She goes, oh my God. Yeah.

1267
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,880
Where do you think is this Texas? I
bet you this is Texas. No White Lexus.

1268
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,510
Cause I like the see the strip malls.
Yeah.

1269
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:58,150
It's in my mind those ladies
are so nice to her though.

1270
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,560
The ladies and the other car,

1271
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:03,970
I think that they were enjoying it
and using the cover of being nice,

1272
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:08,971
which is a good way you need to go to
the hospital because if I were laughing I

1273
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:12,160
would be like, y'all write too,
but then just keep laughing. Yeah.

1274
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:17,140
That's fucking funny. Funny. But a psycho.
I know. God, the world is so messed up.

1275
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:22,290
Um, what else? I'm supposed to be on
Conan next week. Oh, okay. Always.

1276
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,940
I say supposed to because you never
know how things change and yeah.

1277
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:28,270
So showbiz guys. Yeah, but
maybe keep an eye out for that.

1278
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,650
I'm gonna make some moose soup.
I am. Anything else for Eugene's?

1279
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:38,230
Um, I mean not, you know, no. Same
Shit. Different toilet guys. Same Shit.

1280

like a few hours just farming?

1294
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,493
Well,

1295

the Sun would kiss the dad's mouth
mother with kids. The son's mouth.

1296
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,400
They don't make bullet astro when we

Okay. Yeah. Dude, you just like farts.
