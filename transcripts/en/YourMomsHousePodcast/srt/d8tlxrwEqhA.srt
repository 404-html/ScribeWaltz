Yesterday on the way home from my dinner,

63
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,870
it was pretty bad.
Walk me through what happened.

64
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:55,130
This is a liquid ass pranked by the
way. You know it's that spray. Oh yeah.

65
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,050
We've had, we've people have
said to us that one. Yeah.

66
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,400
It's not nearly as volatile as what
you've got in your real ass. Well,

67
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,880
yesterday was an interesting
day because it was a travel day.

68
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll always a recipe, cross country
travel day, just bad things happen. Sure.

69
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,090
I'm at the hotel early, eating
some breakfast, having caught,

70
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:18,890
did you have for breakfast? I had
a mom lit okay. With veggies. Uh,

71
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:23,360
yeah. There was spinach,
onions, mushrooms, and you
don't eat those very often.

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,830
It's very volatile. It's
not true. I ate that,

73
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,420
uh, had some bacon. Coffee. Oh yeah.

74
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,380
Then you were up early, early, too
early. Just does something to your guts.

75
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:40,310
I know what it is. I know.
And then I shit at the hotel.

76
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,320
Then I drive more than an hour.
Get to the airport.

77
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,450
You have another like half coffee,
another coffee and I just started now.

78
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,930
I just started, honestly I get,
I got on the plane with it.

79
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:55,610
I gave it to the flight attendant.
Right. Can you just throw,

80
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,820
someone's going to say, because usually
I drink my morning coffee and then I,

81
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,090
shit, I don't really want
coffee right away. I was like,

82
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,080
I don't really enjoy this and I
slept for a few hours. I don't know.

83
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:09,570
But your whole, your whole digestive
track is messed up that day. Yeah,

84
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,990
it really is waking up super early.

85
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,260
If it would mess my stomach up to
her and my stomach would just hurt.

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,310
And then I got back here eight something
here, I don't know. Then we went out.

87
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:24,000
What do we have for dinner? Oh yeah,
I had that um, salmon, salmon, salmon,

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,840
the hardest. I had the salmon and then,
um, yeah, on the way out of there,

89
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,693
just,

90
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,160
you know what's fun is because we say
Saulman as a joke and that when we're out

91
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,880
in public,

92
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,200
so many people say Saulman with
a hard l and that it's not right.

93
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,610
Including the server. It's a correct.
Yeah. Look, do you want to Solomon?

94
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,460
And I go, I do. And I go, can you
make it medium rare? He's like,

95
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,270
they don't make take temperature.
Change it for the Salomon here.

96
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,550
It was like that.
And I hear library a lot too.

97
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,760
And there's a lot there. Sometimes it
get tweeted you directions for things.

98
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:01,330
So we sit like it will be
like intentionally to, to
really say pacifically.

99
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,990
Yes, it's jokes. So, so
wait a minute. So we,

100
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,790
I remember this, we had is we had
our Saulman I had some seafoods too.

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,840
And then on the drive home. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah. So I farted.

102
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,880
Well it's not just a fart.
It was like an atomic. Yeah,

103
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,740
that's what I'm saying though.
And you had your head out the window.

104
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,250
You're like my husband,
he farted. First of all,

105
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,490
here's the shit thing you do is
you don't give me any heads up.

106
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,390
There's no warning, and then you don't
cross ventilate, which everybody knows.

107
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:35,360
If you're going to fart in the car,
all the windows have to be down,

108
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,020
passenger and driver. You got to cross
ventilate that fucking thing. It was hot.

109
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,350
It was hot. It was hot and it
smelled like a dirty diaper.

110
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,080
Like it smells like our newborns farts.
I got to give it to me,

111
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,400
give it up. To me it was real nasty. What
did it feel like coming out? Was it hot?

112
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,620
Yeah. Yeah. No, I knew it was as it came
out. I was like, this, I told you I'll go,

113
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,100
this is going to be bad. Oh, I know. And
I was saying that before I smelled it too.

114
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,730
I just knew by the feeling. I was
like, oof what you're telling me.

115
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,110
Did you tell us on this show?
Some guy you,

116
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,080
you saw him dancing with
headphones on and then he farted.

117
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,410
Did you say this on the show? Said it
was so funny. I'll never forget that.

118
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,840
That was in DC.
It was on a lunch break.

119
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,800
I was working with another guy named
Tom and he was really into music.

120
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,530
We went to a record store and it
was back when the record stores,

121
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:28,370
they had the listening station
and the guy was like,

122
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,970
he just ripped a huge fart and
we fell out turn. It was like,

123
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,760
I think he really thought we
were laughing at his voice.

124
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,930
Well you didn't because you think people
can hear what you're, what you're doing.

125
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,860
And he was a big guy. Yeah. And I think
that that fart escaped without him.

126
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,610
You wait a minute, Tom, this is a bit Eh,

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,470
sizes to view.

128
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,430
Are you saying that fat people have
girthy or or smelling your farts?

129
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,850
Cause I don't know why a smelly or but
maybe girthy or in media or maybe you

130
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:04,500
think the fatness is directly
proportionate. Maybe has
a, it's a factor. Maybe.

131
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,390
Maybe they're eating more garbage,

132
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,700
but your mom's got monstrous forest.
That's a good point. He's like 80 pounds.

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,200
Great counterpoint. Yeah, the 40
as far as I've ever heard. Right.

134
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:21,120
And smelly. Very slowly. This
is a question for science.
We have to ask a doctor.

135
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,220
Yeah. Yeah. It always
real here late. Let's,

136
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,350
let's examine this dad's reaction a
little more to this, uh, smell in his car.

137
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,940
Sure.

138
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,990
What God

139
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,270
did you shoot it so

140
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,720
it's not all farm?

141
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,280
Just like fucking dumb shit.

142
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,430
They were us yesterday. I
am expelling here. Yeah.

143
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,040
All right Kate, how far looking? Yeah.

144
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,390
I feel like these words come out of my
mouth every week of my life with you.

145
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,880
That can't be a 5,005.
I've said this exact thing over and over.

146
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,570
What is that? Since
we've been together. Now

147
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,010
you're just going to help

148
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,290
and then he eats his ramen
or whatever the fuck.

149
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,520
Great spray in there. I was there ice
cream in there. He's not eating top ramen.

150
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,400
I don't think that's wrong.

151
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,070
Oh, smell anymore. Well, God
know I love this guy. Oh God.

152
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,650
These guys
believe that came out of here.

153
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,490
Now I'm nervous now.
Somebody somehow like that.

154
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,410
That's like every married couples
discussion. I mean that is,

155
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,740
that's ultimate dad too. That's
a real dad. You know, his dad is,

156
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,290
the dad should fart. Well. Yeah,
but I mean that's a bad reaction.

157
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,770
I remember as a kid, we would take these
road trips, especially my uncle Dave,

158
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:03,550
he'd be like, oh, he's like Jesus
Christ. What do you piss pots?

159
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:08,551
Just because this spots and Ding
dongs Jesus go to the bathroom.

160
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,140
Christ stinks. You guys stink. Do
you rip a Fart? You always said that.

161
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,970
Cut apart. Cut. You cut a foreign
ramp. A fighter. My favorites. Yeah.

162
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,260
Cutting a fart. That's social
foreigner thing. Oh my God. Yeah.

163
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,530
Um,
here's another dad here.

164
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,390
Take it to the east coast.
Hello son. Hello Butch.

165
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,100
You're gonna fuck up your
stinking dirty. Pasty. Yeah. Yup.

166
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,980
I'm a big smelly fucking Turd,
which didn't, can do get it busted.

167
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,670
So I'm going to talk to our children to
see exactly how can fantastic talking to

168
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,240
her.

169
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,720
That's sick. That drill. I'm not
getting that. No one looked at

170
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,750
under a place. You the top.
Oh Man. No, I'm not. Fuck
No, I'm not getting in there.

171
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:59,950
You big dirty corn. It's
good though. As he fuck gone.

172
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,953
It doesn't

173
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,193
see.
First of all,

174
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,940
this is way better way to communicate
with someone or your children devil. Yeah.

175
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,170
The way that he calls his kid a
dirty, rotten ginger headed con. Yes.

176
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,390
I mean,
I just love that so much.

177
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,370
He rarely find American parents like that.
No, I know this is a foreigner thing.

178
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,120
My parents used to curse at me all
the time. I love it all the time.

179
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,510
I immediately smile when I see somebody
to talk to their kid like that.

180
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,090
This is more normal to me then you know,
oh sweet.

181
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:34,870
I actually feel like that means you
like your kid even more. Yeah, I agree.

182
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,270
I don't like that.
I agree.

183
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,160
You don't think of them as an
experiment that you're raising? No.

184
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,280
Like if I would farm, my dad would
be like, oh, so, oh real hardcore.

185
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,070
[inaudible] like you've rotten
whore mother kind of and like,

186
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,440
yeah, I think I was normal. Why that
never got mad. You know? My Dad,

187
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,820
he was always like, he's just, he's
like, Jeez, wow. It's like you do that.

188
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,210
That really stinks because you probably
need to take a ship away because your

189
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,610
dad doesn't like lay blame.
He's so sweet. He loves it.

190
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:08,850
He loves the game and loves shits.
He does.

191
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:12,600
So as soon as you are like you've
rip one, he's just like, wow,

192
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,140
that's really something. Now you saw it
ever gets mad. You saw him in breast,

193
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:20,460
a breast balls, beach. He saw him. I
saw a top dog and Charo and any updates?

194
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,740
Um, no. I mean it's pretty much same
shit. Different toilet, you know? Yeah.

195
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,360
Yeah. Did he tell you any
poop stories or anything? No,

196
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:34,830
not really. Okay. So it's
consistent or good? Yeah. Uh, oh,

197
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,820
I have a hemorrhoids update. Oh, we're
not done with this though. I'm sorry.

198
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:39,654
I didn't know.

199
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,640
All right Jordan. I'll save it. Oh,

200
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:47,760
come on man. There's no
throwing him on. There's no

201
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,930
up God. It sounded like it was Gunna, no,

202
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,970
he's just grossed out by his sons.
Fart

203
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,413
dirty Boston

204
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,743
children.

205
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,160
I love this guy so much.
That's it. That's it.

206
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,480
Sorry you have a hemorrhoid up to,
I didn't mean to.

207
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,670
It's a little late on this queue,
isn't it?

208
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:19,370
We've been talking about shit for
the first 10 minutes of the show.

209
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,210
Well I just want to say it

210
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,310
[inaudible] Huh?

211
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,920
Or late than never. That's right.
So anyways, I at first of all,

212
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:32,850
thank you for the outpouring of emails
and concern about my hemorrhoids.

213
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,220
I really appreciate all the
thoughtful advice. It is
really nice guys. Yeah. So, uh,

214
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,660
many of you recommended
a Tux medicated pads. Um,

215
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:46,170
I got a recommendation for this Chinese
cream you can buy on Amazon to that's

216
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:49,920
coming and if high fiber or
things of that nature, but,

217
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:53,990
which I tell you I already have
pretty fiber's good dumps. Um,

218
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,430
and I started using talks.

219
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:59,720
What I would do is I like if I knew I
was kind of sitting around for a minute,

220
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,130
like to breastfeed the kid or something,

221
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,370
I'd take 'em a tox pad and kind of fold
it like a Taco and then just put it up

222
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,810
against my hemorrhoids.
Like just kinda like a,

223
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,530
like a pad and have it soak on my
hemorrhoid. You know what I mean?

224
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,440
Like just sitting there.
Good News.

225
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,520
It's already worked on going to dry heave.
There's no more pain.

226
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,590
It's the pain has gone and, and that
must be the power of Tux. So thank you.

227
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,050
Thank you. It's gone. I mean it's not, the
bump is still there, but there's no pain.

228
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,690
If that makes sense.
Is that how that's supposed to resolve?

229
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,130
I guess so. Like does a bump go
away or it's just, I don't know.

230
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,350
I've just done an expert. Yes. You are in
hemorrhoids. No, I'm not. You have them.

231
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't you have, I mean I've seen
blood before, but that's not it.

232
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,410
Those are internal ones, right?
Yeah. But I don't have a your issue,

233
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,910
the external ones. No.
Ari has the internal ones.

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Ari's issues are vast.
Yeah.

235
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,250
And series should have asked him.

236
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,340
I can't believe he's alive after seeing
what his asshole looks like is so

237
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,290
horrific.
Everyone's seen his butt hole.

238
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,330
I almost passed out when I saw it at
the fire. I swear. I've never though.

239
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,620
It's like, oh, you so nasty.
It's so nasty. He's so nasty.

240
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,840
Um, poor guy. He really has serious ain't
home problems. Real serious problems.

241
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,270
I did also want to point out,
um,

242
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,570
I'm doing a Conan tonight.
Come,

243
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:31,670
so that'll be up by the time you hear
it or listen to this. Yeah, that's it.

244
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,700
I've been there a few times.
It's always fun to go back.

245
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,570
Burt was there last night.
Who, uh, Bart. Yeah. And uh,

246
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,800
I didn't get to see it,
but, uh, that was sent, uh,

247
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,340
just a small clip from his appearance if
you guys want to listen to what he did

248
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:50,660
on the show niggers. Oh,
all right. Well, you know,

249
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:54,440
we each have our own
different way of performing.

250
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,470
I wonder if Conan and brought
him out as the world's fattest,

251
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,420
most racist comedian working
today. Good thing to look up. Yeah.

252
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,710
That's really caught fire and I'm pretty
happy about that. Well, obviously, I mean,

253
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:11,480
he is. Yeah. Was that, that was his
opener, right? He sat down, I guess.

254
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:15,920
And you just did that. Yeah. Conan was
like, oh, okay. Hey Conan's not racist.

255
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,170
No, no, neither is Andy. I wonder
how they dealt with it. Yeah, no.

256
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,290
Um, interesting. So I think these
are the same guys, by the way.

257
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,060
That made that, um, my dad,

258
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:34,570
he never made us ashamed of a heart
penises. Christ. Yeah, that was terrible.

259
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,190
Another clip. You want to see
it now? Here it is. Oh, thanks.

260
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,050
Said that mother fucker. Randy. Every
time he gets more than six beers in them,

261
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:43,480
it gets pissed off and leaves us.
Tell me about it.

262
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,850
I'm getting fucking sick of
walking home from work every day.

263
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,560
I'm going to cut his balls
off the see him don't balls.

264
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,320
My wife's gonna bite mine off
for not being home on time.

265
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,240
What's she making a big
dinner? Yeah. Nah, it's Friday.

266
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,170
She expects me to fuck her all night long.
What the Hell is wrong with that?

267
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,150
Nothing. I mean, I just put a
pillow over her face and go to town.

268
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,090
It's just what?

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,890
Geez. Is that, is that what you do?

270
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,390
She likes to start things
off by giving me some head.

271
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,320
Her teeth always make my
Dick Ra her teeth. Oh,

272
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,460
bitches can't suck a dick worth a day.
I guess because of my size.

273
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:27,810
She can't open up any wider. C'Mon.
Let's go. Where is this headed? Huh?

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,521
I don't know.

275
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,460
I've never had good head and your whole
life and go on hikes like this to all

276
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:34,690
the time.
Is this your hiking?

277
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,010
I don't think I ever really have one
kit that fucking cock out of your pants.

278
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,660
Yeah, that's cuts off right there,
unfortunately. Hulu man. What the fuck,

279
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,230
Ben? Well, do you not know
what's happening next? No,

280
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,860
I don't know what's going to happen.
Yes. I just went on a hike this morning.

281
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,240
This is, this is eerily reminiscent. Yeah.
This is all your hikes and by the way,

282
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,270
yeah. You're always like,
oh, I'm going hiking. Yeah.

283
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,990
I met a lot of Nice guys on my
hike. Yeah, there are. There's,

284
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,780
there's guys just like this with the
hats like this and with sleeveless vests

285
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,350
and a tight jeans.
I love the tight Jean for a hike.

286
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,650
I didn't even think about that. Yeah,
their attire, they're wearing like what?

287
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:16,630
Boots? Yeah. And this is a uniform of
straight heterosexual Niagen guys. Yeah.

288
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,590
Oh,
bitches can't suck a dick worth a damn.

289
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,270
Just a couple of straight guys hiking
and cowboy boots and I'm worth than a

290
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:30,160
bitch that can't suck a dick worth a
damn. You know, I got to fuck my wife.

291
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,510
I'll Friday night long. All right. I put
a pillow over her head and I go to town.

292
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,520
I sure hope our deliveries

293
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,540
or fact that fucking
cock out of your pants.

294
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,070
Our pilot, if it gets picked up. Oh
yeah. Then the acting is terrible.

295
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,090
It was pretty terrible. That's what makes
it great. And they just stand there.

296
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,870
Really
cause that cock out of your pants.

297
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,030
Come on. Be Honest. If you met
some guy on the hiking trail.

298
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,160
Yeah and he was like
vicious cancer car for shit.

299
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,470
[inaudible] trying to try me out.
Try it out.

300
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,640
I was taking my 10 or 12
Benadryl piss on me, beat me.

301
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,280
Would I give it a shot? I'm a hot
white trash, calm dump. I mean I'm the,

302
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:16,200
I'm not totally opposed to it. I just
feel like, I mean, you know, I'm hot,

303
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,450
I'm on the trail. It's
all dirty or sweaty. Yeah.

304
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,240
It's like also people are going to
walk by, where are we going to do?

305
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,990
They don't care. And Gay guys don't
care about that. Oh really? Wow.

306
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,630
They just fuck out in the streets.
When I lived in San Diego,

307
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:32,470
I'd see guys to see this fucking, this
is in the height of like the 90s though.

308
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:35,470
Wouldn't when, you know gay guys ruled
that place. I don't know if they still do.

309
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:37,720
Now it's more yuppies.
But I'm telling you,

310
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:41,170
one time I saw two guys just
butt fucking on the street. Uh,

311
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,440
clubs everywhere guys.

312
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,090
So fucking quit putting their dicks
through holes and other guys just going to

313
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:50,200
suck. I'm their savages, dude.
They're awesome. They used to rule it.

314
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:54,040
It was like awesome. Well this gay Mecca,
like if he were a gay guy, you should,

315
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,060
you should live in San Francisco.
You want to make, it makes me crazy.

316
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:59,680
When gay people write
to me and they're like,

317
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:03,730
I live in fucking Alabama and they hate,
they hate me because I'm gay.

318
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,230
I'll get the fuck out of there.
Yes.

319
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,610
Not just the gays who
are doing the butt stuff.

320
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,570
Do you want to know something
that's really amazing. Oh, what?

321
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,800
A couple who were desperately try and I
can see they'd been having sex the wrong

322
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:24,340
way for four years. No kidding.
Yes. 26 and 24 years old.

323
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,220
Oh my God. They were like, we
keep failing to get pregnant.

324
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,040
The sex on a regular basis.
During the appointment,

325
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:34,570
the woman admitted that sex
was usually painful and uh,

326
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,290
they were very young, very healthy,
hilarious, couldn't conceive.

327
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,010
They were having a lot of stress.
And uh,

328
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,220
the doctor discovered that the couple
had mistakenly been having anal

329
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,720
intercourse rather than vaginal conceive

330
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,910
four years of marriage. And either the
husband or wife knew how to get pregnant.

331
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,380
Goodness. Porns banned in
China. Right? I Dunno. Maybe.

332
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,690
Probably the state controls,
you know. Yeah. I mean,

333
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,130
these people aren't being educated.

334
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,100
I doubt they teach them
about the birds and the bees.

335
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,640
That's wild.
That is wild.

336
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,230
Oh yeah. It says sex education faces
great challenges in China. Djing. John,

337
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,920
a professor of sociology at Beijing's,
I don't know how to say the Tsing Hua.

338
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,540
I'm fluent in Chinese university at Tang.
Ha.

339
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Students take sex education to you?

340
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:32,800
Not even going to comment on me on
my beautiful pronunciations. St Claw.

341
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,100
Yeah. Take sex education classes where
they learn basic melanose any condoms.

342
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,443
Okay.
Anyway.

343
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,640
Huh?
Wow.

344
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,100
Good stuff. Bad stuff for, for for
how many years? That's terrible.

345
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,230
But now that that is, I mean this
has to be a stupid couple. I mean,

346
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,260
why would you put it in?
That's where the chocolate comes out.

347
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
It's pretty, pretty. Uh, pretty wild.

348
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,410
Oh, is it time? Hold on one second.
I might have 18 seconds and my timer,

349
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,210
go ahead. Let them know. Ching Chong,
Ching Chong. Where's that one? No,

350
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,460
you want to fuck with my main memory
that I remember. Just singing what?

351
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:19,330
I know. I'm just singing
what I know from this show.

352
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm not making fun of Asian people.
That's an actual drop.

353
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,320
Okay. There you go.
Alright. Okay. There you go.

354
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,880
So there she is. So I dug it up.

355
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,280
[inaudible] I was referencing a
song and you know, come on guys.

356
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,240
It was

357
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,010
a really back in the news
heavily. These last four hours. Is

358
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,990
that one? Louis Ck. Great.

359
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,520
He did too.

360
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,790
That was an actual audio recording
of the incidents. Right, right.

361
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,780
But he did two appearances,
this, uh, this weekend,

362
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,680
one at the comedy cellar,

363
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,020
a famed New York City Comedy Club.

364
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,160
And one I think out in governors
in Long Island at the comedy club.

365
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,260
And uh,

366
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,260
both were surprised sets
and these are both a new,

367
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,070
these are his first appearances
doing standup since he admitted to,

368
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,900
um, jerking off in front of people
without their consent. Yes. And, uh,

369
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:34,060
that was a huge bomb drop. Yes. Uh,

370
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,450
it was a huge bomb that dropped last
November and everybody, you know,

371
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:41,870
at least in comedy, has been
like, ah, will he come back?
Like, just jump the gun,

372
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:46,700
just what will happen again. And He,
uh, he's doing spots. It looks like,

373
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,760
you know what's interesting is
that huge backlash, by the way,

374
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,520
people aren't exactly applauding
this return. Most people are not.

375
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,490
And it's interesting because we've had
conversations with other people in our

376
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:01,050
business. Like what's
the timeline here? Right.

377
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,110
How long do you think he's gonna hold
out before he comes back and it's been

378
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,150
nine months.
Yeah.

379
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,860
I have to tell you like I
didn't hate him before this.

380
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:16,370
I was kind of like them on the scale
of shitty things that have happened.

381
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:21,140
He's not a Weinstein. He's not
exactly a Cosby. He sucks. That sucks.

382
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:24,650
But it was not on the scale
of Shit. Shit Bird. Yeah.

383
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,820
This makes me not like him
cause you're like motherfucker,

384
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,700
if you don't know to stay the
fuck away for at least a year,

385
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,100
you don't got no sense. He has no sense.
And talk about the sense of entitlement.

386
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,920
Like dude, you're clueless. Like
if you're coming back this early,

387
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,570
that's just my take. Wait at least a year.
Don't you think? Uh, you know it's funny,

388
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:49,571
I didn't really think of the specifics
of it because it's not my life.

389
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,860
You know what you mean? The specifics
like how to come back like was,

390
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,650
I didn't like lay out a plan because
I'm not anything that I deal with.

391
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,870
Not your concern in life.
Yeah.

392
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:04,871
So I mean I was always of the mindset
that I believed that a path to redemption

393
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,590
should exist, not just for him.
I mean, just for most people in,

394
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,810
in life, like people who do bad
things like Cosby though. Well, okay,

395
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:22,490
how has it really bad? My point was that
is that, you know, somebody gets arrested,

396
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:26,090
let's say goes to jail for
any number of terrible things.

397
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,860
You could be accused of
assault, armed robbery, murder,

398
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,990
manslaughter,
all these horrible things.

399
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,960
Eventually some of those people
get released and it's like,

400
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,260
you can't just be like, that's
it. Like you don't get to, well,

401
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:44,130
you're back in society now. You have
to figure out ways. So for, for a lot

402
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,450
of people, they go, you know,

403
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:48,240
let's say somebody is accused
of a horrific violent thing.

404
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,720
They're locked up for 20 some
years. They go, well, they did,

405
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:55,740
they paid their debt to society.
So they're entitled to whatever now,

406
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,470
even though people don't have
to hire them. Right. You know,

407
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,630
so this is obviously not the same thing,
but there is some parallel to,

408
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,600
um,
there's a bad thing done.

409
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,350
You need to pay some type of price.
There's pennants and yeah.

410
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,250
So the, you can make an
argument that, you know,

411
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,020
part of the penance is the
public shame of it all. Yeah.

412
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,780
Part of the pennants is
losing, you know, your,

413
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,440
he had big television deal
with FX that went away.

414
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,830
Touring business just stopped. Obviously
there's monetary monetary punishments.

415
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:35,490
Sure. Then you have to
go, well, um, if he did,

416
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,440
you know, he did admit to doing these
things. Like the probably, I mean there's,

417
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:40,651
again,

418
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:45,651
this is just an opinion needs to be
some type of interaction with the um,

419
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,730
people that you or you know,
uh,

420
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:55,790
let them dictate some
terms of making it okay.

421
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,053
In other words,

422
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,270
some woman that he jerked
off in front of gets to say,

423
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,980
you know, it'd be great if, uh, yeah,

424
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,780
if you were to donate
to this organization or,

425
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,160
I dunno,
I don't have the answer,

426
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:15,600
but I'm saying you need to at least
consider probably some of those peoples,

427
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,550
um,
feelings in this.

428
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,380
Well, I think what you're saying,
which is I agree with too,

429
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,590
is like the way the law functions,
right?

430
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:27,380
Like there's no real due
process with what's happening.

431
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,500
People are being accused and then it's
like you're gone off with your head

432
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:34,960
disappear. Whereas there's no like
legal system being involved. Yeah. Um,

433
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,350
if we could have, I wish gotten legal
system, maybe there's a way to get,

434
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:43,790
if the legal system had been involved,
it's a much clear cut because path, right.

435
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,040
Because the whole point is
to make somebody whole again,

436
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,840
that's the whole point
of the legal system.

437
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,310
And it was also like a direct punishment.
So you go, right, you're going to jail,

438
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,000
you're paying a function.
Pennants dependents. Yeah. And I,

439
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,420
and I think that might be the,

440
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:59,600
the biggest flaw of the me too
movement is just like, okay, I get it.

441
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:03,280
Like we're not victim blaming. If a
girl says I should happen. Yeah. Okay.

442
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,720
It happens. So let's get
it. What are the next steps?

443
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,700
Let's be very clear and specific about
punishment and, and, yeah. And we weren't,

444
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,090
and that's why this shit is not
fucking working now and now he's back.

445
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,440
I think he should,

446
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,410
um, you know, you, you can't stop someone
from doing whatever. I mean, no, he,

447
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,120
you know, seems like illegal.
Seems like he's, I dunno,

448
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,250
it seems like he's going
to keep doing spots.

449
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:31,840
I imagine what I think is crazy actually.
Is that so crazy?

450
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:35,590
I do think it's crazy that the clubs,
um,

451
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,800
let surprise droppings

452
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,950
the [inaudible] case.

453
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,240
Somebody should have been the
gatekeeper here and been like, oh no,

454
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,180
it's not cool to have a polarizing person.

455
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,140
Surprise. Poppin right.
Because there must be, yeah.

456
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:58,141
Cause then you're basically saying that
people who are in the audience who's

457
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:02,470
night might be ruined by it.
You're like, so it's like, dude,

458
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,210
let them let the person,
I'm all for the market dictating what,

459
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,200
what's okay and not sure. So if you
go, Louise, on this show tonight,

460
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,290
you're allowing audience people to go,
okay,

461
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,120
I support the venue and the
comic. I'm spending my money. Um,

462
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,130
go ahead. Right. Let me
show me what's what. Right.

463
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,220
Let the consumer decide
whether or not there,

464
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:27,760
because you're not really letting that
happen. And I know some people were like,

465
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:30,370
yeah, but they can get up and
leave. It's like, yeah, but no,

466
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,110
they don't want to get up and leave.

467
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,240
Let them figure out whether or not
that's the place they want to be.

468
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,920
To watch that. It's so funny because
we were talking about this yesterday,

469
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,060
even before this happened.
So fine.

470
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:46,150
Why don't we just talking about Louis
before this story broke like yesterday at

471
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:49,150
dinner and uh, and we were like,
you know, at the end of the day,

472
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:53,020
a lot of people don't give a shit
what people do in their private lives.

473
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,400
What's that director who lives in
France and he was fucking left Polanski.

474
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,930
Hollywood's still gives that guy, you
know, the, the high five on his work.

475
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:04,530
I made a documentary about
how great he was. Yeah.

476
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:09,130
A couple of years ago called wanted and
desired and I watched it and everyone in

477
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:13,170
Hollywood was before me too.
Stuff took off. Everyone was
there. Like, he's a great,

478
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,750
amazing men. Like you fuck a
13 year old girl, the hot tub.

479
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,040
Like nobody fucking cares. Yeah.
People were like, he wanted Oscar.

480
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,990
He wanted an Oscar. Years
later, a few Oscars.

481
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,060
Woody Allen's been shipping his
stepdaughter for what, 20 years now.

482
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,240
People are like, oh, talents.
And now they're like, no,
no, no, he's no good anymore.

483
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,470
But it took all the other stuff.

484
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,760
But no one should be marrying his
fucking adopted. I mean, look and,

485
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,810
but the point being that yes, there's
more awareness draw bought, brought to it,

486
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:45,790
but people still can separate. There's
still came from the art. I mean,

487
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,910
and look,
he's going to have a massive audience.

488
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,570
Of course people still
want to see him do stands.

489
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,330
He's so silly to go out this early
though. I just don't think it's, it's not,

490
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,710
it's clue.
Can I tell you what it is?

491
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,720
It really shows to me an arrogance and
an obliviousness to the gravity of this

492
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:04,420
movement and the gravity
of what he's done.

493
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,450
It to me reads very callous and like my
younger chefs going to do what I want to

494
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:11,950
do and you know, it's interesting
his approach to it of like,

495
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:15,490
I'm just going to show up and do this
and he doesn't bring it up on stage.

496
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:19,390
He's like, Oh, is this okay?
Very similar to what he was
doing to women. Right? Like,

497
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,940
I'm going to jerk off.
I hope this is okay with you guys.

498
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,660
Like it's the same fucking approach of
like is there's, okay, I'll a too late.

499
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,550
I'm already doing it.
Like there was no,

500
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,210
there's no consent in both of those
scenarios. Right. Him showing up,

501
00:32:31,211 --> 00:32:34,570
doing a pop in and then him taking his
deck out and asking if it's okay and he's

502
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,100
already come.
You know,

503
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,220
it would have been amazing if he did his
like top in 15 minutes set and then the

504
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:46,100
host comes back out, you know, take
the money and just start streaming.

505
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,160
Hey man, good side. And then Louise like,
oh come on man. And he was like, oh no,

506
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:56,390
I'm a big fan. Yeah, that'd be fantastic.
Everybody knows, hey standing ovation.

507
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,120
There was
no clapping.

508
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,390
Everybody give him around a jerk
off. Yeah, he didn't bring it up.

509
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,620
He didn't even bring it up. I
heard in the set. I Dunno. I Dunno.

510
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,650
I heard that he didn't, I heard it was
like the usual stuff like waitresses,

511
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:15,980
donuts, whatever, the subways. Terrible.

512
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,310
Wait a minute,
are you not going to fucking address?

513
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,220
That's the thing is it's kind of,
there is a,

514
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,430
I'm fascinated by what the step must
be like what the hour will look like.

515
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,030
No. Cause who's buying that
one? That is are not Netflix. No

516
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,710
Netflix.
But he's going to,

517
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,510
I may probably the best business solution
for him 100% would be to like do his

518
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:49,030
old model, put it on his site and
whoever's on board is on board.

519
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,390
He'll still sell a ton of them.

520
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,040
I mean saying for him that works and
that leaves it to, you're not surprising,

521
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:00,210
uh, any body with it. It's just here's
content. Do you want to pay for it? Yeah,

522
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,880
I dunno. I want to see too, it's
like, do you open talking about it?

523
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,200
I would get the elephant,
like to not address it.

524
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,420
Here's the other thing
is like as a comedian,

525
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,670
do you want a somber apology at
the beginning of, uh, I mean, no.

526
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,870
You know, it's like, no, but don't, you
can't go up there and not address it.

527
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,041
You would be like,

528
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:26,690
so anything happened in the news
lately and he just starts jerking off.

529
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,700
Do you think he should do like that?
Um,

530
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,940
the drop curtain where they show the
silhouette and then he just turns and

531
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:38,110
starts going like that and he's
like, what's up guys? It's me again.

532
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,120
He's back. Well there's the trailer, it's,

533
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,780
it's a silhouette of him jerking off
and it's like your favorite jerk off

534
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:49,730
comedian. He's bad. It was called.

535
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:54,320
Do you mind just kind of gesturing
like, do you mind if I come?

536
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,660
Yeah, I have to say I was more partial
time if I come might, if I come,

537
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,200
oh, I'll make you come. I'm sure
you will. For stroke comedian.

538
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,873
Yeah.

539
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,310
I have to say that I was more on his side
kind of on this thing and now I'm more

540
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,560
like, oh, this guys doesn't
get it. The fact that he,

541
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,500
he thinks he's welcome back.

542
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,890
It's like he doesn't get
the gravity he doesn't get,

543
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,740
that's the opening sentence right now.
I'll make me come.

544
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,120
That's the next hour I
can make me make me come.

545
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,860
Jesus. Yeah. I mean by that.

546
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,500
Here's, okay, here's what somebody
else's thinking. Because like I said,

547
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:50,670
I didn't lay out a plan for
him so I wouldn't know. But
it's like you go, you go,

548
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:53,640
this is, you shouldn't have
done your spots now. Okay.

549
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,870
When is he supposed to go do spots at
least. But that's a few more months.

550
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,140
So what at least waiting for the holidays
for some other Creepo to come out.

551
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,820
One other big fish,

552
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:07,490
one other big fucking creeper that Asia
Argento story's pretty great. I kind of,

553
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,150
you know what,
maybe that's what did it,

554
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:13,200
cause that kind of minimize the movement
a bit is having that thing with Asia

555
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:18,201
and she was paying off the guy who
accused her of sexual assault teenager who

556
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,390
was a teenager if for those of
you don't know what happened.

557
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,360
And so Asia Argento was one,

558
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,390
it's like one of the leading
people and Rose McGowan. Right.

559
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:30,440
But I'm saying so we're talking about Asia
buddies. Yeah. But they just been like,

560
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,500
one of the faces of this,

561
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:36,501
she was also was dating Anthony Bordain
and it turns out that she was accused by

562
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:43,620
a guy who had just turned 17. So a
kid who was 16, like the week before,

563
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,620
uh, so nasty. She fucked
him. And she's like,

564
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,490
I didn't know he was a teen or something.
She was 37.

565
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,210
He was 17. He, uh,

566
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,090
came after her and he can't enforce
drugs for sure. The story at least,

567
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,631
you know,

568
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:05,631
what is being reported by some people
is that she then had bore Danes,

569
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,520
lawyers and um,
money to pay him off.

570
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,420
Right.

571
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,220
So that more Dane actually paid it
came out of board Danes pocket 380,000.

572
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,020
But who knows? I don't know. The,

573
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,480
I don't know who knows what the
fuck is really happening there.

574
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:26,190
But I do think that that deal
legitimize the movement a bit.

575
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,440
Having one of the people,

576
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:31,620
like one of the big people is full of
shit accusing Weinstein. Yeah. Right.

577
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:34,500
Which started this whole thing, which by
the way doesn't mean that why it seem,

578
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,360
didn't do that. I'm sure
he did, but I'm saying it,

579
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:40,440
it definitely lends itself to
de-legitimizing a lot of this movement.

580
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,340
So maybe that's why Louie felt
a little entitled. I don't know.

581
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:48,730
I'm just speculating. I don't know.
But it seems an odd choice. Um,

582
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,490
why now? Why not? I, if
I were him, I would stay
underground a little bit longer.

583
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,760
Yeah. I think, I think
seeing it happen and um,

584
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,630
the reaction was not positive from
what I could see, at least online.

585
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:04,080
Everybody was like pretty heated about it.
Um,

586
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,750
I mean from, from people in
comedy now, nobody was like,

587
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,020
it seems really tactless and clueless.
And honestly,

588
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,670
like Cosby touring right after
his accusers, it's a little,

589
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,910
that was super checked out. So, yeah.

590
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,770
So it's on that scale. You're right.
I didn't, I didn't think about it.

591
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,170
You know what people ask me, they're
like, you a Rachel one mother passed.

592
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,370
He was like,
I'll be at the club tonight.

593
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,380
Yeah, yeah. Walking out
of court, being like, bye.

594
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,070
And then he did, he did after he was
convicted, he was like, aw, yeah.

595
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,220
Aw, yeah, that's,

596
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,790
yeah, but that's what I'm, is this so far,

597
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,720
craziest thing that's
like level 10 being like,

598
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,301
it's fine.

599
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:04,510
I can just go out there and tell jokes
like I always have and I'm not going to

600
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,810
address it. I'm just going to, it was on
nine months ago. Big Deal. Like, dude,

601
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,070
I dunno it,

602
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,620
it definitely reads is like I'm oblivious
to the reality of the situation and

603
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,320
you're right, there's no pennants,
there's no closure for the women,

604
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,030
and he did put out a press release.

605
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:23,440
It was kind of bullshitty going back
and forth on this. They're like,

606
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:28,290
what if you're him? You're like, what is
the game plan is supposed to be? I mean,

607
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,320
you know, I'm serious. Like I mean, so
it's like I get that we get to say like,

608
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:35,230
no dude, this is not the good
time. Another good strategy.

609
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,370
But a lot of people don't know what the
strategy is. That's the whole point.

610
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,230
You know what the strategy is?
I'll tell you what it is.

611
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,520
It's what that director did who fuck
the 13 year old, you moved to France.

612
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,230
That's what he should do. He would
be accepted and pull that one too.

613
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:51,100
You go to France,

614
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,330
go to France because they don't give a
fuck about kid fuckers and master baiters

615
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:59,060
and and uh, you know rapists. You

616
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,360
say funny.
How'd you say come guy in Mexico.

617
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,723
He comes

618
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,000
how you joking? Joking. You
come, they invented front.

619
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,190
They don't give a fuck. So you moved to
France for two years. That's your penance.

620
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,270
You leave the country, you, you
disappear. You just have to disappear.

621
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,910
And that means don't check on media
to see what's up with your name.

622
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,670
Like fuck off the,
let the French embrace you.

623
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,060
And then once they've embraced
you and then you come back to it.

624
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:41,740
This fucking that director do did.
Yeah. Yeah. Leave the country, Bro.

625
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,370
Take your fucking family and get out.
Why do you want to be here?

626
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,060
Would you want to be here
when your name is being off?

627
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,290
I had gone through what he went through.
Oh my God.

628
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,520
I feel like that has to be
psychologically so devastating. Oh my God,

629
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:56,920
I have to have PTSD.

630
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,360
If you go from being so celebrated the
way he was celebrated to being just

631
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,960
destroyed. I mean, and you earned
it and this thing it's out of no,

632
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,960
not because of anything but
like that going through.

633
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,400
That's interesting point you make too.

634
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,790
It's very traumatizing for going cause
I was just thinking of Monica Lewinsky

635
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:20,710
who was like one of the first people to
be really publicly shamed for a sexual

636
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,580
thing. Right. But that she
wasn't very celebrated before.

637
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm trying to think of what
that must be like. And also the,

638
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,000
that's the second part of it.
First,

639
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,220
don't forget that he
wasn't just like thought of

640
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,800
as like he's a funny comic or he's a guy,

641
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,110
he was thought discussed
and spoken of like, like a,

642
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:42,800
an artists like Monet.

643
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,570
I mean people talked about him in an
almost unnatural way in the comedy world

644
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:52,000
cause he was just iconic and he was just
associated with being brilliant. Oh,

645
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,450
he's like the car land, one of those
timeless. Yes. Yes. So it's like if you,

646
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,160
if you,
you know,

647
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,360
if you go from those types
of conversations about you
and your name every time

648
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:07,100
your name is said, it's like
people are like, oh, that
guy's really something else.

649
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,380
I mean, his comedy is, you
were talking about your,

650
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:14,300
your jokes as if you're talking about
poetry, you know? Oh yeah. And then to be,

651
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,440
just to be torn down,

652
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:19,200
thoroughly torn down and discredit
a couple of other perverts.

653
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,460
Jerry Lee Lewis married his 13
year old cousin. That's true.

654
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:28,050
Elvis Presley was a shipping
Priscilla 15 we have a long,

655
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:33,170
rich history of pedophiles,
perverts and rapists who are beloved.

656
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,780
It's true. Why the public? It
doesn't fucking matter. Ooh, yeah.

657
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,420
Oh God. Yeah. Oh, isn't that nice?

658
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,870
Women Bait.

659
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,030
Ah, Kevin Lord, what is happening
in this world? I don't know.

660
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,670
We are in the upside down this, this last
couple of years. It's just been bonkers,

661
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:01,420
right? It's been nuts. Yeah. It's
a great time to be a comedian now,

662
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,060
that's for sure. Fuck, man.
Yeah. But it'll be fun.

663
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,410
It'll be interesting to see
where this storyline goes.

664
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,160
I'm fascinated and that kind
of fascinated if he keeps,

665
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,940
if this makes them go like,
ah, it takes a break. No, no,

666
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,230
let's put bets on it right now.

667
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,390
Do you think he's that
clueless and oblivious and
checked out that he's going to

668
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,890
persist? I think, does he
have the self awareness to go,

669
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,920
I better take a step back.
I think he,

670
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,820
he accepted that he was going to
take his lumps when it started.

671
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,900
Like he knew when I, whatever the,
whatever, whatever time I come back,

672
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:38,960
there's gonna be some backlash.
So it's like, just go with it.

673
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,310
So I think it's going to persevere.
I think he's, well, I think,

674
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,780
I think he's going to go,
I knew this part was going to happen.

675
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:47,900
Just stay in it so that it kind of,
you know what I mean?

676
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:52,340
Stay the course so that the initial
blow back is the worst part.

677
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,030
And then just you keep doing it.
He's going to Trump his way through it.

678
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,940
I think so. And I think, um, it'll
be interesting to see how, you know,

679
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,940
reactions go with the clubs because
you need a platform to do standup. Yes,

680
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:07,640
he did. He the venue. So, um,

681
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,100
obviously a couple of clubs
just let them do those Poppins.

682
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:13,280
Will the other New York clubs go through
or some of them going to be like,

683
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:17,420
fuck no, it's just interesting to see
how it is and what I brought up. The,

684
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,620
whether you're not you announced or
surprise people with it, I think is a big,

685
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,010
big difference.
I say announce guys,

686
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,860
I think you should give the audience
and I agree with you to let,

687
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:31,860
let the market dictate. That's what we're
all about in this country. He let the,

688
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,070
let

689
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,690
the market tell you whether or not
it's working. But man, I don't know.

690
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,050
I don't know if I'd be interested to see
it. Only if he talks about the truth.

691
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,850
Only if he addresses it. Am I
interested in hearing about, you know,

692
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,873
uh,

693
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,830
the stuff he was talking about before and
now all I want to know about is what's

694
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:51,750
life been like for you
the last nine months?

695
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:55,470
It must've been fucking horrendous
and there's a way to make that funny.

696
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:58,020
You talk about the lows of being a pariah.

697
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,010
Many people don't get to experience that.
That's pretty fucking fascinating,

698
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,050
right? It's true. No. We'll see.
Yeah. Who's on board with him?

699
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,350
Definitely not Hannah Gatsby.
She's got a lot more to say on this.

700
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,990
She's got her work cut out
for another hour right now,

701
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,320
but just I'm writing frantically writing.
She made that.

702
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,040
She did an interview where she said if
Louie comes back, my work is not done.

703
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,130
That's what I'm saying. She's just
pan is at home writing right now.

704
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,800
She got her a whole hour.
It just written.

705
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,530
She'd be great to be having that seat
right now. Where does she live? She,

706
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:35,060
she's English and Australian.
Ah, we got to get her anything.

707
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,710
She was in New York for a while.
She might be in New York right now.

708
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,560
Well that'd be great if they
were on the same line. Oh my God.

709
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,400
She's like her head just exploded
backstage and these came out and was like,

710
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,020
the biggest piece of shit ever is back.

711
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,730
I would just be here to ear smiles at
that show and that's head explodes.

712
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,900
Oh my God.
She was just like,

713
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,720
just straight up. I've got
fucking cunt bag. So Matt,

714
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,270
just shit on everybody
there. Oh Man. Yeah.

715
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,770
You know the world is changing and by the
way, that is Donald Trump's um, method.

716
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:18,480
Whenever some huge shit breaks,

717
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:22,920
like the stormy Daniels and
this last one was the Guy Colin.

718
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,360
He's just like, I don't give a shit
fake news fuckers. Let's go. Wow.

719
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:31,140
That was brazen.
Like don't give a fuck.

720
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,880
I just attacks whoever he's like,
like cone was his lawyer,

721
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,930
his personal lawyer and fix her for
years. And then he's, he tweeted out,

722
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,350
if you need a lawyer,
I would not hire Michael Cohen.

723
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:45,850
He's terrible lawyer.
What are you talking?

724
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,130
Just like he sucks whenever someone
gets turned out of his thing,

725
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:53,760
there are a piece of shit like I'm a row
set too high or that piece of shit like

726
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,740
you did. Hugh did Weirdo. Weirdo.

727
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,820
Very fucking crazy. Yeah. I'm
excited to see what his next move is.

728
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,180
I am guessing more
obliviousness more entitlement.

729
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,100
That'd be more mad at me.
I'm moving along.

730
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,190
You guys ever noticed how,
you know,

731
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:17,750
we talked about how much
we hate people that uh,

732
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,620
speak on speakerphone in public. Yes.
This, this guy wrote in, hey water champ.

733
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,660
I found another level of,

734
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:28,350
of noxious public behavior and this also
makes me crazy similar to the talking

735
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:30,040
on speakerphone.
This guy

736
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,510
in this video attached decided to
double park between two spaces. Ah,

737
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:38,980
half his car into the lane and
uh,

738
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,090
so that he could do his scratch off
tickets for this while he waited for his

739
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:47,920
party to run into the store instead of,
you know, parking like a human being. Um,

740
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,630
can't wait to see you. Philly Burt's do
specialists. Good. But he's still fat.

741
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:54,190
Piss on me and beat me.

742
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,090
I'm a hot white come hot white
trash come dump right after that.

743
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,750
What was it? He goes, I'm a hot white
trash. Let's fuck. Let's fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

744
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,360
New level of ass over here. Double
Park. Two spots of his legs. Still

745
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,330
waiting for his to go into
the grocery store and a,

746
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,080
he was just doing the scratch
offs like half parked in the spot.

747
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,300
There's still sitting there and the
guy just got in the car, Bro. Yeah.

748
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,230
Double parked in the grocery store

749
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,450
so no one can pull through and no one
can work in either one of these spots.

750
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,640
Really even go this lame right now
cause he's still like half out. Totally.

751
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,700
Oh my God. Parking space. So

752
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,180
it's total asshole.

753
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,060
This guy gets a bullet when he thinks
oh to two to the head for sure. This,

754
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,010
I'm somebody in front of us.
His family to somebody emailed this,

755
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:49,270
which is unbelievable.

756
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:53,770
It says all our mommies to take
the cake during my sister's burial,

757
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:59,170
my grandmother answered her phone as
my family was standing around the grave

758
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:03,850
site crying. This was, as you
could imagine, disturbing.

759
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,320
But what really upset my family
was when she loudly said,

760
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,080
yeah,
they're putting her in the ground now.

761
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,320
Love the show. Keep up the great
work. Love the Sissy of Maryland.

762
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:21,910
That is so fucking funny and terrible.
That should be a scene in a movie.

763
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,330
Oh my God. Answering the phone at her. Uh,

764
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,110
I guess granddaughters funeral.
It's crazy. It'd be like, yeah,

765
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:32,950
they're putting her in
the ground right now. God,

766
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,340
human beings again up, Olivia
says, shit, we're doomed.

767
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,780
You know, we're, uh, we've been
talking about it for the listeners. Uh,

768
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,050
we're coming up on 10 years of a marriage.
Oh,

769
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,930
I thought you meant the show.
I was like, really? Yeah.

770
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,380
You and I have been married for 10
years almost. We've been doing the show.

771
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:57,660
It's going to be nine years pretty
soon. I think. That's crazy. Yeah. Um,

772
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,970
it's amazing how we've evolved.
I know this show,

773
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,710
it was started out as far it's
and mentally ill people know.

774
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,100
Anyways, there's, you know, you're,
you're always thinking like,

775
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:13,550
what can I do to keep this
spice ally? What can I do to
keep it going? Oh boy. Um,

776
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,440
and then you, you, you
start thinking of, you know,

777
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,920
I want to do something special for the
10 year anniversary. So good for you.

778
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:25,000
So get it. It makes you happy
and excited. So I found, um,

779
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,070
what would be like a boy,
I guess a seminar of type so

780
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,630
we could go to and just see if you
like it, you'd have to check out.

781
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,483
I had a feeling

782
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,450
making sound together is one of
the natural ways to have intimacy.

783
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,070
Bill 82. Right? Yeah. And there's
a continuum of it where, you know,

784
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,040
there's a really, really casual
way, like the most casual way.

785
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,150
He and I were just going lab, Nah, Eh,

786
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,090
you know,
we're just start playing

787
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,280
just like vocal. Yeah.
I got intimate. Yeah.

788
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,790
All the way up to what Debbie does know,
teaching.

789
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,670
Really teaching a structure.
Yeah.

790
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,680
Lots and lots of schools.
There's a lot of education to be had,

791
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,700
so I totally love and local and from,
because you're trusting the moment.

792
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:17,270
It's whatever wants to come
out right in here right now.

793
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,760
Really, really believing that what
is going to come out is going to be,

794
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,940
I'm going to file for
divorce if you do this.

795
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,280
It's pretty cool.

796
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,040
I want to go. I'd rather blow my
brains. I rather watch Lisa Kate,

797
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:46,970
your golf all day, every raising Rasta.
Kristen. That's a cool necklace. Huh?

798
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,240
I'm going to get to that necklace where
you don't have to remember what's going

799
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,610
to happen. No, that makes a lot.

800
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,170
It gives me a different relationship
with the future resident.

801
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,260
No, it's just really tough. I just,

802
00:52:02,261 --> 00:52:06,150
the world is fascinating with how many
different types of people there are.

803
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,420
I mean, dumb ones. Yeah.

804
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,600
But I also just mean,
wow,

805
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,790
it's good that these people
found each other as a group.

806
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,960
I know there's that positive spin
and then the, I mean, I hate them.

807
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,550
I'm saying terrible.

808
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:22,180
I just can't believe they
also exist in the same world
I live in. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,900
You know, these are the people that
you pass and the trader Joe's. Yeah.

810
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,260
It's guys at Ralph's right now. It's
fucking dumb necklace. There's a way that,

811
00:52:29,261 --> 00:52:29,710
you know,
there's a

812
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:34,260
chance you could start a small
conversation with this guy. Like, Hey,

813
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:39,150
is this that peanut butter
that has the uh, yeah, natural
oils. And he's like, yeah.

814
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,890
And then he goes, uh, he would try to
vocal Improv and you're like, what?

815
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,630
Like, you know, I have the group tell you
about it. Yeah, no shit. I don't know.

816
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,110
He's like, just give it a shot. No, I
don't. I don't think that's for me. Oh,

817
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,233
I think,
uh,

818
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,860
Whoa,
whoa.

819
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,680
This is the worst. This is worse.
This is worse than scanning.

820
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,130
Is it worse than the, I was
just thinking about that. Uh,

821
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,210
the boner that guys got
handloading a little more skill.

822
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,790
A little more like I've got a lot more
skilled and he's got the most scale of

823
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:25,320
the stain align guy saying that United
States United States stay United. Yeah.

824
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,100
This is, you know what,
this is, I need attention.

825
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,230
I need so much attention.

826
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,980
I'm going to inflict this to horse
shit onto another group of people.

827
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,580
It is that who needs so much
attention to what else it is.

828
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,230
I don't have a real skill or
talent, right. For music and see,

829
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,220
but um, you'll let me feel
like I do and this thing,

830
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,740
can you sing? No. You want
to act like you can say,

831
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:55,330
you know it does remind me of a,

832
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,610
used to have a bit where you talk about
how toddlers tell you stories. Oh yeah,

833
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,760
this is,
this is akin to like it

834
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,970
and you're like, nobody wants,
okay, that was cute. Yeah.

835
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,220
This is a horrible,
here's the right through their plug.

836
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,950
Hey guys,
you want to sing together

837
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,893
Bob,

838
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,170
this is kind of how you do it though.

839
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:36,260
Coming to a space near you or
maybe later cause I'm kinda tired.

840
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:40,830
They listen to each other. Do it. That's
the part I don't understand. I don't know.

841
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:44,910
It just reminds me of when you sign
up for an Improv comedy troupe. Yes.

842
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:46,180
100% and write it.
You know,

843
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,160
usually the comics like the standups
and up going like, oh tapped out. No,

844
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:55,530
you can't really do this. This
is real. Cringy no, I know.

845
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:58,260
Cause I did like a couple of
Improv and I was like, I'm out.

846
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,720
This is not for me Bro. This is not
funny. Like this doesn't feel good. No,

847
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,620
it feels wrong. Stupid. We fill out
like I'm going to be embarrassed,

848
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,570
but I mean they all want
attention individually.

849
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,810
I'm saying like how can they have the
patience to listen to everyone else's

850
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:17,730
bullshit? I Dunno. Do you have to learn
how to listen really listen or no,

851
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:22,820
you are. You can I go with that?
Can I really listen? Oh Shit.

852
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,010
You asshole.
Are bringing,

853
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,280
so we're weaving our sounds together in
the moment and it's absolutely just soul

854
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:36,410
satisfying. Oof. Embracing
that vulnerability.

855
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,620
There you go. It's like acting class I
don't like that I don't like long ago.

856
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,160
And then being able to do it with the
others is definitely coming together.

857
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:49,040
Miss of vocal in spirit,
mind and body.

858
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,220
That sounds like fun. Like I like
that you like his pitch. Well,

859
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:53,540
I like the idea of all that,

860
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,790
but that doesn't feel like
that's going to get me there.

861
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,190
Do you know what else would make me make
my asshole? Pucker what I drum circle.

862
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,670
Oh yeah. It's like similar. I've
seen those live a few times.

863
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,670
I've been invited to a few and I was
like, no thanks. I think I know myself.

864
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,080
I'm surprised you didn't go.

865
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,100
It's usually Spanish guys or I was a
Puerto Rican guy. That environment horse.

866
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,290
I know my people. I know, I
know he was, he's married,

867
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,840
but the big Puerto Rican guy and he
goes to other fucking married guy. Yeah.

868
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,430
And he goes, come over on Sunday.
We're doing our drum circle.

869
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:27,220
You're really gonna like it.
And I go, what's a drum circle?

870
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,280
I kind of knew them in San
Francisco and he's like, we all,

871
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:34,240
we just get high and drunk, whatever.
And you just, you just bang on the Bongo.

872
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:37,780
And I go, I don't play the,
this is the million years.

873
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,040
I was 24 oh boy. Now I found
out later surprise. He and his

874
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,680
wife were swingers.
Yeah.

875
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:49,570
So what were the drum circle would
have come out at some point? Yeah.

876
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,660
Just come over you inviting this coming
through other married, spic friend.

877
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,940
Like you're like, oh, he's Spanish
and he's married. But I mean,

878
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,780
I just talked to him
on Facebook sometimes.

879
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,790
I said, good. We all went to
college together. So a cage,

880
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:07,660
I'm telling you once every few sky
here. No, this guy's a grown man.

881
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:11,140
This was an adult person and I
was 24 this is the other guy.

882
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,280
We all went to college together.
I'm saying,

883
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,450
oh, every one to four years there's
an update about, oh, you almost,

884
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,510
that's being almost a lot boy.

885
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,050
Oh.

886
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,490
Or Gall FTT RTD artwork coming in.
This one's by Jake.

887
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:34,290
That's what's the carrot about.
Oh, you haven't ever seen that now.

888
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,591
Oh,

889
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:39,591
there he was in like Ukraine
or Bruce or something.

890
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:42,660
And the president handed them
a carrot and he was like,

891
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:46,050
thanks to getting the carrot you never
seen. That must have been like a cultural,

892
00:57:46,051 --> 00:57:48,840
like in Belarus, it's a symbol
of fertility or something stupid.

893
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,920
He just starts eating his carrot.
It's a very popular meme.

894
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,470
Pretty good stuff there.

895
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:56,760
Wait,
can I,

896
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,350
can I give you my update on the discussion
we had about Forrest Gump in Gma?

897
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Yeah. I really liked this. This was a

898
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,223
Janna.

899
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,500
So a couple of episodes back,

900
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,160
we had a discussion on
whether or not it's ethical,

901
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:20,140
uh,
to make love to a,

902
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,710
what do they call it? Developmentally
challenged person. Tom,

903
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,370
what about them? What are they called?
Developmentally challenged. I mean,

904
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:32,400
what's the PC? What am I supposed to
call him? Okay, so I don't, you know,

905
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,350
I don't want to ruffle feathers
by not using the right PC term.

906
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,930
The certainly this is not a
feather ruffling type of show.

907
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:43,280
So I would hope that you would
respect the feathers. So,

908
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,590
uh,
it was whether or not it's okay too,

909
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,850
if they're really attractive to
have sexual relations with somebody,

910
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:53,960
have to have diminished mental capacity
and we can the conclusion that no,

911
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:57,710
it was not because Forrest
Gump actually is a movie.

912
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,860
The whole premise is that Jenny has
sex with forests and that's really not

913
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:05,870
ethical. It's not cool. And I ended up
being one of the most beloved movies,

914
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,330
so Steph to death on Twitter,

915
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:13,331
at Steph to death rites to add to the
Forrest Gump slash Jenny conversation.

916
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,280
As much as I love the film.
If the gender roles,

917
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,630
we don't like talking
about gender on there,

918
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:22,631
she certainly don't resent that triggered
if the gender were reversed and it was

919
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:26,300
a guy coming back and taking advantage
of a mentally challenged girls,

920
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:31,070
it would be a much different
movie. True. That 100% movies,

921
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,610
that's just a porno. I also
was a red one really, um,

922
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,900
well-written assessment breakdown of
the film that I don't have with me.

923
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:46,420
Um, about how she was horribly
traumatized, which I didn't remember.

924
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,830
She was abused by her father. Yeah,
that makes sense. Yeah. She's basically,

925
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:54,950
you know, a broken person. Ah, yes she is.

926
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:57,830
And she was traveling around
as a hippie doing drugs,

927
00:59:57,831 --> 00:59:59,450
trying to find her way in the world,

928
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:04,630
which gives you permission
to have sex with yes.

929
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,830
Developmentally disabled person and
get aids. So it's all excusable. Right.

930
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,870
It's almost a,

931
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,910
somebody else wrote in mommy jeans while
talking about Tom Starbucks experience,

932
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:17,990
only mentioned one LJ little jeans
that she waited in the truck with.

933
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,190
This begs the question,

934
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,150
did she actually give birth to a second
LJ or did she really just have a huge

935
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:26,630
dump? Oh, you guys think it's
a conspiracy that there's no,

936
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,670
no tiny baby around here. Want to know,
hey man, these tips are feeling it. Well,

937
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,660
we just didn't take the newborn out that
day. We left the newborn, uh, in a crate,

938
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:38,660
right? Tom Left it in the
crate, some water and some food,

939
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:41,600
and then now the did
the newborn was at home.

940
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:46,640
Some other FTT RTD submissions.
Forget girl troubles. Rim,

941
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:51,140
the dude's Ah, four GT
rally truck drivers. Yeah.

942
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,660
Fun Gun tricks.
Rallies the Democrats.

943
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,690
Finding God's teachings
replaces the demons.

944
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:03,620
Wait, wait. Fighting guys. And finding,

945
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:07,700
finding God's teachings.
Teachings replaces the demons.

946
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,550
A failing.
God's teachings replenishes the devil.

947
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,980
Fabulous golden tweens.
Resist their DNA for good times.

948
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:23,610
Remember to dance. Those are all of these
are, and here's the thing about f, g,

949
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:28,000
D, F, g, t RTD, is that
it's open to interpretation.

950
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,340
That's really the beautiful thing
about it. Yeah, that's really,

951
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:35,120
there's no one definition of it. It's
just, it's all these things. Guys.

952
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,990
F Gt RTB.

953
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:49,480
Pretty good. Uh, good.

954
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,410
What else are you got a,
I'm sorry. I was just,

955
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:54,650
those were all of those who were just
mesmerized by your thoughts. Yeah,

956
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:59,060
I kind of was so hard out. Oh,

957
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:01,820
my back hurts when he going to
give me a back massage. Hey,

958
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:05,570
speaking of our 10th band a Smurf,
Ernie, we do have to celebrate it. Yeah.

959
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:10,530
What do you want to do? Just fart
real big. Oh my God, I forgot what.

960
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:14,660
Oh Man, I totally got
distracted. This, uh,

961
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:20,130
this guy, um, was in the
news. The security guard.

962
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,480
Yeah,
he got fired.

963
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,913
Okay.

964
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:46,260
So you get the point. I love
it. Yeah. It's good to hear.
I heard he got fired. Um,

965
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,170
and I'm trying to see if I can
actually get them on the phone.

966
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,700
Do you want to see if we can,

967
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,570
I would love to speak to him because
this man is the people's hero. Yeah.

968
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,130
He was doing the Lord's work here for
us. He really is. I forgot that I, um,

969
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,620
said I would, let me press pause
real quick and Tri Muggle peachy.

970
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:08,620
What do you do that? Okay. I'm
just gonna do this and we are back.

971
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,500
And the clip you just saw of course,
um,

972
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:17,610
was from the actual footage that
was recorded by and released by one,

973
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:24,580
Paul Florida.
The security guard,

974
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:29,581
who in my opinion was unjustly fired from
his job for simply singing a different

975
01:03:32,051 --> 01:03:35,560
way. Um, he just, you, you, you,

976
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,110
you made funny in my opinion,

977
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,950
just short 32nd clips of yourself at work.
Yeah.

978
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,440
Farting. Um, and did, did it start
out of boredom? I mean, is that,

979
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,680
you know, where you just like, like
when you first started doing it?

980
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,200
Um, so first of all, if your video
froze for me, I see that that's not,

981
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,570
that's not a big deal though. Um, but
yeah, I mean it just started off, uh,

982
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,590
just the acoustics in the hospital lobby.
Um, you know, I let one rip one day. Yeah.

983
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:09,170
I didn't want to hold it in
any longer. And uh, yeah,
the acoustics just, you know,

984
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,960
gave it, this is life, this volume.
And so the next time it happened, um,

985
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:17,630
I sent a video to my group chat
and they, they loved it, you know,

986
01:04:17,631 --> 01:04:20,630
just some guys from home and
another guy was down here and yeah,

987
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:22,490
they love this raptor a couple of times.
They were just like,

988
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:25,100
you need to share this to the world.
Yes.

989
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:29,580
So after some brainstorming and stuff
like that and came up with, uh, uh,

990
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:33,020
Paul Flirt Moniker, you know, which was
just fantastic. And I'm a security guard.

991
01:04:33,021 --> 01:04:35,990
I got the hair cut, they got the
mustache bat, you know, all the,

992
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,770
all the key things. And so we just,
you know, boom. Went with that.

993
01:04:39,771 --> 01:04:42,050
I started posting the videos
right to the Instagram. Um,

994
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:45,410
it's been about six months. Yeah.
So in that, so you're doing that,

995
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,430
are you doing pretty much videos daily?
I'm guessing. I tried to do on every day.

996
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:53,150
Um, I really wish that I could
fart on command and just, you know,

997
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:56,710
have that going for me.
Or for your daily farts?

998
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,530
Did you have a diet and it was just, no, I
just, you know, I just, you know, I'm fat.

999
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:05,000
I eat food. I love food, like
food is my thing. I love to cook.

1000
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:08,330
I love to go out and eat food and all
that. So I would just hope that, you know,

1001
01:05:08,331 --> 01:05:11,850
in the amalgam of crap that I
ate would produce, you know,

1002
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,150
you know the fart factory by the way,

1003
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,980
it was not lost on us that you had uh,
wide range

1004
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,813
of farts,

1005
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:24,490
little squeakers and big bulkers and
you had the engine revs and you mean you

1006
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:29,290
really are an artist artist.
That means a lot.

1007
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,220
Yeah. So I mean we definitely enjoyed it.
So you're doing this for a while. It's,

1008
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,030
it's harmless fun is what it seems like.

1009
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:42,330
So how like everything came in the
news like a week ago is that when the

1010
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:45,200
employers took notice,
like somebody took care of it.

1011
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:50,350
So this went on for like six months
without them. Any, anything with nothing.

1012
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:53,890
Nobody knew, nobody saw it,
heard it. Smelts it, anything.

1013
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:58,120
It was just me doing my thing until,
until it got picked up by a,

1014
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,540
I think barstool sports on
Instagram and then, you know,

1015
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,600
slash Sunday night and my
Instagram just blew up.

1016
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,470
I went from 500 followers
Sunday night to 5,000, uh,

1017
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,850
by like midnight that night. Yeah. You're
going to have some more, some more.

1018
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,880
So, so I also watched, we haven't
played it on our show yet,

1019
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:22,350
but I watched the footage of
you getting fired. Yeah. Which,

1020
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:26,530
which was amazing that to see that take
place because that guy, it was funny,

1021
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:29,710
like your superiors like turn that
off. You're like, I'm not filming you.

1022
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:32,950
And he's like, and you actually go like,
are you firing me? And he's like, yeah.

1023
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:37,340
You're like, okay, then I'll just keep
this role. What are you gonna do about it?

1024
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:41,350
Yeah, we've got fire me
again. Um, now can I ask you,

1025
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:46,150
is there a Mrs Flirt and your life? There
is not a missus Florida. No ma'am. Well,

1026
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:49,070
maybe after this era as you
might find your nose. Yeah.

1027
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,730
I've been getting hit up by people saying,
I don't know why,

1028
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:54,420
but this is sexy as hell. They
tried to talk to me. Honestly.

1029
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:02,950
That is something. Yeah. So of course
what everybody you mean, you know,

1030
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:04,080
obviously,
uh,

1031
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:08,860
I created a petition to have a
statue of you erected in DC. Um,

1032
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,870
I'm hoping that tonight when I do Kona,

1033
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:17,860
they let me talk about it in
the preinterview they said
yes and you can't always

1034
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:22,150
dictate how those things go,
but hopefully that will get on the air.

1035
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,590
Um, but what I guess what everyone
also wants to know is like, you know,

1036
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,880
the, the, the simple fact of it all is you
were a guy with a job who lost his job.

1037
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,380
What's going to happen now for you?

1038
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:37,420
Are you going to pursue this
lane as this great farter?

1039
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,900
Like what are you going to do?
Yeah,

1040
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:44,130
so I'm keeping the content going
is number one for me. Yeah,

1041
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,360
just try to keep people love it.
Why not?

1042
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:49,030
Why not keep giving them what they
love regardless of anything else,

1043
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,150
mummy or whatnot,
that content needs to keep going.

1044
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,770
I've got the Patriot and set up,

1045
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:57,130
which I'm still not 100% on how all that
works and how to use that accurately

1046
01:07:57,131 --> 01:08:00,870
and efficiently. A lot of people
were afraid to use patriot.

1047
01:08:00,871 --> 01:08:04,030
And a lot of my followers,
they never heard of it, never
saw it. It was confusing.

1048
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:07,110
So they were like put up a go fund
me, put up a go fund me. But uh,

1049
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,850
I didn't want to beg for money and I
feel like go fund me is more of like a,

1050
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:11,980
just throw your money at me, you
know, whatever happens, happens.

1051
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:16,520
We're patriots like on creation
based stuff. Sure. So I set it up.

1052
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,370
People are donating. Um, so
that's something, but you know,

1053
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:23,090
we're going to keep puff
weren't on vacation coming
up, so we're gonna, you know,

1054
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:25,860
throw in a Hawaiian shirt, traveled
around to well known places, you know,

1055
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:29,810
let them rip all over. Oh, that's a great
idea. And if you thought of a website,

1056
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:33,260
maybe you have a website going,
I don't have a website.

1057
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:37,460
You got locked down that URL, dude. Yeah,
man, it's probably already locked down.

1058
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:41,240
Somebody, the amount of like the Internet,
you know, as you guys know is a crazy.

1059
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,760
It is. But you have, have you checked?
You've got to go check. Yeah. It's, um,

1060
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:48,050
puff fort.com is definitely taken already.
Um,

1061
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:51,020
I could probably get that from
whoever owns it though, maybe.

1062
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:53,760
Or just take of a variation,
you know? Yeah. You know,

1063
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:58,780
the fart authority or
something. And so, uh, I'm fine.

1064
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:02,000
I have to la next week to do
a TV show came to talk about,

1065
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,560
you can't talk about it not next week.
Thursday actually. So quick, so quick.

1066
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,750
I can't really talk about
what that is yet, but you
know, so things are in motion.

1067
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,491
That's great.
You know,

1068
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:13,280
we're trying to get shirts and all
merchant stuff like that. Just out.

1069
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,050
That's where something,
let me tell you Paul,

1070
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:20,051
we love your accessibility because there
is another fart person and we play it

1071
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:24,680
on the show and he's very at
reluctant to be in the spotlight

1072
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:29,820
if you've never looked up king
ass ripper. He is. Yeah. He's um,

1073
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:35,010
he is your brother from another
mother man and a very impressive work,

1074
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:38,070
but he's not a media savvy.

1075
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,550
Yeah, he doesn't want it then. You're
like the people's farther. That's right.

1076
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,490
The people is harder for white people.

1077
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,240
Kind of a elusive,
mysterious,

1078
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:53,800
just Kimbrough cause you don't
want to lose his job. I would be

1079
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:58,930
so surprised if he had a job. This
guy does not seem employable. Um,

1080
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,350
no, but we're big fans man. And um, you
know, we wish you nothing but the best.

1081
01:10:02,351 --> 01:10:06,790
So you know, if you get that site going,
you tell us about it, we'll plug it,

1082
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:10,360
hopefully we'll get a lot more signatures
on the petition to the statue that you

1083
01:10:10,361 --> 01:10:14,290
deserve. And um, uh, your
patrion if people want to know,

1084
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:16,510
is it just like at Paul Florida?
Slash patriotic,

1085
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:17,610
everything's,
yeah.

1086
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:21,980
Patriot and slash Paul Flirt calling
me slash Paul for Facebook, Instagram,

1087
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:23,000
all slash ball Ford.

1088
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,230
Great. I think, um,

1089
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:29,260
I think our audience is really going to
dig you and what you're doing and um,

1090
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,170
you know, it was a, it was a pleasure
to talk to you man. Yeah, man. Anytime.

1091
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,550
Yeah. And keep us, keep us posted on
what you end up doing. You know, if,

1092
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:43,470
if this travel thing goes or whatever,
where we'd be more than happy to,

1093
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:44,540
to plug it on our show.

1094
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:48,100
Excellent. Awesome. Thank you guys
so much. All right, buddy. Take care.

1095
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:53,370
See you guys say, wow. What
a real talent. You know,

1096
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,960
if anything,
your mom's house is broken.

1097
01:10:55,961 --> 01:11:00,961
So many talented people

that likes smelling farts.

1100
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:13,100
We had him on machines within a machines
within great singer. Talented rapper.

1101
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,800
Yup. We've cream fart. That's right.

1102
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:21,210
And we started his career in porn.
We hooked him up with it with porn people.

1103
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:25,680
Um, we also, yeah, a
beautiful guppies. Yeah.

1104
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,480
Try it out guys to try it out.
Guy became famous on this show.

1105
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:34,980
Made you into actors. You guys doing your
own monologues, interpretations of it.

1106
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,710
We have graced. Hi Mommy. Thanks genes.

1107
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:41,760
It's a many a drive through and now
Paul Flirt and now Paul, I got to say,

1108
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:46,500
I really like his person that
he wasn't, yeah, I'm above it.

1109
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:50,190
He wasn't too cool. He was like, it is
what it is. I'm going to keep doing it.

1110
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:55,200
I think it's great and I think he can
have a very lucrative social media career.

1111
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:55,560
Yeah.

1112
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,070
I think that this is a lane that a lot
of people like and enjoy his talent and

1113
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:03,420
why not? Why not go to his patrion
and help him out? And you know why?

1114
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:06,090
Why not people do it for just
being good looking right?

1115
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:07,890
Like that camera Alyse kid.
Dude,

1116
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,090
I can't tell you how many times have
ended up on an Instagram and you're like,

1117
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,090
you've never,
you've never heard of the person's name.

1118
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:19,230
And it's like 5.6 million phones for what?
Uh, they're hot, they're in a bikini,

1119
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:23,040
then they're a shirtless flexing.
They have great bodies. Like, okay,

1120
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,910
so they have great bodies. This guy has
a great talent. What about gray fighters?

1121
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:30,600
Yeah. What about him? Why doesn't he does
there? And then see someone will be like,

1122
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,820
well yeah, but I mean that hot chick,
you know, she's super hot. Like, yeah,

1123
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:39,690
that's it. But that's her God
given innate talent and this is,

1124
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:44,660
this guy's God given and let him run with
it. What is more American? Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:49,440
Paul flirts quest. I agree. I agree.
It's capitalism at its finest.

1126
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:53,100
I think it's great. Market demands
him well, good for him. You know,

1127
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:55,980
getting fired from that job might be
the best thing that ever happened to him

1128
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,480
because now he's going to go into this
lane. That's true. Yeah. Good for her.

1129
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:05,010
I like how he's like, I'm just fat and I
just eat a lot. Right. That's the best.

1130
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:08,880
Uh, the make come guy has
another message. Nope. No thanks.

1131
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,490
Hold on. Oh, I hate him so much. Huh?

1132
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,803
Hello out there.

1133
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,910
My Heart's good man.

1134
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:24,300
Couple of things that are
really going. Yeah, sure. Let's
go. All right. Let's start.

1135
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,670
Uh,
the television is not only on,

1136
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:31,650
but it's on full volume while you record
a video message to post to share with

1137
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:36,380
people that you want to listen to you.
Um, but Anderson Cooper today not right.

1138
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,980
Yeah. It's very interesting
listening to some very liberal media.

1139
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:45,570
Um, took the teeth out. It's also a
choice, but he shaped, so it's like,

1140
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:46,141
what do you like,

1141
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:51,141
what do you not like a framed
up real tight and starting with,

1142
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:56,010
I'm tired of white women, so it's
kind of a, Oh yeah, it's a kind of a,

1143
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,120
I'm triggered already. I mean, let's see
what you got to write this guy in email.

1144
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,860
What I'll make it comes
going to say right here.

1145
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,720
Hello out there with the American. I'm
kind of hot women last break. My heart.

1146
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:09,990
Certainly good man.
You work hard.

1147
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,900
Good bye everybody. Like the Bible says
apple fans. I don't think these people,

1148
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,670
yes,
but all good.

1149
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:23,100
I'm working on a beautiful woman
with a little peck, Michael.

1150
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,600
I don't think they really are out there.

1151
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:26,950
Yeah,

1152
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:31,950
a beautiful woman with a little pecker
plastic and this plot really thickens,

1153
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,050
Huh?
A beautiful woman.

1154
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,740
I'd be all good. Me. I'm working
on a beautiful walnut, right?

1155
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:44,300
Oh, maybe I'll get me a hermaphrodite.
Okay. That's what he said there.

1156
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,540
Is that what he wants? So that's what
he's saying. There's no women left.

1157
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:48,540
Maybe I'll get her magic.

1158
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,280
Oh, maybe I'll get me, I'm
working on more for diet,

1159
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:57,850
get donation. But for a little Pecker, I
don't think there really are out there.

1160
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:02,840
I think he's trying to ease his way into
feeling comfortable with a transsexual,

1161
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,630
a maybe or he's trying to be funny and
it's just maybe I still don't understand

1162
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:12,280
the choice to not put your teeth in
for a video that goes on the soliciting

1163
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:13,300
love.
Yeah.

1164
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:18,130
Don't care about race, you know,
maybe an eight him, Roman or

1165
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:24,870
to now be accident IBM black when I'm
asking taxpayers to him so that he doesn't

1166
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,040
break your heart.

1167
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,130
Okay,

1168
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:30,130
well it's always scanning
was just laying there in bed

1169
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,100
one time.
They weren't my bud out,

1170
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:44,380
so I'm just out here looking. You
believe that coverage, God bless.

1171
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:46,210
Have a good night.
Able to compose the question.

1172
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:52,280
I still can't get past the decision
to not put your teeth in and maybe,

1173
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,750
I mean it might be I'm vain.
Yeah. But even just leaving
or just around the house.

1174
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,600
I got to tell you, I can't imagine
walking around without teeth.

1175
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:04,840
It's a lot. It's a lot.
How do you get that way?

1176
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:05,740
I Dunno.

1177
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,610
Your level of not giving a fuck
is pretty high, dude. Yeah.

1178
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:14,320
No teeth. No teeth is serious. And then
to be like, I'm sick of white women,

1179
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:16,810
I want to demanding shit.

1180
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,670
Yeah. Yeah. He nasty as hell.

1181
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:25,040
Yeah.
Really something.

1182
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,730
Is it true skinny women don't,

1183
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:29,850
don't do anything and the black
women are like this and all that.

1184
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,750
I have, I don't, I don't
know. This is not my world.

1185
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,300
This is this man's interesting.
Right.

1186
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,190
Okay. If anyone has any ideas
for our 10th anniversary. Yeah.

1187
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:45,440
That was nice. Yeah. Well you're not
supposed to call them that anymore.

1188
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:50,330
I don't think so. Oh, you were
saying that you stay United. Um,

1189
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,000
it was like your favorite guy.
He is really talented. His time.

1190
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,170
He's doing a Michael Jackson
Song. Oh, here we go.

1191
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,400
I don't know what you want is to you,

1192
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,850
dude.
Dude,

1193
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:25,510
dude, dude, man,

1194
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,140
I don't know what song that is.
No,

1195
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:34,920
but I think those people were amused
and terrified at the same time.

1196
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,720
People in the car, we're like,
oh cause he's fully in their car.

1197
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:42,350
Like leaned in. Yeah. In his mouth.

1198
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:46,430
It's all open for teeth are out and
they're like, I'm stay, you'll notice.

1199
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,640
Stay United States, United
States. United States. Yeah.

1200
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:53,250
I don't know what's song that if an,
if you guys know what that was,

1201
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:55,860
please let us know. Are you sure it's
Michael Jackson? That's what it said.

1202
01:17:55,861 --> 01:17:59,190
I don't know. I don't know
actually. I really don't know.

1203
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:03,030
I don't like them laughing
at him. No, I know.

1204
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,760
It makes me upset cause he's my
guy. I know. Of course. Yeah.

1205
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:09,760
Don't laugh at my guy like that. Like I
get that. He's funny. It's, it is for me.

1206
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,220
I just, I feel like I'm protective of
him. Of course. That's your guy now.

1207
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,400
He's my dude. Don't
fucking laugh at him. Dude.

1208
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:18,813
What?
What can you do?

1209
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:25,670
We don't serve chicken nuggets.

1210
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,570
Fantastic.

1211
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,310
Don't you fucking run away?

1212
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,373
God.

1213
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:50,963
Nope.

1214
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:05,010
I'm going to go in front of me.
Drugs or they're on drugs to health.

1215
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,090
Everybody's on drugs.
My father used to say,

1216
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:13,220
everybody's on drugs. Everybody's fucking
stupid. That's a good drive through.

1217
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:14,780
Do you know?
Did you hear about the,

1218
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:16,850
I'm just going to turn
into her ultimate form. No,

1219
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:22,300
the lady that was a working the drive
through that left her microphone on.

1220
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:27,590
No. So when the guy pulls up, he
just hears her having a conversation.

1221
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:32,890
Before I even made it to the clock and
clock and I'm here for, and I said, oh no,

1222
01:19:32,891 --> 01:19:36,580
I'm not.
I'm just my ass right back.

1223
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:41,680
No, if I'm at clean on my
day off, I'm a clean at home.

1224
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:47,740
It was hotter than a motherfucker
in your name. I'm like,

1225
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,620
not cleaning in this.
She's got me fucked up.

1226
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:55,690
I'm kicking my ass right back at that.
And you're out and you walk down. No,

1227
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:59,620
I know. Great. I'll tell you when you come
back in to work, when to get this order.

1228
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:04,330
So Brittany, she's a Joe. Okay.

1229
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,480
Loaner twain. Ours. Right week after
she couldn't pay her phone bill number.

1230
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:14,370
We were discussing that. No, I
just let her borrow $20 phone bill.

1231
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:18,280
Girl.
I had to ask her twice for that.

1232
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:25,200
Finally she gives me $10
of it, right? It's correct.

1233
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:29,970
And then says, Oh hey, I got weed for
sale off. Give you a front. I'm like pit,

1234
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:32,280
you can't afford to get fraud.
You owe people money.

1235
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:37,630
This is so great. I would love
to hear this. I know that,

1236
01:20:37,631 --> 01:20:40,190
I mean this dude had the
right idea. Yeah. You know,

1237
01:20:40,191 --> 01:20:41,930
I remember when people started,

1238
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,800
but with the cameras came on cell
phones and everybody was panicked. Like,

1239
01:20:45,801 --> 01:20:48,890
what's the world going to be like
when you can record anything?

1240
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,630
Like the got pretty fucking
awesome. Actually. You did
the videos like this exist.

1241
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:56,450
This is the greatest
thing. Yeah. I like that.

1242
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:59,260
Because this guy telling you about this.
Not In the same,

1243
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:04,640
yeah. I almost said to her, okay, give me
an end guy away. But then I'm like, no,

1244
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:08,440
let me just see if she'll actually give
me the damn cash. You know? I don't know.

1245
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:12,700
She had some low looking dude in
the car with her yesterday. Yeah.

1246
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,340
Oh look like he's all there on the head.
Well,

1247
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,970
I apologize for the way.
How can I help you?

1248
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,200
Oh yeah.
Let me get your two for four one sausage,

1249
01:21:26,201 --> 01:21:29,620
egg mcmuffin and one bacon, egg
and cheese. Mcgriddle please.

1250
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:34,810
She got fired. No, too bad. Yeah,

1251
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:39,770
that sucks. It does suck sex.

1252
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:41,610
How would it kept for,

1253
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:46,610
on course will be better than having
that lady represent the company?

1254
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,400
Um, earlier I was going to show you
this footage of your dad. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1255
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,840
Let's see.
I haven't talked to him in a while.

1256
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,250
The best methamphetamine
have anywhere in this bar.

1257
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,500
I would have to 55 gallon drum and I would
pull a lawn chair in the middle and I

1258
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:08,690
would stack Budweiser this high and I
would have to titty dancers dancing on the

1259
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:13,190
tables, stripping and having a good time
and I would start drinking beer and the

1260
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:17,270
mainstream would be in here ready to go
except for the aluminum and I will drink

1261
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:21,560
the beer and drop one lemon cane in this
side and one in this side and continue

1262
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:25,460
until the bubble started jumping out of
the camp and started tearing the skin

1263
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:26,294
off of you.

1264
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:31,080
Pretty good stuff. How can we
not talk to him? Um, my dad,

1265
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,220
hi Deb participates and things I
don't want him to participate in. Like

1266
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:39,430
one day I had this girl been over the
toolbox in the back of a pickup and she

1267
01:22:39,431 --> 01:22:43,510
was screaming more baby more, maybe
more. We passed by this buffalo,

1268
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:46,390
he had a dog about this long.
Then the hand to the ground.

1269
01:22:46,391 --> 01:22:49,990
I screamed at him and says, Hey, I love
some help over here. She wants more.

1270
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:54,830
She looked over at the buffalo. She said,
oh, I'd never leave. He had that. Awesome.

1271
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,890
That's a good story.
That's a good story.

1272
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,980
Do you like him so wrong?

1273
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,320
This is what's wrong with our country.
This guy,

1274
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,590
I'm all getting on nap and everybody
gets within that distance, gets stabbed.

1275
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:17,060
Anybody,
anybody stay away from me?

1276
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:22,360
I want to die of old age and stage 89
I'm going to be chased out of the bedroom

1277
01:23:23,091 --> 01:23:27,680
of the 18 year old jealous husband and
I'm going to trip over fence made out of

1278
01:23:27,681 --> 01:23:31,790
crank into the street and get hit by a
Budweiser truck going 80 miles an hour.

1279
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,100
That's my idea going out.

1280
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:38,090
It's pretty creative actually. He's not
bad. He's thought about it. Yeah. I never,

1281
01:23:38,091 --> 01:23:40,180
I wasn't. I don't think that was
in the moment. I think he's like,

1282
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,960
this is my real fantasy is jam.
Well good for him.

1283
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,430
I'm pretty good stuff, Huh? Okay.

1284
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,840
Would you rather French
kiss and you got a French,

1285
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:57,580
that guy, God dammit or
the stay United guy. Oof.

1286
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,360
I like to stay United so much more.

1287
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:06,550
His mouth probably smells worse
than the next guy. I Dunno.

1288
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:10,330
Well cause he's always got mouth
rot to. Yeah. But stay United.

1289
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:14,140
He's been drinking in the sun all day.
Beer like hot beer breath.

1290
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,900
I don't think that the math master brushes
his teeth in prison. No, of course not.

1291
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,630
But he doesn't drink beer
all day in the hot sun.

1292
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:26,860
The beer breath is really what I'm
thinking about. Yeah. And the rot.

1293
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,940
You got to pick one state.
United Way United.

1294
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:34,080
I think I'm still going to stay United
cause math guys just, he's never,

1295
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:39,190
he's real nasty. He's a really nice and
he's violent, you know. Yeah. That too.

1296
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,650
Like the math master might
be like, ah, let's do it.

1297
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:49,420
And then he just fucking shank
stabbing you. Yeah. Yeah. It's true.

1298
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:53,980
Somebody said they made um, a studio
g parody or something. Not Cool.

1299
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:54,991
Well,

1300
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:59,670
I guess it's official taking a shit really
wasn't sure about this at the start,

1301
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,300
but a friend of mine said something
to me that made all kinds of stuff.

1302
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:07,740
Think about it as a conversation between
the food and your digestive system.

1303
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:11,340
I like that and has
some funding on my own.

1304
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:16,460
It's turning between my ass in the sewer
I really liked that allows us into each

1305
01:25:17,221 --> 01:25:20,320
other's lives or in this case,
the rest of them.

1306
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,990
What I think about the kind of shits I
want to take, want to take big shifts,

1307
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,690
smooth shifts.
Most of the shits,

1308
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:29,790
I'm going to take her just
rough shits like this.

1309
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,870
This is just who I am,
so this is like an asshole.

1310
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,720
I say let the conversation begin.

1311
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:43,950
Wow. Bravo sir. Good
work is really good. Wow.

1312
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,813
Just a reminder.
Yeah.

1313
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:48,790
Has Anybody does that? I guess it's
official. We're now on Facebook.

1314
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,750
I really wasn't sure
about this start then.

1315
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,930
A friend of mine says just made
all kinds of sense. So creepy.

1316
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,940
You should think of it more as
a conversation. Okay. All right.

1317
01:25:57,941 --> 01:25:59,230
I can only take so much.
Oh

1318
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,550
damn creepy. You know, we
haven't watched that in a while.

1319
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,610
I forgot how like creepy he is.

1320
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:09,950
Let the conversation begin.
Yeah, he is so weird.

1321
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,520
How do you feel about public kinks
and stuff? What public kinkiness.

1322
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,870
What does that mean? Well, I know

1323
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:20,780
you're talking to they'll most
normal boring person sexually.

1324
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:25,520
Do you feel like, um, he's too
weird for you though, Garth. Garth.

1325
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:30,710
I think he's got demons that are darker
as in anything you and I could ever

1326
01:26:30,711 --> 01:26:34,760
muster our imagine.
I think that guy is so fucked up inside.

1327
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,830
He's got all kinds of
shit howling and his,

1328
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,240
I really like that and he's fucked
up, man. Nobody Cosby fucked up.

1329
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:46,370
Yeah, it's a rapist and you're
super famous. You know it's,

1330
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:50,960
I think it's so unnatural. No, I
know. And this good guy persona,

1331
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,760
that's always the kiss of death.
You know,

1332
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:56,990
it's the preacher that is
preaching against gays and
then he's blowing dudes in

1333
01:26:56,991 --> 01:27:01,610
bathroom stalls. It's like, I'm perfect.
No, you're not cool stuff. Slick stuff.

1334
01:27:01,611 --> 01:27:02,490
Neat stuff.

1335
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:08,240
I just don't trust anybody that doesn't
have a bad day every time. Oh yeah.

1336
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:12,140
Every time. Cool stuff.
Slick stuff. Neat stuff.

1337
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,780
Just what made you think to say that?
He's trying to be,

1338
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:20,630
he's trying to be perfect. He's trying to
be awesome. He's trying to not be weird.

1339
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,110
Yeah. He's Goddamn weird
inside. You think this is weird?

1340
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:28,783
Yeah.

1341
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:38,723
Okay.

1342
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:41,690
Did he was eating her food?

1343
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:45,990
So for people who can't see this guy was
at a stoplight and like chowing on his

1344
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:50,430
wife's foot or some lady in
his car. Oh yeah. Some lady.

1345
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:53,920
He's like eating it like
it's a cheeseburger. Yeah,
he's, he's chomping on.

1346
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:59,760
She's on her iPhone just like, anyways,
she's recording it or I'll look at it.

1347
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:04,110
Something. She might be trying to tune
out what happening to her. I mean,

1348
01:28:04,111 --> 01:28:06,840
I'm not against it. I'm just
saying like this. Do you need it?

1349
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:09,480
Like you need it at the stoplight?
Yeah,

1350
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:13,650
sure would be like to be
like, all right, we got,

1351
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:18,660
we got eight seconds ready
and why is he jerking it?

1352
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:22,890
Like he's stroking it like it's a hog
that's, I think his method is a little,

1353
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,380
I've tried to see if she's on her.
I was recording it.

1354
01:28:25,381 --> 01:28:28,440
I don't think she's recording. No, I think
she's checking her Facebook. She's like,

1355
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,310
oh,
fuck this.

1356
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:33,600
Fucking Fred in the foot thing again
at the stoplight to stoplight is my

1357
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:36,750
favorite part, and she's
like, God damn and all right.

1358
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:41,200
There's just not much time headed over
to handing it to, so he's like, yeah,

1359
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:45,020
he's shoving it all the way in there
and then look it up, look at it,

1360
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:47,920
and he's like, I'll,
I'll, I'll Blah la blah.

1361
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:53,980
She's like, Bro, what you doing?
And look at their reaction.

1362
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:59,300
They're just like, yeah,
what'd you do and how?

1363
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:03,660
I work van. I'm taking a shit.
Yeah. He's like the trash collector.

1364
01:29:03,661 --> 01:29:07,830
He's like the city. I don't know.
It's like a van. Yeah. Yeah,

1365
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:16,950
Bro. Yeah. It's the best. When
someone call someone out like that,

1366
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,670
are you done with that? Let's stop light.
I don't know how to stop, you know,

1367
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:23,280
handle your business behind
closed doors, y'all. Yeah.

1368
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,880
It's like we were talking about people
that have to fight and come out to their

1369
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:30,930
family about what makes the holiday card.
I'm Pauley and I'm buying. Yeah. Yeah.

1370
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:35,880
Like, hey guys, you want to know what
makes me calm? Mom, Dad, mom, dad.

1371
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:41,370
I gotta tell you,
I got to tell you that what makes me come.

1372
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:42,533
I got to tell you now,

1373
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,290
I'm proud to have come out as polyamorous
and now I'm excited to share that I'm

1374
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:49,330
bisexual. Why do you have
to share? Why? I don't.

1375
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:53,220
Why he has to share it with his family.
I'm going to fluid bond with Jesse.

1376
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:56,580
You're going to tell your
parents about it. Yeah.

1377
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:59,850
Let me ruin Thanksgiving by
telling my parents I'm bisexual.

1378
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,250
It's definitely ruining
stoplights for some people.

1379
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,420
You know the problem is in our culture,

1380
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:09,270
there's no fucking sense of shame anymore.
You know,

1381
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,150
there's no sense of public
versus private life, man.

1382
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,990
You know [inaudible] people
always did this crazy shit.

1383
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,290
They just knew to keep it behind
closed doors. Man. It's true.

1384
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:22,710
Now everybody's got cameras. They can
video you being a fucking jackass.

1385
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:27,510
It's true. The shame is back. Well,
that's true. That's a good part.

1386
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,720
Let's bring shame back.
I want to bring it back just a little bit.

1387
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:35,670
Just a little bit. That's
a little bit. Mm hmm. Oh,

1388
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:40,890
what'd you do? You do it, bro.
What you doing? It's always us.

1389
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:44,900
It's always that voice that calls out,
ah,

1390
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:49,420
in the car. They're like, roll the window
down, leave. They're excited to say it,

1391
01:30:49,421 --> 01:30:53,040
you know? Hey homie. So funny.
Like in anything else, Jean,

1392
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,250
this is real because he's
a real kiss. No, I'm good.

1393
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,040
I really feel deprived now.
I feel like that was a,

1394
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:03,900
an especially deprived episode. This
one. Yeah. We covered so much weird shit.

1395
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:08,870
It was, I love it. Toothless guys staying
alive. Guide a new jam. Farter Paul Flat,

1396
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,250
Florida. It's pretty great. This
was a, an episode for the vault.

1397
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,050
Like this is a good one. Yeah,
we covered it all man. Okay.

1398
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:17,720
Uh,
here's a song to go out on.

1399
01:31:17,721 --> 01:31:22,721
It's called Tom upsetting
his mom remix by l smiths.

1400
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,230
Perfect. I love it already as always.
Thanks for listening. Oh, quick thing.

1401
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:31,850
We restocked a bunch of stuff
in the store. Shirts, socks,

1402
01:31:31,851 --> 01:31:36,140
hats, including, uh, we hear
you and we respond to you.

1403
01:31:36,141 --> 01:31:39,860
The ladies who asked for a restocked,

1404
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:43,430
I believe it's tried out female sizes,
just restock those.

1405
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:46,640
So if you go to the store,
you can see it.

1406
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:50,990
It's merchant method.com/tom
Segura and uh, that's that.

1407
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,450
Thanks so much guys.
We'll see you next week.

1408
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,820
I can believe that you're,
my song

1409
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,190
came out of my womb

1410
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:05,680
and
I got to do that again.

1411
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,460
You want to hear a different
story for a change.

1412
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:40,320
I realized I to go and I

1413
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:48,020
walk into the kitchen.
Christina comes out of the bathroom.

1414
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:52,900
She just went Gaga and then Ellis walks
by me and he has a gun in Cypress,

1415
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,530
so we all,
we've got going at the same time.

1416
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:02,510
They went like 10 minutes later.
You can

1417
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:07,110
family,
family,

1418
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,370
anybody wouldn't catch on.
